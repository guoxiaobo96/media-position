{"original": "The Pew Charitable Trusts Dr. Constance Guille (right) and Dr. Lisa Boyars, behavioral health physicians at the Medical University of South Carolina, are leading a new telemedicine project that provides opioid addiction treatment for pregnant women across the state. The project was launched in 2017 when new federal grant money first became available."}
{"original": "Editor's Note: This is part three of the State of the States 2019 series."}
{"original": "CHARLESTON, S.C. — Dozens of doctors, nurses and researchers here at the Medical University of South Carolina are working on new opioid treatment projects many say they never dreamed possible."}
{"original": "For a small state without Medicaid expansion to mobilize opioid treatment programs and reach as many people as we have is truly amazing, said Dr. Kelly Barth, a physician and associate professor of behavioral medicine. We know we're saving lives every day."}
{"original": "More than a decade into an opioid addiction and overdose epidemic that's costing the nation at least $78 billion a year, emergency federal dollars have kindled local victories. Frontline practitioners in the opioid epidemic say that the infusion of federal money over the past two years, and the possibility of as much as $8 billion more over the next five years under a law enacted in October, has saved thousands of lives and is starting to change the hearts and minds of traditional addiction treatment providers who have long opposed the use of drugs to treat addiction."}
{"original": "The money also helps healthcare providers in states that aren't taking federal dollars to expand Medicaid — insurance coverage for low-income residents — that is possible under Affordable Care Act."}
{"original": "But state and local officials say they need sustainable funding for what they expect to be a long-term struggle to provide effective prevention, treatment and overdose rescue efforts."}
{"original": "Many officials are counting on settlements in civil cases against the drugmakers and distributors that state and local governments blame for the epidemic. Other states are considering an annual assessment against drug companies or a tax on painkillers."}
{"original": "Unless we can find other ways to keep funding these programs, the bottom is going to fall out for some people, said Dr. Kathleen Brady, an addiction psychiatrist at the Medical University of South Carolina who heads the state's medication-assisted treatment efforts."}
{"original": "One thing we're hoping will happen, she said, is that enough people who receive treatment will be able to get back to work and get insurance coverage somehow."}
{"original": "Without expanding Medicaid to more low-income residents, which in South Carolina is not considered likely anytime soon, she said, we have few options for replacing those funds when we hit that fiscal cliff."}
{"original": "So far, two sweeping federal opioid laws have resulted in roughly $2 billion in grants to states. But if Congress fails to appropriate some or all of the funding approved under last year's law, emergency federal funding could dry up."}
{"original": "To fill the void, more than a dozen states have tried for the past three years to enact a special tax on opioid painkillers. But the measures failed in every state except New York, primarily because of lobbying by drug companies. There, a federal judge struck down the measure in December, saying it interfered with interstate commerce."}
{"original": "The New York bill would have assessed a $100 million tax on drug companies every year for six years and prohibited the companies from passing on the tax costs to consumers."}
{"original": "This year, lawmakers in California and New York have said they plan to write new legislation that would assess a fee on opioid makers and distributors to cover what they argue is the additional cost of treating those who become addicted to the painkillers."}
{"original": "But enacting those laws likely will prove difficult since opioid makers maintain that the taxes could jeopardize the availability of the medications for pain patients who legitimately need them."}
{"original": "In January, Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker proposed a 15 percent tax on opioid painkillers that, if approved by the legislature, could generate more than $14 million a year for preventing and treating addiction to opioids."}
{"original": "Most states, and hundreds of cities, counties and Native American tribes, are banking on hefty settlements from drug companies in a sprawling series of civil lawsuits that will be tried in state and federal courts this year."}
{"original": "The first trial, scheduled to begin May 28, will hear arguments from the state of Oklahoma demanding damages from Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson, Allergan, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and several of their subsidiaries for causing a rash of opioid overdoses in the state."}
{"original": "States also are tweaking their Medicaid rules to allow the federal-state health program to reimburse providers for the three medications — methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone or Vivitrol — that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration."}
{"original": "Research shows those medications are most effective at keeping people in recovery. A fourth drug, naloxone, or Narcan, is approved in the use of overdose rescue."}
{"original": "In the 36 states and the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid to low-income adults under the Affordable Care Act, the health plan paid at least $930 million just for addiction medications in 2016, 30 percent more than in 2015, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank."}
{"original": "But for South Carolina and the 13 other states that did not expand Medicaid to cover low-income adults, the program pays for addiction treatment only if the patient is pregnant or disabled."}
{"original": "In South Carolina, 30 percent of low-income adults are not enrolled in Medicaid and have no other insurance coverage. Of that group, 1.5 percent are likely to have an opioid use disorder."}
{"original": "An end to the federal opioid money that only recently started flowing could leave thousands of people in treatment with no way to pay."}
{"original": "Nationwide, about 2 million people are addicted to opioid painkillers or heroin."}
{"original": "Of those, about 17 percent, or 340,000, are uninsured, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes Medicaid and private insurance data."}
{"original": "Most states spend federal opioid money primarily on outpatient medication-assisted treatment."}
{"original": "But in the 36 states with Medicaid expansion and relatively high rates of insurance coverage, a larger share of the money tends to support services for people in recovery, including temporary housing and job training, according to Brendan Saloner, a health policy researcher at Johns Hopkins University."}
{"original": "States also are spending emergency opioid dollars on prevention, including prescription drug monitoring, education and outreach, as well as overdose rescue."}
{"original": "At the Medical University of South Carolina, three new programs designed to expand access to effective treatment for opioid addiction were funded in part with allotments from the more than $27 million in federal grants the state received in 2017 and 2018."}
{"original": "For South Carolina, the new funds amounted to a roughly 50 percent increase in available federal dollars for addiction services for the uninsured."}
{"original": "In 2017, that meant treatment for nearly 7,000 South Carolina patients with an opioid addiction, about a thousand more than in 2016. By 2018, the state was providing treatment for an additional 3,600 addiction patients."}
{"original": "The new programs — including addiction treatment tailored to pregnant women, access to medication-assisted treatment in hospital emergency departments, and training and support for primary care doctors who want to help more patients with opioid addiction — already have helped hundreds of people turn their lives around and get back to work, Barth said."}
{"original": "Jasmine Mizell is one of them. At 28, struggling with addiction to opioid pain relievers and pregnant with her second child, Mizell said her local doctor advised her to go to Charleston and sign up for the university's addiction treatment program for pregnant and postpartum women. She said there's no question the program saved her life."}
{"original": "If it weren't for them, I would have lost my kids and everything else, she said in a Stateline interview. They didn't treat me like some drug addict. They treated me like someone they wanted to help."}
{"original": "And because the university's pregnancy program uses telemedicine to care for its patients after an initial in-person visit, Mizell avoided what would have been a weekly six-hour drive to and from Charleston during her pregnancy."}
{"original": "According to a Kaiser analysis, Medicaid in 2014 paid 21 percent of U.S. addiction treatment costs, private insurance paid 18 percent, and Medicare and federal block grants paid 22 percent. The balance was paid for by state and local funding, or by patients out of pocket."}
{"original": "As the opioid epidemic worsened, more states adjusted their Medicaid rules to ensure that addiction medications were paid for. Medicaid expenditures for opioid treatment grew by 19 percent a year between 2011 and 2016, researchers at the Urban Institute found."}
{"original": "According to Daniel Polsky, a health management professor at the University of Pennsylvania, commercial insurers also stepped up to pay for more opioid treatment medications and therapy during the same period."}
{"original": "It's in insurers' interest to cover addiction medications, and it's in the patients' interest too, Polsky said. It's the cheapest and most effective treatment available."}
{"original": "With increased insurance coverage, the number of people receiving specialized addiction treatment has grown in the last decade. The most recent annual survey of drug use and treatment conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration indicates that 600,000 people received treatment for an opioid use disorder in 2017, up nearly a third from 2016."}
{"original": "Still, the percentage of people with an opioid addiction who receive drug treatment has remained lower than for any other chronic diseases, according to the agency. Only 1 in 5 people with an addiction to painkillers or illicit opioids takes drugs designed to help the patient recover from the addiction."}
{"original": "Mizell said she thinks discrimination against people addicted to opioids and other substances, and the widespread bias against the use of medications to treat opioid addiction, is starting to break down in South Carolina. I really think things are changing."}
{"original": "In the past, Mizell took buprenorphine for an addiction to pain relievers off and on for more than a decade. And she said doctors, her parents and others made her feel that her daily dose of buprenorphine was just trading one drug for another."}
{"original": "But since her treatment at Medical University of South Carolina during her pregnancy, she said, she's convinced she needs to stay on the medication for as long as necessary."}
{"original": "Before, I didn't have anything to live for. Now, I have too much to lose to go back to drugs, she said. I'm a recovering addict, and I'm proud of what I've done. I'm proud I'm taking the medicine I need."}
{"original": "After her son Grayson was born in August, Mizell, now 29, opened her own consignment shop in Bennettsville. I tell people who say, 'I can't pay, I'm on drugs,' that they shouldn't feel ashamed to ask for help, she said. Treatment can work, she tells them. It's just a matter of finding the treatment that's right for you."}
{"original": "If you or a family member need help because of a mental or substance use disorder, call 1-800-662-HELP (4357) or visit the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's website at findtreatment.samhsa.gov."}
{"original": "Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz kicked off a potential 2020 presidential run on Sunday by ripping his former party, depicting the Democrats' health care proposals as unrealistic and financially unfeasible."}
{"original": "Every American deserves the right to have access to quality health care, Schultz told 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley. But what the Democrats are proposing is something that is as false as the wall ― and that is free health care for all, which the country cannot afford."}
{"original": "Where does Howard Schultz stand on immigration, climate change, healthcare and taxes? https://t.co/pGqGohQbHK pic.twitter.com/u0WydOYhY8 — 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) January 28, 2019"}
{"original": "During the interview, Schultz said he is seriously considering running for president as a centrist independent, outside of the two-party system. Asked why he wouldn't run as a Democrat, the self-described lifelong Democrat said both parties are consistently not doing what's necessary on behalf of the American people and are instead engaging in revenge politics."}
{"original": "I look at both parties, we see extremes on both sides, he said. We are sitting today with approximately $21.5 trillion of debt, which is a reckless example ― not only of Republicans, but of Democrats as well ― as a reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility."}
{"original": "Schultz has long expressed concern about the national debt. In 2011, he asked business leaders around the country to forgo political contributions until Washington deliver[ed] a fiscally disciplined long-term debt and deficit plan to the American people. Last year, he called the national debt the greatest threat domestically to this country."}
{"original": "That concern may explain Schultz's comments on health care ― that Democrats believe in free health care for all and that the country cannot afford it. Presumably he is thinking of proposals to create a Medicare for all system in which a new government insurance program would cover everybody, with no premiums or out-of-pocket costs. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has proposed such a plan, and many Democrats have endorsed it."}
{"original": "But not all Democrats support the Sanders plan, and whether the plan would actually lead to higher spending would depend on a number of variables, like how successful it was at holding down payments to doctors and hospitals. (A proposal like Sanders' could actually result in less overall spending.) And while the federal government would end up spending more ― because it would be taking over spending from employers and private individuals ― federal debt would rise only if the government didn't offset that spending with new taxes, such as on the very rich, or with cuts elsewhere."}
{"original": "During the interview, Schultz aligned himself with many Democrats in other ways. He said he believed there should be a fair and equitable way for undocumented immigrants to become U.S. citizens, that leaving the Paris climate accord was a tremendous mistake, and that the Republican tax bill went too far."}
{"original": "Schultz stepped away from Starbucks last summer after more than three decades with the company, saying he had become deeply concerned about growing division in the U.S. and wanted to figure out what he could do to help his country."}
{"original": "The possibility that Schultz may run as an independent candidate has already rankled Democrats. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, who has announced he plans to run for president as a Democrat, said Schultz running would provide Donald Trump with his best hope of getting re-elected."}
{"original": "When asked if he was worried his own presidential run could help Trump win another four years in the White House, Schultz made it clear he didn't buy that line of thinking."}
{"original": "I want to see the American people win. I want to see America win. I don't care if you're a Democrat, independent, libertarian, Republican. Bring me your ideas. And I will be an independent person who will embrace those ideas, he said. Because I am not, in any way, in bed with a party."}
{"original": "He begins a promotional tour for his new book, From the Ground Up, on Monday in New York City. Described as part candid memoir, part uplifting blueprint of mutual responsibility, Schultz's book delves into his experience growing up in a public housing project in Brooklyn, New York, and how it shaped the rest of his life."}
{"original": "Schultz had a net worth of $3 billion as of 2017."}
{"original": "This story has been updated to mention Schultz's book tour."}
{"original": "God never intended for one group of people to live in superfluous inordinate wealth, while others live in abject deadening poverty. God intends for all of his children to have the basic necessities of life, and He has left in this universe enough and to spare for that purpose. Martin Luther King, Jr."}
{"original": "House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Catholic who described himself as a big fan of Pope Francis, wants to fight poverty by reinventing the federal government's social welfare programs."}
{"original": "For Ryan to accomplish this goal, he should not only heed the words of a transformational religious and political leader like Pope Francis, but also Martin Luther King Jr. Despite widespread praise showered upon MLK through the years, few have championed his dream of a basic income and employment for all. Those ideas served as the bedrock of MLK's anti-poverty crusade, yet have been largely forgotten today."}
{"original": "In his 1967 book Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?, MLK described Washington's anti-poverty efforts as piecemeal and pygmy. Essentially, MLK felt that indirect and reactionary efforts by the government on fighting poverty were too small and unorganized to be effective. Paul Ryan shared similar sediments when in a 2014 article he wrote federal programs aimed at the poor are fragmented and formulaic. In both cases, MLK and Ryan consistently based their viewpoints on poverty from deeply held religious convictions."}
{"original": "This is where the similarities between Paul Ryan and MLK end. Whereas Ryan wants less government intervention in fighting poverty, MLK sought more."}
{"original": "MLK's concept of a basic minimum income and national jobs program came from the realization that no amount of economic growth and prosperity could eliminate poverty or create jobs for all. Thus in 1965, MLK argued for a national jobs program when he stated, At the present time, thousands of jobs a week are disappearing in the wake of automation and other production efficiency techniques."}
{"original": "With a four decades year low of 94 million people not in the labor force, MLK's statement rigs true today."}
{"original": "Rapid technological advancements have contributed to manufacturing and high-tech jobs being occupied by a select few, while the vast majority of new jobs created since the Great Recession have primarily been low-skill and easy to replace."}
{"original": "For example, Netflix, the undisputed king of streaming movies and television shows online, generates $5.5 billion in revenue and has about 2,400 employees. Compare that to its now defunct competitor, Blockbuster, which at its peak employed nearly 60,000 employees."}
{"original": "In the book Freedom From Fear, The American people in Depression and War, 1929-1945, author David M. Kennedy writes about the impressive productivity of American capitalism. Kennedy highlights that by 1925, a completely assembled Model T Ford was created every 10 seconds at Henry Ford's Highland Park plant. Less than a decade before, it would've taken 14 hours to assemble the very same car."}
{"original": "MLK realized this technological trend will only accelerate, which meant a federal jobs program aimed at full employment was an absolute necessity."}
{"original": "MLK's support for a basic minimum income was seen as a serious proposal in the 1960s."}
{"original": "In 1962, economist Milton Friedman released a book titled Capitalism and Freedom, in which he believed a negative income tax, or basic minimum income, could replace most of the current social welfare programs. In 1966, devout Catholic Sargent Shriver, considered the chief architect of the War on Poverty, suggested to President Lyndon Johnson he adopt Friedman's idea on the negative income tax so long as all able bodied citizens find employment."}
{"original": "President Nixon in 1969 and his Democratic opponent in the 1972 presidential election, George McGovern, both unsuccessfully advocated their own form of the basic minimum income."}
{"original": "Go back to the early days of the American republic and you'll find one of the greatest political thinkers of the time, Thomas Paine, advocate for a social insurance system for youth and seniors which formed the basis for today's Social Security program. In his 1797 pamphlet, Agrarian Justice, Paine argued for a 10 percent tax on inherited property to combat the growing inequality of natural property. From this national fund, those 21 years old would receive a onetime payment of 15 pounds and those over 50 years old 10 pounds each year."}
{"original": "Paine believed such compensation was a small measure of justice for young citizens in particular, since most owned no land. In one of the more notable passages of Agrarian Justice, Paine declares, It is wrong to say God made rich and poor; He made only male and female, and He gave them the earth for their inheritance. Furthermore, Paine reasoned the poor shouldn't have to rely solely on charity and suffer the stigma it carried."}
{"original": "Paul Ryan, who strongly believes private charities should take the lead on anti-poverty efforts, would likely disagree with Paine on this last point."}
{"original": "In 2013, when Pope Francis critiqued capitalism and blasted trickle-down economics for the exclusion and indifference it creates towards the poor, Paul Ryan responded by stating, The guy is from Argentina, they haven't had real capitalism in Argentina. They have crony capitalism in Argentina. They don't have a true free enterprise system."}
{"original": "Perhaps Pope Francis could've defended himself against Ryan with a critique on our economic system from someone who actually lived and experienced 'real capitalism'."}
{"original": "The pope could turn to someone like MLK, who in a speech delivered less than a month before his assassination, said this about our economic system: Well that appears to me to be a kind of socialism for the rich and rugged hard individualistic capitalism for the poor."}
{"original": "While workers across the nation fight for a $15 minimum wage and citizens suffer from institutional neglect in Flint, Michigan, we should remember Martin Luther King Jr. had a much more revolutionary dream for the United States of America. A dream in which incomes are lifted up and jobs aimed at promoting the common good are guaranteed for all. MLK's dream on how to fight poverty should be the nation's dream too."}
{"original": "Bucket List added to at Liberty Mountain Resort"}
{"original": "On a beautiful warm and sunny afternoon, I rode a bucket down Liberty Mountain in Carroll Valley , Fairfield Pennsylvania. Actually I was helped into a sitski by adaptive ski instructor Mike Caselle and this experience added to my bucket list. I glided down the shimmering mountain on what is formally known as a bi-ski; Blue Ridge Adaptive Snow Sports (BRASS) has a new full size Ferriol-Matrat FMS made in France. It is a luxurious experience, but you must really trust your instructor. He has special training in loading people with significant neuromuscular problems into the sit ski, getting it on and off chair lifts, and holding and steering it as you flow down the mountain. He reassured me that they have never lost control of the sit ski."}
{"original": "There was little work involved on my part, but I did gently bend my body into the turns. Mike helped by playing recorded acoustic guitar music to help me relax and move my stiff body. While this was a great experience, it is not a joking matter. Skiing has been my passion for 50 years, but I now suffer from advanced Parkinson Disease. I do not know if I can ever regain the balance, strength, or confidence to ski upright again. Adaptive programs are perfect for people like me, and for those with birth defects, war wounds, or other disabilities."}
{"original": "The BRASS adaptive program at Liberty and similar programs at other mountains continue to grow. Although this has been a rather short season, BRASS taught about 300 adaptive students this year. 11 injured soldiers were honored at their annual Warfighters weekend. The program is run by Leslie and Dick White and a large group of professional instructors and devoted volunteers; it is supported entirely by tax-deductible contributions. BRASS is a local chapter of Disabled Sports, USA."}
{"original": "Liberty Mountain is growing as a four season resort. This season they added the majestic Highland Lodge to their facilities. It has 17 guest rooms or suites, and is steps away from the mountain and the 18 hole Carroll Valley Golf Course."}
{"original": "Liberty Mountain Resort continues to grow. As it does, it brings more revenue and employment to the area. It also brings a lot of fun to those who visit, including seasoned old timers like me!"}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is gone ― that didn't take long ― but he leaves behind a famous and fateful question: What did the president know and when did he know it?"}
{"original": "Donald J. Trump has been president for less than a month, and already the Watergate query is all the capital is talking about, and, as a result, there is a widespread sense of a White House in deep, perhaps cataclysmic, trouble."}
{"original": "The list of failures and missteps of the Trump administration is as well known as it is long: a litany of patently obvious lies to the public and the press; mismanagement and vicious infighting; several malodorous Cabinet choices; mixed messages from on high, many of them coming within minutes of each other; leaks that gush like a fire hydrant; national security lapses that would be comical if they were not so risky; and a job approval rating lower at this point than that of any new president in memory."}
{"original": "But all of that is as nothing compared with the conflagration now."}
{"original": "Flynn resigned after it became clear that federal investigators and the national media were closing in on his close relationship ― bought and paid for, it appears ― with Vladimir Putin and his henchmen in Moscow."}
{"original": "Then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed Trump and his circle weeks ago that the FBI had developed information that Flynn had been compromised by his close, and financial, Russian ties."}
{"original": "Kevin Lamarque / Reuters Sally Yates, then acting U.S. attorney general, sounded an alarm weeks ago about Michael Flynn."}
{"original": "But now come some obvious, and, for Trump, perilous, questions."}
{"original": "What did the president know and when did he know it about Flynn's friendly and potentially compromising calls in December with the Russian ambassador? In those conversations, Flynn allegedly told the Russian to disregard the Obama administration's imposition of new sanctions, because Trump would lift them once he assumed office."}
{"original": "Is it possible Flynn would have had those conversations with the Russian ambassador and not told Trump about them? Was Trump really flying blind when he praised Putin for not reacting to those sanctions? Who else in the chain of command, as chaotic as it is, knew of Flynn's conversations and his assurances to Russia?"}
{"original": "Now that Flynn is out of the White House, he no longer can claim executive privilege if subpoenaed to testify before Congress. Will he take the Fifth? Possibly. Will he talk? Unlikely."}
{"original": "Yates communicated her concerns to White House Counsel Don McGahn, a longtime Trump adviser whose main qualification was his loyalty to Trump and knowledge of business and campaign finance. He knows little or nothing about national security."}
{"original": "But what chance is there that McGahn would not have told the president about the warning from Yates?"}
{"original": "With Flynn gone, who will be national security adviser? Will the role still matter? Will the CIA, which reportedly had considered Flynn a security risk (!) be assuaged?"}
{"original": "No one has been prosecuted under the more-than-200-year-old Logan Act, which forbids the private conduct of diplomacy, but if Flynn didn't tell the truth to the FBI, he could be at risk of prosecution."}
{"original": "Flynn wasn't the only Russia proponent in the administration. Others include chief strategist Steve Bannon and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. What did they know and when did they know it? And what have been their dealings with Russia?"}
{"original": "Flynn's departure will also inevitably draw attention back to the role of Russian hacks and leaks in the 2016 presidential campaign ― and to demands, so far turned away by Trump, that he release his tax returns. The president has said that he has no loans from Russia or Russians. Really?"}
{"original": "Late Monday, the list of questions continued to grow, and there was a sense in Washington that the real story of the Trump administration was just beginning to be told."}
{"original": "NEW YORK (AP) — The escalating coronavirus emergency Thursday sent stocks to their worst losses since the Black Monday crash of 1987, extending a sell-off that has now wiped out most of Wall Street's big run-up since President Donald Trump's election."}
{"original": "The S&P 500 plummeted 9.5%, for a total drop of 26.7% from its all-time high, set just last month. That puts it way past the 20% threshold to make this a bear market, snapping an unprecedented, nearly 11-year bull-market run. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 10% for its worst day since a nearly 23% drop on Oct. 19, 1987."}
{"original": "European markets lost 12% in one of their worst days ever, even after the European Central Bank pledged to buy more bonds and offer more help for the economy."}
{"original": "The heavy losses came amid a cascade of cancellations and shutdowns across the globe — including Trump's suspension of most travel to the U.S. from Europe — and rising worries that the White House and other authorities around the world can't or won't counter the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic any time soon."}
{"original": "The news just continues to get worse, and the travel ban puts an exclamation point on the weakness we're going to see in global GDP and, in turn, the U.S., said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. We're starting to get a sense of how dire the impact on the economy is going to be. Each day the news doesn't get better, it gets worse. It's now has hit Main Street to a more significant degree."}
{"original": "Stocks fell so fast on Wall Street at the opening bell that they triggered an automatic, 15-minute trading halt for the second time this week. The so-called circuit breakers were first adopted after the 1987 crash, and until this week hadn't been tripped since 1997."}
{"original": "The Dow briefly turned upward and halved its losses at one point in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve announced it would step in to ease highly unusual disruptions in the Treasury market. But the burst of momentum quickly faded."}
{"original": "Trump often points proudly to the big rise on Wall Street under his administration and warned a crowd at a rally last August that whether you love me or hate, you gotta vote for me, or else your 401(k) will go down the tubes."}
{"original": "Just last month, the Dow was boasting a nearly 50% gain since Trump took the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2017. By Thursday's close, the Dow was clinging to a 6.9% gain, though it was still up nearly 16% since just before Trump's election in November 2016."}
{"original": "On Wednesday, the Dow finished the day down more than 20% from its all-time high, set just last month, officially entering what is known as a bear market for the first time in over a decade."}
{"original": "The combined health crisis and retreat on Wall Street heightened fears of a recession."}
{"original": "This is bad. The worst and fastest stock market correction in our career, Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union, said in a research note overnight. The economy is doomed to recession if the country stops working and takes the next 30 days off. The stock market knows it."}
{"original": "The coronavirus has infected around 128,000 people worldwide and killed over 4,700. The death toll in the U.S. climbed to 39, with over 1,300 infections. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illnesses, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus in a matter of weeks."}
{"original": "In a somber prime-time address Wednesday night from the White House, Trump announced the new travel ban as well as measures to extend loans, payroll tax cuts and other financial relief to individuals and businesses hurt by the crisis."}
{"original": "But the travel restrictions represented another heavy blow to the already battered airline and travel industries, and the other measures did not impress Wall Street."}
{"original": "What markets are waiting for are efforts to contain the virus in a very aggressive way, ways we've seen in other countries, said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones. Short of that, nibbling around the edges, maybe doing something that can help a firm with a very short-term impact or help an employee, doesn't hurt, but it's not the bull's-eye, and it's not as targeted as the markets would like to see."}
{"original": "Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets said: The market judgment on that announcement is that it's too little, too late."}
{"original": "The damage was worldwide and eye-popping. Among the big moves:"}
{"original": "— Travel stocks again were among the hardest hit. Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean Cruises both lost roughly a quarter of their value. Another drop for United Airlines put its loss for the year at more than 50%."}
{"original": "— Oil continued its brutal week, with benchmark U.S. at $31 per barrel."}
{"original": "— In Asia, stocks in Thailand and the Philippines fell so fast that trading was temporarily halted. Japan's Nikkei 225 sank 4.4% to its lowest close in four years, and South Korea's market lost 3.9%."}
{"original": "Perhaps more alarming were complaints in recent days by investors that trading in the Treasury market wasn't working well. For reasons that weren't immediately clear, traders said they were seeing surprisingly large gaps in prices being offered by buyers and sellers. That threatened to cause the market to seize up."}
{"original": "In a surprise move, the Fed said it would pump in at least $1.5 trillion to help calm the market and facilitate trading."}
{"original": "After earlier thinking that the virus could remain mostly in China and that any dip in the economy would be followed by a quick rebound, investors are seeing the damage and disruptions mount, with Italy locking itself down, the NBA suspending games and authorities in the U.S. and beyond banning large gatherings and closing schools."}

{"original": "On February 12 of 2013, the night of the State of the Union, a town meeting was held at the Chopin Theater in Chicago's Near West Side. The subject was tax increment financing. Despite the complexity of the topic and the competition from President Obama, some 230 people packed the theater to hear a journalist, an academic and an activist discuss TIFS."}
{"original": "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Illumination Project is an effort of a group of volunteers in Chicago to investigate and expose a decades-old municipal finance scheme that annually extracts almost 500 million dollars of local property taxes and places that money in a program controlled by the mayor. This program has dispensed billions of property tax dollars to major U.S. companies (Walmart, Target, Home Depot, UPS, Coca-Cola, United Airlines, Willis Insurance) to well-heeled developers of Loop office towers and to a collection of connected developers throughout the city."}
{"original": "This program has been a source of controversy here for years but is not readily understood by Chicagoans. It is decidedly not a public process and the rationale behind what projects are selected for subsidy in the name of community development is not apparent or available for any community to debate or participate in. Chicago has a notoriously corrupt and opaque government with numerous local councilmen having been sent to prison. The city was ruled with an iron hand for 43 years by the father and son Daleys, and the Democratic Machine had a firm lock on local government for almost one hundred years. This is a tough town for civic engagement, government transparency and grassroots urban policy planning."}
{"original": "A Tax Increment Finance district is created by the City's Department of Planning and Development. It is a tool to capture property taxes from all properties inside the district. A TIF is usually created to build some project in a blighted community that the free market won't support. The developer seeks a gift of cash and/or land to do their project because it is deemed to be a public good. A snapshot is taken of the value of the properties inside the district and how much property taxes they are paying. The TIF district captures all INCREMENT from all those properties for 23 years. The money captured by the TIF is effectively off the books from the annual public budgeting process."}
{"original": "Since TIFs first appeared in Chicago in 1986 they have captured over $7 billion in property taxes."}
{"original": "The TIF Program has taken on significant political and civic import because it diverts and disperses property taxes. In Chicago about 54 cents of every property tax dollar collected by the city is supposed to go to the Board of Education. Other units of government that rely on property taxes for significant parts of their budget include the public libraries, the public parks, the city colleges, the county government and the city, itself. So any entity that steps in and skims, so to speak, hundreds of millions of property tax dollars annually is a grave threat to the finances of local government. Currently Chicago has 148 TIF districts covering about 32 percent of the city. No other city in America has so many special taxing bodies."}
{"original": "About 32% of Chicago is in a TIF district!"}
{"original": "The TIF Illumination Project is an exercise in civic imagination. It's about civic geography and civic mental map-mapping. We set out to answer the question of What are TIFs doing to MY community? If you ask a person, How is life in the Kinzie Industrial TIF? they will look at you blankly. But if you ask, How is life in the 27th Ward? then people can locate themselves and form a response based on their lived experience of that community. We are telling people what TIFs are doing to us a ward-by-ward basis."}
{"original": "Our volunteers have acquired eight different sets of data and using data mining, GIS coding, map making, investigatory journalism and crowd-sourced organizing, we have compiled an unprecedented picture of what TIFs are doing across the city."}
{"original": "We can tell you, on a ward-by-ward basis:"}
{"original": "• How many TIFs are in the ward"}
{"original": "• How much money they extracted from within the ward last year"}
{"original": "• How much money was left in the TIF accounts at the start of this year"}
{"original": "• What projects were funded by TIFs inside the ward"}
{"original": "• How much money was transferred IN or OUT of the TIFs"}
{"original": "• How much money the Department of Planning and Development skimmed from those TIFs (in 2014 it was a total of $8.8 million from ALL the TIFs)"}
{"original": "• How much money was given to banks in terms of finance fees (in 2014 Amalgamated bank and Well Fargo received a total of $98.6 million from all TIFs)"}
{"original": "• Location of public schools that have closed by the Board of Education"}
{"original": "• Location of public schools that have received budget cuts for the current year"}
{"original": "We produce a graphic poster showing all this against a map of the ward we are covering plus a general piece that explains what TIFs are. We do a 50-minute presentation that walks through the history and scope of the TIF program and then zooms in to reveal the details of the TIFs in the ward we are visiting."}
{"original": "At the TIF Town Meeting at the Chopin Theater on February 12, 2013, we asked the attendees if they found the information useful. There was a strong response from the audience that this information was a revelation. We then invited folks to return to their communities and organized public meetings -- or Illuminations -- as we call them."}
{"original": "People responded with enthusiasm. The first meeting was in the 6th Ward on March 9 and since then we've been to 47 meetings and have Illuminated 141 TIFs across 34 wards! Over 4,600 people have attended these meetings. In addition, we've done Illuminations in Oak Park, Woodstock and for two suburban school districts."}
{"original": "All the presentations are available at our TIF Data Store."}
{"original": "Here is the graphic produced for the TIF Illumination of the 4th Ward (Hyde Park, home of the University of Chicago and President Obama) we did on May 13, 2013."}
{"original": "The piece is designed for ledger size, two-sided, full color. The fold is along the left. The front follows this pattern, with a call out to the residents of the ward we are visiting. We identify the major named neighborhoods inside the ward and produce the TIF district shapes as though they are the culprits on a wanted poster. The headline is derived from looking at one or more TIFs that are entirely inside or mostly inside the ward."}
{"original": "The back of the piece remains the same across all our Illuminations and will be updated for meetings in 2014 to incorporate the latest data. We endeavor to explain what TIFs are using text and graphics."}
{"original": "The piece was produced by Tom Tresser, designed by Carlyn So and based on the data research of Cory Mollet and Bill Drew. There are many others who helped and some would prefer to keep their participation private."}
{"original": "Our first poster went through seven iterations and was reviewed by one of America's most experienced academics in the TIF and local government finance arena. We are constantly testing this work. Is this the best way to explain TIFs? We've translated this part of the poster into Spanish and are working to turn the poster into a comic book and animation."}
{"original": "This section is immediately below the map and contains the final exclusive piece of news that the TIF Illumination Project delivers to communities. We use the same data analysis that got us the basic Illumination to determine how much money was left in the TIF accounts from the in-ward TIFs at the start of the year."}
{"original": "This number is shown in red and asks the provocative question: What would you do to improve the ward if you had this money available? In the case of the 4th Ward at the start of 2012, that number was $15.3 million."}
{"original": "The remainder of this section of the graphic explains what the TIF Illumination Project is about and also explains that it is a project of the CivicLab, a new co-working space in the West Loop dedicated to collaboration, education and innovation around civic engagement."}
{"original": "We have shown folks who has gotten paid via TIFs and revealed details hitherto kept secret -- including the startling fact that the TIF accounts held $1.4 billion on January 1, 2015. That number HAD been $1.7 billion on January 1, 2014. So we also revealed a 71% increase in TIF spending over that one year time period."}
{"original": "This information challenges the notion that we are broke."}
{"original": "The net result is that people ask more questions than can be answered. They are angry. They wonder if the city is truly broke, as the mayor claims. They want to know who green-lighted the projects that received so much public dollars and why are essential city services being cut (including the closing of 49 public schools) at the same time?"}
{"original": "We launched an online petition to put TIF data on the property tax bills that the county issues twice a year, and that reform was instituted by Cook County Clerk beginning with the bills issued in July of 2014."}
{"original": "We launched a second online petition demanding that the mayor account for the $1.7 billion and release those funds to the units of government that SHOULD'VE gotten those funds in the first place. Over 4,500 people have signed so far."}
{"original": "We have placed all our presentations online for easy access and purchase at the TIF Data Store. You can also purchase a copy of our TIF Atlas that shows ALL the TIFs in the new ward maps PLUS locations and details of all TIF funded projects up through 2010 and much more!"}

{"original": "An article in the Chicago Sun-Times and an editorial in the Chicago Tribune referenced $1.7 billion in TIF funds. The only way that the editors at the Chicago Tribune (as well as the rest of the public) knew that there was $1.7 billion sitting in TIF accounts was because the volunteers of the TIF Illumination Project has been opening up all the annual reports from the TIF districts when they are released in July and manually adding up the balances! We've been doing that since 2009 (although the TIF Illumination Project formally launched in February of 2013, this work has been going on for quite a while). See our analysis for all of Chicago's TIFs for 2013 and and for 2014 at our TIF Reports web site."}

{"original": "The new website Grading the States: Business Climate Rankings and the Real Path to Prosperity debunks the state rankings from several organizations purporting to measure each state's business climate and prospects for economic growth. These rankings don't amount to much more than calls for cutting or eliminating taxes and rolling back workers' rights."}
{"original": "The Iowa Policy Project, a member of CBPP's State Priorities Partnership, created the site with our help. It shows that the rankings' indicators and methods of measurement are highly flawed and that the rankings often contradict one another. Also, despite the groups' focus on reducing taxes, the rankings generally don't accurately portray businesses' actual taxes."}
{"original": "One particularly egregious example is the American Legislative Exchange Council's (ALEC) Economic Outlook Ranking in the group's annual Rich States, Poor States report. The highest- ranked states have:"}
{"original": "low top marginal income tax rates;"}
{"original": "While ALEC claims these policies promote economic growth and prosperity, the evidence shows otherwise. In fact, ALEC's 20 best states are actually poorer than its 20 worst states, as this graph from Grading the States shows."}
{"original": "The ALEC agenda is the basis of Kansas' income tax cut experiment, which has undermined the state's ability to invest in areas like K-12 education and balance its budget. The state is in a precarious fiscal position, and the promised boost to the economy hasn't materialized -- and probably never will. That's because big, broad-based income tax cuts are a poor strategy for economic growth, as both recent history and the preponderance of research show."}
{"original": "Grading the States exposes the rankings for their disservice to state policy debates and offers evidence for what really matters for state economic growth -- investing in kids, infrastructure, and a healthy, productive workforce."}
{"original": "This post originally appeared on Off the Charts, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' blog."}
{"original": "When Lisa Wise, the top election official in El Paso County, Texas, got a list of suspected noncitizens on her voter rolls, one name quickly stood out. It was the name of someone in her office who went to get a state ID a few years ago and recently became a naturalized U.S. citizen."}
{"original": "The data point underscores why many are skeptical about claims from Texas' Secretary of State David Whitley (R) and Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) that 95,000 noncitizens may be on the voting rolls and that 58,000 of them voted in at least one election since 1996. Election officials, lawyers and experts said that number is likely inflated because of people who applied for driver's licenses when they were legal permanent residents and later became naturalized."}
{"original": "Whitley's office told county officials on Friday to investigate further, but Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) quickly seized on the numbers and claimed there was voter fraud in the state. On Sunday, President Donald Trump amplified the claims."}
{"original": "Sophia Lin Lakin, a staff attorney at the ACLU's voting rights project, said she suspected the quick claims of voter fraud were part of an effort to justify voting restrictions. Critics say requiring documentary proof of voting eligibility is unnecessary and is more likely to affect young people, who move around a lot, as well as the poor and minority voters who don't have access to the required documentation or the resources to get them to obtain them and take them to election officials. A bill to require people to prove their citizenship was filed in the Texas House of Representatives in November."}
{"original": "Wise said her office received about 4,100 names to investigate from the Secretary of State's Office on Sunday evening. She said the Department of Public Safety (DPS), which maintains driver's license records, might have outdated records."}
{"original": "When you go to the DPS and you mark noncitizen, if you go through the naturalization ceremonies where we're at and we're promoting voter registration, which we did about 200 a year, you're not going back to DPS after that. They're not being notified."}
{"original": "58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote. These numbers are just the tip of the iceberg.

{"original": "Wise said her office would take its time reviewing the records — some of which dated back to the early 1970s — to make sure they are accurate but said she anticipated many of the names provided by the Secretary of State's Office were errors. She added that quick accusations of voter fraud were not helpful."}
{"original": "That's inaccurate at this point. None of that has been proven. And I just don't want that to kind of lead what's going to happen, she said. When we start deciding something is voter fraud without proof, that's a real problem."}
{"original": "Sam Taylor, a Whitley spokesperson, did not return several requests for comment. He told The New York Times on Friday he didn't see a situation in which this would produce a false positive."}
{"original": "Gabriella Demczuk via Getty Images Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is facing criticism for quickly making allegations of voter fraud in the state before local officials could investigate."}
{"original": "Bruce Elfant, the tax assessor-collector and voter registrar in Travis County, said he would be very surprised if all of the names the Secretary of State's Office submitted to him to investigate turned out to be noncitizens. His office received 4,547 records to investigate on Monday."}
{"original": "We're coming in with a healthy look of skepticism. We want to take a look at this data, analyze it for ourselves, he said in a telephone interview. The secretary of state is responsible for vetting all the voter registration cards that are uploaded and sent by all the registrars in Texas to the Secretary of State's Office. They have all the data sets they used. I would be surprised, bordering on stunned, if that many slipped through their process."}
{"original": "Douglas Ray, a special assistant Harris County attorney, said officials were very skeptical about the accuracy of this list. He said the county previously received inaccurate data from the state, including in 2011, when the state sent a list of allegedly deceased voters, some of whom turned out to be alive."}
{"original": "He added that in Harris County, which encompasses Houston, thousands of people are naturalized each month and election officials regularly conduct voter registration drives there. Officials were going to carefully review all the names on the list before taking further action, he said."}
{"original": "Twelve civil rights groups jointly wrote to Whitley on Monday urging him to rescind the advisory he sent Friday to counties on the suspected noncitizens on the rolls, saying his methodology was unreliable."}

{"original": "Charles Stewart, the director of the MIT election lab and an expert on election administration, estimated that up to 1 million adults have become naturalized in Texas since 1996. He said he studied similar cases in which suspected noncitizens on the voting rolls turned out to be naturalized citizens."}
{"original": "In 2012, Florida election officials ran a similar program that compared driver's license records against the state's voter registration database and flagged more than 180,000 possible noncitizens for removal from the state's voter rolls. Officials then revised the list to 2,600 people, and 85 people were ultimately removed from the rolls. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled in 2014 that the state's process for removing people from the rolls ran afoul of federal law."}

{"original": "They can be very intimidating. My former clients ― they'd come from Nicaragua and Haiti, respectively ― where they had fled circumstances of dictatorship. They felt very targeted and nervous, she said in an interview. There's no reason for naturalized citizens to be treated differently than persons born in the United States."}
{"original": "It's more of what we've been seeing over and over again ― the use of scare tactics and the fear of voter fraud to justify restrictive voting policies, Lakin said."}

{"original": "School voucher programs aren't new, but they're getting more attention than ever. If you have a child with learning and attention issues, you may wonder what school vouchers are, and if your child could benefit. Here's what you need to know."}
{"original": "States offer school voucher programs as a way to give parents choices in what school their child attends. Parents receive funds to use toward the cost of private or parochial school. (Not all states allow vouchers for parochial schools, however.) In some cases, they may also be used for homeschooling."}
{"original": "The typical dollar amount of a voucher varies, but it almost always falls short of the cost of a private or parochial school. Parents have to pay the difference between the voucher amount and the school's tuition. Some private schools may agree not to charge more than the amount of the voucher, though."}
{"original": "This funding is removed from the public schools and given to the private schools. (It's typically less than what a state allocated per student.) Vouchers can be a controversial topic in some communities."}
{"original": "Voucher programs have been around since the early 1990s. They're not available in all states—or even to all students where they are available. The new secretary of education favors these programs, however, so it's possible more states will start offering them. (Get answers to common questions about the new administration and special education.)"}
{"original": "There are three types of voucher programs:"}
{"original": "1. Traditional voucher programs. States give parents a certain amount of public education funding to put toward private school tuition. Most states set requirements that schools must meet to accept a voucher. The number of approved schools varies."}
{"original": "2. Education savings accounts (ESA). States set aside money and put it in individual accounts for students. Parents can use the money toward the cost of private school tuition. But they can also spend it on homeschooling costs (such as online courses or tutoring) and even on some types of therapy."}
{"original": "The main difference between an ESA and a traditional voucher is that school vouchers can only be used at participating schools. If parents use ESA funds for tuition, they can spend it at whatever school they choose."}
{"original": "3. Tax credit scholarships. States give businesses or individuals tax credits to donate money to a scholarship organization. Students who meet the requirements of the program can use the scholarship money toward tuition at a private school."}
{"original": "School vouchers are currently available in nearly 30 states, plus Washington, DC. Some states only offer them to students who apply for the program and fall into certain groups. These groups include:"}
{"original": "Kids from low-income families who meet certain income thresholds"}
{"original": "Students who are zoned for a school that's failing"}
{"original": "Enrollment and Discipline Policies With Vouchers"}
{"original": "Even if you have a voucher, a private school doesn't have to admit your child like a public school does. And after admittance, they can expel your child for poor behavior or academic performance."}
{"original": "Private schools can set their own policies for enrollment and discipline. It's important to ask about the policies before you take a voucher."}
{"original": "There are a number of reasons why parents may prefer a private school over a public school. But school vouchers have some limitations. And if you have a child with learning and attention issues, there are extra considerations to be aware of before accepting one."}
{"original": "Kids with disabilities have certain rights in public school, under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Among other things, the law says they must have:"}
{"original": "The right to an Individualized Education Program (IEP)"}
{"original": "But IDEA doesn't apply to private or parochial schools (Child Find stays in effect, though). They don't have to provide FAPE, IEPs or evaluations for your child. The services and supports outlined in an IEP your child might have in public school don't travel with him to private or parochial school."}
{"original": "If your child needs an evaluation, then it's likely you will have to pay for it on your own, because the private school may not provide that service. (You may be able to get one for free from your public school district under Child Find, however.)"}
{"original": "Also, if your child receives additional services in school—like speech therapy or occupational therapy—private schools do not have to provide these services. These supports may have to be purchased outside of school."}
{"original": "Private and parochial schools also don't have to follow hiring guidelines that public schools do. This means your child's teachers may not have the same level of special education expertise that public school teachers have."}
{"original": "They don't have to provide data on how well their students are doing, either. They don't have to give standardized tests. That makes it hard to know how special education students are faring."}
{"original": "Before you take a voucher, ask what you can expect from the private school you're looking at. Compare the supports and services it provides with the ones your child is getting at public school."}
{"original": "It's important to know that vouchers aren't the same as a charter school. Charter schools are public schools and must follow IDEA and provide needed services in an IEP."}
{"original": "Different Rules for Vouchers in Different States"}
{"original": "Voucher programs can vary widely from state to state. It's important to know what your state requires of both you and of the schools participating in the program."}
{"original": "Some states require parents who accept a voucher to give up their rights entirely under IDEA. But even if your state doesn't require that, you aren't likely to have any recourse if your child isn't getting the services or support he needs. In that case, your only option may be to leave."}
{"original": "You can go back to public school and resume supports and services under an IEP. However, you may have to the start the evaluation process over."}
{"original": "Opponents of school vouchers also point out a larger issue with voucher programs. They believe school vouchers drain money from the public schools. When that happens, public schools have fewer resources for the students who stay."}

{"original": "Texas officials contacted local election administrators on Tuesday to tell them that a list of suspected noncitizens on their voter rolls was inaccurate and actually contained the names of citizens."}
{"original": "The concession is significant because Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) and President Donald Trump immediately seized on the list of 95,000 people on the voter rolls who were suspected of being noncitizens as evidence of voter fraud in Texas."}
{"original": "Texas Secretary of State David Whitley (R) identified potential noncitizens by comparing noncitizens who got driver's licenses against the state's voter rolls. That methodology drew immediate outcry from critics, who said people who are naturalized after getting their driver's licenses would still be flagged as noncitizens."}
{"original": "But on Tuesday morning, representatives of the Texas secretary of state's office began contacting local officials to inform them that at least some of the voters on the list were citizens. They also told county officials there were more people who may have been naturalized and were eligible to vote."}
{"original": "In Harris County, which encompasses Houston, the Texas secretary of state's office initially flagged 29,822 names as potential noncitizens on the rolls. But Douglas Ray, a county attorney, said state officials told them those names included people who initially got a driver's license as noncitizens and then registered to vote at the DMV after becoming naturalized. State officials had validated the citizenship of those people, Ray said, and they were erroneously included on the list."}
{"original": "Ray said Wednesday that officials believe almost 18,000 names should be removed from the list the secretary of state's office provided because they were citizens.

{"original": "After counties were notified of potential noncitizens on their rolls, they were authorized to begin investigating suspected noncitizens, which could include sending people notices asking them to prove their citizenship within 30 days or be removed from the rolls. Critics said such an effort unfairly targeted naturalized citizens and unlawfully intimidated voters."}
{"original": "On Friday, Sam Taylor, a spokesman for Whitley, told The New York Times he didn't see a situation where the list could contain a false positive. On Tuesday, Taylor said the secretary of state's office was providing updated information to voters."}

{"original": "Economists say that a recession fueled by the coronavirus pandemic is on the horizon and warn that if policymakers don't move quickly, the damage could be painful. Yet so far, the White House and congressional Republicans haven't released any actual policy proposals to deal with the economic blows of COVID-19."}
{"original": "It could very plausibly be worse than the financial crisis, said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former economic adviser to President Barack Obama who helped design the 2009 stimulus bill crafted in response to the Great Recession."}
{"original": "It's not yet clear that a recession would be as painful or prolonged as it was a decade ago. Once the threat of the virus recedes, things could bounce back. However, serious signs of a downturn are here already, showing up in the bond market and stock market, which had its worst day since 1987 on Thursday, and in the plunging price of oil. Layoffs in sectors already affected by the virus have begun. And there's been a widespread downturn in spending as events are canceled and Americans encouraged to stay home."}
{"original": "Any questions about whether there would be economic repercussions are gone, said Jay Shambaugh, an economist and director of the Hamilton Project. It is clear, he said. The NBA suspending its season and the NCAA canceling March Madness ― and all the lost revenue that comes with those decisions ― are just a few examples."}
{"original": "Yet the policy response from the White House has been almost nonexistent. In his Oval Office speech Wednesday night, President Donald Trump spoke vaguely about paid leave, financing for coronavirus-related health care and policies to shore up small businesses. Trump has repeatedly criticized Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, and is pushing for more rate cuts. But interest rates are already at historic lows. The Fed also announced other moves on Thursday to stabilize the markets, but no one thinks that will be enough to cushion the crisis."}
{"original": "Trump has also been pushing hard for a cut to payroll taxes in response to the outbreak. Such a tax cut would increase working Americans' paychecks by a small percentage and would do little to offset the economic pain of a pandemic."}
{"original": "The fact that the Trump administration and the Republicans have not come out with a clear plan is an outrage. It is an outright cruelty. Claudia Sahm, director of macroeconomic policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth"}
{"original": "The payroll cut is better than nothing, but we can do a lot better, said Furman, who helped design a similar tax cut during the Obama administration. For starters, it would only help those Americans who are still employed. It would take too long before working people would feel its impact, as it would mean just slightly higher earnings. And the cut would give a bigger boost to those who earn bigger paychecks."}
{"original": "It drips out, he said. it's too much money for people who don't need it. And too little for people who really do need it."}
{"original": "Even conservative economists say it's not a good solution."}
{"original": "Republicans in the House and Senate have been lukewarm on a payroll tax cut and are also pushing back on a plan from House Democrats that would mandate paid sick leave."}
{"original": "They've offered no solutions of their own."}
{"original": "The fact that the Trump administration and the Republicans have not come out with a clear plan is an outrage, said Claudia Sahm, director of macroeconomic policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. It is an outright cruelty."}

{"original": "Economists Have A Plan, Even If The White House Doesn't"}
{"original": "Economists are pushing for direct cash payments to all Americans; similar to what was done under the George W. Bush administration during the financial crisis."}
{"original": "The money would help many meet their day-to-day expenses as work slows or dries up."}
{"original": "There's a clear need to get more money to individuals and households to help them smooth over what is hopefully a temporary economic shock, said Shambaugh. This isn't trying to get people to [go on a] shopping spree, it's trying to get people to meet their daily needs."}
{"original": "Still, the hope is that when the economy does come back after the virus fades, those checks would provide an immediate boost of cash to an ailing economy."}
{"original": "You want the bounce back to be really strong, you want people to have the resources to do it, said Josh Bivens, an economist at the progressive Economic Policy Institute. He said the hope is for a V-shaped downturn, in which the economy plunges temporarily during the crisis and comes back quickly when people can stop social distancing measures."}
{"original": "The Difference Between Now And 2008"}
{"original": "The key difference, of course, between now and the financial crisis in 2008 is that this time around, the country is facing a public health crisis that's creating an economic downturn. Last time around, it was the finance sector, courtesy of the mortgage bust, that sent the country into freefall."}
{"original": "That means the first order of business is addressing public health, making COVID-19 testing available and widespread, beefing up funding for Medicaid to the states, and ensuring that sick workers can stay home and still get paid."}
{"original": "But part of keeping citizens healthy will involve taking economic measures to ensure they can access health care and practice the social distancing measures that are key to slowing the spread of the virus."}
{"original": "Paid sick leave is crucial. Also helpful: Making sure folks that need food assistance can get it."}
{"original": "Though the '08 financial crisis was obviously quite severe, back then, many Americans did keep spending money. Now Americans are already slowing down on spending, with more pain to come."}
{"original": "In fact, the recommended way to solve this public health crisis is to literally slow the economy ― forbidding large events and gatherings, keeping people home and away from work and shops and restaurants and theaters."}
{"original": "Consider all the events and travel that's already been canceled: There will be no spectators for the NCAA basketball tournament. The NBA regular season has been suspended. Colleges are shutting down campuses. That's all lost revenue that can't be recovered and lost work for millions."}
{"original": "Everyone in the U.S. is cutting back on their spending, not counting the stocking up they're doing at this moment, said Furman, who also chaired the Council of Economic Advisers from 2013-2017. If everyone who was going to spend $1,000 spends $950, that's a recession."}
{"original": "All the economists who spoke to HuffPost emphasized that the coronavirus should not be a political issue. It's a virus that doesn't care about political affiliation."}
{"original": "During the financial crisis, the idea of who was to blame came up constantly. Homebuyers were often criticized for taking on bigger mortgages than they could handle, and bailing them out was viewed in some corners as unethical."}
{"original": "This is not about particular groups that might not have done what they need to do, said Sahm. The coronavirus is highly infectious. The coronavirus does not care if you're going to vote for Biden or Trump this fall."}
{"original": "Shambaugh put it this way: I'm still hopeful, and maybe I'm naive that this doesn't need to be partisan, [but] people need help and we need to do it fast."}

{"original": "Ten Republican senators on Sunday sent a letter to President Joe Biden outlining their rebuttal to his COVID-19 relief proposal as Democrats signaled their intentions to push through the president's plan without GOP help."}
{"original": "In their two-page letter, the Republican lawmakers asked to meet with Biden to work toward a bipartisan compromise on the relief package, which Biden promised on the campaign trail would be passed swiftly if elected. The Republican proposal amounts to a significantly narrower aid package, nearly 70% smaller than Biden's plan."}
{"original": "Our proposal reflects many of your stated priorities, and with your support, we believe that this plan could be approved quickly by Congress with bipartisan support, the senators wrote."}
{"original": "The letter was signed by Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Mitt Romney of Utah, Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Todd Young of Indiana, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Thom Tillis of North Carolina."}
{"original": "Republicans have balked at the Biden proposal's $1.9 trillion price tag, which includes $1,400 relief checks for most Americans and the expansion of enhanced unemployment benefits. In their letter to Biden, the GOP senators pushed for more targeted relief payments and limitations on jobless benefits."}
{"original": "Portman, during an interview Sunday with CNN's State of the Union, said his fellow signatories believe the stimulus checks should be capped at individuals who make $50,000 per year and families with a household income of $100,000. Biden's proposal would offer payments for individuals making up to $75,000 annually and households earning up to $150,000."}
{"original": "Let's focus on those who are struggling, Portman said. Let's target it. We really want to help those who need it the most."}

Last week, Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he and Democrats would use budget reconciliation ― a process by which certain legislation can be passed with the support of a simple majority ― to push through Biden's proposal.

{"original": "Christian textbooks used in thousands of schools around the country teach that President Barack Obama helped spur destructive Black Lives Matter protests, that the Democrats' choice of 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton reflected their focus on identity politics, and that President Donald Trump is the fighter Republicans want, a HuffPost analysis has found."}
{"original": "The analysis, which focused on three popular textbooks from two major publishers of Christian educational materials ― Abeka and BJU Press ― looked at how the books teach the Trump era of politics. We found that all three are characterized by a skewed version of history and a sense that the country is experiencing an urgent moral decline that can only be fixed by conservative Christian policies. Language used in the books overlaps with the rhetoric of Christian nationalism, often with overtones of nativism, militarism and racism as well."}
{"original": "Scholars say textbooks like these, with their alternate versions of history and emphasis on Christian national identity, represent one small part of the conditions that lead to events like last week's riot at the U.S. Capitol, an episode that was permeated with the symbols of Christian nationalism. Before storming the Capitol, some groups prayed in the name of Jesus and asked for divine protection. They flew Christian and Jesus 2020 flags and pointed to Trump's presidency as the will of God. The linkage between Christian beliefs and the violent attack on Congress has since pushed evangelical leaders to confront their own relationship with Trump and their support for the rioters."}
{"original": "These textbooks made this brand of nationalism more mainstream, said Kathleen Wellman, a Southern Methodist University history professor who is working on a book about the two Christian publishers. I'm struck by how coherent of a worldview [the textbooks] promote and how thoroughly it resonates in current culture."}
{"original": "Representatives from BJU Press and Abeka did not respond to inquiries about how many schools use their products. However, a 2017 HuffPost investigation found that about one-third of Christian schools participating in private school choice programs used a curriculum created by these two publishers or a similar company called Accelerated Christian Education, amounting to around 2,400 schools. The number of schools using these company's products that do not participate in a voucher program likely amounts to thousands more. (Voucher programs allow students to use taxpayer funds to attend private schools.)"}
{"original": "A passage in a history textbook published by Abeka."}
{"original": "Both Abeka and BJU Press have ties to Christian colleges. Abeka was launched in the 1970s by Arlin and Beka Horton, who also founded Pensacola Christian College, a Florida institution that outlaws dancing and other satanic practices, such as astrology. BJU Press is affiliated with the evangelical Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, which famously lost its tax-exempt status after banning interracial dating in the '80s, a policy it didn't reverse until 2000."}
{"original": "We unequivocally condemn any rhetoric that promotes illegal or violent behavior, Amy Yohe, managing editor of Abeka Publishing, told HuffPost. One of Abeka's core goals is to teach constructive citizenship through textbooks that accurately represent the facts of history, enabling students to learn from the life lessons it teaches, both positive and negative."}
{"original": "BJU Press did not respond to requests for comment."}
{"original": "However, scholars who study religion in America say that many of the ideas present in the publishers' textbooks overlap with rhetoric heard from the rioters last week. Christian nationalists argue that the United States was founded as a Christian nation and has a special covenant with God, meaning that its citizens must implement a particular vision for this country or they will fall out of favor with God. The textbooks parrot these ideas, said Andrew Whitehead, associate professor of sociology and director of the Association of Religion Data Archives at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis."}
{"original": "As we see in these textbooks, they're afraid of outside forces or the U.S. won't be what it should be, said Whitehead. There's always a particular prescription ― they have to be on God's good side. I think that's a big part of it."}
{"original": "Passages from the textbooks reflect an overarching worldview in which America is constantly moving away from a moral center, with Christians on the front lines beating back the forces of immorality."}
{"original": "One passage in an 11th-grade U.S. history textbook from Abeka states, Although many false philosophies were popular in America before 2000, the new millennium heralded a dramatic acceptance of immoral ideology on a national scale. … Three such philosophies are globalism, environmentalism, and postmodernism."}
{"original": "Believing religion — particularly Christianity — to be divisive, globalists discourage its influence on public life, it continues."}
{"original": "By parroting such conservative political views under the guise of Christianity, the textbooks give those views more legitimacy, making it difficult to distinguish between fact and opinion. While all textbooks, including the secular, cherry-pick narratives and have their biases, these ones fuse a religious worldview with Trumpian talking points using anti-media and anti-immigrant rhetoric."}
{"original": "Obviously it's too simplistic to say these textbooks are causing people to think something, but they play a unique role in giving visual credibility to these ideas by having them be in a very traditionally trustworthy artifact, said Adam Laats, professor of history and education at New York state's Binghamton University. There's a sense that they couldn't put it in a schoolbook if it wasn't true."}
{"original": "HuffPost's previous investigation of these textbooks found that they also dismiss evolution as junk science, characterize Nelson Mandela as a marxist agitator who helped drive South Africa to radical affirmative action, and suggest that Satan hatched the idea of modern psychology. Many of the schools that use these books also ban LGBTQ students and families, and the books repeatedly condemn homosexuality. At one point in an Abeka textbook, slavery is described in purely economic terms, saying that slaves seemed to be better investments than indentured servants."}
{"original": "I absolutely thought of these textbooks when watching what played out last week, Wellman said. It's the anti-science culture, anti-elite, the identification of Christianity with military culture."}

Bush's low approval rating at the time, the Abeka 11th-grade U.S. history book points the finger at the media in part, saying that much of the war opposition in America was the media, supported by a large number of Hollywood entertainers, and that spurred on by the media, many Americans wanted a change from the policies of the previous eight years."}
{"original": "When discussing President Obama, the textbooks accuse him and his administration of stoking racial divisions. Below is a passage from that Abeka history book:"}
{"original": "Many Americans' views about race relations had improved at the time that Obama was inaugurated. Unfortunately, Americans' views of race relations declined after Obama came into office. Race riots in places such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, greatly escalated racial tensions and worsened strife between minorities and local police. President Obama's attempts to resolve these problems often seemed to make the situation worse."}
{"original": "The books do not mention that such protests came in response to the deaths of unarmed Black men, including Michael Brown and Freddie Gray Jr., at the hands of police."}
{"original": "A high-school-level textbook from BJU Press also blames the Black Lives Matter movement for racial discord. It says:"}
{"original": "Despite President Obama's call for racial harmony, his eight-year term of office saw an intensification of racial discord. Several controversial shootings of black men led to protests, some of which were violent and destructive with black communities bearing the brunt of most of the destruction. Groups such as Black Lives Matter sharpened the divide between police and citizens, and black and white, with divisive rhetoric. Mixed messages from the Obama administration, the Department of Justice in particular, seemed to increase the racial discord."}
{"original": "The textbook does not mention that those controversial shootings were at the hands of police officers or explain the societal changes Black Lives Matter is trying to achieve with its supposedly divisive rhetoric. The book does not lay out for its teen readers what those mixed messages from the Obama administration were."}
{"original": "Other targets of the textbooks include globalists, environmentalists and multiculturalists."}
{"original": "According to multiculturalists, advancing the achievements of western civilization was an act of hatred toward other cultures. They encouraged people to define themselves by race, sex, or sexual orientation rather than by the pillars of western civilization, such as nation, family, and God, reads the Abeka American history textbook. However, many conservatives and Christians within America have attempted to quell these philosophies and once again turn America into a united, moral nation."}
{"original": "The textbooks don't give a full-throated endorsement of Trump, noting his crude remarks and previously liberal positions, but they ultimately represent him as someone on the side of Christians who is fighting for their values. One description from the Abeka textbook reads:"}
{"original": "Contrary to the high hopes that Obama's presidency would bring the country together, Americans were bitterly divided leading up to the election in 2016. The Democratic Party had become increasingly concerned with identity politics, which is the idea that a person's race, sex, and sexual orientation form the most important parts of their humanity and that politics should reflect that belief. Republicans, meanwhile, believed that their politicians had been too compromising with the increasingly radical left and that they needed a political outsider who would not back down or compromise with the Democrats. ... The Republican Party nominated real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump from New York, whose determination and bombastic mannerisms gave Republicans the fighter they wanted. As a businessman, Trump stated that he would 'take the brand of the United States and make it great again.' However, many conservatives were wary of Trump because of his occasional vulgar speech, his past immoral behavior, and his public support of homosexual marriage; but some were persuaded by Trump's choice for his running mate — Indiana's conservative governor Mike Pence."}
{"original": "Evangelical Christians were one of Trump's most important voting blocks. Though white evangelicals only represent about 15% of the electorate, they made up about 23% of the vote during the 2020 election, according to the Associated Press. About 8 in 10 white evangelical Christians voted for Trump last year."}

{"original": "There were the Christian flags, like the ones she used to pledge allegiance to in school, waving alongside American flags. The rioters' rhetoric, focused around saving the country, defeating enemies and promoting the will of God, could have come straight out of one of her childhood classrooms, where she said she was taught a distorted version of history with nods to white Christian supremacy. Last week's insurrectionists could have been her classmates, her teachers, her pastors. She felt a wave of recognition as she watched the pictures on social media."}
{"original": "Over the course of my life I can see how what I was taught in Christian schooling has impacted me, and the riots on Jan. 6 played into it. That whole belief system revolves around the idea that you want the rest of the world to think like you, said Garman, who is now a social worker. It's a 'the ends justify the means' type of thing."}
{"original": "Since Jan. 6, popular pro-Trump evangelical leaders have felt driven to judge the rioters' actions, with some offering full-throttle condemnations and others issuing more temperate responses."}
{"original": "The Secret Service had to escort the vice president of the United States to safety out of the Capitol building. Gunshots were fired. Tear gas was deployed in the Capitol Rotunda.

{"original": "Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press Liberal leader Justin Trudeau campaigns with then-minister of transportation Steven Del Duca on Sept. 4, 2015 in Richmond Hill, Ont."}
{"original": "But he says there were times when the public found his government to be out of touch."}
{"original": "When you're talking about a 15-year horizon, it's very easy for governments to become stuck inside the bubble of government, he said."}
{"original": "The only way we're going to restore the trust and rebuild that relationship with voters … is actually go and talk to everyday Ontarians in their neighbourhoods, in their communities and hear about their concerns."}
{"original": "But like the Ontario Liberal Party, Del Duca's name carries some baggage."}
{"original": "The province's auditor general found in 2018 that when Del Duca was transportation minister, he pressured Metrolinx to inappropriately recommend GO stations be built in Kirby and Lawrence East, even though the costs of building those stations outweighed the benefits. The Kirby station was in Del Duca's riding."}
{"original": "And after he became minister of economic development in 2018, Del Duca was accused of giving a leg up to his former employer, the carpenters' union, at the expense of a rival union."}
{"original": "There are five other challengers. Two of them, Coteau and Graham, have been quick to point out that delegated conventions often deliver unexpected results."}
{"original": "The next time someone tells you that one candidate has this leadership race 'in the bag' — ask them about Lyn McLeod or Dalton McGuinty or Kathleen Wynne, Coteau wrote in a message to supporters on Jan. 25. No 'frontrunner' has ever won our leadership race process."}
{"original": "Here's more about the other contenders, in alphabetical order by last name."}
{"original": "Like Del Duca, Coteau is a former cabinet minister. As minister of social services, he oversaw the Liberals' program for children with autism and helped implement the basic income pilot project that Ford's government quickly cancelled."}
{"original": "I think that overall, Liberals in Ontario have a lot to be proud of, he told HuffPost. But there were a few decisions that were made that weren't necessarily aligned with where people wanted to go; selling off Hydro One was one of those decisions."}
{"original": "He said his biggest accomplishments were passing a child protection bill that laid the groundwork for Indigenous-led child welfare agencies, reorganizing autism services and delivering the Pan Am Games in 2015."}
{"original": "CoteauMichael/Facebook Ontario Liberal leadership contestant Michael Coteau with former premier Kathleen Wynne in a Facebook photo."}
{"original": "His biggest regret is that the Liberals' anti-racism plan is no longer being implemented under Ford."}
{"original": "We put in place the act which passed and Doug Ford has completely destroyed. He's just not acted on any of it … I really wish I could have explored more ways to lock it into the system so it'd be more difficult for him to dismantle."}
{"original": "As premier, he says he would hold town halls four times a year to hear directly from voters. He also says he'd create a more respectful legislature by meeting with opposition caucuses at the start of every session."}

{"original": "She also points out that she's not a former MPP or cabinet minister."}
{"original": "I don't think we can win in 2022 and beyond if we look the same as we did in 2018, Graham told HuffPost. I've got a decade of experience in local government, developing public policy … but in an environment where people aren't part of a political party. People with different ideas actually have to get along."}
{"original": "She said she's motivated by a desire to fundamentally change the party, which she thinks has become all about winning elections and trying to buy people's votes."}
{"original": "A Liberal government should focus on improving wellbeing instead of growing the economy, like the governments of New Zealand and Iceland have, Graham said."}
{"original": "Her platform says she would apply rent control on all rental units, no matter when they were built, create an Indigenous housing strategy and immediately provide $100 million for emergency housing and homelessness prevention."}

{"original": "Adopting the Ontario NDP's Pharmacare for Everyone plan, which would cover 125 essential medicines like insulin, antibiotics and birth control;"}

{"original": "She says the fact that she comes from outside is what makes her different than the other candidates."}
{"original": "I bring the perspective of a person who has lived with the consequences of a Liberal government for 15 years, the good and the bad, she told HuffPost. I know what it's like to struggle to meet a payroll, I know what it's like to worry about paying rent."}
{"original": "She said the previous Liberal government had some outstanding outcomes, especially full-day kindergarten, which she called its crowning jewel."}
{"original": "I deeply regret that my kids were too old for that, Hollingsworth, who has two teenage sons, said."}
{"original": "On other issues, like auto insurance, Hollingsworth said the Liberals failed to help people and actually did harm."}
{"original": "LiberalBrenda/Facebook Brenda Hollingsworth, in red, laughs with fellow Liberal leadership candidates Alvin Tedjo and Mitzie Hunter."}
{"original": "There were all sorts of changes made to reduce the amount of coverage that people have with a promise of reduced premiums that didn't materialize, Hollingsworth said. That has had very serious repercussions for lots of Ontarians."}
{"original": "Hollingsworth said that despite her lack of political experience, she has many applicable skills."}
{"original": "I manage a staff. I make policy decisions. I am an expert negotiator. I have been an advocate for thousands of individual Ontarians over the last two decades."}
{"original": "As premier, Hollingsworth is proposing to:"}
{"original": "Fund mass transit projects, including the Hamilton light-rail transit (LRT) project;"}
{"original": "Develop more transit in rural areas;"}

{"original": "MPPMitzieHunter/Facebook MPP Mitzie Hunter campaigns in Ottawa with Liberal supporters."}
{"original": "As premier, Hunter says she would aim to get the high school graduation rate up to 90 per cent from its current 87 per cent, bring in a school nutrition program and make sure there's a mental health worker in every high school."}
{"original": "Hunter says that both Ontario and the Liberal party need electoral reform."}
{"original": "She's pledging to make election day a statutory holiday and introduce ranked ballots."}
{"original": "Last year, Hunter led an unsuccessful push to change the Liberals' delegated system so that all members could cast a vote in the contest."}
{"original": "We need to be a party that's open and that is inclusive, that's modern and youthful and ready to take on the challenges of the future. I think that moving to a one-member-one-vote system would really help."}

{"original": "Like Graham, Tedjo is in his mid-30s and has never held public office."}
{"original": "For millennials, people under 40, people like myself, we need to give them a reason to vote for us. We need to give them a reason to vote at all, he told HuffPost."}
{"original": "TeamTedjo/Facebook Ontario Liberal leadership candidate Alvin Tedjo says he will institute a universal basic income if he becomes premier."}
{"original": "And I think the experience that we've seen is that unless we are going to be aggressive about climate change, unless we're going to have a real plan for education and the economy of the future, young people will vote elsewhere."}
{"original": "Tedjo has grabbed headlines for some of his bold proposals, which include merging the public and Catholic school boards and implementing a basic income based on the Wynne government's pilot project."}
{"original": "That would provide a no-strings-attached income supplement to anyone living on less than $34,000 individually or $48,000 as a couple."}
{"original": "I'm the only one saying don't need any more studies, we need to do this right away, he said."}
{"original": "As the economy changes and technology evolves, we need an income floor … so that people can still maintain a certain dignity in their lives while they decide what to do if they need to get retrained."}

{"original": "Sean Kilpatrick/THE CANADIAN PRESS Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner speaks in Ottawa on May 7, 2019."}
{"original": "So begins the Buffalo Declaration, a document released by Conservative Calgary Nose Hill MP Michelle Rempel Garner Thursday. The declaration is co-signed by three other Alberta Tories, and demands equality for the province under the constitution."}
{"original": "Besides now getting to use the excellent pun of referring to these MPs as the Buffalo wing of the Conservative Party — and developing a hankering for blue cheese dressing along the way — this document reignited debate about Western alienation, conversations that followed last fall's election after the ruling Liberals didn't win a single seat in Alberta or Saskatchewan."}
{"original": "It's also sparked a wave of critiques from Albertans and other people across Canada, arguing that the alienated Westerners don't represent their views and legitimize dangerous separatist sentiments."}
{"original": "WATCH: Alberta premier reacts to letter calling for Ottawa to deny Teck project. Story continues below."}
{"original": "But what is this document and how seriously should you take it?"}
{"original": "Here are some answers to your Buffalo Declaration questions."}
{"original": "The Buffalo Declaration is a 13-page document and accompanying webpage released on Feb. 20 signed by four Conservative members of Parliament. It outlines concerns about Alberta's role in the federal government and what the signees call a push for equality for the province. The authors definition of equality has a number of different pillars, from repealing carbon taxes to changing the size of Parliament."}
{"original": "The declaration outlines the challenges faced by Alberta and possible solutions. It contends that Alberta is physically and economically isolated from Canada's power structures."}
{"original": "It's structurally quite similar to the 2001 Firewall Letter, written by future-prime minister Stephen Harper and other prominent Albertans to then-premier Ralph Klein urging him to to fully exercise Alberta's constitutional powers by creating a provincial police force and withdrawing from the Canada Pension Plan."}
{"original": "The Buffalo Declaration, however, is targeted at Justin Trudeau's federal government rather than the provincial one. In fact, it is quite sympathetic to Jason Kenney's UCP government in Alberta and how it's handled separatist sentiment."}
{"original": "We support Premier Jason Kenney's initial efforts in this regard, as his government's Fair Deal panel explores the creation of a provincial revenue agency, withdrawing from the Canada Pension Plan, establishing a provincial police force, and other measures, the report reads. But we must go further. Much further."}
{"original": "We must go further. Much further - The Buffalo Declaration"}
{"original": "The much further in question seems to be demanding things that would require a rewriting of the constitution, such as shifting resource projects to be under the control of the provinces and rewriting equalization payments. As well, the document calls for repealing policies such as the carbon tax and enforcing rule of law on energy project protests."}
{"original": "It even asks for Trudeau to recognize Alberta as culturally distinct from the rest of Canada."}
{"original": "There's a lot going on there."}
{"original": "The document's proposing over a dozen structural and policy changes to how Canada works. Many would require referenda, and most would require the support of the federal Conservative party before pushing Trudeau on them."}
{"original": "And that brings up that this document, notably, is targeted at the upcoming Conservative leadership race."}
{"original": "Any leadership contestant for the Conservative Party of Canada who seeks the support of Albertans should be prepared to address this declaration, the document reads."}
{"original": "Notably, Rempel Garner — who's leading the charge on the declaration — has expressed interest in a run for federal party leadership in the past, but has not formally declared anything for the current race."}
{"original": "Alberta currently has 33 Conservative MPs in the House of Commons, but only four have signed this document."}
{"original": "Rempel Garner is leading the charge on the declaration, but it is also co-signed by Banff-Airdrie MP Blake Richards, Medicine Hat-Cardston-Warner MP Glen Motz and Peace River-Westlock MP Arnold Viersen."}
{"original": "Albertans are questioning if confederation is broken. They feel disconnected from, and disrespected by, the rest of Canada, Richards wrote in a Facebook post."}
{"original": "Alberta is not, and never has been, an equal partner in Confederation. The people of my province are suffering and need real, structural change. A line in the sand must be drawn. Here it is. https://t.co/Hc4z5CYN4N — Michelle Rempel Garner (@MichelleRempel) February 20, 2020"}
{"original": "Motz was in transit Friday and unable to return HuffPost Canada's request."}
{"original": "A representative from Viersen's office deferred to Rempel Garner for all inquiries related to the declaration."}
{"original": "The offices of both Rempel Garner and Richards did not respond to HuffPost's request for comment."}
{"original": "Why is it called the Buffalo Declaration?"}
{"original": "Ahead of confederation, the area now covered by Saskatchewan and Alberta was proposed by the then-Northwest Territories premier as a possible large province called Buffalo."}
{"original": "The federal government feared this would concentrate too much power in one province and grow to rival Quebec and Ontario, the authors argue, though there is little historic evidence proving this."}
{"original": "NurPhoto via Getty Images A herd of bison is seen in a field west of Calgary."}
{"original": "The authors argue the name is meant to evoke the glory days of Alberta before it starting being taken advantage of by the federal government."}
{"original": "But aren't bison a tricky subject on the prairies?"}
{"original": "When the first European settlers arrived in North America, as many as 60 million bison inhabited the continent's grasslands, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. And yes, bison are different than buffalo. Scientifically speaking, buffalo actually refers to animals like water buffalo in Africa. Bison refers to the big brown woolly folks the Buffalo Declaration used as their logo."}
{"original": "Plains bison were almost wiped out entirely in the late 1800s by over hunting, largely the result of colonial settlers on the prairies. Bison populations had remained steady for thousands of years previously and were incredibly important to Indigenous communities."}
{"original": "They have made a comeback in recent times. 2018 was the first time bison roamed freely in Alberta in 140 years."}
{"original": "Many critics of the manifesto immediately pointed to the irony of using Buffalo in its name."}
{"original": "It takes one hell of a lot of nerve to name the #BuffaloDeclaration after an animal sacred to First Nations, when most of their complaints stem from how Canada keeps stopping them from rampantly screwing over Aboriginal populations, and destroying the land. #abpoli #cdnpoli — Jeff Rybak🍁 (@JeffRybak) February 21, 2020"}

{"original": "Wait, all this talk of Western alienation sounds a lot like Wexit?"}
{"original": "It sort of is! The issues and concerns outlined are very similar to those put forward by the folks behind Wexit, aka the separatist movement."}
{"original": "Those folks want Alberta — and sometimes other Western provinces — to leave Canada to a certain degree. Some want to form a new country, others propose joining the United States while others just want Alberta to start governing more of itself a la Quebec."}
{"original": "Separatists have been specifically dismayed about equalization payments, where federal funds are transferred between wealthy and less wealthy provinces to help ensure reasonably comparable health care, education and welfare in all regions. Opponents of equalization say Alberta pays an unfairly large share, and argue that it should be allowed to keep all of its oil revenue."}
{"original": "On this, the Buffalo Declaration and Wexit agree. They also agree on what both sides call an unfair treatment from Ontario in specific."}
{"original": "And while the Buffalo Declaration claims to be about the West wanting in as opposed to wanting out, they document does work to legitimize Alberta separatism."}
{"original": "Structural, constitutional change must happen within Confederation or a referendum on Alberta's independence is an inevitability, the declaration reads. It is not our job to explain Alberta's value, it is now up to Canada to show they understand Alberta and our value to Confederation."}
{"original": "One way or another, Albertans will have equality. - The Buffalo Declaration"}
{"original": "The document even ends with a bit of a threat."}
{"original": "One way or another, Albertans will have equality."}
{"original": "It's important to note the struggles that have plagued Alberta separatists for decades, including an unsavoury connection to alt-right and white nationalist movements in the province. Parties have struggled to gain footholds campaigning on these alienation-inspired ideas"}
{"original": "The most recent separatist group, Wexit, has largely faded from public consciousness in the past few months as it struggled to reconcile its more radical members with actual political process."}
{"original": "How many Albertans actually want this?"}
{"original": "That's the big kicker here. Only four Tory MPs are actually signed on to this declaration."}
{"original": "If we're talking about alienation and separatist sentiments, according to two different polls in the months following the 2019 election, — one from ThinkHQ and one by Abacus Data, less than 28 per cent of Albertans surveyed actually support separatism."}
{"original": "It's difficult to gauge support for the policies outlined in the Buffalo Declaration because, frankly, they have so many different goals, varying in scope."}
{"original": "Support for having Trudeau acknowledge Alberta as a distinct culture is likely vastly different than rewriting the constitution to give Alberta more seats in Parliament."}
{"original": "What are the people saying about this?"}
{"original": "While there is little formal polling on it, the document's been heavily critiqued on social media, with people particularly drawing attention to its ideas around Alberta's unique culture and the assertion that the province is treated like a colony, many calling the latter statement outright racist."}

{"original": "I look forward to being a progressive voice at the table to secure meaningful relief and lasting economic security for struggling families, Warren said Tuesday."}
{"original": "Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) will chair the finance committee, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer confirmed Tuesday."}
{"original": "Our to-do list is long, Warren continued. We must provide immediate relief for families struggling under the weight of twin health and economic crises. We must make health care in America a human right and expand public programs like Medicaid and lower the Medicare eligibility age. And we must ensure those at the very top actually pay their fair share to keep America strong ― including a wealth tax on fortunes over $50 million to fund needed investments for working families."}
{"original": "Polling during her campaign indicated popular support for reducing income inequality in the U.S. More than 60% said in July 2019 that they would support such measures."}
{"original": "Warren also noted that she intends to serve as an aggressive advocate for accomplishing much of our agenda through the budget reconciliation process."}
{"original": "In a Senate chamber where Democrats have the slimmest of majorities, budget reconciliation is expected to become an invaluable tool for senators seeking to pass legislation in support of President Joe Biden's agenda. Passing a bill through budget reconciliation requires just a simple majority approval, but only a limited number of bills that affect federal spending and revenue can be passed this way ― such as former President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cut bill."}
{"original": "BUDAPEST, Hungary ― Eszter Imrenyi is a 25-year-old student who has become increasingly worried about what's happening to her country."}
{"original": "Hungary is more divided, and public debate more polarized. The country's far-right populist leader rails against migrants, minorities and the media. Wages remain low, and much-vaunted tax breaks have come at a price. Critics say the government is raiding future benefits in a short-sighted attempt to pay for them."}
{"original": "We have such a beautiful country. We have so many things we could be proud of, said Imrenyi. But we have to leave."}
{"original": "She is not alone. A generation of young Hungarians has decided to move abroad as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has consolidated power in Hungary over the last eight years, remaking the country's laws and cracking down on human rights groups."}
{"original": "Hungary, which has one of the world's fastest-declining populations, is facing a demographic crisis. The United Nations projects there will be at least 15 percent fewer people in the country by 2050."}
{"original": "But rather than counter this crisis by taking in more migrants ― as Germany, for example, has done ― Hungary has effectively shut its borders. Meanwhile, economic opportunities abroad, divisive rhetoric and the rise of ethnonationalism are driving many young people away."}
{"original": "Some Hungarian Jews are particularly concerned. The country, home to between 35,000 and 120,000 Jewish people, has a long history of anti-Semitism, with anti-Jewish laws and violence preceding the Nazi occupation of Hungary. During the Holocaust, more than 440,000 Hungarian Jews were rounded up in less than three months and sent to their deaths in Auschwitz and other death camps."}

{"original": "You don't really want to live in a country that's full of hate, said Adam Schonberger, leader of the Jewish community group Marom, which operates a hub for different minority rights organizations. A lot of people either already left or are planning to leave. A lot."}

{"original": "A 2017 Pew Research Center poll found around 1 in 4 Hungarians wouldn't accept Jews as members of their family and about 1 in 6 wouldn't accept a Jewish neighbor. While the official number of reported hate crimes in Hungary is low, rights groups charge that the government rarely prosecutes hate crimes as such, so it's hard to determine the exact extent of discrimination and violence against minority groups."}
{"original": "The Hungarian government has long demonized the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, alleging that the 87-year-old philanthropist has used his wealth to conspire against the government. Jewish groups say Orbán and other government officials have used classic anti-Semitic tropes in their attacks on Soros, who is Jewish."}
{"original": "When he says Soros, what Hungarians on the right hear is 'Jewish banker,' said R. Daniel Keleman, a political science professor at Rutgers University. In Hungary, he's just a stand-in for age-old conspiracy theories."}
{"original": "Orbán has also praised the self-described anti-Semite Miklos Horthy, Hungary's leader from 1920 to 1944. And Orbán's government erected a controversial statue in 2014 that depicts the country as a blameless victim of Nazi aggression, with an eagle embodying the German occupation attacking an angel, representing Hungary."}

While Spring Training is still a few weeks away, we're in the thick of a tax season, where legions of scammers are swinging for the back wall."}
{"original": "According to the IRS, there was a 400 percent increase in phishing and malware incidents during the 2016 tax season. With the April 15 filing deadline still feeling as far away as the Green Monster from home plate in Fenway Park, Yogi Berra's other dictum -- it ain't over till it's over -- was never more true."}
{"original": "My book Swiped: How to Protect Yourself in a World Full of Phishers, Scammers and Identity Thieves goes into great detail about the various tactics cyber criminals use to lure you, but the most important thing you can do to keep yourself scam-free this tax season is educate yourself on the most prevalent risks out there."}
{"original": "As ever the best (yet pretty lame) advice is to file your taxes as early as possible. Tax-related identity theft is primarily aimed at grabbing your tax refund, and scammers are creative, sophisticated, persistent, and move very quickly once your information is in hand. Armed with your Social Security number, date of birth and a few other pieces of your personally identifiable information, which if you have been involved in a data breach (you can check here to see warning signs and view two of your credit scores for free on Credit.com) is likely available on the dark web, they are off to log on to motels' Wi-Fi networks, bunny-slippered feet resting comfortably on coffee tables, furiously filing fraudulent tax returns online."}
{"original": "Here are some other things to bear in mind as the tax season is upon us:"}
{"original": "There is no bigger threat. Phishing was recognized as a word by the Oxford English Dictionary more than 10 years ago, which is the main reason I thought of Yogi Berra's déjà vu quip. By now it is a home truth that there are phishers out there. Catfishing is a regular part of the popular imagination, and phishing emails hit our inboxes with the same regularity as the various promotional emails we get from retailers and media outlets."}
{"original": "Phishing emails take many forms, but they are most commonly pointed at getting enough of your personally identifiable information to commit fraud in your name (identity theft). They also commonly contain a link that places malware on your computer. These programs can do a variety of things (none of them good), ranging from recruiting your machine into a botnet distributed denial of service attack to placing a keystroke recorder on your computer to access bank, credit union, credit card, and brokerage accounts to gathering all the personally identifiable information on your hard drive."}
{"original": "Here's what you need to know: The IRS will never send you an email to initiate any business with you. Did you hear that? NEVER. If you receive an email from the IRS, delete it. End of story. Oh, and they will never initiate contact by way of phone call either."}
{"original": "That said, there are other sources of email that may have the look and feel of a legitimate communication that are tied to other kinds of tax scams."}
{"original": "2. The Criminal Tax Preparation Scams"}
{"original": "You learned how to do homework in school for this reason: Not all tax preparers are the same and you must vet anyone you're thinking about using well before handing over a shred of your personally identifying information. Get at least three references, check online if there are any reviews, and call them."}
{"original": "Here's why: At this time of the year, tax prep offices that are actually fronts for criminal identity theft tend to pop up around the country in strip malls and other properties and then promptly disappear a few days later. Make sure the one you choose is legit!"}
{"original": "Phishing emails may not be aimed at stealing your personally identifiable information or planting malware on your computer. They may be simply aimed at getting your attention and business through enticing (and fraudulent) offers of a really big tax refund. While these preparers may get you a big refund, it could well be based on false information."}
{"original": "Be on the lookout for questions about business expenses that you did not accrue, especially watching out for signals from your preparer that you are giving him or her a figure that is too low. If he or she looks over their glasses and says, Are you sure you only spent $5,384.35 on business-related entertainment last year when you said zero, perhaps it's time to consider finding a new person to help you file."}
{"original": "Other soft-cons of shady tax preparation include inflated deductions, claiming tax credits to which you are not entitled, and declaring charitable donations you did not make. Bottom line here: We're all connected these days, and chances are you will get caught, so just make sure you are working with someone who follows the instructions (yes, they're complicated, and that's why it's not a bad idea to get help)."}
{"original": "As Yogi Berra said, You can observe a lot by watching. Tax season is stressful without the threat of tax-related identity theft and other scams. It's important to be vigilant, because, to quote Yogi all over again, If the world were perfect, it wouldn't be."}
{"original": "My fancy, embossed college diploma sits on my office desk. It's pretty — it ought to be. It was certainly expensive. Like so many of my millennial compadres, I fell victim to the idea that an expensive secondary education was vital to my overall success in life."}
{"original": "Prior to my leaving the nest, my dad laid out the terms of his contribution to my college education. Graciously, he would allocate $10,000 per year toward academic costs. I could go wherever I wanted, but if I chose an option where all costs were covered, he would buy me a car as a graduation gift. In hindsight, I realize how generous his support was. I understand the value of money better, now that I live the life of a corporate worker bee."}
{"original": "Nevertheless, in my ambitious naiveté, I chose the most expensive school that accepted me, sunk daddy's investment, and signed the digital dotted line for a $30,000 loan. (I still drive the same car from high school.)"}
{"original": "It's good debt. I'll make great money once I graduate. It's not that much in the scheme of life."}
{"original": "While my musings were true to an extent, I graduated Rollins College in Florida in May 2013, and hit the job market with an overwhelming feeling that I had made a poor investment. I spent $70,000 on a private, undergraduate business degree that I can't read because it's printed in Latin. My senior year, I imagined I'd work for a top consulting firm, analyze numbers, make important recommendations to clients, take home a fat salary and live my idea of a glamorous lifestyle. To my dismay, in my final semester, I discovered spreadsheets make me cry, and my interview skills were subpar. Needless to say, my dream job never came to fruition."}
{"original": "I spent $70,000 on a private, undergraduate business degree that I can't read because it's printed in Latin."}
{"original": "Three years post-graduation, I found myself working as a recruiter for a small, national firm. I spent my days aggressively cold-calling potential candidates and pitching job opportunities. I was paying my $301 minimum monthly payment and was discouraged when I realized I was barely making a dent in the overall balance due to high interest rates. The balance made me sick. I hated my job. I felt chained to my desk — decaying under fluorescent lights."}
{"original": "I had a pipe dream of quitting and traveling the world for a year. I wanted to start a podcast and record the stories of people I met anonymously. Unfortunately, I had minimal savings and an educational debt shackle keeping me at my recruiting desk. Around this time, I received news that I was not selected for a job opportunity that would allow me to travel while working remotely. I thought the job was the answer to my prayers, so the rejection was heartbreaking."}
{"original": "I was miserable for months. I was insufferable at home, which consequently led to a temporary split from my long-term boyfriend. After several months of wallowing in my perceived misfortune, I decided I had to make a change. I was disgusted by my own behavior. Who likes a mopey whiner? I felt financially trapped. I had borrowed to get to this place, and it appeared I had made a mistake. I obsessed. I worried. Then, I took action. I devised a financial plan to eliminate my college loan and save enough cash to allow me to quit my job and travel for an extended period."}
{"original": "My recruiting job paid me a $40,000 salary and commission based on performance and sales. The base was enough to get by, but the variable income portion was the attractive aspect of the compensation plan. I figured if I could seriously cut my expenses, make a killing in commission, and supplement my income with side jobs, I could potentially eliminate the loan balance and alleviate the financial stress."}
{"original": "I felt financially trapped. I had borrowed to get to this place, and it appeared I had made a mistake."}
{"original": "November 2016, I started by making a $500 payment. My bank account felt it. The majority of my after-tax income was allocated to living expenses. Still, there was a sense of satisfaction associated with paying more than the minimum. It was a small step, but it was what I needed. I started reading financial blogs and books, and began discussing my plan with a few close friends. I set a goal to pay off my $22,000 loan balance in six months, beginning in January 2017. Lofty? Yes. I'm not the most disciplined when it comes to managing money. I'm your typical millennial consumer. Dining out, manicures, and long weekends away ate up the majority of my disposable income. Nevertheless, I had to change my situation, so I had to change my habits."}
{"original": "The terrifying aspect of my plan revolved around the fact that only $40,000 of my compensation plan was guaranteed. I needed to perform like a rockstar professionally to ensure I stayed on track. I estimated I needed to gross approximately $100,000 in 2017 to pay off the loan, save a hefty security fund and account for taxes."}
{"original": "One of my mentors regularly acknowledged the power of writing down goals and the benefit of positive affirmation. I figured this was the perfect time to test her theory. I started a journal, penned my six-month goal and gave myself specific dates to accomplish financial payoffs."}
{"original": "June 30 was highlighted on my calendar as D-Day (Debtless Day)! I read my goals daily, and I focused on the small accomplishments. Essentially, I gave myself a consistent reminder that the insurmountable is comprised of bite-sized victories! (i.e. NO, I do not need that Starbucks latte!)"}
{"original": "At the onset of my six-month endeavor, I still owed approximately $22,000, which meant I needed to contribute $3,666 or more each month to my debt. (It was actually more than that, as I did not account for interest). After taxes, that was more than my base income, and of course, I still had bills to pay. Out of either sheer luck, skill or power of will, I began to see significant success at work. I was closing deals regularly, and my paychecks began to reflect the effort. Still, I needed more to meet my living expenses and self-imposed, monthly debt payment."}
{"original": "I picked up several side hustles to pad my pay. I spent 50 hours each week recruiting by day, and moonlighted as a liquor promoter by night. I was exhausted, caffeinated, and determined. I went on a strict budget, lived with multiple roommates to mitigate my rent expense, and lowered my 401k contribution from 12 percent to 1 percent. I vowed: No binging! No superfluous buying! Err, mostly (again with the lattes. OK, and maybe manicures). I may have slipped here and there, but for the most part, I stayed the course: $3,666 each month."}
{"original": "I'm your typical millennial consumer. Dining out, manicures and long weekends away ate up the majority of my disposable income. Nevertheless, I had to change my situation, so I had to change my habits."}
{"original": "Like John Lennon, I got by with a little help from my friends ― specifically, my parents. I needed an accountability partner (or two) to keep me honest and focused. They were my cheerleaders, and encouraged me to stay the course. Many of my friends and colleagues were deferring their loans. They did not buy into my debtless delirium. But mom and pop were always there to offer praise and wisdom. But that was all they offered. My dad was adamant that he had contributed his fair financial share to my education, and the debt responsibility was mine and mine alone."}
{"original": "Entering the fourth month of my debt demolition, my balance was a proud $11,600. Progress was delicious! Still, that was only half of my goal. With two months left on my (self-imposed) payoff timeline, I had to kick things into high gear."}
{"original": "Initially, I didn't realize I could choose which loan balances to pay. I just submitted the $301 monthly payment to the balance and called it a day. I finally realized I had eight mini-loans ― all with different interest rates ranging from 3.4 percent to 6.5 percent. Logically, I should've been paying off the highest interest rates first. Eek ― rookie mistake! I also started making weekly, sometimes biweekly, payments. If I had an extra $5 in my budget, I literally made a $5 payment. It kept me honest, and mathematically it reduced the interest, which accrued daily. Toward the end of my debt payoff timeline, I had several small loans, all at 3.4 percent, so I paid the smallest balance first. Knocking off one mini-balance at a time was quite satisfying!"}
{"original": "June came, and I continued to sink every extra dollar into my debt. I depleted my savings to an uncomfortably low balance. BUT. I. DID. IT! I made the last payment on June 26, 2017: four years, one month after graduation; and six months after I aggressively decided to commit to debt payoff."}
{"original": "In an era where 'treat yo'self' is a cultural norm, I think a little self deprivation does the soul good."}
{"original": "So how did it feel? Honestly, a bit anticlimactic. Crowds cheer, family sends greeting cards, and there are parties to celebrate when you graduate. Debt payoff is an achievement celebrated in solitude. Yet, the sense of personal pride was much greater paying off my student loan than actually earning my diploma."}
{"original": "I often reflect on my why. Why did I feel the need to adhere to such extreme measures? It certainly wasn't fun. On the contrary, at times it was miserable. But in an era, where treat yo'self is a cultural norm, I think a little self-deprivation does the soul good. I live in a world where I'm always teetering toward indulgence, and my all-or-nothing personality needs to be yanked back in the other direction from time to time."}
{"original": "To date, this is my proudest accomplishment. I taught myself a valuable lesson. Discipline is much more valuable than motivation. I was motivated to pay off my debt, but disciplined behavior was the driver that enabled me to do so in a six-month period. Today, I do not feel shackled by the constraints of a student loan. I used a methodology that can be applied to many life accomplishments: set a goal, create a plan, execute. I'm not special, but I do have an extra $301 each month to spend as recklessly as I want."}

{"original": "The question has led to a flurry of unsubstantiated allegations, denials and qualifications, potentially none of it bringing the public any closer to the facts."}
{"original": "It's a situation that could ― almost ― only happen in Canada. Unlike many other developed countries, Canada doesn't have any laws that require the owners of residential real estate to identify themselves. It's a notable weak link in Canada's anti-corruption laws, and part of the reason the country has become a magnet for money laundering."}
{"original": "Watch: Is Canada's economy addicted to money laundering? Story continues below."}
{"original": "Whoever owns Mille Fleurs ― as the the 11,000-square-foot property in North Saanich, B.C., is known ― used highly controversial methods also deployed by money-launderers and tax-evaders to conceal [their] identity, The Daily Mail reported last week."}
{"original": "The outlet cited neighbours as saying the property had been bought by a wealthy Russian businessman, possibly a billionaire. But in a separate report, it asserted that the owner is Frank Giustra ― a wealthy Canadian mining magnate and founder of B.C. film company Lionsgate. Giustra was born in Sudbury, Ont., and is of Italian, not Russian, origin."}
{"original": "A day later, the paper published Giustra's vehement denial, stating he doesn't own the property and doesn't know the royal couple."}

{"original": "Local news sources took a stab at figuring it out, and reported that the property is owned by nearby Towner Bay Country Club. The Daily Mail, however, says the mystery owner bought shares in the country club so they could hide their ownership of the house."}
{"original": "This game of who-owns-what would be much harder, these days, in most other developed countries, which have shot out ahead of Canada in passing laws to stop money launderers from hiding their ill-gotten gains in real estate."}
{"original": "Canada may need such laws more so than others. In a 2017 report, the global anti-corruption group Transparency International (TI) said the country's lax laws on real estate mean that a global corrupt elite is using Canadian real estate to launder money. It found that the government doesn't know who owns half of the 100 most expensive residential properties in Vancouver."}
{"original": "Large amounts of money can be legitimized at once, maintaining or increasing its value. Investments in real estate are seen as an alternative for those who fear having offshore accounts frozen, the TI report said."}
{"original": "The G20 countries agreed in 2014 to pass laws that would require the beneficial owner of a property to reveal themselves ― in other words, no more hiding home ownership behind numbered corporations or lawyers' firms."}
{"original": "But according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Library of Congress' research division, Canada and Japan were the only G7 countries not to have followed up on that commitment."}
{"original": "Britain, for instance, established registries of beneficial owners of businesses and land in recent years. Since 2016, title insurers in the U.S. (but not real estate lawyers or agents) are required to identify the real owners of real estate bought in cash. In the European Union, member countries are facing a deadline this month ― January 2020 ― to put into place beneficial ownership rules."}
{"original": "Canada's lagging position could soon change, starting with British Columbia. The provincial legislature has passed the Land Owner Transparency Act, which will require the actual owner of a property to be identified."}
{"original": "Though the new rule hasn't been implemented yet, things have gotten much better in B.C. in this regard, said James Cohen, executive director of Transparency International Canada."}
{"original": "So far in other provinces, it's been mostly talk. British Columbia is a front-runner in the country on beneficial ownership transparency, Cohen said in an interview with HuffPost."}
{"original": "He's encouraged by the moves made by the federal government, noting that in their recent mandate letters, both Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains were instructed to work with the provinces on developing a registry of the beneficial owners of real estate."}
{"original": "Senate and House Democrats renewed their effort to enact sweeping reform to U.S. labor laws on Thursday, reintroducing a broad bill that would expand collective bargaining rights and help rejuvenate labor unions."}

If it becomes law, it would be the most significant labor legislation enacted in the post-war period, and the most beneficial to unions in nearly 90 years."}
{"original": "With Democrats controlling both chambers, the legislation now stands a realistic chance of becoming law, but perhaps only if Democrats prove willing to get rid of the legislative filibuster. The bill would almost certainly garner no GOP support, meaning it could not clear a 60-vote threshold.

{"original": "The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the urgent need for Congress to protect and strengthen workers' rights, Scott said in a statement. Over the past year, workers across the country have been forced to work in unsafe conditions for insufficient pay, because they lacked the ability to stand together and negotiate with their employer."}

{"original": "The Senate is a different matter. Democrats hold a bare 50-50 majority in which Vice President Kamala Harris would cast a tiebreaking vote. Just like with the $15 minimum wage, some moderate Democrats might view the PRO Act as too aggressive and withhold support. If all 50 Democrats did get onboard, they would still expect to face a Republican filibuster."}
{"original": "Democrats are already using a procedural maneuver known as budget reconciliation to move a coronavirus relief package with no GOP support, just as Republicans unilaterally pushed through the Trump tax bill in 2017. But under Senate rules such a strategy would be much harder to pull off with the PRO Act, since the implications of the bill might be deemed extraneous to the budget."}
{"original": "The Congressional Budget Office previously estimated that the PRO Act would bring in about $39 million to the government in revenue over a decade, primarily through civil penalties on employers."}
{"original": "The last time unions saw the possibility of passing landmark labor legislation was during former President Barack Obama's first term, when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House. That effort, known as the Employee Free Choice Act, failed to make it through the Senate"}
{"original": "While there are still major hurdles to passing the PRO Act, many union activists are hopeful it could breathe new life into the labor movement. Organized labor has generally been on the decline for decades, with about 1 in 10 workers in the U.S. now belonging to a union. That's close to the lowest rate on record since the Labor Department started tracking in the early 1980s."}
{"original": "While there are many reasons for shrinking membership, many experts agree that one factor is the vehemence with which companies fight union campaigns, using tactics both legal and illegal. The PRO Act could make it harder for such employers to interfere with organizing efforts by unions. But ultimately unions would have to capitalize on it to grow their ranks."}
{"original": "What it does is it opens the door for unions to do more organizing, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor policy expert at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. The PRO Act is a very important step, but the unions have to rise to the occasion."}
{"original": "NEW YORK (AP) — When he was Donald Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen was hellbent on silencing Stormy Daniels, even arranging a hush-money payment to the porn actress that landed him in federal prison."}

{"original": "Both of our stories will be forever linked with Donald Trump, but also with one another, Cohen tells her. Thanks for giving me a second chance."}
{"original": "The scandal turned Stormy Daniels into a household name, and critics accused her of capitalizing on her newfound fame, including crisscrossing the country on a Make America Horny Again strip tour."}
{"original": "Federal prosecutors charged Cohen with skirting campaign contribution rules by arranging the hush-money payment to Daniels and a similar payment to Playboy model Karen McDougal. He pleaded guilty to those counts — as well as lying to Congress and tax evasion — and was sentenced to three years in federal prison."}
{"original": "Cohen has been producing his podcast from his Manhattan apartment, where he is serving the remainder of his sentence after he was released for a second time in July as part of an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19 in federal prisons. The podcast is distributed by LiveXLive's PodcastOne and produced by Audio Up."}
{"original": "Cohen and Daniels are united not only in infamy but deep regret over Trump. Despite the publicity boom — a windfall that included a bestselling book — Daniels said she longs for life before her allegations launched her into the zeitgeist."}
{"original": "I got to go places I would never get to go, she tells Cohen. But overall, if I could just wave a magic wand and make everything go back to the way it was before, I would absolutely do that."}
{"original": "Daniels said the waning weeks of Trump's presidency felt like the eye of the storm. The death threats — and headlines — had subsided as she remained in a sort of legal limbo."}
{"original": "But now she's braced for a second wave of controversy, including a defamation lawsuit she brought against Trump that she has taken all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court."}
{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Michael Cohen arrives at his Manhattan apartment, Thursday, May 21, 2020, in New York. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)"}
{"original": "Daniels sued Trump for defamation after the then-president commented on Twitter that a man she said had threatened her was nonexistent. She appealed a lower court's decision to dismiss the case and an order to pay Trump nearly $300,000 in attorneys' fees."}
{"original": "The lawsuit is among a minefield of legal issues Trump faces after leaving the White House, including state investigations in New York of his business dealings."}
{"original": "I've already lost everything, she said, referring to her prior way of life, so I'm taking it all the way."}
{"original": "Daniels also remains a witness in a federal criminal case against her own former attorney, Michael Avenatti, who is charged with cheating her out of $300,000 in proceeds from her 2018 book, Full Disclosure. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty."}
{"original": "The hourlong interview also includes graphic descriptions of Daniels' 2006 sexual encounter with Trump — details she said supports the veracity of her claims. She calls the encounter the worst 90 seconds of my life, for sure, because it just made me hate myself."}
{"original": "While she did not feel physically threatened, she said she had not expected to have sex with Trump and, at one point, thought about how to escape the room, thinking I could definitely outrun him."}
{"original": "She repressed details of the rendezvous for years, she said, adding the dynamics only came into focus after she saw the movie Bombshell about the sexual harassment women underwent in meetings with former Fox News executive Roger Ailes."}

{"original": "The latest Trump Organization filings reporting a $4.6 million annual loss at the president's two Scottish golf resorts boost the total red ink for the courses over eight years to an eye-popping $75 million."}
{"original": "The filings covering 2019 don't reflect the tumult of 2020. Eric Trump, the director of the Scottish courses, warned that the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit — which the president has always supported — may take a further bite out of revenues."}
{"original": "The unprofitable properties have been hemorrhaging money for years. Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd., which operates Donald Trump's course in Aberdeenshire, reported a net loss of $1.5 million for 2019 after losing $1.4 million the previous year, according to a filing with Britain's Companies House registry. The total debt for the club, which opened in 2012, is more than $16 million, the London Times has reported."}
{"original": "Despite the losses, the Trump Organization has reported massive outlays at the properties over the years. It also has won approval to build a 500-unit housing development at a cost of $185 million next to the club in Aberdeenshire, which it intends to pursue, according to the latest filing."}
{"original": "Accounting for the president's Scottish resorts is unusual because Trump is the creditor for his own businesses, which means payment for many of the resorts' costs flow to the Trump Organization."}
{"original": "The resort losses are so astronomical that some Scottish officials are suspicious about financing and taxes. Trump hasn't paid a penny in tax on the properties."}
{"original": "Trump bought the Scotland properties with huge amounts of cash at a time when he was heavily indebted and having a difficult time finding a bank to loan him funds. Scottish Green Party co-leader and member of Parliament Patrick Harvie called on the government in November to file an Unexplained Wealth Order against Trump to compel him to reveal the source of that cash."}
{"original": "The circular flow of money in the Trump companies provides an opportunity for money laundering, The New Yorker business writer Adam Davidson has suggested. He called the resorts money disappearing operations."}

{"original": "These feelings of being different and 'on guard' can affect how Black women perform. It may lead them to feeling they need to be vigilant and 'self-police' their behaviour, so as to not let their 'guard' down. Getting less sleep when unrealistic expectations are too much to bear, can also make them more anxious and less productive than they would be."}
{"original": "This additional psychological burden, or 'emotional tax', that they feel is linked to them feeling like outsiders, different to their peers and this negative can impact not only their work but also their health and well-being."}

{"original": "DAVOS, Switzerland ― This week, thousands of business leaders, lawmakers and activists will convene in Davos to discuss the greatest challenges facing the world."}
{"original": "At the yearly gathering hosted by the World Economic Forum, there is much talk of worrying geopolitical and geo-economic tensions. But, to its critics, Davos embodies everything that's wrong with the current moment."}
{"original": "They gather to talk about making the world a better place. But instead they commandeer our conversation, said Anand Giridharadas, author of Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World, who will not be attending."}
{"original": "The U.S. government is in its longest shutdown on record. Britain is spiraling out of control over Brexit. Flames of rage engulf France. But the plutocrats who shattered the world order are gathering to make out in the mountains, Giridharadas said."}
{"original": "According to a report from the anti-poverty coalition Oxfam, timed to coincide with Davos, the world's 2,200 billionaires grew 12 percent wealthier last year. But the wealth is not trickling down. The poorest half of the world got 11 percent poorer in 2018, and today the top 26 billionaires own the same wealth as the poorest 3.8 billion people."}
{"original": "The economy we have today is fundamentally inhuman, Paul O'Brien, Oxfam America's vice president for policy and campaigns, told HuffPost. You're not going to get a decrease in extreme wealth until you have leadership committed to tackling its root causes, and right now we don't."}
{"original": "In the U.S., wages have been essentially stagnant for decades while members of the Davos elite have gotten significantly richer. The fortunes of a dozen 2009 Davos attendees have jumped by a combined $175 billion in the years since, a Bloomberg analysis found."}
{"original": "Among those on the list were Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who has tripled his net worth since 2009, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose wealth grew 1,853 percent in that period."}
{"original": "Zuckerberg is not scheduled to attend Davos, but Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is using the gathering as a stop on a Facebook apology tour, after a slew of bad publicity over its role in the spread of misinformation in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and evidence that the company helped stir violence in Sri Lanka and elsewhere."}
{"original": "The problem with Davos is that it provides a moral glow of heroism to people who should be begging for society's mercy for their role in breaking our social contract, said Giridharadas. No one at Facebook should be on a panel explaining anything. They should be apologizing … for breaking our democracy and for enabling ethnic violence."}
{"original": "To Giridharadas, Davos amounts to a week of rich-splaining, characterized by terms that shift the conversation away from actual social change: Win-win replaces a debate about social justice. Lean in gets in the way of maternity leave. Talk of micro-credits takes the place of a discussion about a wealth tax. These elites have essentially used the rhetoric of changing the world to prevent change, he said."}
{"original": "Seemingly taking note of populist protests that most recently have hit France, Klaus Schwab, WEF's executive chairman, told reporters before the yearly meeting that globalization has to become more inclusive. Globalization produces winners and losers, and there are many more winners in the last 24, 25, 30 years, he said. But now we have to look after the losers, after those who have been left behind."}

{"original": "The budget for the World Economic Forum has more than doubled since 2009, to $337 million last year. What WEF sells at this ski resort, of course, is access, and it's a bit of an inside-Davos joke that the stream of exclusive parties and private events provoke FOMO among even the most high-powered attendees."}

{"original": "Bloomberg via Getty Images Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks, in New York City in May 2017. In a 60 Minutes interview that aired on Jan. 27, he said he is considering a run for the presidency in 2020 as an independent."}
{"original": "We do not know if a third-party presidential run by former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz would throw the 2020 election for President Donald Trump. Professional Democrats, of course, are terrified by this prospect."}
{"original": "But the fact that Schultz can imagine running for president only as a long-shot third-party candidate demonstrates something critical — and frequently overlooked — about his brand of politics. Schultz hails from an aging, elite enclave in which the conventional wisdom of the 1990s remains the foundation of all political truth. It is a world where balanced budgets, low taxes and government spending cuts animate the top minds among Republicans and Democrats alike. But in the 21st century, the 1990s are a political death sentence."}
{"original": "In a 60 Minutes interview that aired on Sunday, Schultz reeled off a list of complaints about contemporary politics cryogenically preserved from 1995. What the Democrats are proposing is something that is as false as the wall, he said. And that is free health care for all, which the country cannot afford. The bean-counting billionaire said he would not have cut corporate taxes as much as Trump did but refuses to say whether he would raise corporate taxes as president."}
{"original": "I look at both parties, we see extremes on both sides, Schultz said. We are sitting today with approximately $21.5 trillion of debt, which is a reckless example ― not only of Republicans but of Democrats as well ― as a reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility."}
{"original": "Schultz is distressed that the current administration locks children in cages and leaves them to die, but he finds the prospect of Democrats authorizing spending on health care comparably troubling. Back in Bill Clinton's presidency, Schultz would have been toasted as a great mind for making such pronouncements. Everyone, it seemed ― Clinton, then–Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, then–House Speaker Newt Gingrich — agreed: Low budget deficits would boost Wall Street's confidence in America's fiscal sustainability, bringing down interest rates and boosting economic growth. Since the government was too clunky and inefficient to spend money wisely, according to this orthodoxy, it was best to get deficits down through spending cuts, rather than tax increases, although a slight hike for the richest households could be stomached for the sake of appearances. It was very nice that bleeding-heart liberals wanted to spend money to alleviate poverty and treat the sick, but ultimately, most people would be better off with smaller deficits."}
{"original": "The problem with this story is that it isn't true. Despite endless prophecies of debt apocalypse during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama years, fiscal armageddon has steadfastly refused to arrive. Economists increasingly recognize the benefits of budget deficits, noted Stephanie Kelton, an economics professor at Stony Brook University. Deficits are an important policy tool, especially at a time when global growth is slowing."}
{"original": "Schultz hails from an aging, elite enclave in which the conventional wisdom of the 1990s remains the foundation of all political truth."}
{"original": "In fact, economists have been distancing themselves from these 1990s relics for quite some time. The tide of expert opinion is shifting the other way from this 'Old View,' to almost the opposite view, wrote Jason Furman in 2016. Furman, a thoroughly conventional economist in the Clinton administration, was also a thoroughly conventional economist in the Obama administration. By the end of Obama's presidency, the conventional wisdom had changed."}
{"original": "If his 60 Minutes interview is any indication, Schultz isn't very good with numbers. His $21.5 trillion debt monster is an exaggeration: It includes trillions of dollars the government owes to itself. As of the third quarter of 2018, the total debt held by the public was about $15.8 trillion. And he is simply wrong about the affordability of Medicare for all. Even the Mercatus Center, a think tank funded by Charles and David Koch, found that Sen. Bernie Sanders' single-payer health care plan would actually lower total health care costs."}
{"original": "But the fundamental problem for Schultz isn't his ineptitude with calculators. It's the way ordinary Americans think about politics in the 21st century. Polling consistently indicates that a majority of Republicans support Medicare for all. Among Democrats, support hovers around 80 percent. Few political ideas are so popular. As he vacillates on tax hikes for the rich, 59 percent of voters surveyed said they favor increasing the marginal tax rate on the highest-income Americans to 70 percent — including 60 percent of independent voters, 57 percent of Southern voters and 56 percent of rural voters."}
{"original": "If there were a large constituency for what he is offering, his easiest path to the White House would run through a major political party. No third-party candidate has ever won the presidency, and only an ego fueled by enormous amounts of money is capable of believing that will change in 2020."}
{"original": "The Schultz trial balloon is ultimately a sign of the elite center flailing to maintain its grasp on power in the populist world shaped by the 2008 financial crisis. Ask Emmanuel Macron."}

{"original": "Pienaar's Politics On Radio 5Live, Sir Keir Starmer repeated the point he made on Marr that Labour would not necessarily pull the UK out of the customs union after Brexit. Let's take the question of the customs union. There's a lot of anxiety in the business community about stepping outside the customs union because it creates so many difficulties. And that's why we've said it's an option that should be left on the table. The question of whether in the end we stay in the customs union is one that we need to address when we get to the end of the negotiating process because it will depend on what level of access we've got to the Single Market. The question then will be is it better to have freedom to strike new deals across the world or are we better off staying with deals that are struck by the EU. That is something that at the moment we can't answer. That is why we've said look at the outcomes, leave options on the table. That's a perfectly sensible negotiating strategy. London Minister Greg Hands also appeared, and repeated most of what he said on Ridge, although he was pushed more on why Grenfell Tower residents' complaints were ignored. John Pienaar: Whether consciously or unconsciously there is an unfairness there because if your better off, if you've got more money, maybe a bit more education, you know to organise yourself, you know how to complain and have the complaints heard."}
{"original": "If the complaints aren't heard you can just hire a lawyer and they'll put the pressure on and just get things done. That is a fact isn't it Greg? Greg Hands: Well I think the public inquiry will look at the specific aspects of the complaints that were made in Grenfell Tower. But in general experience, my experience of local Government and central Government is that people in general respond well. Whether it be local authorities, whether it be members of parliament, whether it be GLA members, councillors and so on there is a lot of very committed people in London to making sure that people lead their lives as well as they can. John Pienaar: Obviously on the case of Grenfell Tower no one would have wanted to see a horror like this. But there were complaints and they weren't listened to. Greg Hands: Well I think we will have to look at the role of the tenant management organisation (Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation). You've got to remember this is an organisation set up with the very best of motives twenty or more years ago as a way of tenant's managing their own estate. That was the principle behind the tenant management organisation, with the noblest of principle. We will have to see how that worked out in practice and the responses from the landlord – the KCTMO – in this case. That will be clearly part of the public inquiry."}

{"original": "But it may have broad public support, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that found nearly two-thirds of respondents agree that the very rich should pay more."}
{"original": "Among the 4,441 respondents to the poll, 64% strongly or somewhat agreed that the very rich should contribute an extra share of their total wealth each year to support public programs - the essence of a wealth tax. Results were similar across gender, race and household income. While support among Democrats was stronger, at 77%, a majority of Republicans, 53%,also agreed with the idea."}
{"original": "A wealth tax is levied on an individual's net worth, such as stocks, bonds and real estate, as well as cash holdings, similar in concept to property taxes. It is separate from an income tax, which applies to wages, interest and dividends, among other sources."}
{"original": "Asked in the poll if the very rich should be allowed tokeep the money they have, even if that means increasinginequality, 54% of respondents disagreed."}
{"original": "Rich people have a right to blow their money on Lamborghinis and world-wide cruises or whatever, said EsinZimmerman, 53, a lifelong Republican from Madison, Minnesota, who wants higher taxes for the wealthy. But that money could be used in other ways that help people."}

{"original": "The results may reflect how the economic changes of the pastroughly 20 years, from globalization to the financial crisis,have shaped attitudes about economic policy."}
{"original": "According to polling by Gallup, concerns about the rich paying too little actually declined through the 1990s and early 2000s, a relative boom period for the United States."}
{"original": "But the concerns have been climbing since the crisis years of 2007 to 2009, from 55% to more than 60% as of 2016 The Reuters/Ipsos results suggested even stronger support for an annual levy on total wealth, not just income.Warren and Sanders have touted the idea as a way to help pay for major social programs like Medicare for All and to reverse a stark rise in the share of wealth owned by the very richest Americans, known as the 1 percent."}
{"original": "The poll also points to changing attitudes toward basic ideas such as keeping what you earn."}
{"original": "That notion, central to a winner-take-all brand of capitalism, got mixed reviews. While 56% of Republicans agreed the very rich should keep what they have regardless of the impact on inequality, 35% of Republicans disagreed with the statement, as did 71% of Democrats."}

{"original": "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposal to tax the wealth of the country's super-rich has met with elation from the political left, which has long pressed Democrats for more ambitious plans to curb economic inequality."}
{"original": "I still think guillotines might be more efficient, but a wealth tax is a decent alternative, deadpanned Alex Lawson, executive director of the nonprofit Social Security Works, who emphasized that he was joking."}
{"original": "It's a very exciting and interesting idea in terms of how we talk about wealth inequality, said Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America who has vocally argued for higher taxation on the rich."}
{"original": "Warren, who hopes to secure the Democratic nomination for president, announced Thursday that she would levy a 2 percent tax on assets over $50 million and a 3 percent tax on assets over $1 billion. Ocasio-Cortez shook up the national tax debate weeks ago with her call, in an interview on CBS' 60 Minutes, to subject income over $10 million to a 70 percent marginal tax rate."}
{"original": "In the 60 Minutes interview, Ocasio-Cortez referred to earnings above the $10 million threshold as the tippy-top ― language Warren borrowed when promoting her own plan on Twitter."}
{"original": "The ultra-rich have rigged our economy & rigged our tax rules. We need structural change. That's why I'm proposing something brand-new: An annual wealth tax on the tippy-top 0.1%. We'd get $3 trillion in new revenue to invest in rebuilding the middle-class. Let's make it happen. pic.twitter.com/B0ImiSTxez — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 25, 2019"}
{"original": "Now Ocasio-Cortez's grassroots allies, including the group Justice Democrats, which played a pivotal role in Ocasio-Cortez's victory in her June primary, are praising Warren's addition to the tax debate as the Massachusetts senator's presidential campaign ramps up. (Justice Democrats has not yet endorsed in the race.)"}
{"original": "The wealth tax is exactly the kind of populist policy America needs as we face systemic crises around climate change, inequality, and structural racism, said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats."}
{"original": "The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Warren's presidential candidacy almost the moment she announced it on Dec. 31, also gushed about the wealth tax."}
{"original": "A wealth tax on the richest heirs, heiresses, mega-millionaires, and billionaires would create trillions of dollars that could be used on priorities like expanding Medicare and Social Security benefits, letting students graduate public college without debt, free child care, and creating millions of jobs through a Green New Deal, said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the PCCC."}
{"original": "I'm glad that Elizabeth Warren is stepping up to the plate. Winnie Wong, co-founder, People for Bernie Sanders"}
{"original": "Warren's plan, developed by the Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, is projected to raise $2.75 trillion in revenue from just 75,000 families over a 10-year period if implemented. In their analysis, Zucman and Saez assume that wealthy households will respond to the changes by reducing their taxable net worth by about 15 percent."}
{"original": "Perhaps more importantly, Warren's plan aims to narrow economic inequality by limiting the accumulation of concentrated wealth at the tippy-top of the earnings spectrum."}
{"original": "In an email to HuffPost, Zucman described the tax as the right answer to the dramatic increase in inequality ― the defining challenge of our time."}
{"original": "A key innovation of the wealth tax is its extension beyond the income of wealthy individuals, whether in wages or investments, to the assets they accumulate over time."}
{"original": "Saez and fellow French economist Thomas Piketty conducted the formative research demonstrating that the accumulation of asset wealth plays a significantly greater role than annual income in the concentration of money in the hands of a few."}
{"original": "In Piketty's best-selling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, he entertains the idea of imposing a 1 percent tax on net worths of $1.3 to $6.5 million, and a 2 percent tax on those of $6.5 million or more."}
{"original": "Piketty told HuffPost that Warren's proposed wealth tax would not only help curb inequality and ultimately promote growth in the U.S., but also have a major impact all around the world."}
{"original": "Warren's plan is not entirely unprecedented in recent U.S. politics. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) listed a 1 percent tax on household wealth above $21 million as one of several potential financing options for the Medicare for all legislation he rolled out in September 2017."}
{"original": "Sanders' office declined to comment on Warren's proposal. (Sanders is reportedly still mulling a 2020 presidential bid.)"}
{"original": "Winnie Wong, a co-founder of the grassroots group People for Bernie Sanders, offered qualified praise for the proposal."}
{"original": "I'm glad that Elizabeth Warren is stepping up to the plate. It's good for the national narrative, but she's following in the footsteps of Bernie Sanders and [Ocasio-Cortez], she said."}
{"original": "Progressive economists have mostly applauded Warren's wealth tax. In an op-ed in The Washington Post, former Obama administration economist Jared Bernstein called it a smart idea whose time has come."}
{"original": "Stephanie Kelton, a Stony Brook University economist who advised Sanders' 2016 presidential run, lamented merely that the wealth tax should be larger in the interest of curbing billionaires' wealth even more. She noted that when Donald Trump flirted with a third-party presidential run in 1999, he proposed a one-time wealth tax of 14.25 percent."}
{"original": "The only way this works is if the tax rate is greater than the rate of asset growth, Kelton said, though she acknowledged that coming in with a number that's a bit more modest may feel a bit safer."}
{"original": "Dan Alpert, a fellow at the liberal Century Foundation, said that every progressive bone in his body nudged him toward supporting the wealth tax, but he was concerned about its effects on investment and access to credit. He instead supports subjecting capital gains ― that is, profit made on the sale of a financial asset ― to the higher rates in effect for traditional income."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Alpert's objections to the wealth tax pale in comparison to those of Republicans and their amplifiers in the conservative media."}
{"original": "To fit in with the Democrats' ever-increasing race to the left, Elizabeth Warren has proposed yet another tax increase ― one that is potentially unconstitutional ― to pay for her wildly expensive policy agenda, said RNC spokesperson Mandi Merritt. When are Democrats going to learn, raising taxes and expanding government is never the answer?"}
{"original": "On Fox News' morning talk show Fox and Friends, the co-hosts suggested Friday that Warren's tax ― and other proposals to redistribute wealth promoted by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) on Thursday ― risk pushing the United States toward the economic and social disarray of Venezuela, which is run by a nominally socialist authoritarian government."}
{"original": "After briefly describing Warren's proposal, the Fox News co-hosts played a clip of de Blasio speaking to the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Thursday, where he said there is plenty of money in the world, but it's just in the wrong hands."}
{"original": "Ed Henry, one of the co-hosts, compared the policies backed by de Blasio, and by extension Warren, to those enacted in Venezuela, where the government nationalized entire industries."}
{"original": "What he's saying is, 'The money's in the wrong hands, so we're gonna take it out of those hands and we're gonna redistribute it,' which is what they tried to do in Venezuela ― basically, Henry said."}
{"original": "This article has been updated with comments from Piketty."}
{"original": "So how's your day going? asked the post office lady as I bought some colorful Cook Islands postage stamps (I'm very analog and love sending post cards on my travels rather than posting to Facebook)."}
{"original": "Funny thing was, the way she asked I had a feeling that she would have lent an ear were I interested in sharing the details of my day, which by the way had gone splendidly. I was in the Cook Islands, after all."}
{"original": "When you ask a Cook Islander what the one reaction visitors have when visiting here, they invariably answer the people are so friendly. Of course, the Cooks have the sun and sand and aqua waters you've always associated with the South Pacific, as do Tahiti and Fiji. But there are several ways the Cooks stand out from those other destinations."}
{"original": "First, it's the cheapest destination to reach by air. Air New Zealand flies here every Saturday on a Boeing 777, a 9- or 10-hour nonstop flight from Los Angeles, and frequently offers airfares around $899 round-trip, or even less with their occasional $400 off coupon codes, which bring the price down to a ridiculous $499-$598 round-trip (the country subsidizes the flights if you're wondering. Airfare to other South Pacific hot spots are usually $1200 round-trip or more)."}
{"original": "Second, the main island, Roratonga, with its large lagoon, is a continuous land mass. Whereas your resort on Fiji or Tahiti might be isolated on its own island, the ones here are all on the same island so you can easily explore different resorts, restaurants, and attractions. The small airport is just a few minutes drive from most resorts. Once you land, you're there."}
{"original": "There are no high-rises, no chain stores, no McDonald's, not even a stop light. This is, as they say, Hawaii like it was 50 years ago."}
{"original": "When to visit: November to April is rainy season, so resort prices are lower, and November to March is cyclone season, although the country hasn't had a serious storm in several years, and July to October is whale season during which cavorting whales and their offspring are visible from the shore."}
{"original": "Things to do: Take a sunset cocktail cruise on the lagoon. Several resorts offer these."}
{"original": "Visit the Whale and Wildlife Centre and Cafe. Ask them to let you feed a minnow to their resident rock fish and enjoy some excellent coffee in the cafe."}
{"original": "Take a Tik-E electric tuk-tuk tour with Karl Jackson, a New Zealander expat. Anything you ever wanted to know about the Cooks will be revealed."}
{"original": "Attend a Sunday church service: Sunday services are colorful events when women sport elaborate Polynesian head dresses and the choirs are uplifting."}
{"original": "Take a BBQ lagoon cruise with Kia Orana Cruises and enjoy just-caught charcoal-grilled fish and other treats while you visit empty, white sand beaches and snorkel among the reefs. Unlike some of the lagoon cruises here, this one accommodates just eight guests so it's much more manageable and intimate. $125 per person or $800 for a private charter up to eight people."}
{"original": "Obviously, snorkeling and diving are popular here. The Dive Centre in Aroda is the place to go. Also of note: Cross-island treks, Jungle Quad Tours with Coconut Tours, and the Te Vara Nui Village with its Legends of Tongaiti show featuring the islands' finest dancers and musicians."}
{"original": "Connectivity: This is an interesting aspect of any visit to the Cooks, and there's good news and bad news. There is no such thing as free WiFi here because all data is transmitted by satellite rather than less expensive undersea fibre optic cables and there's only one provider. Check rates at bluesky.co.ck (100 megabytes start at NZ$10, or 20 cents per megabyte). The good news: while you can get online if you must, you end up asking yourself how much it's worth it to pay to sort through email and read all the depressing news from back home. Instead of Facebooking or Insta-bragging your trip, send a postcard. Postage back to North America is about 70 cents. Or read a book and relax on the talcum-powder-sand beaches. Costly internet connection rearranges your thinking about what's really important."}
{"original": "Cuisine: There are over 50 cafes and restaurants on Roratonga, operated both by the native-born and New Zealand expats. Fish and other seafood are the thing to have here. You eat what was caught that day."}
{"original": "Reserve dinner at Tupuna's Restaurant for fresh coconut crab and the creamiest, most decadent cheese cake you will ever taste. Moorings Cafe offers fresh fish sandwiches and addictive smoothies. If you think you don't like fish, it may be because you haven't eaten it here."}
{"original": "One word to know: kia orana. It means hello, may you live long, and many other things."}
{"original": "Getting around the island: many resorts offer shuttle service, and you can rent cars and mopeds (drive on the left). A public bus circumvents Roratonga every 30 minutes and costs NZD$5 per ride, $30 for ten rides, or $16 for an all day hop on, hop off pass."}
{"original": "Where to stay: The three most luxurious resorts, on Roratonga, according to TripAdvisor.com, are Rumours, Te Manava (13 self-catering villas) and the recently-opened Nautilus with 20 stylish villas and apartment units. There's no government tax on rooms (yet), however resorts add a surcharge to use credit cards (typically four percent). On Aitutaki, the other most-visited island,the 27-room Pacific Resort is the place to stay."}
{"original": "Shopping: Stores close around 4 p.m. Monday to Friday and noon on Saturday. Everything is closed on Sunday. Jewelry designed from highly polished shells, carved by local artisans, make a beautiful gift."}
{"original": "Excursions: A 50-minute flight to Aitutaki, the other major island in the Cooks, is a popular option. All resorts here are beachfront or waterfront. There are many other smaller islands to explore, but without scheduled air service."}
{"original": "Etiquette: don't be surprised if you're greeted with a kiss on the cheek instead of a handshake, even on a first meeting. These people really are friendly! People speak their minds, even to strangers."}
{"original": "Currency: the New Zealand dollar (currently equal to 69 cents U.S.)"}
{"original": "Interesting fact: the country will most likely be the first to run on 100% renewable energy. The current plan is that it will happen by 2020, although the Prime Minister assured me that it will happen before then."}
{"original": "Jonathan Ernst / Reuters President-elect Joe Biden jokingly thanks Georgia for certifying his victory three times as he campaigns on behalf of Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in Atlanta on Monday."}
{"original": "The Democratic sweep in Tuesday's Georgia Senate runoff probably won't alter much of the incoming Biden administration's reform agenda. Progressive hopes for everything from action on climate change to judicial reform remain limited, if not nonexistent. Even without the pandemic, the country and the world are marching steadily toward various modes of destruction."}
{"original": "But claiming the Senate majority does offer Democrats some reasonable grounds for optimism, should the clear electoral indications from Tuesday hold. For the next two years, at least, President-elect Joe Biden's party will be able to control what bills receive votes and when. Most importantly, Democrats will have much greater influence over the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic and the economic support that must go hand-in-hand with national public health efforts."}
{"original": "Given the failed federal response to COVID-19 so far, that can only mean improvement. On public health, the record is one of unmitigated disaster. Where South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, Singapore and other places swiftly implemented effective measures to avert both mass death and economic calamity, the United States has been an uncoordinated and morally callous disgrace."}
{"original": "Some of the trouble has been bipartisan ― plenty of states with Democratic governors pursued premature reopenings over the summer and have struggled with testing and now vaccinations. Some of it is the result of decades of economic non-policy that left the United States uniquely vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. But it is hard to imagine that Biden could do worse than the Trump administration's raving, dishonest incompetence."}
{"original": "That the federal government blew the pandemic response is, outside QAnon fantasy forums, uncontroversial. Less well-understood is the way federal economic mismanagement has contributed to the public health problem."}
{"original": "Congress badly misjudged the nature and scope of the coronavirus crisis with the CARES Act, and then took six months to assemble a fiscal Band-Aid for its mistakes."}
{"original": "The flagship coronavirus legislation was the CARES Act, passed in late March with a unanimous Senate vote. Conventional wisdom in Washington regards the law as a smashing success. Even the chronically malcontent left has cheered the CARES Act for temporarily boosting unemployment benefits by $600 a week ― a level that put modest upward pressure on wages, since some workers found themselves better off financially after losing their jobs. Generous provisions for big business prevented a financial panic, and though clumsy, the hundreds of billions of dollars allocated to support small businesses did not go to waste."}
{"original": "All of this is true, but the verdict of success is misplaced. Congress badly misjudged the nature and scope of the coronavirus crisis with the CARES Act, and then took six months to assemble a fiscal Band-Aid for its mistakes. By the time Congress finally passed an eleventh-hour re-up on some of the law's provisions, 1 out of every 6 American families with children were going hungry. And what they passed was a paltry influx of cash ― far short of the $2,000 per person that Democrats, and even Trump, called for."}
{"original": "Democratic lawmakers recognized the inadequacy of their efforts back in the spring. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) began referring to phases of the legislative response ― CARES was Phase Three (Congress, it turns out, had actually passed two previous phases of relief so negligible as to have already been forgotten). When the next bill merely topped-up an almost instantly exhausted small business relief program, lawmakers changed Phase Four to Phase Three-and-a-Half. And when no further relief came from Washington for several more months, Pelosi stopped talking about phases."}
{"original": "The more robust unemployment provisions of the CARES Act expired in July. Its $350 billion in small business aid drained in two weeks, and 60% of the $310 billion top-up was gone within two weeks of Phase-Three-and-a-Half's passage."}
{"original": "Worst of all, however, was the lack of concern for state and local governments. Back in July, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank, estimated that the coronavirus crash would create state government budget shortfalls of about $555 billion ― a figure that would increase substantially if local and tribal governments were included in the calculation. The CARES Act included just $150 billion in state and local government relief."}
{"original": "This guaranteed a large round of unnecessary layoffs for teachers, firefighters and other public servants. But it also encouraged disastrous pandemic policies. In order to boost tax revenue to balance state budgets, governors encouraged reckless reopening strategies, hoping to get money to local businesses that would make their way to state coffers. The results for state budgets were disappointing, but more importantly, they encouraged the spread of a deadly virus."}
{"original": "It is time for a big, multitrillion-dollar economic relief package ― for the sake of American families and public health. The results of the Georgia runoff make that kind of legislation much more plausible."}
{"original": "The fresh $900 billion in relief Congress passed last month includes a welcome $300 per week boost to federal unemployment benefits ― half that of CARES, and set to expire on March 14 ― along with a $600 per person check for households making less than $75,000 a year."}
{"original": "It isn't nothing, but once again, it is inadequate given the scope of the crisis."}
{"original": "The legislation includes no funds for state and local governments, and according to economists Mark Paul and Adam Hersh, is at least $2.1 trillion short of what the economy needs to return to pre-pandemic health. Paul and Hersh assume that government spending is about or a little more efficient at boosting economic growth than its direct outlays ― payments are spent on other activity, which in turn encourages more activity."}
{"original": "But the Congressional Budget Office has been much more conservative about the efficacy of government spending during the pandemic, assuming that only a fraction of every federal dollar will actually result in economic output. Based on the CBO's more cautious estimates, the latest stimulus legislation is a stunning $6.8 trillion short of February 2020."}
{"original": "The CBO is probably wrong; Paul and Hersh are probably right. And in a $21-plus trillion economy, a gap of a couple trillion isn't really that big. It's only big in the minds of members of Congress, who feel uncomfortable about spending money, even when every economic indicator says they should spend much, much more."}
{"original": "Regardless of exactly how much needs to be spent, there is simply no economic indicator that suggests the United States government is anywhere close to overspending or over-indebtedness."}
{"original": "Interest rates remain at or near historic lows and the Federal Reserve has a bevy of actions it can take should they rise. Inflation sits at just 1.2%, well below the Fed's target rate of above 2%."}
{"original": "In short, it is time for a big, multitrillion-dollar economic relief package ― for the sake of American families and public health. The results of the Georgia runoff make that kind of legislation much more plausible."}
{"original": "Barring a bizarre-but-not-mathematically-impossible shift in the Georgia vote tallies, These fiscal decisions will be in the hands of Democrats. Key tax and spending decisions are not subject to the filibuster ― a simple majority will do, and Democrats will now have the simplest of majorities to do so."}
{"original": "When the coronavirus forced churches to close their doors and give up Sunday collections, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte turned to the federal government's signature small business relief program for more than $8 million."}
{"original": "The diocese's headquarters, churches and schools landed the help even though they had roughly $100 million of their own cash and short-term investments available last spring, financial records show. When the cash catastrophe church leaders feared didn't materialize, those assets topped $110 million by the summer."}
{"original": "I am gratified to report the overall good financial health of the diocese despite the many difficulties presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, Bishop Peter Jugis wrote in the diocese's audited financial report released last fall."}
{"original": "As the pandemic began to unfold, scores of Catholic dioceses across the U.S. received aid through the Paycheck Protection Program while sitting on well over $10 billion in cash, short-term investments or other available funds, an Associated Press investigation has found. And despite the broad economic downturn, these assets have grown in many dioceses."}
{"original": "Yet even with that financial safety net, the 112 dioceses that shared their financial statements, along with the churches and schools they oversee, collected at least $1.5 billion in taxpayer-backed aid. A majority of these dioceses reported enough money on hand to cover at least six months of operating expenses, even without any new income."}
{"original": "The financial resources of several dioceses rivaled or exceeded those available to publicly traded companies like Shake Shack and Ruth's Chris Steak House, whose early participation in the program triggered outrage. Federal officials responded by emphasizing the money was intended for those who lacked the cushion that cash and other liquidity provide. Many corporations returned the funds."}
{"original": "Overall, the nation's nearly 200 dioceses, where bishops and cardinals govern, and other Catholic institutions received at least $3 billion. That makes the Roman Catholic Church perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the paycheck program, according to AP's analysis of data the U.S. Small Business Administration released following a public-records lawsuit by news organizations. The agency for months had shared only partial information, making a more precise analysis impossible."}
{"original": "Already one of the largest federal aid efforts ever, the SBA reopened the Paycheck Protection Program last month with a new infusion of nearly $300 billion. In making the announcement, the agency's administrator at the time, Jovita Carranza, hailed the program for serving as an economic lifeline to millions of small businesses."}
{"original": "Church officials have said their employees were as worthy of help as workers at Main Street businesses, and that without it they would have had to slash jobs and curtail their charitable mission as demand for food pantries and social services spiked. They point out the program's rules didn't require them to exhaust their stores of cash and other funds before applying."}
{"original": "But new financial statements several dozen dioceses have posted for 2020 show that their available resources remained robust or improved during the pandemic's hard, early months. The pattern held whether a diocese was big or small, urban or rural, East or West, North or South."}
{"original": "(AP Photo/Allen G. Breed) This Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2021, photo shows the Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral in Raleigh, N.C. The Raleigh Diocese collected at least $11 million from the federal government's small business emergency relief program."}
{"original": "In Kentucky, funds available to the Archdiocese of Louisville, its parishes and other organizations grew from at least $153 million to $157 million during the fiscal year that ended in June, AP found. Those same offices and organizations received at least $17 million in paycheck money. The Archdiocese's operations have not been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak, according to its financial statement."}
{"original": "In Illinois, the Archdiocese of Chicago had more than $1 billion in cash and investments in its headquarters and cemetery division as of May, while the faithful continued to donate more than expected, according to a review by the independent ratings agency Moody's Investors Service. Chicago's parishes, schools and ministries accumulated at least $77 million in paycheck protection funds."}
{"original": "Up the interstate from Charlotte in North Carolina, the Raleigh Diocese collected at least $11 million in aid. Yet during the fiscal year that ended in June, overall offerings were down just 5% and the assets available to the diocese, its parishes and schools increased by about $21 million to more than $170 million, AP found. In another measure of fiscal health, the diocese didn't make an emergency draw on its $10 million line of credit."}
{"original": "Catholic leaders in dioceses including Charlotte, Chicago, Louisville and Raleigh said their parishes and schools, like many other businesses and nonprofits, suffered financially when they closed to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus."}
{"original": "Some dioceses reported that their hardest-hit churches saw income drop by 40% or more before donations began to rebound months later, and schools took hits when fundraisers were canceled and families had trouble paying tuition. As revenues fell, dioceses said, wage cuts and a few dozen layoffs were necessary in some offices."}

{"original": "Catholic researchers at Georgetown University who surveyed the nation's bishops last summer found such measures weren't frequent. In comparison, a survey by the investment bank Goldman Sachs found 42% of small business owners had cut staff or salaries, and that 33% had spent their personal savings to stay open."}
{"original": "Church leaders have questioned why AP focused on their faith following a story last July, when New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan wrote that reporters invented a story when none existed and sought to bash the Church."}
{"original": "By using a special exemption that the church lobbied to include in the paycheck program, Catholic entities amassed at least $3 billion — roughly the same as the combined total of recipients from the other faiths that rounded out the top five, AP found. Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist and Jewish faith-based recipients also totaled at least $3 billion. Catholics account for about a fifth of the U.S. religious population while members of Protestant and Jewish denominations are nearly half, according to the Pew Research Center."}
{"original": "Catholic institutions also received many times more than other major nonprofits with charitable missions and national reach, such as the United Way, Goodwill Industries and Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Overall, Catholic recipients got roughly twice as much as 40 of the largest, most well-known charities in America combined, AP found."}
{"original": "The complete picture is certainly even more lopsided. So many Catholic entities received help that reporters could not identify them all, even after spending hundreds of hours hand-checking tens of thousands of records in federal data."}
{"original": "The Vatican referred questions about the paycheck program to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which said it does not speak on behalf of dioceses."}
{"original": "Presented with AP's findings, bishops conference spokeswoman Chieko Noguchi responded with a broad statement that the Paycheck Protection Program was designed to protect the jobs of Americans from all walks of life, regardless of whether they work for for-profit or nonprofit employers, faith-based or secular."}

{"original": "The AP's assessment of church finances is among the most comprehensive to date. It draws largely from audited financial statements posted online by the central offices of 112 of the country's nearly 200 dioceses."}
{"original": "The church isn't required to share its financials. As a result, the analysis doesn't include cash, short-term assets and lines of credit held by some of the largest dioceses, including those serving New York City and other major metropolitan areas."}
{"original": "The analysis focused on available assets because federal officials cited those metrics when clarifying eligibility for the paycheck program. Therefore, the $10 billion AP identified doesn't count important financial pillars of the U.S. church. Among those are its thousands of real estate properties and most of the funds that parishes and schools hold. Also excluded is the money — estimated at $9.5 billion in a 2019 study by the Delaware-based wealth management firm Wilmington Trust — held by charitable foundations created to help dioceses oversee donations."}
{"original": "In addition, dioceses can rely on a well-funded support system that includes help from wealthier dioceses, the bishops conference and other Catholic organizations. Canon law, the legal code the Vatican uses to govern the global church, notes that richer dioceses may assist poorer ones, and the AP found instances where they did."}
{"original": "In their financial statements, the 112 dioceses acknowledged having at least $4.5 billion in liquid or otherwise available assets. To reach its $10 billion total, AP also included funding that dioceses had opted to designate for special projects instead of general expenses; excess cash that parishes and their affiliates deposit with their diocese's savings and loan; and lines of credit dioceses typically have with outside banks."}
{"original": "Some church officials said AP was misreading their financial books and therefore overstating available assets. They insisted that money their bishop or his advisers had set aside for special projects couldn't be repurposed during an emergency, although financial statements posted by multiple dioceses stated the opposite."}
{"original": "For its analysis, AP consulted experts in church finance and church law. One was the Rev. James Connell, an accountant for 15 years before joining the priesthood and becoming an administrator in the Milwaukee Archdiocese. Connell, also a canon lawyer who is now retired from his position with the archdiocese, said AP's findings convinced him that Catholic entities did not need government aid — especially when thousands of small businesses were permanently closing."}
{"original": "Was it want or need? Connell asked. Need must be present, not simply the want. Justice and love of neighbor must include the common good."}
{"original": "Connell was not alone among the faithful concerned by the church's pursuit of taxpayer money. Parishioners in several cities have questioned church leaders who received government money for Catholic schools they then closed."}
{"original": "Elsewhere, a pastor in a Western state told AP that he refused to apply even after diocesan officials repeatedly pressed him. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of his diocese's policy against talking to reporters and concerns about possible retaliation."}
{"original": "The pastor had been saving, much like leaders of other parishes. When the pandemic hit, he used that money, trimmed expenses and told his diocese's central finance office that he had no plans to seek the aid. Administrators followed up several times, the pastor said, with one high-ranking official questioning why he was leaving free money on the table."}
{"original": "The pastor said he felt a sound moral conviction that the money was meant more for shops and restaurants that, without it, might close forever."}
{"original": "As the weeks passed last spring, the pastor said his church managed just fine. Parishioners were so happy with new online Masses and his other outreach initiatives, he said, they boosted their contributions beyond 2019 levels."}
{"original": "We didn't need it, the pastor said, and intentionally wanted to leave the money for those small business owners who did."}

{"original": "Months after the pandemic first walloped the economy, the 112 dioceses that release financial statements began sharing updates. Among the 47 dioceses that have thus far, the pandemic's impact was far from crippling."}
{"original": "The 47 dioceses that have posted financials for the fiscal year that ended in June had a median 6% increase in the amount of cash, short-term investments and other funds that they and their affiliates could use for unanticipated or general expenses, AP found. In all, 38 dioceses grew those resources, while nine reported declines."}
{"original": "Finances in Raleigh and 10 other dioceses that took government assistance were stable enough that they did not have to dip into millions they had available through outside lines of credit."}
{"original": "This crisis has tested us, Russell Elmayan, Raleigh's chief financial officer, told the diocese's magazine website in July, but we are hopeful that the business acumen of our staff and lay counselors, together with the strategic financial reserves built over time, will help our parishes and schools continue to weather this unprecedented event. Raleigh officials did not answer direct questions from AP."}
{"original": "The 47 dioceses acknowledged a smaller amount of readily available assets than AP counted, though by their own accounting that grew as well."}
{"original": "The improving financial outlook is due primarily to parishioners who found ways to continue donating and U.S. stock markets that were rebounding to new highs. But when the markets were first plunging, officials in several dioceses said, they had to stretch available assets because few experts were forecasting a rapid recovery."}
{"original": "In Louisville, Charlotte and other dioceses, church leaders said they offered loans or grants to needy parishes and schools, or offset the monthly charges they assess their parishes. In Raleigh, for example, the headquarters used $3 million it had set aside for liability insurance and also tapped its internal deposit and loan fund."}
{"original": "Church officials added that the pandemic's full toll will probably be seen in a year or two, because some key sources of revenue are calculated based on income that parishes and schools generate."}
{"original": "We believe that we will not know all of the long-term negative impacts on parish, school and archdiocesan finances for some time, Louisville Archdiocese spokeswoman Cecelia Price wrote in response to questions."}
{"original": "At the nine dioceses that recorded declines in liquid or other short-term assets, the drops typically were less than 10%, and not always clearly tied to the pandemic."}
{"original": "The financial wherewithal of some larger dioceses is underscored by the fact that, like publicly traded companies, they can raise capital by selling bonds to investors."}
{"original": "One was Chicago, where analysts with the Moody's ratings agency calculated that the $1 billion in cash and investments held by the archdiocese headquarters and cemeteries division could cover about 631 days of operating expenses."}
{"original": "Church officials in Chicago asserted that those dollars were needed to cover substantial expenses while parishioner donations slumped. Without paycheck support, parishes and schools would have been forced to cut many jobs, as the archdiocese, given its liabilities, could not have closed such a funding gap, spokeswoman Paula Waters wrote."}
{"original": "Moody's noted in its May report that while giving was down, federal aid had compensated for that and helped leave the archdiocese well positioned to weather this revenue loss over the next several months. Among the reasons for the optimism: a unique credit strength that under church law allows the archbishop to tax parish revenue virtually at will."}
{"original": "(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Clergy attend a funeral Mass inside the St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans, Thursday, Oct. 6, 2011. The New Orleans archdiocese, along with its parishes and schools, collected more than $26 million in paycheck money."}
{"original": "In a separate Moody's report on New Orleans, which filed for bankruptcy in May while facing multiple clergy abuse lawsuits, the ratings agency wrote in July that the archdiocese did so while having significant financial reserves, with spendable cash and investments of over $160 million."}
{"original": "Moody's said the archdiocese's very good liquid assets would let it operate 336 days without additional income. Those assets prompted clergy abuse victims to ask a federal judge to dismiss the bankruptcy filing, arguing the archdiocese's primary reason for seeking the legal protection was to minimize payouts to them."}
{"original": "The archdiocese, along with its parishes and schools, collected more than $26 million in paycheck money. New Orleans Archdiocesan officials didn't respond to written questions."}
{"original": "Without special treatment, the Catholic Church would not have received nearly so much under the Paycheck Protection Program."}
{"original": "After Congress let nonprofits and religious organizations participate in the first place, Catholic officials lobbied the Trump Administration for a second break. Religious organizations were freed from the so-called affiliation rule that typically disqualifies applicants with more than 500 workers."}
{"original": "Without that break, many dioceses would have missed out because — between their head offices, parishes, schools and other affiliates — their employee count would exceed the limit."}
{"original": "Among those lobbying, federal records show, was the Los Angeles Archdiocese. Parishes, schools and ministries there collected at least $80 million in paycheck aid, at a time when the headquarters reported $658 million in available funds heading into the fiscal year when the coronavirus arrived."}
{"original": "Catholic officials in the U.S. needed the special exception for at least two reasons."}
{"original": "Church law says dioceses, parishes and schools are affiliated, something the Los Angeles Archdiocese acknowledged proved to be an obstacle to receiving funds because its parishes operate under the authority of the diocesan bishop. Dioceses, parishes, schools and other Catholic entities also routinely assert to the Internal Revenue Service that they are affiliated so they can maintain their federal income tax exemption."}
{"original": "While some Catholic officials insisted their affiliates are separate and financially independent, AP found many instances of borrowing and spending among them when dioceses were faced with prior cash crunches. In Philadelphia, for example, the archdiocese received at least $18 million from three affiliates, including a seminary, to fund a compensation program for clergy sex abuse survivors, according to 2019 financial statements."}
{"original": "Cardinals and bishops have broad authority over parishes and the pastors who run them. Church law requires parishes to submit annual financial reports and bishops may require parishes to deposit surplus money with internal banks administered by the diocese."}
{"original": "The parishioners cannot hire or fire the pastor; that is for the bishop to do, said Connell, the priest, former accountant and canon lawyer. Each parish functions as a wholly owned subsidiary or division of a larger corporation, the diocese."}
{"original": "Bishops acknowledged a concerted effort to tap paycheck funds in a survey by Catholic researchers at Georgetown University. When asked what they had done to address the pandemic's financial fallout, 95% said their central offices helped parishes apply for paycheck and other aid — the leading response. That topped encouraging parishioners to donate electronically."}
{"original": "After Congress approved the paycheck program, three high-ranking officials in New Hampshire's Manchester Diocese sent an urgent memo to parishes, schools and affiliated organizations urging them to refrain from layoffs or furloughs until completing their applications. We are all in this together, the memo read, adding that diocesan officials were working expeditiously to provide step by step instructions."}
{"original": "Paycheck Protection Program funds came through low-interest bank loans, worth up to $10 million each, that the federal government would forgive so long as recipients used the money to cover about two months of wages and operating expenses."}
{"original": "After an initial $659 billion last spring, Congress added another $284 billion in December. With the renewal came new requirements intended to ensure that funds go to businesses that lost money due to the pandemic. Lawmakers also downsized the headcount for applicants to 300 or fewer employees."}
{"original": "(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) Catholic Bishops participate in a morning prayer during a meeting of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) in Baltimore, Tuesday, Jun 11, 2019."}
{"original": "In other federal small business loan programs, government help is treated as a last resort."}
{"original": "Applicants must show they couldn't get credit elsewhere. And those with enough available funds must pay more of their own way to reduce taxpayer subsidies."}
{"original": "Congress didn't include these tests in the Paycheck Protection Program. To speed approvals, lenders weren't required to do their usual screening and instead relied on applicants' self-certifications of need."}
{"original": "The looser standards helped create a run on the first $349 billion in paycheck funding. Small business owners complained that they were shut out, yet dozens of companies healthy enough to be traded on stock exchanges scored quick approval."}
{"original": "As blowback built in April, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned at a news briefing that there would be severe consequences for applicants who improperly tapped the program."}
{"original": "We want to make sure this money is available to small businesses that need it, people who have invested their entire life savings, Mnuchin said. Program guidelines evolved to stress that participants with access to significant cash probably could not get the assistance in good faith."}
{"original": "Mnuchin's Treasury Department said it would audit loans exceeding $2 million, although federal officials have not said whether they would hold religious organizations and other nonprofits to the same standard of need as businesses."}
{"original": "The headquarters and major departments for more than 40 dioceses received more than $2 million. Every diocese that responded to questions said it would seek to have the government cover the loans, rather than repay the funds. One diocese receiving a loan over $2 million was Boston. According to the archdiocese's website, its central ministries office received about $3 million, while its parishes and schools collected about $32 million more. The archdiocese — along with its parishes, schools and cemeteries — had roughly $200 million in available funds in June 2019, according to its audited financial report. When that fiscal year ended several months into the pandemic, available funds had increased to roughly $233 million. Nevertheless, spokesman Terrence Donilon cited ongoing economic pressure in saying the archdiocese will seek forgiveness for last year's loans and will apply for additional, new funds during the current round. Beyond its growing available funds, the archdiocese and its affiliates benefit from other sources of funding. The archdiocese's Inspiring Hope campaign, announced in January, has raised at least $150 million. And one of its supporting charities — the Catholic Schools Foundation, where Cardinal Sean O'Malley is board chairman — counted more than $33 million in cash and other funds that could be used for general operations as of the beginning of the 2020 fiscal year, according to its financial statement."}
{"original": "(AP Photo/Bill Sikes) This Friday, Jan. 22, 2021, photo shows the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston. According to the Boston Archdiocese's website, its central ministries office received about $3 million, while its parishes and schools collected about $32 million more from the federal government's small business emergency relief program in 2020."}
{"original": "Despite these resources, the archdiocese closed a half-dozen schools in May and June, often citing revenue losses due to the pandemic. Paycheck protection data show four of those schools collectively were approved for more than $700,000. The shuttered schools included St. Francis of Assisi in Braintree, a middle-class enclave 10 miles south of Boston, which received $210,000. Parents said they felt blindsided by the closure, announced in June as classes ended. It's like a punch to the gut because that was such a home for so many people for so long, said Kate Nedelman Herbst, the mother of two children who attended the elementary school. Along with more than 2,000 other school supporters, Herbst signed a written protest to O'Malley that noted the archdiocese's robust finances. After O'Malley didn't reply, parents appealed to the Vatican, this time underscoring the collection of Paycheck Protection Program money. It is very hard to reconcile the large sums of money raised by the archdiocese in recent years with this wholesale destruction of the church's educational infrastructure, parents wrote. In December, the Vatican turned down their request to overrule O'Malley. Spokesman Donilon said the decision to close the school is not being reconsidered. Today, the three children of Michael Waterman and his wife, Jeanine, are learning at home. And they still can't understand why the archdiocese didn't shift money to help save a school beloved by the faithful."}
{"original": "What angers us, Michael Waterman said, is that we feel like, given the amount of money that the Catholic Church has, they absolutely could have remained open. Contributing to this report were Justin Myers, Randy Herschaft, Rodrique Ngowi, Holbrook Mohr, Jason Dearen and James LaPorta."}

{"original": "Over cocktails the night before my good friend's wedding recently, a fellow rehearsal dinner guest casually asked how long I'd been dating my boyfriend, who was dutifully fetching me a glass of wine at the time."}
{"original": "We met nine years ago, I said. And we've been dating seriously for six."}
{"original": "Immediately, the half-drunk bro grabbed my left hand. No ring? he said, as if it were his place to undermine my long-term relationship with two slurred words and a pitying smirk because (OMG!) I wasn't yet betrothed."}
{"original": "What a fool! his expression said. Poor girl's being strung along by some dude who's never going to pop the question."}
{"original": "For the record, my boyfriend is the opposite of the commitment phobe my naked ring finger might suggest. The man refers to me constantly as his wife — to waiters, customer service representatives, friends, and family — because the word girlfriend sounds ridiculously insufficient to him. Plus, he's definitely proposed on a few occasions (when he was a tad buzzed, maybe, but also because he was maybe serious), and I've always politely declined."}
{"original": "It's not that I'm not madly in love with my boyfriend (I am), or that I don't plan on spending the rest of my life with him (I do). The simple truth is, I give exactly zero fucks about the institution of marriage."}
{"original": "If only I'd responded to that prying guy with some smart, dignified comment that at once put him in his place and established that I don't aspire to be married — ever.* Instead, I faltered over my next few sentences, mangling some version of the response I always give in such situations:"}
{"original": "He keeps proposing, and I just keep saying no…Plus, if we get married, I know someone will force me to have a wedding, and I hate being the center of attention…I'd rather keep the cash than throw a giant party I'd probably want to Houdini from around midnight anyway."}
{"original": "While these statements are an accurate reflection of my feelings on the subject, my claims are never interpreted as honest, probably because I deliver them so damn sheepishly rather than in the empowered way I'd like to. I tend to come off as if I'm justifying my relationship status rather than celebrating it. Why? Maybe because I'm used to fielding the doubt that follows a no-thanks-to-marriage assertion from a 30-something woman who's been dating the same guy for a long-ass time."}
{"original": "No one seems to want to believe that I don't want a ring, let alone a wedding or a marriage."}
{"original": "I understand that society is designed to favor married couples, especially those who choose to raise children. I also know that some women genuinely dream of a fairytale wedding, and while certain aspects of the modern wedding make me squirm with discomfort, I don't blame anyone for aching to toast their coupledom amongst friends and family. I also fully respect and appreciate that some couples marry primarily for financial and/or religious reasons."}
{"original": "All of that said, as half of a happily un married duo, I take issue with the sense of validation people attach to the institution of marriage — as if married couples are necessarily more serious, more committed, or more in love than their unwedded counterparts. Tying the knot doesn't guarantee lasting happiness, and it certainly doesn't protect you from breaking up. What it does is make the process of splitting a whole lot trickier from a logistical standpoint."}
{"original": "Truthfully, at the root of our cultural obsession with marriage, I smell fear and insecurity."}
{"original": "It seems like a lot of people marry to feel safer in their relationship — to procure some degree of certainty that their significant other is less likely to flee when shit gets tough. I'm not suggesting there's anything wrong with that. But aren't long-term couples that forgo the nuptial seal worthy of the same respect?"}
{"original": "No matter how hard it is for me to articulate this to strangers who shame me for checking single on my tax returns six years into a serious relationship:"}
{"original": "I do not need to be married to feel secure in my relationship, and I'm proud of that."}
{"original": "I don't need a license to know in my heart that my boyfriend adores me, or that he's committed to sticking it out. Nine years after locking eyes for the first time, we still crave nothing more than to be in each other's company. We are best friends, playmates, and lovers. We've merged our financial resources and divided all household chores equally. We are each other's most trusted advisors, go-to confidantes, and medical proxies. We know each other's social security numbers and passwords to (almost) every single account. His parents even refer to me as their daughter-in-law without the necessary paperwork."}
{"original": "Shouldn't that be enough? At least, isn't there something super romantic about not seeking more?"}
{"original": "Of course, like any other couple, my boyfriend and I fight occasionally, and we sometimes experience relationship doubts. But we're in it for the long haul. I don't need some higher power to witness him promise forever, or a government official to ratify our commitment. His word is sufficient."}
{"original": "And if he breaks it, guess what? I'll be okay, just like any divorcée."}
{"original": "Maybe I'm a curmudgeon intent on bucking convention because she's incapable of appreciating tradition. Maybe I'm secretly jealous. Or maybe I'm just lucky to be with someone I trust that much — someone whose signature I do not need as proof of his plans to stay with me until death says our time is up."}

{"original": "Freelancers ― a broad category that can include lawyers, writers, IT workers, designers and just about anyone else who works on a per diem or per assignment basis ― may love the freedom that comes from cobbling together a series of jobs and setting their own hours and work pace, but as a group, they don't actually do such a great job of staying on top of their budgets. In fact, according to a poll conducted for QuickBooks by Pollfish in March 2018, 36 percent paid no taxes last year ― some because they didn't earn enough to owe any, and others because they said they didn't know how much they made. Uh, that's not good in either case."}
{"original": "While we're talking about managing finances as a freelancer, let's throw in contract workers, too. One in five American jobs is held by a worker under contract, according to a Marist/NPR poll conducted earlier this year. Contractors are not employees and are generally paid no benefits. So for all those who work for themselves and need a bit of help getting bills paid on time and maybe saving a bit for down the road, here are some ideas:"}
{"original": "Get organized with an app built for freelancers."}
{"original": "As a freelancer, you are not only doing the work that people are paying you to do, you are also running a business ― you. So you need to have a business infrastructure in place. You need an organized way to keep track of assignments, invoice clients for your work and make sure payments are received and recorded."}
{"original": "You also need to know what your business expenses are, including whether you need any special licensing, insurance, supplies, space, equipment, etc. And you, of course, must keep track of it all: when bills are due, what you spent in the course of doing business, etc."}
{"original": "Fortunately, there are plenty of apps out there to help you. Invoicely lets you create, manage and track all of your invoices from a single dashboard. Send or need to sign contracts much? Try Shake."}
{"original": "Hubstaff listed what it calls the best 29 apps for freelancers, and more than a few are purposed on just keeping you focused."}
{"original": "Don't forget about taxes — all of them."}
{"original": "If you are a freelancer, you are considered to be self-employed, and as such, you are required to file an annual income tax return and pay your estimated tax quarterly."}
{"original": "But on top of that, freelancers also must pay a self-employment tax to cover Social Security and the Medicare taxes that would generally be withheld from the pay of salaried wage earners."}
{"original": "Plan for the income ebbs and flows."}
{"original": "Whether you work on movie sets as a production aide or you're a seasonal tax accountant, you must plan for the dry spells. Almost 50 percent of contract workers have income that varies from month to month or seasonally."}
{"original": "The trick to keeping things in balance is to determine what your annual expenses are, and then divide that number by 12. That's the target amount you should be earning each month. In a good month, you may surpass that target, but you understand that a not-so-good month is likely just around the corner — so you set aside money from the good month."}
{"original": "Don't forget to add in a little something extra for emergencies and future purchases. Will you be needing a new car soon? Hope to buy a house one day? Want to go to your cousin's wedding in London in the fall? Financial planners suggest having one month of income tucked away for an emergency fund, plus an additional three to four months' worth of average income in reserve to handle the dips that come with freelancing."}
{"original": "Budgeting with income that fluctuates is harder to do than you think. Financial experts advise that entrepreneurs make it a goal to live on 50 percent of their income."}
{"original": "Freelancing requires discipline. What you make in any given month is not all for immediate consumption."}
{"original": "Don't forget to budget for health care."}
{"original": "The individual mandate that everyone must carry Affordable Care Act-level health insurance or face a fine was repealed, but is still in effect through 2019."}
{"original": "Freelance work, in and of itself, does not provide access to health insurance. The way for the self-employed to obtain health coverage at the moment is either through marriage to or a domestic partnership with someone whose plan will cover them, or by purchasing it through a state health exchange."}
{"original": "As a freelancer, you can also look at various umbrella group policies. Does your college alumni association have a plan you can join? What about the Freelancers Union?"}
{"original": "Remember that even freelancers must retire."}
{"original": "Many freelancers created jobs for themselves when they couldn't find a spot working for a company. For them, freelancing is a way to help pay the bills and may open new doors. In other words, not every freelancer is a starving artist; more than a few are freelancing as a stop-gap measure."}
{"original": "But even those people need to be thinking about their retirement before they fall behind in retirement savings. Consider opening an IRA. Like a 401(k), an IRA provides tax-deferred growth on your investments, meaning the money in an IRA will not be taxed until it is withdrawn. A traditional IRA may also offer tax-deductible contributions for people who don't participate in an employer-sponsored plan."}
{"original": "According to a Harvard study, the percentage of people engaged in alternative work arrangements (freelancers, contractors, on-call workers and temp agency workers) grew from 10.1 percent in 2005 to 15.8 percent in 2015. Economists Alan Krueger and Lawrence Katz found that 94 percent of net jobs created from 2005 to 2015 were these sorts of impermanent jobs."}
{"original": "Delaying retirement savings makes little sense for most people, and even less for people in this increasingly likely income track."}
{"original": "After so many dark months, it is a peculiar relief for the biggest story of the week to be about a gang of online pranksters gaming the stock market."}
{"original": "Over the past several days, a handful of corporate stocks have surged to cartoon-hilarious price levels, as denizens of the website Reddit appear to be deliberately inflating them for fun. Nothing particularly special has happened to send these stocks, which include video game retailer GameStop and movie theater chain AMC, on their starward trajectory. It's rather obviously a game, and the kids are having fun."}
{"original": "Some hedge funds, however, are losing a lot of money, particularly Melvin Capital. With malls closed, a retail business like GameStop seemed like a pretty obvious target for short sellers ― including Melvin, which bet big that the company's stock price would fall. But after ending 2020 at $18.84 per share, GameStop stock is selling for well over $200 as I write, with the price swinging quite a bit, as it is all happening for no reason. Melvin Capital has lost $3.75 billion and counting."}
{"original": "These hedge funds are, of course, furious. But the sheer preposterousness of the whole event has inflamed tempers all over Wall Street. Typically anti-government CNBC anchor Joe Kernen is calling for a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission crackdown on the Reddit kids. TD Ameritrade host Oliver Renick has been inveighing against the tremendous greed that pervades American life, from the billionaires all the way down to the average Joe and Jane. CNBC host Carl Quintanilla declared Wednesday that the debacle reveals the folly of fiscal stimulus itself. Former Trump adviser and fund-of-funds titan Anthony Scaramucci struck a more sympathetic tone when he said, We are witnessing the French Revolution in finance."}
{"original": "This is all a bit silly. The Reddit-GameStop surge of 2021 may well end in tears, but if the world is ending, Armageddon will not be held at Nasdaq."}
{"original": "Most of us like to believe that our work contributes something useful to society. Even if we are not all dedicating our time and energy to working in a COVID-19 ward, we like to think that we create something that others enjoy. A restaurant feeds people, a vacation rental gives a family some respite from the daily grind, a mechanic fixes your car."}
{"original": "But what exactly is it that investors and traders on the stock market do? The Reddit hoax-bubble has revealed the underlying myth of the entire enterprise. The more money people make from that enterprise, the more unpleasant it is to confront the myth."}
{"original": "Back in 1936, when the ravages of the 1929 stock market crash remained tangible across multiple continents, the great economist John Maynard Keynes issued a very reasonable warning about the dangers of excessive stock market speculation: When the capital development of a country becomes a byproduct of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done."}
{"original": "As was often the case, Keynes was right, and his insights remain important for debt and derivatives markets. But the capital development of the United States today has almost nothing to do with the stock market. New companies do not raise their funds from the stock market. They get it from bank loans, private venture capitalists or the federal government."}
{"original": "The early investors in these startups only rarely cash out their investments into the stock market. Most new companies break into the big time not by selling themselves into the stock market, but to another company. This is most obvious in the technology sector, where the typical exit strategy for a venture capital firm is a sale to Google, Facebook, Amazon or Apple rather than an initial public offering."}
{"original": "There is much about this picture that is unpleasant, notably the extreme power of a handful of tech firms that have repeatedly proven themselves to be poor stewards of the public interest. But it is simply not the case that some Redditors going wild on GameStop has undermined the dignified social function of stock trading."}
{"original": "What does the stock market do? It provides a convenient method of payment for elevated executive salaries and an avenue to riches for people ― usually organizations of rich people ― who want to bet on stocks. Turns out, that's a lot of people."}
{"original": "More sophisticated defenders of the stock market justify this activity by talking about the social utility of price discovery. Speculators may not be directly helping companies get off the ground, but they are doing the important work of demonstrating which business activities are valuable and which are not, an act that helps others make important investment decisions that ultimately improve society."}
{"original": "But what exactly is it that they are going to discover? And how will we know if they get the right answer? Most will agree right now that the price of GameStop shares discovered by the Redditors does not reflect the True GameStop Value conjured from the ether of the universe."}
{"original": "But is there a True GameStop Valuation written in the stars? Of course not. It's a video game retailer. God does not have time for such things."}
{"original": "The real work of determining what kind of world we want to live in is the proper subject of democracy, not high finance. The Redditors have made this clear to the world, and for that they should be celebrated rather than condemned."}
{"original": "The GameStop affair provides an opportunity to update Keynes for the 21st century: If you leave it to professional gamblers to determine the social value of any activity, they will almost always give you the wrong answer, no matter how many of them gamble against each other. They can reward social destruction just as readily as they reward social harmony or a video game store or a well-groomed horse at the starting gate."}
{"original": "Financial markets cannot tell us what is good and what is bad. They can only tell us what a lot of people thought they could make money on at a certain point in time. The real work of determining what kind of world we want to live in is the proper subject of democracy, not high finance. The Redditors have made this brazenly clear to the world, and for that they should be celebrated rather than condemned."}
{"original": "The situation, however, does demand a public policy solution. The Redditors have revealed an absurdity by being absurd. The appropriate response is not to demand an orgy of further absurdity, but to do something sensible."}
{"original": "The simplest solution is a financial transactions tax ― a small fee attached to every financial bet. This tax will either discourage reckless stock betting and reduce the volume of what is a mostly economically wasteful activity, or generate a great deal of revenue that can be devoted to more useful activities."}
{"original": "We have plenty of roads and bridges to repair and a vastly outdated transportation system. Redistributing money from hedge funders in the Hamptons to a high-speed rail network or a national public housing program would do more for growth and productivity than all the shorts and put options in New York."}
{"original": "Imagine that you run a troubled business and a group of people come to you and say they can help. You would want to look into their backgrounds first, right? When you did, you found that they have decades of losses in their own business. They've filed for bankruptcy more times than anyone in history. And they have a customer satisfaction rating on TripAdvisor that's lower than Henry VIII's executioner."}
{"original": "You might then stop returning their calls."}
{"original": "But not if they are the nation's airlines who are pushing for a naked power grab in their attempt to run Air Traffic Control."}
{"original": "And they appear to have a sympathetic ear in President Trump."}
{"original": "Some Republicans, lead by Rep. Bill Shuster (R-PA), would like to set up a non-profit, private company to run ATC. Why? They say it's because Congress is unable to fund the system properly and innovation and efficiency are lacking. Basically, the argument from Congress comes down to we can't get the job done, so magically maybe someone else can."}
{"original": "The airlines, of course, like the idea because they would largely be in charge. (Note— Delta Air Lines, the world's largest airline, opposes privatization). The airlines will probably have an outsized number of seats on this new entity's board and they can then do what they have long dreamed of: raise the tax on using the system and limit non-airline traffic (known as general aviation)."}
{"original": "Here's why the whole scheme is a terrible idea."}
{"original": "The ATC system is not (very) broken. It manages the safest aviation system in the world, delivers hundreds of millions of passengers yearly, and has made steady, albeit slow, progress on adopting new technology."}
{"original": "The cost of flying is surely going to go up for everyone. How will this system be funded? The private entity, now outside of the U.S. Treasury, will have to be self-sufficient. And that means user fees for everyone. User fees are a tax. Except it won't be Congress implementing them, it will be a private organization."}
{"original": "It potentially devastates general aviation. These are thousands of small businesses, employing roughly a million people, which may find it impossible to operate in a higher-cost environment. In nation's that have user fees for general aviation, general aviation suffers to the point of near non-existence."}
{"original": "And it will be the largest transfer of public property to a private entity in history."}
{"original": "Supporters of privatization point to Canada, which set up the private NavCanada twenty years ago. Funny that the same people who deride Canada for its universal health care system like its aviation system."}
{"original": "But in Canada, both work because the country is a whole lot smaller. (Not landmass— it's a really big place. But in population)"}
{"original": "Roughly 80 million passengers fly in Canada each year. In the U.S., that number is 700 million. NavCanada serves about 570 airports. In the U.S., FAA oversees some 5,000. And the FAA. employs 15,000 air traffic controllers. Canada... just 1900."}
{"original": "President Trump met with airline executives last week. He needs to hear the rest of the story from the whole industry."}
{"original": "We have the largest, most complex, aviation system in the world. There are ways of improving it without turning the keys over to an industry that has a track record of running everything into the ground."}
{"original": "House Democrats unveiled Friday the For the People Act, a comprehensive package of democratic reforms and the first major bill of the 116th Congress. The bill is a sweeping combination of election, campaign finance and ethics reforms designed to make voting easier, curb the power of big donors and reduce conflicts of interest in all three branches of government."}
{"original": "The For the People Act was the first major legislative action for Democrats after they voted to end the partial government shutdown initiated by President Donald Trump, a measure he is expected to veto."}
{"original": "The package of reforms was put together in a collaborative process initiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in 2011 and overseen by Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) since 2017. The party ran in the 2018 midterm elections on a promise to enact these reforms."}
{"original": "We carried a message of reform, of fighting corruption, of cleaning up Washington, Sarbanes said in introducing the bill on Friday. We made a promise to the American people. The new members who've come made that promise and made it clear they wanted this to be the first order of business. [This bill] is delivering on that promise."}
{"original": "The reforms in the For the People Act would restore the right to vote to millions of disenfranchised Americans and make it dramatically easier for people to vote while also creating a first-of-its-kind public financing system for House elections. It would also require presidential candidates to disclose 10 years of their tax returns."}
{"original": "The bill shortly will go to three committees ― administration, judiciary and oversight ― for hearings. Democrats hope to pass it through the full House in February."}
{"original": "It will then go to the Senate, where a companion bill will be introduced soon. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a hard-line opponent of campaign finance and election reforms, promised that the bill will not get a vote."}
{"original": "The American people will know that this is an option that the House has given the Senate of the United States and the president of the United States, Pelosi said on Friday."}
{"original": "Here is what is in the Democrats' big reform bill: (Read the full text here.)"}
{"original": "David Goldman/ASSOCIATED PRESS The reform bill aims to reduce voting problems, such as the long lines seen at polling locations on Election Day, like this one in Fulton County, Georgia, on Nov. 6."}
{"original": "The bill includes a requirement that all states automatically register voters who submit paperwork to a state government agency (unless the person opts out), provide same-day voter registration, allow 15 days of early voting with sites located near public transportation, use nonpartisan redistricting commissions to draw new congressional maps, enable online voter registration, count provisional ballots from eligible voters filed at the wrong polling place and use paper ballots in addition to electronic voting systems."}
{"original": "It would also ban post-release felon disenfranchisement. This means that about 5 million Americans ― a disproportionate number of whom are African-American ― would regain their voting rights once their sentence is completed. The bill would, however, still allow states to disenfranchise felons during their imprisonment."}
{"original": "States would be banned from engaging in voter caging, a process in which election officials purge voter rolls by sending out non-forwardable mail and then removing anyone whose mail is returned to sender. It would not be permissible for states to remove someone from the voter rolls for failing to vote in a previous election. The use of interstate cross-checks to purge voter rolls would also be limited under the legislation."}
{"original": "Election Day would become a federal holiday for 2 million-plus federal workers, and non-government employers would be encouraged to give the day off to private-sector employees, too. Colleges and universities would be designated as voter registration agencies. Absentee ballots would no longer require postage. And the bill would also increase funding to help states update and secure election infrastructure and to the Election Assistance Commission to oversee these updates, with mandated reports on its progress. The Department of Homeland Security would be ordered to deem election systems as critical infrastructure."}
{"original": "Additionally, the bill contains declarations and findings on important issues that Democrats aim to advance in separate legislation. These include findings about the importance of fixing the Voting Rights Act to comply with the Supreme Court's 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision, which gutted a key section of the historic legislation. Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) will introduce this legislation, which will move on a separate track through the committees. The bill also asserts support for statehood for the District of Columbia, protects Native American voting rights and the right to vote in U.S territories."}
{"original": "J. Scott Applewhite/ASSOCIATED PRESS Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) discuss the For the People Act at a news conference on Nov. 18."}
{"original": "Sarbanes built his reputation as a democracy reform advocate through his work crafting and advocating for legislation to create a system of public financing for congressional elections. The legislative language from his previously introduced bills is the centerpiece of the For the People Act's campaign finance reform section."}
{"original": "The bill creates a public financing system for House elections that provides $6 in public funds for every $1 in funds raised from donations up to $200. Participants in this voluntary public financing system would also be prevented from raising money from large donors. The bill also creates a small-donor matching system for presidential elections. A separate bill covering Senate elections will be introduced by Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.)."}
{"original": "This small-donor-backed public financing system is based on numerous programs adopted around the country, most notably in New York City. The idea is to create an alternative to the funding from big donors and political action committees that currently dominates politics by making it feasible for more candidates to run on small-donor contributions alone."}
{"original": "The bill also includes the Disclose Act, which mandates that nonprofits and other groups not currently bound by law to reveal donor information must disclose those sources when they contribute to election campaigns. The package's Honest Ads Act requires the disclosure of digital political ads on tech platforms."}
{"original": "The Federal Election Commission would be reconfigured from six members to five to prevent deadlocks on important issues. The agency's civil penalty would be made permanent to prevent future legislative battles over its authority. Coordination between super PACs and candidates would be defined in the legislation and banned. Presidential inauguration committees would be required to disclose expenditures and be banned from spending money on anything not related to the actual inauguration. Previously enacted bans on the Securities and Exchange Commission, the executive branch and the Internal Revenue Service from requiring donor disclosure from corporations, nonprofits and government contractors would be repealed."}
{"original": "Like the election reform section, the campaign finance reform piece of the bill contains findings on issues Democrats would like to address in separate legislation. This includes a declaration that the Constitution should be amended to overturn not just the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision that empowered corporations, unions and the rich to spend unlimited sums on elections, but also the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo decision that banned Congress from limiting election spending altogether. Additionally, the bill states an intent to ban anonymous shell companies from funding campaigns to prevent the potential for secret foreign money to seep into elections."}
{"original": "Bloomberg via Getty Images One provision of the bill would ban presidents from contracting with the government. This would prevent President Donald Trump from leasing government property for his Washington, D.C., hotel."}
{"original": "Every presidential candidate would be required to disclose 10 years worth of tax returns under the bill. The president and the vice president would be required to conduct themselves as though the executive branch's conflict of interest regulations apply to them. Presidential appointees would be required to recuse themselves from any decision in which a party is either the president, the president's spouse or any entity in which the president or their spouse has an interest. The president and vice president would be banned from contracting with the U.S. government ― a provision that would prevent Trump from leasing the Old Post Office Building that houses his D.C. hotel."}
{"original": "The Office of Government Ethics would get new enforcement powers. Ethics waivers issued by OGE must be publicly disclosed. OGE must also come up with regulations to govern potential conflicts of interest that arise from the political contributions appointees previously made and received. Presidents-elect would be required to come up with ethics plans to govern their transitions."}
{"original": "The bill also features new lobbyist and revolving door reforms to reduce government corruption. Lobbyist registration is extended to anyone counseling in support of lobbying contacts. This means ex-lawmakers acting as consultants for lobbyists would finally have to register as lobbyists. Federal contracting officers would be banned from accepting any compensation from a contractor that they awarded a contract to for two years after leaving office. Senior federal officials would be banned from contacting their former agency to influence employees for two years after their service ends. Foreign agents would be required to disclose anything of value given to an officeholder. And corporations would be prohibited from making incentive payments to anyone entering government service."}
{"original": "Supreme Court justices would be required to develop a code of ethics to govern conflicts of interest and recusals. Members of Congress would be banned from using taxpayer funds to settle employment discrimination cases. Lawmakers would be banned from serving on corporate boards and from using their position to help the financial interests of themselves or their immediate families."}
{"original": "Democrats see passage of the For the People Act as necessary to keep the promise that they made in the 2018 election to voters to fix democracy and root out corruption in Washington."}
{"original": "The new House Democratic class that pushed the party into power in the 2018 election ran on a message of reform. More than 100 Democratic candidates, many of whom now sit in Congress, sent a letter to the House in October demanding the first order of business be the passage of campaign finance and electoral reforms."}
{"original": "This package is really a great place for us to start in keeping all of the promises we made on the campaign trail, freshman Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) said."}
{"original": "The overall message is one that I hope will show voters that Democrats and many Republican allies who join us in this effort are trying to restore faith in the democratic process and in our government, freshman Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) added."}
{"original": "This article has been updated to include Sarbanes' comments."}
{"original": "In a landmark infrastructure bill passed in December, Congress finally penetrated the Fed's independence by tapping its reserves and bank dividends for infrastructure funding."}
{"original": "The bill was a start. But some experts, including Congressional candidate Tim Canova, say Congress should go further and authorize funds to be issued for infrastructure directly."}
{"original": "For at least a decade, think tanks, commissions and other stakeholders have fought to get Congress to address the staggering backlog of maintenance, upkeep and improvements required to bring the nation's infrastructure into the 21st century. Countries with less in the way of assets have overtaken the U.S. in innovation and efficiency, while our dysfunctional Congress has battled endlessly over the fiscal cliff, tax reform, entitlement reform, and deficit reduction."}
{"original": "Both houses and both political parties agree that something must be done, but they have been unable to agree on where to find the funds. Republicans aren't willing to raise taxes on the rich, and Democrats aren't willing to cut social services for the poor."}
{"original": "In December 2015, however, a compromise was finally reached. On December 4, the last day the Department of Transportation was authorized to cut checks for highway and transit projects, President Obama signed a 1,300-page $305-billion transportation infrastructure bill that renewed existing highway and transit programs. According to America's civil engineers, the sum was not nearly enough for all the work that needs to be done. But the bill was nevertheless considered a landmark achievement, because Congress has not been able to agree on how to fund a long-term highway and transit bill since 2005."}
{"original": "That was one of its landmark achievements. Less publicized was where Congress would get the money: largely from the Federal Reserve and Wall Street megabanks. The deal was summarized in a December 1st Bloomberg article titled Highway Bill Compromise Would Take Money from US Banks:"}
{"original": "The highway measure would be financed in part by a one-time use of Federal Reserve surplus funds and by a reduction in the 6 percent dividend that national banks receive from the Fed. . . . Banks with $10 billion or less in assets would be exempt from the cut. The Fed's surplus capital comes from the 12 reserve banks. The highway bill would allow for a one-time draw of $19 billion from the surplus, which totaled $29.3 billion as of Nov. 25. . . . Banks vigorously fought the dividend cut, which was estimated to generate about $17 billion over 10 years for the highway trust fund."}
{"original": "According to Zachary Warmbrodt, writing in Politico in November, the Fed registered strong concerns about using the resources of the Federal Reserve to finance fiscal spending. But former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who is now at the Brookings Institute, acknowledged in a blog post that the Fed could operate with little or no capital. His objection was that it is not good optics or good precedent to raid an independent central bank. It doesn't look good."}
{"original": "Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon), ranking member on the House Transportation Committee, retorted, For the Federal Reserve to be saying this impinges upon their integrity, etc., etc. -- you know, it's absurd. This is a body that creates money out of nothing."}
{"original": "DeFazio also said, [I]f the Fed can bail out the banks and give them preferred interest rates, they can do something for the greater economy and for average Americans. So it was their time to help out a little bit."}
{"original": "An Idea Whose Time Has Come"}
{"original": "It may be their time indeed. For over a century, populists and money reformers have petitioned Congress to solve its funding problems by exercising the sovereign power of government to issue money directly, through either the Federal Reserve or the Treasury."}
{"original": "In the 1860s, Abraham Lincoln issued debt-free US Notes or greenbacks to finance much of the Civil War, as well as the transcontinental railroad and the land-grant college system. In the 1890s, populists attempted unsuccessfully to revive this form of infrastructure funding. In the Great Depression, Congress authorized the issuance of several billion dollars of US Notes in the Thomas Amendment to the 1933 Agricultural Adjustment Act. In 1999, Illinois Rep. Ray LaHood introduced the State and Local Government Economic Empowerment Act (H. R. 1452), which would have authorized the US Treasury to issue interest-free loans of US Notes to state and local governments for infrastructure investment."}
{"original": "Law professor Timothy Canova plans to reintroduce this funding model if elected to represent Florida's 23rd Congressional district, where he is now running against the controversial Debbie Wasserman Schultz, current chair of the Democratic National Convention. Prof. Canova wrote in a December 2012 article:"}
{"original": ". . . Wall Street bankers and mainstream economists will argue that greenbacks and other such proposals would be inflationary, depreciate the dollar, tank the bond market, and bring an end to Western civilization. Yet, we've seen four years of the Federal Reserve--now on its third quantitative-easing program--experimenting with its own type of greenback program, creating new money out of thin air in the form of credits in Federal Reserve Notes to purchase trillions of dollars of bonds from big banks and hedge funds. While the value of the dollar has not collapsed and the bond market remains strong, neither have those newly created trillions trickled down to Main Street and the struggling middle classes. The most significant effect of the Fed's programs has been to prop up banks, bond prices, and the stock market, with hardly any benefit to Main Street."}
{"original": "In a January 2015 op-ed in the UK Guardian titled European Central Bank's QE Is a Missed Opportunity, Tony Pugh concurred, stating of the US and European QE programs:"}
{"original": "Quantitative easing, as practised by the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve, merely flooded the financial sector with money to the benefit of bondholders. This did not create a so-called wealth affect, with a trickle-down to the real producing economy. . . . If the EU were bold enough, it could fund infrastructure or renewables projects directly through the electronic creation of money, without having to borrow. Our government has that authority, but lacks the political will. The [Confederation of British Industry] has calculated that every £1 of such expenditure would increase GDP by £2.80 through the money multiplier. The Bank of England's QE programme of £375bn was a wasted opportunity."}
{"original": "According to IMF director Christine Lagarde, writing in The Economist in November 2015:"}
{"original": "IMF research shows that, in advanced economies, an increase in investment spending worth one percentage point of GDP raises the overall level of output by about 0.4% in the same year and by 1.5% four years after the spending increase."}
{"original": "In a December 2015 paper titled Recovery in the Eurozone: Using Money Creation to Stimulate the Real Economy, Frank van Lerven expanded on this research, writing:"}
{"original": "For the Eurozone, statistical analysis of income and consumption patterns suggests that €100 billion of newly created money distributed to citizens would lead to an increase in GDP of around €232 billion. Using IMF fiscal multipliers, our empirical analysis further suggests that using the money to fund a €100 billion increase in public investment would reduce unemployment by approximately one million, and could be between 2.5 to 12 times more effective at stimulating GDP than current QE."}
{"original": "The invariable objection to exercising the government's sovereign money-creating power is that it would lead to hyperinflation, but these figures belie that assumption. If adding €100 billion for infrastructure increases GDP by €232 billion, prices should actually go down rather than up, since the supply of goods and services (GDP) would have increased more than twice as fast as demand (money). Conventional theory says that prices go up when too much money is chasing too few goods, and in this case the reverse would be true."}
{"original": "In a November 2015 editorial, the Washington Post admonished Congress for blurring the line between fiscal and monetary policy, warning, Many a banana republic . . . has come to grief using its central bank to facilitate government deficit spending. But according to Prof. Michael Hudson, who has studied hyperinflations extensively, that is not why banana republics have gotten into trouble for printing money. He observes:"}
{"original": "The reality is that nearly all hyperinflations stem from a collapse of foreign exchange as a result of having to pay debt service. That was what caused Germany's hyperinflation in the 1920s, not domestic German spending. It is what caused the Argentinean and other Latin American hyperinflations in the 1980s, and Chile's hyperinflation earlier."}
{"original": "Any encroachment on the Fed's turf is viewed by Wall Street and the mainstream media with alarm. But to people struggling with mounting bills and crumbling infrastructure, the development has promising potential. The portal to the central bank's stream of riches has been forced open, if just a crack. The trickle could one day become a flow, a mighty river of liquidity powering the engines of productivity of a vibrant economy."}
{"original": "For that to happen, however, we need an enlightened citizenry and congressional leaders willing to take up the charge; and that is what makes Prof. Tim Canova's run for Congress an exciting development."}
{"original": "Amit Dave / Reuters Construction workers build a wall along a slum area along a route that U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be taking during Trump's visit later this month, in Ahmedabad."}

{"original": "A senior government official said the wall was being built for security reasons, not to conceal the slum district."}
{"original": "But the contractor building it told Reuters the government did not want the slum to be seen when Trump passes by on the ride in from Ahmedabad's airport."}
{"original": "I've been ordered to build a wall as soon as possible, over 150 masons are working round-the-clock to finish the project, the contractor said, speaking on condition of anonymity."}
{"original": "The government official conceded that the wall was part of a beautification and cleanliness drive."}
{"original": "Whatever the reason, the 400-meter-long and seven-feet-high wall will prevent the U.S. leader from getting a glimpse of a slum district that houses an estimated 800 families."}

{"original": "As cities across Ontario finalize their budgets and try to squeeze out savings to expand public transit, something doesn't add up. Too many cities, including Toronto, are missing out on hundreds of millions in savings. That's because Ontario has a labour law loophole that's putting cities, companies and taxpayers at a huge disadvantage."}
{"original": "The heated debate over road tolls in Toronto has distracted from a far simpler way of saving for public transit expansion. Here it is: Change the way construction projects are tendered. Right now, Toronto and too many other municipalities including Hamilton, Sault Ste. Marie and the Region of Waterloo are forced to award construction work to contractors affiliated with select unions only. No other contractors are allowed to compete, even if they're better qualified, can do the work more efficiently and at a lower cost."}
{"original": "A loophole in Ontario's Labour Relations Act forces these municipalities to pay a premium for construction work by restricting competition. Each year, up to a billion dollars worth of construction work is subject to labour monopolies. As a result, taxpayers are not getting good value, and infrastructure dollars aren't going as far as they should. Ontario is the only province in all of Canada where municipalities are treated as construction employers and automatically bound to pre-existing collective agreements with no ability to negotiate the terms."}
{"original": "If Toronto had an open bidding process, there would be no need to bring in road tolls."}
{"original": "There's a compelling and mounting body of evidence that demonstrates the costly consequences of limiting construction competition. Research by the Cardus think tank shows that in those municipalities where construction tendering is restricted, project costs are inflated by 20 to 30 per cent. Apply that to the $600 million worth of work Toronto performs annually (and isn't allowed to openly tender) and it translates into major savings that could go a long way in expanding transit or addressing the backlog of needed repairs at Toronto Community Housing."}
{"original": "Here's another way to look at it: If Toronto had an open bidding process, there would be no need to bring in road tolls. That's right. The city could save about the same amount of revenue it hoped to collect through tolls by tendering construction work in a fairer way."}
{"original": "This begs the question -- shouldn't open tendering be an obvious choice as Toronto looks for savings to fund transit and other infrastructure projects? After all, Mayor Tory vowed that all options would be considered and City Manager Peter Wallace has said, We need to demonstrate that we're investing [Torontonians'] hard-earned tax dollars properly."}
{"original": "Toronto could prove that it's willing to do right by taxpayers by teaming up with the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, the Large Urban Mayors' Caucus, the Ontario Good Roads Association and the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. They've all urged the Ontario government to fix its antiquated labour laws."}
{"original": "Restricted tendering increases project costs, harms local economic development and prevents the public from getting the best value for its tax dollars, said Gary McNamara, past president of AMO in a letter to Ontario's labour minister."}
{"original": "At every opportunity, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce has asked the province to amend Section 126 of Ontario's Labour Relations Act."}
{"original": "The current system has created monopolies in some of the province's largest municipalities, said the OCC in a submission to the Ontario government back in 2015. It went on to say, ... this system stifles competition and often results in unnecessarily high infrastructure costs."}
{"original": "To help stimulate Canada's sluggish economy, the federal government is planning the biggest infrastructure spend in the country's history. It's committed to investing almost $125 billion over the next decade. Every dollar we spend on public infrastructure grows our economy, creates jobs and strengthens our cities and towns, according to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau."}
{"original": "This should not sit well with taxpayers."}
{"original": "One issue is that when these infrastructure dollars start flowing, they won't go nearly as far in Toronto, Hamilton, Sault St. Marie or the Region of Waterloo. For every infrastructure dollar spent elsewhere in Canada, it translates into about 70 cents in these municipalities. This should not sit well with taxpayers."}
{"original": "There is a way for Canada's largest city to find the savings it needs and champion a worthy cause. Toronto has an opportunity to push for a small legislative change that could make a big difference to municipalities and taxpayers across Ontario."}

{"original": "Democrats are holding a hearing Thursday on the importance of disclosing Trump's tax information, which would reveal how much money he makes, who pays him and how much tax he pays."}
{"original": "Top-ranking Republicans on the House tax committee asked its chairman not to request the documents, even though federal law explicitly gives him the power to do so ― and even though Republicans used that power to oversee Barack Obama's administration."}
{"original": "Transparency in our government is enormously important, but must be undertaken with appropriate care, Reps. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) and Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) wrote in a Thursday letter to Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.)."}
{"original": "Weaponizing our nation's tax code by targeting political foes only serves to weaken our system of government, not strengthen it, Brady and Kelly wrote. If there are valid concerns with financial disclosure, then let's come together to legislate a thoughtful solution to require additional disclosures."}
{"original": "Trump broke with precedent of the last 40 years by refusing to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential campaign. And he broke with tradition when he took office without divesting from his businesses."}
{"original": "It's normal for congressional committees to conduct oversight of the executive branch, but Trump said during his State of the Union address on Tuesday that Democrats should lay off."}
{"original": "If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation, Trump said."}
{"original": "Ways and Means can obtain anyone's tax returns under a provision of the tax code. This provision has existed since the 1920s, when Congress enabled three congressional committees to obtain the president's tax returns without the chief executive's consent. Those committees can then release those tax returns to the full House or Senate if they choose. The Joint Committee on Taxation famously did so in 1974 when it sent its report on President Richard Nixon's tax returns to the House."}
{"original": "In 2014, Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee used their authority under the same provision to obtain the tax information of several private groups that were seeking nonprofit status from the IRS. They then voted to release that information publicly in a letter that sought criminal prosecution of a former IRS official for allegedly targeting conservative groups for audits."}
{"original": "Brady and Kelly were members of Ways and Means in 2014, as were several other Republicans currently on the committee."}
{"original": "At the hearing, a panel of four expert witnesses testified that the committee has broad authority to request tax returns from the president or anyone else. But Republicans argued the committee had no need to obtain Trump's returns because the IRS is mandated to audit them and the president already has to make other financial disclosures."}
{"original": "The witnesses, however, argued that Congress sought Nixon's tax returns because they did not trust the IRS to properly audit the president's taxes without undue influence, and because tax returns contain different information than what's required by mandatory financial disclosures."}
{"original": "Representatives for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have said he would review any requests for legality, suggesting the Trump administration would defy Congress ― and defy the law."}
{"original": "I don't see any wiggle room in the statute for the secretary to refuse a request, George Yin, a tax expert at the University of Virginia Law School, testified."}
{"original": "This story has been updated with details from Thursday's hearing."}
{"original": "Boston Globe via Getty Images A family walks along Oak Street in Boston's Chinatown, where protestors for affordable housing have written on the sidewalk in front of an Airbnb rental."}
{"original": "One snowy winter day, after standing at his restaurant job washing dishes, Jinlong Chen came home to the apartment that he and his wife shared with several other families on Beach Street in Boston's Chinatown. He opened the door to their room to find water and debris everywhere. Part of the ceiling had collapsed."}
{"original": "Chen notified his landlord. The landlord told him to move out. Back then, I didn't know my rights as a tenant, Chen, 66, says in Mandarin through an interpreter. I avoided that part of the ceiling. I moved the bed to the other side of the room. A few months later, with the ceiling still gaping, Chen and his wife moved."}
{"original": "Landlords neglecting their buildings and harassing tenants in order to get them to leave have become a common story in Chinatowns across the country as these traditionally working-class immigrant neighborhoods become gentrified."}
{"original": "A study of the three largest Chinatowns on the East Coast — Boston, New York, and Philadelphia — by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund found that Chinatowns are losing their Asian residents as the white population grows. Asians now account for less than half of the population in all three Chinatowns."}
{"original": "As those with more means move in, immigrant residents of Chinatowns increasingly squeeze into shared quarters, like Jinlong Chen and his housemates did."}
{"original": "In Boston, there's a lot of real estate speculation, says Lydia Lowe, a Chinatown community leader for more than 30 years."}
{"original": "Boston's Chinatown, located adjacent to the Financial District, has long been affected by development, Lowe says. During urban renewal in the 1950s and '60s, an estimated 1,200 units of housing were demolished when two major highways, I-93 and the Massachusetts Turnpike, were routed through Chinatown, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund study says."}
{"original": "Then, Tufts University and the New England Medical Center, now the Tufts Medical Center, took over one-third of Chinatown's land area."}
{"original": "But the pace of development has exploded in recent years. We've just seen luxury tower after luxury tower being built in the area and this has led to rapid gentrification, Lowe says."}
{"original": "Lowe now serves as executive director of the Chinatown Community Land Trust, founded in 2015. In a community land trust model, the trust owns land and can deed-restrict the buildings on it to be permanently affordable."}
{"original": "The Chinatown Community Land Trust intended to do just that, but its attempts to buy properties have failed. That's not looking so good right now, Lowe says. Because of the market we're not able to even get our hands on buying a smaller property."}
{"original": "A dilapidated three-story row house that would have gone for about $800,000 two or three years ago is now selling for $2 million to $3 million, Lowe says."}
{"original": "Boston Globe via Getty Images Construction by Tufts University on Tyler Street in Chinatown near traditional row homes, which residents worry will either be demolished or turned into expensive condos."}
{"original": "So, the land trust looks for other ways to preserve affordable housing in Chinatown. One way is to advocate for stronger tenant protections and policies. Several Chinatown organizations — including the Chinatown Community Land Trust, Chinese Progressive Association, and the Asian Community Development Corp. — are part of the Welcome Home Coalition, which is calling for stricter regulation of Airbnbs to keep residents from being displaced."}
{"original": "The Chinatown organizations are also pushing for stronger enforcement of zoning. We have zoning in theory, but many times large projects get a lot of variances and zoning relief, says Angie Liou, executive director of the Asian Community Development Corp., which builds affordable housing."}
{"original": "The developments obtain variances for height, for example. Comparing Chinatown to other more upscale neighborhoods, it makes me question whether developers in those neighborhoods would have dared to propose such a thing, Liou says."}
{"original": "The community is also fighting to preserve existing affordable housing. One battle is taking place at Mass Pike Towers, a 200-unit low-income development. When developer Trinity Financial purchased the towers in 2000, it did so using public funding, including low-income housing tax credits, and agreed to give tenants and the city government an opportunity to purchase the property in 15 years."}
{"original": "Boston Globe via Getty Images Residents of Mass Pike Towers, Boston, practice a Tai Chi sword routine."}
{"original": "In 2016, the city agreed to buy the property and turn it over to the tenants, who would finance the purchase. The tenants plan to convey the land to the Chinatown Community Land Trust."}
{"original": "But the tenants and Trinity have been locked in ongoing litigation over the purchase price of the building. The tenants offered $42 million. Trinity wants $61 million, citing a city-ordered independent appraisal. The tenants argue that the appraisal is based on rental income that was not weighed in the original agreement."}
{"original": "Bill Oranczak, president of the Mass Pike Towers Tenants Association, has lived in the complex since 2008 and says that Trinity previously proposed to build market-rate condos on Mass Pike Towers' parking lot, a proposal that the tenants successfully fought."}
{"original": "Every time I turn around, there's a new set of cranes, Oranczak says. When we see what's going on in Chinatown with all the development, it's important for us to try to preserve some of the property and the land to slow down gentrification. That's a big reason why we're doing this."}
{"original": "Serene Wong, who has lived in Mass Pike Towers since 1992, says she would like to see Chinatown remain a landing spot for working-class Chinese immigrants, as it's been for more than 100 years."}
{"original": "Chinatown used to be, for us, a stepping stone to adjust to the culture, to adjust between American and Chinese, Wong says."}
{"original": "When Wong immigrated to America from Hong Kong in 1987, she didn't speak much English. Living in Chinatown, where other people spoke Cantonese like her, eased her adjustment. She enrolled in a training program offered by a community organization. Today, she serves as vice president of the tenants association, and was one of its founders."}
{"original": "Boston Globe via Getty Images Bill Oranczak and Serene Wong stand in front of Mass Pike Towers."}
{"original": "We're being eaten up little by little. Chinatown is getting very small, Wong says."}
{"original": "The affordability subsidies for Mass Pike Towers don't expire until 2070, so the tenants still have time. But for residents of the many row houses in Boston's Chinatown, the situation is more precarious."}
{"original": "After all these towers being built right now, the housing stock that is most at risk are the row houses, says Karen Chen, executive director of Chinese Progressive Association."}
{"original": "Jinlong Chen (no relation) lives in one of those row house. After moving out of the apartment with the collapsed ceiling in 2011, he and his wife moved a few more times and eventually settled into an apartment with another couple. Living in Chinatown is important to him, he says, because he's not proficient in English. When he leaves Chinatown, he gets lost."}
{"original": "But in 2016, the landlord said he wanted to renovate the building and served them an eviction notice. This time, Chen went to Chinese Progressive Association to ask for help."}
{"original": "Community organizers represented the couple at housing court and won a reprieve. They can stay in the building — at least for now. But Chen worries. The landlord recently raised the rent by $100. (Chen's monthly income is about $1,000, and his portion of the rent is $650). Will the landlord try to kick them out again? Where would they go?"}
{"original": "My ideal is that there will be more elderly housing in Chinatown, so that the elderly like me, who've worked all my life, could move there and have affordable housing, he says."}

{"original": "DENVER ― Upset constituents have inundated the office of Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) with phone calls, letters and emails during President Donald Trump's tumultuous first two weeks in office."}
{"original": "He's hardly the only politician being bombarded by voters urging him to take stands on issues they care about. But he sets himself apart with the claim that many of those deluging his office with correspondence are paid protesters, not Coloradans."}
{"original": "Gardner first made the allegation Friday in an interview with Denver TV station CBS4, speculating that some of the unusual volume of calls he's receiving come from out of state area codes, so they must be paid protesters."}
{"original": "The comment prompted massive backlash, the station reported in a followup. Gardner told CBS4 many callers had area codes from California and New York."}
{"original": "Gardner dug deeper on Wednesday in an interview with NBC affiliate 9News."}
{"original": "Grateful for your patience as my office has been receiving a large volume of calls. We're working overtime to make sure your voice is heard. pic.twitter.com/XS5z9UAI8L — Cory Gardner (@SenCoryGardner) February 2, 2017"}
{"original": "There is certainly a number of people calling from out of state, Gardner said. New York, California. That's happening. There are certain paid activists through Craigslist. We've seen the advertisements."}
{"original": "Gardner's office did not respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post."}
{"original": "It actually makes sense that Gardner would be fielding more calls from California and New York phone numbers. Colorado has seen a spike in new residents from outside the state in recent years, with Californians and New Yorkers leading the pack."}
{"original": "According to IRS tax return data, more people moved to Colorado from California in 2014 and 2015 (the most recent data available) than from any other state. New Yorkers also moved there in large numbers ― the sixth-largest source of new residents."}
{"original": "That migration trend has been the same since at least 2011, the earliest year that IRS tax data is readily available. Californians consistently lead new residents moving to Colorado, with New Yorkers not far behind."}
{"original": "And, as anyone with a cellphone will tell you, unless you go out of the way to get a new phone number, your old area code goes with you, regardless of where you move."}
{"original": "At least one of Gardner's colleagues in the House has floated a similar paid protesters theory."}
{"original": "Rep. Dave Brat, (R-Va.) told Republican supporters on Monday he was upset with protesters. The women are in my grill no matter where I go, Brat complained."}
{"original": "In a followup interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Brat claimed many of the protesters are paid activists. One of those protesters said Brat's claim is absurd."}
{"original": "Nobody is being paid or put up to this by an outside organization, Karen Conley, who called Brat's office, said. Everybody is putting in their time and effort because they're dissatisfied with the representation. They feel dismissed, and that their concerns aren't valid because they're not being responded to."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― Eight months after the Panama Papers shed new light on the scale of tax avoidance by the global elite, Ecuador plans to make cracking down on tax havens the centerpiece of its leadership of the G-77 bloc of developing countries at the United Nations."}
{"original": "Ecuador formally assumes leadership of the influential group on Friday, and one of its top priorities will be the creation of an international body to combat the practice of hiding wealth in countries with low taxes and secretive financial laws."}
{"original": "Tax dodging is one of the great scourges of the 21st century and we need to put an end to it, Guillaume Long, Ecuador's minister of foreign affairs and human mobility, told The Huffington Post on Thursday."}
{"original": "In an attempt to put its proverbial money where its mouth is, Ecuador is pairing its international initiative with a domestic referendum on whether it should be illegal for any elected official or civil servant to have financial assets in tax havens. A vote on the measure will coincide with the country's general elections on Feb. 19."}
{"original": "Like many other developing countries, Ecuador has a strong stake in reining in tax-dodging schemes since they remain a widespread practice among its own elite class. Cash equal to some 30 percent of Ecuador's economy escapes the country every year for overseas shell companies, secret bank accounts and other tax shelters, Long estimated."}
{"original": "That level of avoidance is a huge irony, he said, in light of the cash remittances that flow in from the far-less-privileged segment of Ecuadoreans working abroad. Those transfers totaled more than $2.4 billion in 2015."}
{"original": "Those are basically people from the poorest sectors of society … and that bolsters the Ecuadorean economy, and you have elites, who haven't migrated because they haven't had any necessity, who actually take money physically out of the economy and send it away, Long said."}
{"original": "Under the left-wing government of President Rafael Correa, poverty and inequality in Ecuador have dropped dramatically. But much of that gain is dependent on the funding of ambitious social programs. Tax avoidance threatens to undermine that progress ― particularly when the economy slows down, as it did in 2015."}
{"original": "Globally, the use of tax havens deprives impoverished nations of $170 billion in tax revenue annually, according to the anti-poverty group Oxfam International."}
{"original": "JUAN CEVALLOS/AFP/Getty Images Ecuador's President Rafael Correa (left) and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hold a press conference in October 2016. Ecuador is assuming leadership of the U.N.'s G-77 bloc."}
{"original": "An intergovernmental United Nations body that fights for tax justice would provide countries with a forum to challenge the policies of other countries that function as tax havens, Long suggested. He pointed to the way nations can challenge one another's trade practices at the World Trade Organization, arguing there is no reason that a similar body should not exist to monitor fiscal policies."}
{"original": "Such an institution could also be empowered to intervene, Long said, when it sees there is a kind of race to the bottom between two neighboring states ― one lowering its taxes, the other lowering its taxes ... in order to be able to kind of pull money from each other."}
{"original": "At a July 2015 U.N. conference on financing and development in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the G-77 failed in its efforts to win support for such a global tax body."}
{"original": "But Long expressed confidence that the Panama Papers, which revealed the offshore holdings of 140 public officials around the world and resulted in the ouster of Iceland's prime minister, have changed the politics of the issue."}
{"original": "This year, because of the scandal, because of the Panama Papers, there is a new historic conjuncture that we can use in order to bring this topic forward, Long said."}
{"original": "The time is ripe, he added."}
{"original": "The prospects for a global tax body may still remain rather dim. The economies of many U.N. member-nations depend on their status as tax havens, and they would likely fight such a proposal vehemently."}
{"original": "Eric LeCompte, executive director of the faith-based anti-poverty organization Jubilee USA and moderator of a Thursday panel on tax havens for which Long delivered the opening remarks, nonetheless lauded Ecuador's leadership on this issue."}
{"original": "It is clear to me that the government of Ecuador has looked at how tax and trade issues impact vulnerable communities in their country, LeCompte said earlier this week."}
{"original": "Short of a global body to combat tax havens, a coordinated push to reduce tax avoidance could involve providing greater resources to developing nations to monitor exports, LeCompte argued. Commercial goods that get past customs officials represent a major source of lost tax revenue, he noted."}
{"original": "Its estimated that about 150 companies file for commercial bankruptcy each day according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. Companies of all sizes fail due to lack of or misuse of capital. We hear stories all the time about new tech companies failing even after raising huge funding rounds. These companies often fail to turn a profit and most likely took a bigger bite than they could chew."}
{"original": "Because of this we are seeing new startups use the lean startup methodology. The basic premise being: what's the cheapest and quickest way we can get to market with our minimum viable product. If you're just starting out here are three ways to keep your startup lean and mean."}
{"original": "Your team will have their core competencies and you should delegate any work you can to your core team first. Then you'll want to look for outside help. Whether its software development, design, marketing, financial consulting, or even just advice you should look to the share economy. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr give you access to hundreds of thousands of talented freelancers across the globe."}
{"original": "Instead of paying a design team in the United States a couple thousand dollars to design your home page, you could get by with a couple hundred dollars for the same quality of work using this outsourced talent. Freelancer's carry dramatically less overhead than dev shops and other service providers. Because of this they'll typically be way less expensive."}
{"original": "Some freelancer's even allow you to pay a fixed price upon completion. I highly recommend using this strategy since it ensures you get what you pay for. Be transparent and upfront with your freelancer and I guarantee you won't be disappointed with their work."}
{"original": "The world of payments is a tricky one. The quicker you're able to find a proper payments solution for your business the better. There are plenty of payment platforms out there that offer a wide variety of value-added features. Start by looking at the most popular payment solutions and decide what core features your business will need to utilize."}
{"original": "Regardless if you're building a SaaS product or plan on selling online, you should definitely look to utilize a completely digital payment solution. A huge plus is that you won't have to worry about sifting through all your paperwork when it comes to any basic accounting tasks. Electronic payment systems are great for keeping all your documents in one place. Some platform's even offer features such as tax filing and preparation, white-labeled support, and extensive reporting. As a start-up, utilizing these features will save you tons of time and money when it comes to your finances."}
{"original": "I know its fun working out of the garage, but it comes time in every start-ups life where they'll need to find some legitimate office space. From a cost perspective, co-working spaces are a great way to get the most bang for your buck. Typically these space's have all the amenities of a regular office and allow you and your team to essentially pay-per-use. Companies like WeWork offer a tiered pricing structure where you can basically pick and choose your amenities as you need them."}
{"original": "Another great aspect about a co-working space is that you're able to access a great network of like minded entrepreneurs. Even if they can't offer you any help with your business it's always good to make connections. If you're still in the early stages, it's probably best to leverage a co-working space before moving to your own office."}
{"original": "Startups are tricky. Navigating through the early stages of a startup will really age you. The best way to mitigate risk is to stay lean as long as you can. Use these three tips to stay lean and mean during your entrepreneurial journey."}
{"original": "After Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections, they introduced and passed the For the People Act as H.R. 1 — the first bill of their majority. It aimed to restore voting rights, reform campaign finance laws and enhance ethics enforcement. Senate Democrats have now done the same after reclaiming the chamber majority with the introduction of S. 1, their version of the For the People Act."}
{"original": "These nearly identical bills contain a suite of policies to protect, enhance and expand democracy, according to supporters. These policies would institute national standards for expanded voting rights, create a system for publicly financed congressional elections, ban undisclosed dark money and forbid partisan gerrymandering."}
{"original": "But there's more urgency now. American democracy is imperiled like at no other time in modern history; the country is coming off an election in which President Donald Trump refused to accept his loss. With the help of national and local Republicans, he launched legal efforts to overturn or nullify the voting results. These lies culminated in the violent sacking of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 that left five people dead."}
{"original": "We have all been reminded in the starkest terms that government of the people, by the people, and for the people is not guaranteed, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the lead Senate sponsor of the For the People Act with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), said in a statement introducing the bill. A violent assault on the Capitol is not the only way to attack democracy. Everyone who believes in our Constitutional vision should support reforms that make sure the American people are able to vote and that their government reflects their preferences and works for them."}
{"original": "Democrats prioritized these reforms in 2019 in response to the ever-growing influence of money in politics; greater Republican Party efforts to make voting more difficult, particularly for racial minority groups; and the rising threat of minority rule. These issues remain as well."}
{"original": "Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images Senate Democrats introduced the Senate version of the For the People Act (S. 1) on Tuesday. In 2019, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schummer (center) first introduced the bill."}
{"original": "Democrats do not intend to waste time. The House bill, introduced by Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) on Jan. 4, could get a floor vote as early as Jan. 28, according to a congressional aide. But it may take longer for the bill to move on the Senate side."}
{"original": "Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the outgoing majority leader, attacked the 2019 bill as socialist as he blocked consideration in the Senate. But with a new majority soon to be in place, the legislation can get full consideration, although Senate Democrats will need to hold hearings first in the relevant committees and then the Rules Committee before advancing the bill to the floor. But it may need to wait until after Congress passes another round of COVID-19 relief."}
{"original": "The bill would need to receive 60 votes to prevent it from being blocked by a Republican filibuster on the floor. That is unless Democrats decide to end the use of the filibuster entirely or on a case-by-case basis. Though such considerations have been discussed, there remains no consensus on how Democrats will approach the filibuster in the coming months."}
{"original": "There is a lot at stake in whether Democrats can pass the For the People Act quickly. State-level Republicans are already gearing up to pass a raft of new voting restrictions in states including Georgia and Texas, inspired by Trump's lies about widespread voter fraud in the November election. The states will also begin a new round of redistricting this year, which could cement Republican Party gerrymanders in dozens of states for another 10 years."}
{"original": "The first section of the bill would institute national standards for voting in every state to expand access to the ballot. These include mandating automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, at least 15 days of early in-person voting, no excuse mail-in voting with postage prepaid, online voter registration and the restoration of voting rights to felons upon release from custody."}
{"original": "The bill would also block states from making it harder to vote by banning certain voter purge practices while imposing new penalties for deceptive electioneering. And it would require every state election system to maintain a paper ballot trail, among many other election security provisions."}
{"original": "This section was largely written by the late Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights hero. It was Lewis who first introduced these reforms as the Voter Empowerment Act in each Congress beginning in 2012 until his death in 2020. He incorporated them into the For the People Act in 2019 as a co-author along with the bill's lead sponsor Sarbanes and many other Democratic lawmakers."}
{"original": "In addition to the voting rights reforms first proposed by Lewis, the bill also includes a requirement that every state appoint an independent and nonpartisan redistricting board to draw new congressional districts after each decennial census."}
{"original": "Alex Wong/Getty Images Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), who died in 2020, co-authored the voting rights modernization section of the For the People Act."}
{"original": "The For the People Act also provides a list of congressional findings in support of the passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2021, which will be introduced in the House separately."}
{"original": "The section of the bill contains a litany of campaign finance reforms built on the work of Sarbanes and others over the past decade."}
{"original": "It would create the first public financing for congressional elections in which candidates would receive $6 for every $1 in funds raised from donations up to $200. Participants in this voluntary public financing system would also be prevented from raising money from large donors. The bill creates a similar small-donor matching system for presidential elections."}
{"original": "Previously introduced election transparency proposals are also in the bill, including the Disclose Act, which would ban undisclosed dark money spent by political nonprofits on elections, and the Honest Ads Act, which mandates the disclosure of the buyers of digital and social media advertising."}
{"original": "The Federal Election Commission would be reconfigured from six members to five to prevent deadlocks on important issues. Coordination between super PACs and candidates would be defined in the legislation and banned. Presidential inauguration committees would be required to disclose expenditures and be banned from spending money on anything not related to the actual inauguration."}
{"original": "Beyond voting rights and campaign finance reforms, the bill expands ethics and lobbying laws to take on both long-standing abuses and those made evident by the pervasive corruption of the Trump administration."}
{"original": "Every presidential candidate would be required to disclose 10 years' worth of tax returns under the bill. The president and the vice president would be required to conduct themselves as though the executive branch's conflict-of-interest regulations apply to them. And neither the president nor the vice president would be allowed to hold a contract with the U.S. government, as Trump did for his hotel in Washington, D.C."}
{"original": "The Office of Government Ethics would get new enforcement powers, and ethics waivers issued by OGE would have to be publicly disclosed. The bill also closes lobbying disclosure loopholes by requiring all people engaged in lobbying to register whether they contact government officials or not."}
{"original": "And for the first time, the Supreme Court would be required to institute a code of ethics to govern conflicts of interest and recusals."}
{"original": "Senate Democrats released a summary of the bill's entire contents on Tuesday that can be read here."}
{"original": "The FBI should open a criminal investigation into President Donald Trump for solicitation of election fraud, House Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) said Monday."}
{"original": "The lawmakers sent a congressional letter to the FBI in response to an audio recording that showed Trump threatening Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) with criminal prosecution unless he could find 11,780 votes ― one more vote than President-elect Joe Biden's margin of victory in the state."}
{"original": "So look, Trump said on the recording, first released to The Washington Post. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state."}
{"original": "Later in the call, Trump reiterated his demand for Raffensperger to manufacture votes for him. So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break."}
{"original": "The letter alleges Trump violated two federal statutes and one Georgia statute forbidding the solicitation of election fraud when he pressed Raffensperger to alter the vote total in order to declare Trump the winner of the state's 16 electoral votes."}
{"original": "As Members of Congress and former prosecutors, we believe Donald Trump engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes, Lieu and Rice wrote. We ask you to open an immediate criminal investigation into the President."}
{"original": "In America, no one is above the law ― not the president and not any former presidents, Lieu told HuffPost."}
{"original": "The call for a criminal investigation is among the strong reactions lawmakers and watchdog groups have expressed about the phone call. But Democrats and outside groups differ on how to hold Trump accountable for his misdeeds."}
{"original": "Trump's effort to pressure Raffensperger merits nothing less than a criminal investigation, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) tweeted Sunday night."}
{"original": "There's no question there is grounds for an investigation at the federal level and at the state level, said Stephen Spaulding, special counsel for public policy at the nonpartisan nonprofit Common Cause."}
{"original": "A potential problem for prosecuting Trump's actions is that the person soliciting the crime must know that they are requesting election fraud to be committed. If Trump legitimately believes the falsehoods that he won Georgia by hundreds of thousands of votes, that thousands of dead people voted and that electronic voting machines invented votes for Biden, among other outlandish conspiracies, then it may not be possible to criminally prosecute him."}
{"original": "As with so many things in this presidency and president, the question is whether Trump is drinking his own Kool-Aid, election law expert Rick Hasen wrote on Slate Monday. Reading the entire one-hour rambling call transcript, it is hard to know if Trump actually believes the fever swamp of debunked conspiracy theories about the election or whether he's just using the false claims as a cover to get the political results he wants."}
{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Two Democratic lawmakers are asking the FBI to investigate President Donald Trump for solicitation of election fraud during his phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger."}
{"original": "If it is not possible to prove Trump knowingly committed a crime, then his offense becomes a political abuse of power that can be addressed by Congress."}
{"original": "In that vein, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) promised to introduce a resolution in the House to censure Trump for the effort to steal the 2020 presidential election. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, a liberal ethics watchdog group, went further, calling on the House to immediately impeach the president again."}
{"original": "While the logistics of holding impeachment proceedings in the final two weeks of a presidency are admittedly hard to pull off, if this isn't impeachable conduct, then literally nothing is, Noah Bookbinder, CREW executive director, said in a statement."}
{"original": "The watchdog group is not solely focused on impeachment, as its lawyers are examining criminal statutes to determine whether to file a criminal complaint against the president."}
{"original": "Lieu said he believes Trump's actions amount to impeachable conduct, but he questions whether a second impeachment is necessary after Trump lost the election."}
{"original": "The purpose of impeachment is to remove the president and the American people already chose to do that in November, Lieu said"}
{"original": "The threatening phone call to Raffensperger in many ways mirrors the phone call Trump made to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in July 2019 that led to his impeachment. On the call with Zelensky, Trump pressured the foreign president to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Biden by threatening to withhold congressionally approved military aid from the country."}
{"original": "I would like you to do us a favor though, Trump told Zelensky after mentioning the military aid that Trump had illegally halted."}
{"original": "During the House impeachment hearings, Stanford Law School professor Pamela Karlan explained that Trump's abuse of office as it related to Ukraine simply foreshadowed the threat he posed to domestic affairs by seeking to extract concessions from state-level officials with threats of withholding federal money."}
{"original": "Imagine living in a part of Louisiana or Texas that's prone to devastating hurricanes and flooding, Karlan said. What would you think if you lived there and your governor asked for a meeting with the president to discuss getting disaster aid that Congress has provided for? What would you think if that president said, 'I would like you to do us a favor? I'll meet with you, and send the disaster relief, once you brand my opponent a criminal.'"}
{"original": "Trump did threaten to withhold coronavirus aid from states with governors who spoke negatively about him. And now, Trump is threatening to brand and prosecute Raffenperger as a criminal in order to get the secretary of state to help him to steal the election."}
{"original": "One reason to pursue a criminal investigation, regardless of whether Trump believes his own lies, is because the scope of the president's effort to steal the election is not yet known."}
{"original": "The question is we've got this one tape, but how many other people received this call? Spaulding said. How many state legislatures received this call? What other secretaries of states, election officials received this call? Who else in the White House was involved?"}
{"original": "I find it hard to believe that Donald Trump called just one secretary of state, Lieu said, adding that the FBI should investigate any other calls they uncover."}
{"original": "An investigation could be led by Congress, the FBI, a special counsel appointed by the attorney general, or state-level prosecutors in Georgia."}
{"original": "It would not be extraordinary for the incoming Biden administration to open an investigation into criminal wrongdoing by the outgoing administration."}
{"original": "President George W. Bush's attorney general, John Ashcroft, appointed James Comey as special counsel in 2001 to investigate President Bill Clinton's last-minute pardon of tax-dodging investor Marc Rich after Rich's wife made political and charitable donations that benefited Clinton. Attorney General Eric Holder, serving under President Barack Obama, appointed special counsel John Durham to investigate the torture program run by the CIA under the Bush administration."}
{"original": "[The Biden administration] should let law enforcement do its job and pursue investigation, Lieu said. Once they get the facts they should let prosecutors decide what they want to do with it."}
{"original": "Anyone who studies The Wealth Of Nations hoping to glean insights on the mysteries and mechanics of the stock market will be disappointed. Adam Smith didn't discuss stock exchanges anywhere in the 1,100-plus pages of his foundational capitalist treatise. Nor did Karl Marx feel compelled to include the stock market among the damning contradictions and irrationalities of the capitalist system documented in Das Kapital."}
{"original": "The bestselling economics textbook ever written ― Paul Samuelson's adventurously titled Economics ― devotes just five of its 608 pages to the stock market, drawing the unhelpful conclusion: Anyone who can accurately predict the future course of business will prosper, but there is no such person."}
{"original": "Yet nothing captivates Americans like the stock market. We gape at the great fortunes won and lost on the exchanges, and broadcast the Dow Jones' minor movements on the nightly news. This week's wild swings in the market have alternately thrilled and alarmed us."}
{"original": "The stock market is a good story ― one of the best. But it doesn't mean what most people think it does. The stock market is not an important measure of national well-being, productive capacity or material wealth. It isn't even a reliable gauge for the health of specific companies, and is only tangentially related to helping them raise capital. The most iconic contemporary capitalist institution is, in truth, inessential to the operation of capitalism itself. The stock market, in the words of the late British economist John Maynard Keynes, is merely the outcome of the mass psychology of a large number of ignorant individuals."}
{"original": "The basics: A stock exchange is where people go to buy and sell shares of corporations. Buying stock gives you an ownership stake in a company, but this stake itself has no inherent value. It doesn't entitle you to proceeds from the firm's earnings, or provide you with a stream of revenue. The stock is worth whatever you can get somebody else to pay for it."}
{"original": "Companies issue stock to raise money for personnel, equipment, research and everything else that goes into providing goods and services. But after the stock is issued, its price is no longer directly involved in corporate finance. A company doesn't see any additional revenue when its stock price increases, or lose cash when it falls. Stock prices are determined by bidders in the stock market ― whatever a willing buyer and seller agree on ― and the profits and losses on stock accrue to those speculators."}
{"original": "Spencer Platt via Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 6 during a wild day of market swings."}
{"original": "We like to think that stock prices are closely connected to events in the real world, and that the values the market assigns are the concrete, reliable assessments of experts. As the market has rocketed this way and that this week, the commentariat has scrambled into action to explain the deeper meaning. Money magazine attributed Monday's sell-off to new inflation data. MarketWatch told its readers to keep their eye on the yield curve of Treasury bonds. The Guardian, with a bit more precision, explained that investors expect higher interest rates from the Fed."}
{"original": "But none of this is really true. When Keynes bemoaned the ignorance of stock traders more than 80 years ago, he wasn't insulting their education. He was pointing out that any precise value judgments about a company's future prospects require knowledge of the future ― something nobody possesses."}
{"original": "A fall in oil prices might signal a profit boost for a shipping company, but not if political instability disrupts its trade route. The meaning and value of each new piece of data that traders evaluate is dependent on a flood of unknowable future data."}
{"original": "The point is that stock traders don't respond to new information, they respond to each other. When they bid on stock prices, traders aren't stating their beliefs about the true value of a company, but making inferences about how to play the reactions of other traders, who, in turn, are doing the same thing. When corporate earnings come in unexpectedly high, traders expect the stock to go up and bid accordingly. It has very little to do with a company's long-term or even near-term prospects. It's just what people do."}
{"original": "This means that the value of a company's stock, while based on an enormous amount of information, is inherently unstable and essentially arbitrary."}
{"original": "At the moment, a lot of people believe that the stock market is overvalued ― although this idea itself wrongly assumes there is some real stock market value that the market has pulled away from. Years of low interest rates from the Federal Reserve have discouraged people from buying interest-bearing bonds and spurred purchases of stock instead. When the GOP cut corporate taxes, it created the prospect of companies paying out dividends to shareholders or buying back stock to drive up the price. The Fed is now steadily raising interest rates, and plenty of stock experts think traders have gotten a little carried away with tax-cut enthusiasm. And so, while the economic data is pretty good, there is a consensus in some quarters that the market is due for dip."}
{"original": "This doesn't necessarily tell us anything about the real world, so more cautious economic analysts like Neil Irwin at The New York Times urge their readers to focus not on stock price swings, but on economic fundamentals ― things like employment, wages and interest rates ― in assessing the country's economic prospects. And if the stock market were, in fact, nothing more than a lightly regulated casino, this would be the end of the story."}
{"original": "But over the past half-century, we have instead imbued the stock market with an almost cosmic significance. We use stock prices to evaluate the performance of corporate executives. Business schools teach aspiring young men and women that shareholder value is the only appropriate pursuit for corporate leaders."}
{"original": "Because the business world believes stock prices reflect deep metaphysical truths about the state of commerce, big movements in the stock market do, in fact, affect real-world decisions about trade. Even if its revenues are strong, a company might pull back on major investments in the face of a declining stock market, worried about pessimism over corporate prospects in general. Bankers looking at a stock slump might decide to withhold loans from perfectly responsible businesses. Even if it's an ideal time to upgrade its equipment or expand its operations, a company might decide to be tight-fisted about expenses to prove its fiscal discipline to shareholders when the stock price is low."}
{"original": "Most alarming, we have made the financial security of the elderly almost completely dependent on stock market values by making 401k plans and mutual funds the flagship operations of our retirement system. The value of your nest egg is dependent not on your thrift or prudence, but on when you happen to invest, and when you need to cash out."}
{"original": "But even with that, only about half of all Americans own stock, either directly or indirectly through retirement accounts. And the vast majority of stocks ― over 86 percent, according to People's Policy Project President Matt Bruenig ― are owned by the richest 10 percent of households. To the extent that the strange casino of the stock market does, in fact, create wealth, it almost exclusively circulates it among the rich."}
{"original": "The idea of using proceeds from business wealth to secure the well-being of society at large is, however, a good one. Instead of tying wealth to the speculative whims of the stock market, we might bind it directly to the productive activities of business. Instead of having individuals save for retirement by purchasing stock, we could have companies that are turning a profit pay a special dividend into a public fund. We could even call it a tax."}
{"original": "Win McNamee via Getty Images House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Democrats proposed a paid leave program to deal with the fallout from coronavirus."}
{"original": "Workers affected by the coronavirus outbreak may soon be able to take advantage of the first nationwide paid leave program in the U.S. if Congress can agree on the plan."}
{"original": "Late Wednesday, House Democrats unveiled a big legislative package to address the public health and economic threats posed by COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The bill includes a government-funded program that would reimburse eligible workers who lost wages because they were unable to work during the crisis."}
{"original": "The bill also includes a provision that would establish a future nationwide paid sick leave program ― prompting howls of protest from Republicans."}
{"original": "Democrats and Republicans have been unable to agree on a federal paid leave program for years, but some form of the bill stands a chance of passing due to the damage the virus is doing to the economy. Many Republicans who've opposed such programs in the past agree something must be done to keep money flowing into workers' pockets as business slows."}
{"original": "The bill includes provisions for 14 days of emergency leave for workers who are either diagnosed with COVID-19 or quarantined because of the virus. Crucially, workers would also qualify if they must care for others who are sick or stuck at home, including because of school closures."}
{"original": "The benefits would be administered and paid directly to workers by the Social Security Administration, and capped at two-thirds of a person's monthly earnings, not to exceed $4,000. If a worker already receives sick leave benefits from their job or state government, they would still be eligible for the new federal benefit minus what they're already receiving."}
{"original": "Workers can apply for the reimbursement retroactively, meaning people who are already quarantined or missing work to take care of someone would be able to receive a later payment for their time off."}
{"original": "The plan differs from earlier proposals in that it creates temporary, emergency funding specifically to deal with the coronavirus. It also includes a permanent mandate that employers provide sick leave in the future."}
{"original": "Under the bill, employers would have to let workers gradually accrue up to seven paid sick days per year. Those days could also be used to care for family members who are sick, or deal with domestic violence-related issues."}
{"original": "Employers would also be required to provide 14 days of sick leave immediately in the event of a public health emergency like the current one. Large employers would have to pay for those 14 emergency days, while smaller employers (defined as 50 or fewer workers) would be reimbursed by the government."}
{"original": "The fact that the U.S. has no national paid sick leave policy has become a huge issue during the coronavirus crisis."}
{"original": "The potential problem with including permanent paid sick leave in the package is that it could hinder the bill's passage and gum up the works, said Claudia Sahm, director of macroeconomic policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. I have concerns it'll slow down the process and more people will get hurt than need to get hurt, Sahm said."}
{"original": "Those parts of the plan are already drawing real pushback from Republicans, who generally hate employer mandates. Democrats proposed an emergency sick leave plan last week that included those provisions, and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) spoke out against it on the Senate floor Wednesday and prevented it from being fast-tracked."}
{"original": "Alexander said he was open to a paid sick leave program to deal with coronavirus and thought it was a good idea. But he said the government should have to foot the bill, not employers. Employees are struggling, our employers are struggling, and it's not a cure for the coronavirus to put a big new expensive federal mandate on employers, he said."}
{"original": "It's possible Republicans like Alexander would support an emergency fund but demand that the permanent mandate be dropped from the House package. A spokesperson for the senator said Thursday that he had nothing to add beyond his comments on the Senate floor."}
{"original": "Proponents of paid leave programs were happy to see a potential deal coming together, even if the final details weren't clear."}
{"original": "This is an extremely substantial step toward addressing the very real and immediate needs of this emergency and setting up a system for paid sick days for the future so people won't face this risk again, said Vicki Shabo, a senior fellow at The New America Foundation and paid leave expert."}
{"original": "Some economists worried that the funding provisions for the plan would prove too complicated to enact quickly. It might take a while to get set up, said Jay Shambaugh, director of the Hamilton Project. He suggested giving companies a tax break to offset the cost."}
{"original": "The bill does say that small businesses would be compensated for the costs of providing 14 days of emergency leave."}
{"original": "Samuel Corum via Getty Images President Donald Trump hinted Wednesday that the White House would support some kind of paid leave program."}
{"original": "The House is scheduled to vote on the bill on Thursday, which will likely pass with mostly Democratic support. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called the legislation completely partisan and unworkable."}
{"original": "It's not clear if the bill can get through the Senate. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Thursday morning that the Democratic bill is an ideological wish list that was not tailored closely to the circumstances."}
{"original": "Regarding the paid leave provision, McConnell said the proposal appears to impose permanent unfunded mandates on businesses that could cause massive job losses and put thousands of small businesses at risk."}
{"original": "Thursday could be the last day to pass legislation before lawmakers leave Washington for a planned recess next week."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump, meanwhile, seemed to hint that the White House would support emergency paid sick and family leave in his Oval Office address Wednesday night."}
{"original": "To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief, he said. This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus."}
{"original": "The administration, however, hasn't offered any detail. A White House spokesman could not provide any as of Thursday morning."}
{"original": "The fact that the U.S. has no national paid sick leave policy has become a huge issue during the coronavirus crisis, shining a light on a safety net gap long highlighted by Democrats and progressives."}
{"original": "The lack of paid sick leave is an urgent problem for low-income workers in the service industries, who are particularly at-risk during the current crisis."}

{"original": "The Internal Revenue Code includes provisions that impose severe punishments for criminal offenses, such as intentional attempts to evade income taxes. Section 7201 authorizes jail sentences of up to five years and fines of as much as $100,000, or both, plus prosecution costs, for each fraudulent return."}
{"original": "The harsh sanctions imposed on tax evaders didn't deter real estate tycoon Leona Helmsley, who learned the hard way not to tangle with the IRS. The New York businesswoman's evasion efforts secured her an enduring place in the pantheon of tax cheats, alongside such miscreants as mobster Al Capone and baseball stars Pete Rose and Darryl Strawberry."}
{"original": "Leona had a widely-reported reputation for mistreating people, particularly her hotel employees, that earned her the sobriquet Queen of Mean. She was unyielding in her unwillingness to allow an unpleasant thought to go unexpressed."}
{"original": "Leona is best remembered for an indiscreet comment to Elizabeth Baum, a housekeeper at the Helmsley home: We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes. Perhaps our queen was inspired by another queen whose reign was cut short (pun intended) in 1793."}
{"original": "The testimony of the former housekeeper helped Uncle Sam convict the premier hotelier on charges of evading taxes of several million dollars. The centerpiece of her evasion scheme was to offset hotel profits with illegally-billed invoices for remodeling and other expenditures. Actually, the outlays were nondeductible personal expenses, mostly improvements to Dunnellen Hall, a 21-room mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, that she shared as a weekend retreat with husband Harry Helmsley, the builder of a real-estate fortune over half a century."}
{"original": "Leona faced the charges alone. An enfeebled Harry was unfit to stand trial. He died in 1997."}
{"original": "Unsurprisingly, the media-savvy feds ordered Leona to report to prison on tax day, April 15, 1992, to serve a four-year sentence. The mogul was released after serving 19 months at Club Fed."}
{"original": "Jail time didn't cramp the style of someone like Leona, whose sprawling property portfolio included the iconic Empire State building. At the time of her death in 2007, her assets aggregated slightly south of $5 billion, putting her right up there with The Donald."}
{"original": "She wrote a will that left most of Harry's fortune to charities and named four executors. All of them proved to be equally rapacious in the execution of their duties; more on that in a moment."}
{"original": "Like Jarndyce versus Jarndyce (a fictional court case from the novel Bleak House by Charles Dickens that has become a byword and metaphor for seemingly interminable legal proceedings), the unwinding of Leona's estate has generated lots of billable hours. The protracted litigation has been closely covered by, among others, the Wall Street Journal. A Journal article of January 22, 2016, details a New Fight Over Helmsley Fortune."}
{"original": "A $l00 million fee sought by the estate's four executors for work done so far 'is astronomical' and 'should be cut, potentially by about 90 percent, 'says the New York State Attorney General. The attorney general's court filing adds that an hourly rate a few dollars north of $6,400 is, by any definition, exorbitant, unreasonable and improper...The fight over executor fees stems in part from the will's lack of clarity. It doesn't specify how the executor fees should be calculated."}
{"original": "So, people, why is a federal tax columnist like me chronicling a squabble over the administration of an estate that is playing out in a Manhattan courtroom? One reason is that the IRS has a dog in this fight. For estate tax purposes, fees charged by executors and other administrative expenses are deductible."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden plans to unveil a sweeping immigration bill on Day One of his administration, hoping to provide an eight-year path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. without legal status, a massive reversal from the Trump administration's harsh immigration policies."}
{"original": "The legislation puts Biden on track to deliver on a major campaign promise important to Latino voters and other immigrant communities after four years of President Donald Trump's restrictive policies and mass deportations. It provides one of the fastest pathways to citizenship for those living without legal status of any measure in recent years, but it fails to include the traditional trade-off of enhanced border security favored by many Republicans, making passage in a narrowly divided Congress in doubt."}
{"original": "Expected to run hundreds of pages, the bill is set to be introduced after Biden takes the oath of office Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the legislation and granted anonymity to discuss it."}
{"original": "As a candidate, Biden called Trump's actions on immigration an unrelenting assault on American values and said he would undo the damage while continuing to maintain border enforcement."}
{"original": "Under the legislation, those living in the U.S. as of Jan. 1, 2021, without legal status would have a five-year path to temporary legal status, or a green card, if they pass background checks, pay taxes and fulfill other basic requirements. From there, it's a three-year path to naturalization, if they decide to pursue citizenship."}
{"original": "For some immigrants, the process would be quicker. So-called Dreamers, the young people who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children, as well as agricultural workers and people under temporary protective status could qualify more immediately for green cards if they are working, are in school or meet other requirements."}
{"original": "The bill is not as comprehensive as the last major immigration overhaul proposed when Biden was vice president during the Obama administration."}
{"original": "For example, it does not include a robust border security element, but rather calls for coming up with strategies. Nor does it create any new guest worker or other visa programs."}
{"original": "It does address some of the root causes of migration from Central America to the United States, and provides grants for workforce development and English language learning."}
{"original": "Biden is expected to take swift executive actions to reverse other Trump immigration actions, including an end to the prohibition on arrivals from several predominantly Muslim countries."}
{"original": "During the Democratic primary, Biden consistently named immigration action as one of his day one priorities, pointing to the range of executive powers he could invoke to reverse Trump's policies."}

{"original": "9:30 a.m. — I hear some neighbors outside and my roommate up and about. I decide it's time to start the weekend. I'm usually a very early bird — I love to get up before the sun and have time for quiet, coffee, breakfast, etc. — but I was up really late last night and slept in today."}
{"original": "9:45 a.m. — Make a pot of coffee and heat up breakfast. I have leftover whole-wheat banana bread topped with peanut butter, plus an orange and some sesame honey cashews. And coffee. I bring it back to bed and eat while I read a few New York Times articles and catch up on Bravo shows I've missed this week. Not a bad start to the day!"}
{"original": "11:30 a.m. — Text my friend about our plans for the afternoon. She's my best friend and lives right down the block from me, but we've both had busy weeks and haven't seen each other. I'm ready for some girl time!"}

{"original": "12 p.m. — Parking is crazy where we planned to go, so we detour to a local brewery we've never been to. It was a little bit of a hike but the beer was awesome. We chat about the book she's writing and admire the strangely violent murals on the walls. I pay. $23"}
{"original": "3 p.m. — I'm hangry when I get home, so I make the quickest thing I can think of: rye toast and eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese, and hazelnut chocolate for dessert."}
{"original": "4 p.m. — I've been feeling super strange lately, kind of unsure of myself, insecure, self-critical, like I don't even know myself or what I want. Even though I love spending time with my best friend, she is so sure of herself and confident that I sometimes feel unsteady in comparison. I remind myself to contact a counseling office I've bookmarked to schedule an appointment. I can't tell if these are normal late-20s feelings or if I'm really struggling. I turn on Gilmore Girls to comfort myself and try not to get too wrapped up in my head. I've gotta get it together for a date tonight!"}

{"original": "5 p.m. — Hop in the shower and get ready for my date. I cannot decide what to wear (see struggling feelings above) and try on approximately three outfits before settling on an old faithful: a black jumpsuit with a chunky cardigan. Curl my hair and put on a little makeup."}

{"original": "8:30 a.m. — Wake up, make coffee, and toast a TJ's multigrain bagel for breakfast. I put clarified french butter on one side (I don't even know what really this is, but damn is it good!) and peanut butter on the other. I also grab an apple. Somehow, I threw out my back between last night and this morning, so I hobble around a little bit. I scheduled a barre class through ClassPass for later today. If I cancel, I have to pay a fee of $15 so I hope it feels better soon."}

I also stop at Target for paper towels, sponges, and one of those assorted cereal packs my family used to bring on vacation. I'm going to make cereal milk ice cream! ($11.59) The last stop is Trader Joe's for frozen leeks, broccoli florets, parsnips, and heavy cream ($12.14). $84.53"}

I would love to stay home or go out for a beer with my friend, but I remind myself that this money will help pay for my beach trip! Plus, we don't have school tomorrow because it's MLK Jr. Day, so I can sleep in a little."}
{"original": "12:15 a.m. — Home, and so damn tired. I wash my face, put on PJs, and head to bed."}
{"original": "8:15 a.m. — Up and at 'em! I'm feeling strangely motivated when I wake up, so after I put in my contacts, wash my face, and brush my teeth, I do a deep clean of the bathroom and throw in a load of laundry. Then on to coffee and a comforting bowl of oatmeal with bananas, dates, chia, flax and peanut butter. I also churn the ice cream I made yesterday and stick it in the freezer."}
{"original": "9 a.m. — I'm feeling stressed about this beach trip. I kind of wish that I hadn't agreed to it and had instead devoted the money to a new trip somewhere different this year, but I got swept in. This was an instance when I definitely could have practiced being more assertive instead of going with the flow, which is my natural inclination. I know it will be a ton of fun when I get there, though."}
{"original": "9:30 a.m. — Wash the huge pile of dishes in the sink, then do some more cooking for the week: Joy the Baker's turkey meatballs, broccoli with garlic and olive oil, and farro."}
{"original": "11 a.m. — Shower and get ready for the day. I drive downtown to spend the afternoon in a few of my favorite Smithsonian museums, but as soon as I get there I realize that may not be possible. There is not single a parking spot to be found for blocks! I'm still glad to drive around and swing by the Dr. MLK Jr. memorial on this holiday."}
{"original": "12:15 p.m. — Instead of my museum plan, I take myself out to one of my favorite restaurants for a burger and a toasted marshmallow milkshake. Seriously, it's heaven on earth. I didn't order fries but I think the cashier made a mistake (or was really nice/flirty!) and gave me some! I sit by the window and read my book, The Sound and the Fury, and people watch while I eat. I leave feeling full but satisfied. $13.89"}
{"original": "2 p.m. — Call my dad on the drive home and vent about feeling down. He is a great listener and knows exactly what to say."}
{"original": "2:30 p.m. — Take a long, hot bubble bath with my book and a can of sparkling water — one of my favorite self-care activities. I also spend like 15 minutes feeling the feelings (read: crying uncontrollably), but I feel a lot better after."}
{"original": "3:15 p.m. — Paint my nails and watch a few episodes of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Why didn't I start this show sooner?! The script, wardrobe, and acting are all so good. Also, Tony Shalhoub!"}
{"original": "5:15 p.m. — Snack on an apple, still kind of full from lunch. Feeling fancy, I put on two face masks in a row — a fun, peel-off one followed by one from The Ordinary that makes me look like a newborn alien."}
{"original": "7 p.m. — Prep snacks for me and my friend to eat; she's coming over to watch The Bachelor tonight. I cut up veggies, cheese, leftover banana bread, and pop a big bowl of stovetop popcorn. I never watch The Bachelor on the night of, so this is a treat! I also definitely need some social time (but there was no way was I putting on a bra and/or real pants again today)."}
{"original": "10 p.m. — I love my friend. She gives great advice and is so funny and supportive. We had a blast judging Arie's awkward kisses and catching up on each other's weeks."}
{"original": "10:30 p.m. — My nighttime skincare routine is already done; all that's left is to take out my contacts and hop into bed. Getting up for work tomorrow will not be easy…"}
{"original": "5:45 a.m. — Wake up and get going with the morning routine. Put my contacts in, remember to take my calcium pill (I never know if it helps), wash my face, etc. I put on a pot of coffee and make my bed, then start putting on skincare stuff and decide on an outfit and breakfast. It's going to be a balmy 40 degrees today after a brutally cold weekend, so I decide to wear ankle-length pants. I like to live on the edge."}
{"original": "6:30 a.m. — Sip on my first cup of coffee and pack up my lunch for work. I have a really tasty breakfast that I hope will fill me up for a busy morning: TJ's multigrain bagel (half with butter and half with peanut butter) with two fried eggs, and a sliced pear. I also look over my weekend spending on Mint, something I do every morning, if not multiple times per day. I could probably ease up a little bit on this, but I stress out about money so much that tracking every penny of my spending gives me some peace of mind."}
{"original": "6:45 a.m. — I need to leave a few minutes early to fill my gas tank on the way to work. I live in D.C. but work in the suburbs of Virginia, so I have a pretty long commute. I just started listening to Jeffery Eugenides' new short story collection, so the drive isn't so bad today! $24.52"}
{"original": "7:30 a.m. — Get settled at work and drink my second cup of coffee from a travel mug. My job is really stressful sometimes, but I mostly love it. We have a department meeting first thing and plan for our upcoming registration. It's good to catch up with my coworkers after a long weekend and get back in a routine. There are murmurs of a possible snow day tomorrow, but I'm not counting my chickens!"}
{"original": "10:30 a.m. — I check on a student whose mental health I'm worried about, help another track down a spare textbook from a math teacher, and respond to parent emails. Then I meet with a new student and her dad to show her around the school and talk about the classes she will take."}
{"original": "12:45 p.m. — I was hungry for lunch about an hour ago, but I got sidetracked with students who needed to see me. Then I had to walk (read: escort) a student to in-school suspension. So goes the life of a school counselor! When I get back to my office, I see that my sweet coworker left me her soft pretzel; they come with school lunches but she didn't want hers and knows I love them. I eat that in approximately five seconds, then move on to the lunch I prepped yesterday while I read emails."}
{"original": "1:30 p.m. — I like something sweet in the afternoon, so I have a small apple and a piece of chocolate one of my students gave me for Christmas. I also make a cup of decaf coffee to sip on while I rush around to meetings this afternoon."}
{"original": "3:30 p.m. — Feeling so snacky today! I eat a little slice of leftover whole wheat banana bread and a few crackers with cheese. I always pack extra things like this in my lunchbox in case of a snack attack."}
{"original": "4:30 p.m. — I decide to run the few miles over to my ClassPass class tonight, which is a spin class at Flywheel. It's not too far and mostly downhill from my apartment — plus, parking is a nightmare near the studio. I tell myself I'll walk or take the bus home if I'm too pooped after class is over."}
{"original": "5:30 p.m. — Great spin class! I leave dripping in sweat, feeling strong and grateful for a body that is able to do lots of different things."}
{"original": "6:15 p.m. — Grab a free apple on the way out of the studio to sustain me for my walk home. My phone recently started to spontaneously die when the weather is cold, so I spend the quiet walk home making a to-do list in my head, thinking over the day, and wondering if we'll have a snow day tomorrow."}
{"original": "7 p.m. — Get home and start preparing vegetable pot pie for dinner! I'm using a Thug Kitchenrecipe, so it's vegan — except I use regular pie crust, because pie crust must have butter in my humble opinion. I just put it in the oven to bake when my friend calls. We're both smart ladies who love trashy reality television, so we chat for a bit about the finale of RelationShep on Bravo. She makes me laugh like crazy."}
{"original": "8 p.m. — Take a quick shower, put on PJs, and serve myself dinner. It is delicious! I finish the night off by taste testing some of the cereal milk ice cream from yesterday. Oh man, is it good. The buttery cereal crumble tears up the roof of my mouth a little bit, but that's a good problem to have, I think."}
{"original": "9:30 p.m. — Put on my retinol cream, take out my contacts, and hit the hay, hoping for a snow day tomorrow."}
{"original": "5:30 a.m. — Wake up to a text that we have a two-hour delay. I'll take that! I set my alarm for 7 and go back to sleep."}
{"original": "7 a.m. — I'm awake. It felt so good to sleep in and still beat my alarm. I make a pot of coffee and a more time-intensive breakfast: a bowl of oatmeal with chia, flax, cinnamon, half a banana, and a scoop of peanut butter. I eat, drink my coffee, read blogs, and check my budget. I'm still waiting on a return credit for a pricey jacket I returned a week or two ago, but it's not in yet. Grr! I check my email and see that the store is trying to send me a store credit card instead of refunding the money to my credit card. Frustrated, I email customer service to see what they can do. I see that a Madewell order for a pair of jeans I was waitlisted for went through. (The hassle of needing tall sizes!) I got them for a great deal during a 30% off sale, though, so I didn't mind waiting. I update my budget spreadsheet with these purchases. $59.48"}
{"original": "8 a.m. — Start getting ready for work. I have extra time and decide to put a few curls in my hair. Drink one more cup of coffee before leaving."}
{"original": "10 a.m. — Drop off my stuff in my office, then show my new student to all of her classes. Go to a meeting, see a few students, and prep for things happening next week."}
{"original": "12 p.m. — Eat lunch before I have to head down to cover the cafeteria. I eat the same things as yesterday plus an orange and carrots on the side."}
{"original": "1 p.m. — I have a meeting at our county office this afternoon, so I leave school. On my way I stop at one of my very favorite places: Wegmans! As a born and raised Rochesterian, this is a big deal for me, and definitely worth going out of my way through the Northern Virginia suburbs. I have plans to take myself to a movie tonight, which requires gummy candies and maybe chocolate. I pick and choose some favorites from the bulk section and also grab a twelve-pack of diet root beer, gum, a big bag of epsom salts, heavy cream, and malted milk powder to make more ice cream. Can't stop, won't stop. $20.61"}
{"original": "2:30 p.m. — Leave the county office and head home. I have the whole afternoon ahead of me! In a flash of creativity, I start brainstorming my maid of honor speech for my best friend's wedding. It's not until the fall but great memories and ideas popped into my brain randomly this afternoon. I make a voice recording on my phone so I don't forget!"}
{"original": "3:15 p.m. — Well, crap. Apparently Aritzia only gives store credit for returned sale items. I'm kicking myself for not checking the policy more carefully, and mad that I won't get the money back, which I wanted to put towards my larger than normal credit card bill this month. I guess it's good I have store credit, but I never even really shop here. Sigh. Lesson learned."}
{"original": "3:30 p.m. — Dust my apartment, Swiffer the floors, water my plant, fold laundry. I also pay a bill from my doctor's office. I thought I had a yeast infection last month (I didn't, thank goodness!) so my doctor ordered labs that insurance only partially covered. I try to have as many zero-spend days as possible in a month (which I'm doing a very bad job of this week). Since I've already spent money today, I figure I might as well check off this. $38.15"}
{"original": "4:15 p.m. — Getting pretty hungry so I eat leftover roasted sweet potatoes and watch an episode of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Take a break to call my best friend and wish her luck on a job interview. I make a batch of malted vanilla ice cream and a pan of boxed brownies that I'm going to chop up and mix in."}
{"original": "5 p.m. — Early bird dinner: leftover cauliflower fried rice and kung pao chicken."}
{"original": "5:30 p.m. — I'm feeling a little cooped up and I decide to get fresh air and exercise by walking 35-ish minutes down to the Loft store to see what's new. I don't need to buy anything immediately but I am in the market for a new skirt or two, a pair of work pants, and a sweater. It's freezing out so I walk quickly and get my heart pumping!"}
{"original": "6:30 p.m. — Struck out at Loft, which is a good thing for my budget. I decide it's too cold to walk to and from the movie theater like I planned. I'll have to see Call Me By Your Name another time. I head home and swing by the library to pick up a few more holds that came in."}
{"original": "7:30 p.m. — When I get home, I churn up my ice cream, adding the brownie pieces and a caramel swirl, and stick it in containers in the freezer to share with friends and coworkers. Then I take a bath, eat some of the movie gummies I bought earlier, flip through cookbooks, and listen to a podcast. I text my brother about coming over to pick up ice cream tomorrow, text a bit with a few friends, and do a little browsing on OkCupid."}
{"original": "9:15 p.m. — In bed reading my book. An early night is great with me! I remind myself to make plans with friends over the weekend; it will feel good to be a little more social after an introverted week."}
{"original": "5:45 a.m. — Up and starting my morning routine. I take my vitamin, put in my contacts, put on some serum and face oil, put some dry shampoo in my second day hair, and brush my teeth. Then I make coffee and pack my lunch."}
{"original": "6 a.m. — Do about 10 minutes of Duolingo practice while drinking coffee. I want to be more consistent with this habit — usually I'm great for about three weeks and then I totally stop. I'm visiting my brother in Paris in April, so that is motivation to practice my rusty high school French! I'm also trying to learn Spanish because a lot of the students and families I work with are from Latin America, so maybe I'll alternate which language I practice each day. I was taking a Spanish class but it got too expensive, so this will be a good free way to practice."}
{"original": "6:45 a.m. — Easy breakfast of two slices of whole wheat toast, one with peanut butter and one with butter, with a pear on the side. Get on the road to work a few minutes later than I was hoping to."}
{"original": "8 a.m. — Drink my second cup of coffee during my first meeting of the day."}
{"original": "11 a.m. — This morning has been crazy stressful. I'm trying to do ten things at once (see students, prep for registration, make schedule changes, plan a baby shower potluck for a coworker) and I feel like I'm not making progress on any of it. I'm already hungry at 11, so I eat an orange and crackers to tide me over until lunch, and keep plugging away."}
{"original": "12 p.m. — Lunch is leftover veggie pot pie with a spinach salad on the side. A little while after lunch, I eat a small apple and dark chocolate leftover from Christmas. I update my budget spreadsheet over lunch and read one of my favorite money-related websites, The Billfold."}
{"original": "5:15 p.m. — I have to meet with a student's parents and a teacher after school, which keeps me there way later than usual; it happens. My best friend asks if I can pick her up from campus on the way home. It's on my way and it's freezing out (she hates the cold!) so I tell her no problem. She stops at my apartment to pick up ice cream before heading home."}
{"original": "6 p.m. — I text a parent about tutoring her son and arrange to meet this Saturday. The extra money will be great!"}
{"original": "6:30 p.m. — Go over to my friend's apartment for dinner. She feeds me leftover baked ziti and salad, which obviously tastes amazing because it wasn't made by me! We drink a beer and plan a potential summer program for rising high-school seniors. She's a great writing teacher and we think we could make money by doing a weeklong college application and essay bootcamp together. We brainstorm for a while and half-watch what might be the worst show ever made, Hart of Dixie."}
{"original": "8:30 p.m. — Walk home, take a shower, and start winding down. I taste test a little bit of the ice cream I made yesterday. It is so good, oh my goodness. New favorite flavor. I bring my laptop in bed to watch an episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. I know better but every once in a while, I give in to the urge!"}
{"original": "5:45 a.m. — The usual morning routine commences."}
{"original": "6:15 a.m. — Pack up my lunch for today and make breakfast: multigrain toast, one with jam and one with butter, with two fried eggs and a few blackberries. And coffee, obviously. Check Mint, transfer my Venmo balance to my bank, and read blogs."}
{"original": "7:30 a.m. — Get to work a little early. Sip coffee in my travel mug and try to evaluate a few students' transcripts before a busy day of meetings. A sweet student gave me a Starbucks gift card yesterday for helping him with something, so I add that and a few others I had from Christmas to the app on my phone. Easier than juggling separate cards which very well could fall into the black hole that is my purse. Remind myself to write him a thank-you note later."}
{"original": "7:45 a.m. — Text with my friend who is considering getting bangs. I used to have super full bangs and loved them. Seeing the new Fifty Shades of Grey trailer has made me want them again in a big way. The movies may be problematic, but damn, Anastasia Steele has good hair! I remember how annoying bangs can be, though, especially once you decide you no longer want them. What to do?!"}
{"original": "12 p.m. — My coworkers and I actually are able to sit down for 20 minutes to eat lunch together. Miracle of miracles! I love chatting with them, but we're all so busy that it doesn't happen often. I have leftovers again and I'm looking forward to a new lunch next week. I eat quickly because I have to run to another meeting at 12:30."}
{"original": "1:45 p.m. — Snack on a few brownie pieces and an apple to power me through the rest of my afternoon meetings."}
{"original": "3:15 p.m. — So glad it's the weekend. I blast old school John Mayer on the drive home (embarrassing) and consider how I'd like to spend my evening."}
{"original": "4:30 p.m. — Change into workout clothes and go for a walk. It's beautiful out; the sun is setting and it's still in the low 50s. I stop by an ATM to deposit cash, then walk for 30 minutes or so. while chatting with my parents on the phone. This diary is making me realize how often I'm on the phone! I'm happy to stay connected with friends and family who live elsewhere but I know it's often a big distraction."}
{"original": "5:30 p.m. — Craving a huge salad for dinner, I make one with romaine, spinach, pistachios, goat cheese, and dried cranberries. With some popcorn on the side for a whole grain. Yum! I start season two of The Crown."}
{"original": "7:30 p.m. — Finish the night with the rest of my gummies and chocolate, and a big glass of water. My brother comes over for ice cream and we chat for a while. He works a crazy consulting job so I don't get to see him often. He seems so old and mature to me!"}
{"original": "9:30 p.m. — Wind down for the night, eager to finish my book. I'm feeling rested after a quiet couple of days, and I'm excited to have some more fun this weekend!"}

{"original": "If someone told you that you may be one of the more than five million Americans missing out on as much as $6,269 in your year-end paycheck, you'd almost certainly dismiss it as a fantasy or fraud, right? What if I said that you could get that boost from the IRS just for doing your job? It definitely sounds too good to be true, I know."}
{"original": "Fortunately, millions of working families actually can get a significant check from the federal government, thanks to the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). For more than 40 years, the EITC has been, by many accounts, the nation's most successful anti-poverty program. Last year, it lifted 6.5 million Americans out of poverty, including 3.3 million children, and reduced the severity of poverty for another 21.2 million qualifying workers. Studies show that the tax credit is used by working families to pay for necessary expenses like home and auto repairs and to boost earning power by getting more education. This in turn allows large numbers of single parents to leave welfare for work, saving taxpayers money."}
{"original": "Despite these benefits, more than 20 percent of people who qualify for the EITC fail to claim it. We think that's because many consumers are never made aware of the EITC due to a lack of reliable, affordable tax preparation resources in their communities."}
{"original": "January 27 is EITC Awareness Day, which is a perfect time to make sure that every American who qualifies for the EITC knows about it. That's why the National Consumers League is working to promote free tax preparation services like Baltimore's CASH Campaign, whose volunteers are ready to help educate the one in five workers who are missing out on this benefit. The Baltimore CASH Campaign is one of the 12,000 Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) programs that the IRS relies on to help qualifying individuals prepare and file their taxes, free of charge."}
{"original": "Working families making less than $64,000 per year can also take advantage of free name-brand tax preparation software offered through the IRS's Free File program. An added benefit of using resources like VITAs and Free File is that they can help taxpayers navigate a new wrinkle this tax season. Because of a new law designed to protect consumers from tax identity fraud, the IRS will hold refund checks until February 15 for consumers claiming the EITC. This is important, because there are likely to be unscrupulous tax preparers who promise they can get EITC-qualified taxpayers their refunds sooner than February 15. In reality, any money a consumer gets before February 15 will probably be in the form of a refund anticipation loan, which comes loaded with predatory fees."}

{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden promised Georgia voters that if they sent Democrats Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock to the Senate, he would send them $2,000 coronavirus relief checks."}
{"original": "Georgia Democrats delivered, and soon it will be time for Biden to step up."}
{"original": "Democrats' sweep of the Georgia runoff elections puts the party at an even 50-50 split in the Senate, and when Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is inaugurated on Jan. 20, she will have the tie-breaking vote."}
{"original": "Media outlets declared Warnock the winner early Wednesday morning over Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler, and Ossoff's win over David Perdue was projected Wednesday afternoon."}
{"original": "Democrats are now strategizing ways to pass immediate economic relief, like the checks, and potentially use procedural maneuvers through the budget process to bypass their Republican Senate colleagues and move legislation on their own terms."}
{"original": "This gives us an opportunity to have a very different set of choices and that's what the election was all about in Georgia last night, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) told HuffPost on Wednesday."}
{"original": "The $2,000 stimulus checks were part of Democrats' closing message in Georgia, as the COVID-19 pandemic has reached new horrors across the country."}
{"original": "Their election will put an end to the block in Washington on the $2,000 stimulus check, Biden said at an Atlanta rally over the weekend with Warnock and Ossoff. If you send Sen. Perdue and Loeffler back to Washington, those checks will never get there. It's just that simple. The power is literally in your hands."}
{"original": "On Wednesday morning, Biden reiterated that point in a statement claiming a mandate to move quickly on more relief."}
{"original": "Georgia's voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now, Biden said, adding that he wants to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get another relief measure."}
{"original": "I have long said that the bipartisan COVID-19 relief bill passed in December was just a down payment. We need urgent action on what comes next, because the COVID-19 crisis hits red states and blue states alike, the president-elect said."}
{"original": "The fight for $2,000 checks has been a tumultuous one for the past several months. Not long ago it was a rallying cry pushed by some of the most progressive members of Congress, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). But in the last month, President Donald Trump has vocalized his support for the effort, putting Republicans — who have been reluctant to spend more on COVID-19 relief — in a difficult political position."}
{"original": "With overwhelming bipartisan support, Congress passed a $900 billion coronavirus package in December that included $600 direct payments to Americans who made less than $75,000 in 2019. That legislation also funded unemployment insurance and loans for small businesses, among a host of other crucial relief measures."}
{"original": "Later that month, with Trump's backing and bipartisan support, the House passed a bill to increase those direct payments to $2,000. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) repeatedly blocked that bill from passing despite support from both Democratic and Republican senators. He dubbed the effort socialism for rich people because it would have sent checks to some higher earners."}
{"original": "With total control of Congress this year, however, Democrats will likely renew their push for $2,000 stimulus checks in the coming months, alongside a host of other provisions they had to concede in negotiations with Republicans, like a further extension of unemployment benefits. They will need every member of the Democratic caucus in the Senate on board as well as at least nine Republican senators to join them to overcome the chamber's 60-vote threshold and make it happen quickly."}
{"original": "One moderate Senate Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, recently expressed reservations about the impact of larger direct stimulus payments on the federal deficit. The House's $2,000 check legislation is projected to cost about $450 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation."}
{"original": "I would remind the president that under President Trump's watch, we have added more debt at a faster pace than ever since World War II. We have never done this. People need to know that, Manchin told a local West Virginia television station in December after Trump called on Congress to increase direct payments to $2,000."}
{"original": "Manchin's position on larger stimulus checks could change when his party controls the Senate. And there are also some Republicans who have expressed support for the measure. Notably, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) partnered with Sanders to lobby for the proposal, despite disapproval from his own party leadership. There will additionally be pressure on some Republicans up for reelection in 2022 to support the checks ― especially now that Trump has so vocally backed the idea."}
{"original": "Democrats could also try to move additional coronavirus relief via a wonky process known as budget reconciliation. Republicans turned to that process ― which can be used to pass bills on specific topics in accord with certain guidelines ― to push through their tax cuts in 2017."}
{"original": "At the very least, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) ― now the likely majority leader ― could schedule a floor vote on $2,000 checks."}
{"original": "It feels like a brand-new day. For the first time in six years, Democrats will operate a majority in the United States Senate ― and that will be very good for the American people, Schumer said in a statement on Wednesday after Warnock and Ossoff both declared victory."}
{"original": "For too long, much-needed help has been stalled or diluted by a Republican-led Senate and President Trump. That will change with a Democratic Senate, Democratic House, and a Democratic President, Schumer added."}
{"original": "Americans have already begun to receive the approved $600 payments — for many a critical boost of cash to cover essential bills. But poverty experts have pointed out that $600, while helpful, won't be enough to support the millions who have been unemployed or suffered cuts to their income since the pandemic took hold in March."}
{"original": "Microsoft announced Wednesday it would loan up to $500 million to address homelessness and help build affordable housing in the Seattle area, which has been plagued by skyrocketing real estate prices as tech companies have taken over the Emerald City."}
{"original": "The software giant, which isn't based in Seattle but nearby Redmond, said it would work to open up housing options for low- and middle-income workers almost immediately, with plans to invest the money within the next three years. It's the largest pledge in the company's history and comes on the heels of gangbuster profits for Microsoft under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella."}
{"original": "We believe everybody has a role to play, and everybody needs to play their role, Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, told The New York Times."}
{"original": "Smith told The Seattle Times the effort will benefit working families who teach our kids in schools, and put out the fires in our houses and keep us alive in the hospital. Officials told the newspaper that it was too early to say how many affordable units could be built with the funding, but Smith noted he hoped it would help create tens of thousands of new homes."}
{"original": "It is very difficult for folks earning what would be an average salary to buy what should be an average house, or rent, Dow Constantine, the King County executive, said in a video announcing the initiative. And that gap creates lots of costs for them individually and for all of us as a community."}
{"original": "As part of the effort, Microsoft will split up how it loans out the money. Some $225 million will be loaned at below-market interest rates to developers to spur construction of affordable housing, $250 million will go toward market-rate loans to low-income families around the region and $25 million more will be doled out as grants to housing affordability efforts."}
{"original": "The loans will go toward project all over the greater Seattle region, and Microsoft has said it hopes the investment will prompt other major companies to follow suit."}
{"original": "The move comes after Amazon, the Seattle region's other major tenant, moved to block a citywide tax meant to combat homelessness and housing affordability issues. Seattle passed the tax before officials repealed it last June amid warnings from Amazon that the measure would affect its bottom line. It would have required large companies to pay a per-employee tax to fund homeless services and housing construction by generating up to $50 million in revenue annually."}
{"original": "Seattle has the third-largest homeless population in America, behind New York City and Los Angeles, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. At the same time, home prices in the area have skyrocketed, nearly doubling in the past eight years, according to the Times."}

The tax, locally known as the IVA (impuesto al valor agregado), equaled an extra 21% charge each night. The tax should not appear on most prepaid bookings, but if it does, the property will adjust your bill to remove the charge at checkout. If the tax appears on your bill and is not automatically refunded, you are entitled to request reimbursement."}

Savvy travelers would then pay in cash upon arrival. Now that there is hardly any difference between the official and unofficial rates, travelers who shied away from on-the-street exchanges can get a fair exchange rate when using an ATM or credit card."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON — If Donald Trump thought his presidency so far has been harder than he expected, Nancy Pelosi's retaking of the gavel in the House of Representatives is about to make those first two years seem easy in comparison."}
{"original": "Instead of shielding Trump, his administration, his business and his family members from investigations, the California Democrat is expected to crank them into high gear. Instead of throttling legislation that is popular with the general public but makes Trump and Republicans look bad, she will pass it, and dare the Senate and Trump to oppose it."}
{"original": "I don't think the president or his team fully appreciate how miserable having a House Democratic majority will be, said one Republican consultant on condition of anonymity."}
{"original": "A former White House official said Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had told the president that a Pelosi speakership would actually be good for him."}
{"original": "He's only now realizing that Javanka misled him, the official said, also on condition of anonymity and using a nickname for the couple."}
{"original": "Trump made a surprise visit to the White House briefing room Thursday afternoon to congratulate Pelosi and to predict he would work well with her. I think it's actually going to work out. I think it will be a little bit different than what a lot of people are thinking, Trump said."}
{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS It seems like they haven't given much thought to the legislative headaches Pelosi could cause, said scholar Ramesh Ponnuru of the White House."}
{"original": "Ramesh Ponnuru, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, remained unpersuaded. He said that Trump's White House seems to understand the threat posed by Democrats' new ability to investigate using congressional hearings and subpoenas, but it seems like they haven't given much thought to the legislative headaches Pelosi could cause."}
{"original": "If Trump demands legislation important to him, Pelosi and Democrats could counter it with something they want."}
{"original": "If Trump pushes restrictions on immigration, as he has in the past, House Democrats could pass the comprehensive immigration bill that cleared the Senate in 2013, which includes a path to citizenship for those who entered this country illegally."}
{"original": "If Trump insists on funding for his border wall, Democrats could agree to pass it on the condition that the bill also include protection for special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Trump. Or a requirement that all presidential candidates produce 10 years of tax returns. Or both."}
{"original": "Democrats could also bring to the floor and pass proposals that are popular generally but that traditionally have been opposed by Republicans — and thereby force House Republicans to take a public stand on them."}
{"original": "Just increasing the minimum wage is an issue that's popular and that splits Trump's coalition, Ponnuru said."}
{"original": "The new Democratic House majority will likely not have much effect on Trump's own legislative agenda, primarily because he has not had much of one."}
{"original": "While Trump likes to boast about the tax cut bill, legislation rolling back regulations and his appointment of a record number of conservative appeals court judges, in reality, all of those likely would have happened with any Republican president working with a Republican Congress. The uniquely Trumpian elements of his agenda — such as cutting back on legal immigration or backing out of trade agreements — have not received much support at all from congressional Republican leaders in either chamber."}
{"original": "He didn't need or want much. He didn't ask in a serious way for much. And he didn't get much, Ponnuru said."}
{"original": "I don't think the president or his team fully appreciate how miserable having a House Democratic majority will be. Republican consultant"}
{"original": "In any event, Republicans' bigger concern now is the legislation originating in Pelosi's House. Raising the minimum wage, protecting Mueller, requiring tax returns of presidential candidates and offering a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, particularly those brought into the country as children, are all popular among the general public but have been blocked by Republican House leaders in the past."}
{"original": "When those or similar bills pass the House, the only thing stopping them from passing Congress could well be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell."}
{"original": "All eyes should be on Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell understands the implications of House Democratic control even though the White House doesn't, said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida. McConnell's full-time role is going to be preventing legislation from getting to the president."}
{"original": "It's a role he has already started playing. When Pelosi announced that the first legislation to pass under her leadership would be bills ending the partial government shutdown — bills that had already won strong Republican support in the Senate last year — McConnell quickly responded that he would not bring them to the floor because Trump would not sign them."}
{"original": "In an interview with CNN, McConnell said he was waiting for Trump to come to an agreement with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, since he needs seven Democratic votes to pass legislation. So, I haven't been sidelined, McConnell said. It's just that there's no particular role for me when you have this setup."}
{"original": "Jolly said he is not sure that explanation will pass the straight-face test with bills that clearly have enough bipartisan support to pass McConnell's chamber. There will be a moment when the votes are there in the Senate, and McConnell doesn't let it pass, he said."}
{"original": "Stan Collender, who for decades worked on Capitol Hill as a budget committee staffer, said that dynamic could be a dangerous one for Trump. Looks like McConnell is willing to take the bullet for Trump so far, Collender said. If and when that changes, this will become a real shit show for the White House. That will be the real loss of the Trump base."}
{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Britain's Prince William and natural historian Sir David Attenborough, watch the screening of Attenborough's new documentary Our Planet at Davos. Climate change may be a theme at the gathering, but a new poll finds it's less a priority for business."}
{"original": "DAVOS, Switzerland ― With all the evidence of a coming climate catastrophe, which threatens the very future of civilization, one would expect humanity to put every effort into solving the crisis. But time and again, we see how difficult it is for the majority of people to rise to the challenge."}
{"original": "This is particularly true of the business community, which in the West is built largely on ensuring that the next quarter's profits roll in to keep shareholders happy and result in executive bonuses."}
{"original": "A telling piece of evidence presented at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting this week in Davos is hidden away in a flagship survey of 1,378 chief executives from more than 90 countries. It shows that concerns about climate change and environmental damage have sharply fallen over the past year."}
{"original": "In 2018, the annual poll by professional services provider PwC showed a rather paltry 31 percent of chief executives were extremely concerned by climate change. The problem then barely squeezed into the top 10 perceived threats, below issues such as increasing tax burdens and the availability of key skills."}
{"original": "But this year, with rising alarm over trade threats and populism, only 19 percent of business leaders highlighted the risks of climate change, which fell to 13th place on their list of priorities."}
{"original": "I am rather shocked by this, said Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, visibly shaken when I showed her the PwC results. By focusing on short term profits, they are missing this moment in history. For me, we are at a moment where we need to step back and look deeply into ourselves and how we stand as a species and internalize the state of emergency and then decide if we want to be on the right side of history or not."}
{"original": "The fact that CEOs' biggest concern in the PwC report is overregulation tells me they do not understand and have not read the IPPC report on climate change. The report, published in October by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, found that the world is rapidly running out of time for avoiding catastrophic climate change."}
{"original": "Many CEOs believe in their minds that if they are talking about climate change and creating some initiatives around it, then they are taking care of it, Morgan said. But because they have not faced up to the issue for so long, she added, we need a whole different approach with all hands on deck. There is a point of no return where we cannot turn back the impacts and the world can be overrun by runaway climate change."}
{"original": "Morgan called for young people to rise up and engage in nonviolent direct action to bring this message to corporate leaders in a different way."}
{"original": "Christiana Figueres, the architect of the Paris climate agreement and now the convener of Mission 2020, a global initiative to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, said she was hugely disappointed CEOs failed to see the gravity of the situation. Especially, she added, when there are enormous opportunities from tackling climate change."}
{"original": "Businesses are in the position they are as a result of a focus on quarterly profit statements. If you plan corporate strategy around this, then this is the result you get, Figueres said."}
{"original": "Business leaders are not alone in failing to focus on longer-term dangers at the expense of what is currently in their face, Figueres added. We all do this. We tend to focus on the exceedingly urgent short term rather than the much larger consequences over the longer term."}
{"original": "Figueres used the metaphor of a doctor telling someone they may suffer a heart attack in the future unless they start now to exercise more and eat healthier food. Despite this, the patient often ignores the advice and focuses on more immediate obligations."}
{"original": "This interpretation is supported by the research of Daniel Gilbert, a psychology professor at Harvard University, who found that humans are not wired to deal effectively with long-term problems."}
{"original": "In an interview with NPR, Gilbert said we are much more likely to take alarm at terrorism. Global warming, he said, is not something that threatens us this afternoon, but rather something that threatens us in the ensuing decades."}

{"original": "antpkr via Getty Images Many with diabetes, faced with tripling insulin prices, are now forced to choose between life and rent."}
{"original": "It's hard to remember now, but there once was a time when pharmaceutical companies were considered heroes, not villains."}
{"original": "In the 1920s, Dr. Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered insulin could be purified and administered to diabetes patients via injection. Before this groundbreaking discovery, people living with diabetes were placed on starvation diets as a form of treatment, and many patients died."}
{"original": "Banting and Best understood the enormity of their discovery and considered insulin a public good. But as these researchers soon realized, insulin wouldn't be able to save lives if patients couldn't access it. They sold the rights to the drug to the University of Toronto for $1. The university, in turn, gave it to pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly for a 5 percent royalty so the company could manufacture at scale to meet the enormous demand. In 1923, insulin became widely available and saved countless lives, thanks to Banting and Best – and Eli Lilly."}
{"original": "Now, just under a century later, Eli Lilly and other insulin manufacturers are taking the exact opposite approach."}
{"original": "Big Pharma is pushing every scheme imaginable to squeeze money from the pockets of patients who need insulin to survive. Many with diabetes, faced with tripling insulin prices ($200 to $700 per month), are now forced to choose between life and rent. Some patients ― like 26-year-old Alec Raeshawn Smith, who aged out of his parents' health insurance plan and whose job didn't offer comprehensive coverage ― have died from a lack of affordable insulin."}
{"original": "Pharmaceutical companies can become heroes again, but only if they stop taking advantage of the patients who need them."}
{"original": "Eli Lilly says the company strives to make life better for all those affected by diabetes around the world. And because drug companies do save and improve lives (or, at least, are supposed to), the U.S. government allows them special privileges and protections. This includes tax breaks, government subsidies, extensive patent protection, free access to publicly funded scientific discoveries and more."}
{"original": "However, when drug companies use empty words to make promises they have no intentions of honoring, they do not deserve the public's largesse."}
{"original": "Big Pharma has not shown any inclination to change its price gouging practices. On the contrary, drug companies continue to push higher costs despite the horrific impact this has both on human life and the U.S. economy. Price freezes in the U.S. are rare (and are exclusively voluntary). They also tend to be set at high levels, like the price freeze for the HIV drug Isentress, which caused a stir among HIV patients because of its exorbitant cost compared to competitive products."}
{"original": "jetcityimage via Getty Images Price gouging by pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly is preventing patients from accessing the medications they need to survive."}
{"original": "Some companies have rolled back drug prices but typically only in response to public humiliation. Doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering publicly rejected Sanofi's Zaltrap, a colon cancer drug, because it was priced twice as high as a competing product. Three weeks after the doctors' announcement, Sanofi cut its price in half. This is why consumers shouldn't be satisfied with price freezes; only rolling back prices will return us to reasonable drug costs."}
{"original": "Pharmaceutical companies do sometimes offer solutions to runaway drug prices, like value-based pricing and discount cards, but though these practices may help some, they are generally gimmicks meant to distract the public. Value-based pricing sets prices according to a drug's perceived value rather than according to the actual costs of developing and manufacturing it. Such a practice can put a limit on the price of marginally effective drugs, but on the other hand, it increases the price of medications like insulin ― drugs that save lives but have been around for years and are cheap to produce. Discount cards are sometimes offered to a small subset of insured patients and do very little to help the vast majority of users or those who need the drugs most."}
{"original": "In the U.S., our 20 top-selling medications cost consumers three times more than the exact same drugs cost in Britain. I once paid $36 for a medication in Canada that costs me more than $700 here at home. In many European countries, government committees calculate reference prices for classes of drugs with similar ingredients, based on the costs to develop and manufacture them and their clinical effectiveness. That said, it's probably not realistic to expect our politicians to agree to this kind of approach; in the U.S., pharmaceutical companies are some of the largest contributors to political campaigns, giving more than $2.3 billion over the past 10 years."}
{"original": "Big Pharma is pushing every scheme imaginable to squeeze money from the pockets of patients who need insulin to survive."}
{"original": "Our legislators, too afraid to challenge Big Pharma's pocketbooks, continue to propose tepid solutions, like price transparency, that only work around the edges. Pharmacy benefit managers ― the industry middlemen who play a role in drug pricing ― take a piece of the pie, but how large a piece remains a secret. Legislation around transparency regarding undisclosed PBM deals could drive down drug prices somewhat, but it likely wouldn't affect the baseline prices set by drug manufacturers."}
{"original": "The Right Care Alliance ― a group of patients, physicians, nurses, patient advocates, students and other community members with chapters around the country ― is currently organizing a campaign to target price gouging in the pharmaceutical industry. We are planning year-long grassroots actions, including town hall meetings, marches and demonstrations, to pressure Big Pharma to stop predatory pricing, particularly for life-saving medications."}
{"original": "We must force companies like Eli Lilly to address the gap between what they say they stand for and their actions. We must be loud with our demands to counterbalance the hold Big Pharma has on U.S. politics. Drug companies can become heroes again but only if they stop taking advantage of the patients who need them."}

{"original": "Medicare late enrollment penalties: You can first sign up for Medicare Part B within seven months of your 65th birthday. But if you fail to enroll during this crucial period, you face a penalty of a premium increase by 10% for each 12-month period that you were eligible but did not enroll. The premiums won't ever decrease, either. If you are still working once you become eligible, as long as you sign up within eight months of leaving your job, you can avoid retirement penalties."}
{"original": "Penalty for failing to take retirement distributions: Once you turn 70 ½, you are required to take withdrawals from your 401(k)s and IRAs. You can withdraw the necessary amounts from any of your IRAs and can even combine them. But the 401(k) RMDs will need to be withdrawn from each account or you could get penalized. If you fail to do this, you could face as much as a 50% tax penalty on the offending 401(k) accounts."}
{"original": "401(k) early withdrawal penalty: If you withdraw your 401(k) too early, there's a penalty for that, too. That penalty is removed once you reach age 59 ½. But for public safety employees or those who leave their job at age 55 or older, there penalty-free withdrawals that you can make. If you have loans that have been taken out, and you leave your job or lose it, the loan often becomes due right away; and if you are unable to pay it back, a penalty may also apply."}
{"original": "IRA early withdrawal penalty: For IRAs, if you leave your job before you reach the age of 59 ½, there is typically a 10% early withdrawal penalty that applies. For instance, if you withdrew $5,000 prior to reaching this qualifying age, you'd generally pay a 10% penalty tax of $500. But you can also avoid these penalties under certain circumstances, like using the money for college or as the down payment on a first time home purchase (a few other situations, like medical expenses, also count as an exclusion from the penalty, too)."}

{"original": "For instance, if you owed $4,000, a credit of $2,500 would shrink your bill to $1,500. Even better? Any refundable portion of a credit that exceeds what you owe goes straight to you.

{"original": "In addition, if you have a filing status of married filing separately or if another person can claim an exemption for you as a dependent on his or her tax return, you won't be eligible."}
{"original": "How much it's worth: This credit covers 100 percent of the first $2,000 of qualified expenses and 25 percent of the next $2,000 of qualified expenses, for a maximum credit of $2,500. If the credit brings the amount of tax you owe to $0, you can have up to $1,000 refunded directly to you!"}

{"original": "How much it's worth: The credit is nonrefundable -- so you won't see any cash in your tax refund from it. It has a maximum yearly value of $2,000 or 20 percent of up to $10,000 of qualified expenses. While you can claim this credit an unlimited number of times, you can only claim it once per year -- regardless of how many students are on your tax return."}
{"original": "Expenses that qualify: You can claim this credit for qualified expenses for post-secondary degree programs or for programs taken to acquire or improve job skills. Qualified expenses generally include all costs to enroll in/attend an eligible educational institution."}
{"original": "Things like books, supplies, and equipment generally do not qualify unless you must pay the school directly for them as a condition of enrollment."}
{"original": "Tax deductions increase your savings by decreasing the income that the government taxes you on."}
{"original": "For instance, say you earned $35,000 in taxable income this year. Qualifying for a $4,000 deduction would decrease that taxable income to $31,000. That's $4,000 that you don't owe any taxes on!"}
{"original": "Students and their parents have two tax deductions available to them: the tuition and fees deduction and the student loan interest deduction."}
{"original": "Option #1: Tuition And Fees Deduction"}
{"original": "Whom it's for: Any taxpayer who paid qualified education expenses. However, you are ineligible if you have a filing status of married filing separately or if another person can claim an exemption for you as a dependent on his or her tax return."}
{"original": "How much it's worth: This deduction covers 100 percent of qualified higher education expenses up to $4,000. The actual maximum you qualify for will depend on your modified adjusted gross income (AGI)."}
{"original": "Expenses that qualify: Generally, qualified expenses include all costs that you have to pay in order to enroll/attend an eligible educational institution."}
{"original": "Option #2: Student Loan Interest Deduction"}
{"original": "Whom it's for: Any taxpayer who paid interest during the year on a qualified student loan."}
{"original": "How much it's worth: You can deduct up to $2,500."}
{"original": "Loans that qualify: Generally, only loans taken out to pay for qualified education expenses are eligible; this includes Parent PLUS loans. Qualified expenses generally include the total cost of attending an eligible school of higher education (as either an undergraduate or a graduate student), as well as tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, equipment, and any other necessary expenses."}
{"original": "In addition, you must have paid for or incurred these expenses within a reasonable amount of time from when you took out the loan. The expenses also must have been for the student's education during an academic period when he or she was an eligible student."}
{"original": "To learn more about these deductions and credits, check out Publication 970 or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website. And remember, it's always a good idea to check with a tax professional to be sure you're claiming benefits correctly."}
{"original": "What If My Employer Helps Me Pay For School?"}
{"original": "Some companies offer to help pay your tuition costs as a way to invest in employee development. If your company offers this assistance:"}
{"original": "Generally speaking, you can receive up to5,250 toward undergraduate or graduate tuition, fees, and books totally tax-free (usually through reimbursement)."}
{"original": "Additional assistance may be taxable. Speak to your employer to find out more about your specific situation."}
{"original": "Another rising trend is employers offering student loan repayment as an employee benefit. Depending on how your employer makes the payments toward your student loans, you may have a minimal tax bill if the payment is considered income. Your employer may deduct the tax directly from the payment or your paycheck, or you may be responsible for it when you file your tax return each year. Talk to your payroll office to learn more."}

{"original": "Most people don't wake up one morning and think: I wonder what my business is really worth? Ok, some do."}
{"original": "But then they usually lose that enthusiasm at the notion that they might need to spend a few bucks to get the answer."}
{"original": "The reality is that a valuation is typically performed because someone else will tell you that you need to have a valuation performed. It's usually in order for you to complete some other task -- the 'real objective' if you will. Here are just some of the reasons that might trigger the need for a business valuation:"}
{"original": "Objective #1: You're trying to incentivize your key employees with stock-based compensation."}
{"original": "Your accountant advises that need to have something called a 409A valuation done...and you thought that they were talking about cleaning your kitchen."}
{"original": "Objective #2: You're trying to gift shares of your business to your kids."}
{"original": "Your attorney advises you that you'll need a valuation to satisfy the IRS."}
{"original": "Objective #3: You're trying to raise capital either through private equity or a public offering."}
{"original": "You're told by both your accountant and your attorney that you need to have those stock options valued. (No, they're not ganging up on you!)"}
{"original": "There are several methods used to value a business, but at a high level, there are two key fundamental ways to think about the value of your business:"}
{"original": "First, the value of your business today is equal to the present value of the future monetary benefits it can deliver. (Income-Based Approach) Secondly, the value of your business is equal to what someone else is willing to pay for it. (Market-Based Approach)"}
{"original": "These are the underpinnings of the Income and Market Approaches to valuation."}
{"original": "Naturally, the only way to know for certain what someone is willing to pay for the business is to put it on the market, but knowing how similar businesses transact will get you in the ballpark."}
{"original": "If you're not familiar with these valuation techniques and you'd like to learn a little more, you might enjoy taking a peek into these methods from the perspective of the TV show Shark Tank."}
{"original": "The value of your business (or business interest) depends on what exactly needs to be valued, why it needs to be valued, when it needs to be valued and for whom it needs to be valued. A few things to consider:"}
{"original": "1. Is there debt on the balance sheet? If the answer is yes, the value of your business depends on how much. As an every day example, if your house could be sold for $300,000 today but you have a mortgage (debt) of $200,000, your equity interest is only worth $100,000. The same is true for the business."}
{"original": "2. Is your valuation as of a recent date or do you need to go back in time to say, the date of someone's passing for an estate matter? Markets and valuations change over time."}
{"original": "3. If your needs pertain to a minority ownership interest in the business, understand that it will be worth less than a controlling interest in the business."}
{"original": "4. The value of the minority interest also depends on what other classes of equity have preference ahead of it."}
{"original": "5. Furthermore, if that ownership interest is illiquid, understand that it will be worth less than if it were traded on an exchange or otherwise lacked the restrictions on liquidity."}
{"original": "Have you been running the business with a strategic goal of trying to minimize your tax payments? If so, that means that your financial statements probably show that you aren't really all that profitable."}
{"original": "Saying it that way has a different feel about it, especially from a potential buyer's perspective, doesn't it?"}
{"original": "And what value might a not-really-profitable business have? Five times zero is still zero. If a sale or other liquidity event might be on the horizon, you probably should discuss this point with your advisers fairly soon."}

{"original": "The story of 21st-century America is complex, but the narrative of powerful people behaving terribly and getting away with it is arguably the common thread. Consider the illegal torture operations of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and John Yoo. Reflect on the financial frauds perpetrated by Wall Street bankers and foreclosure mills last decade (they're not exactly complying with the law this decade, either). Contemplate the big lies of fossil fuel executives like Exxon chair turned Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Think about the violations of consent decrees, tax laws and antitrust statutes by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg and the rest of Silicon Valley. Reckon with the horrifying conduct brought front and center by #MeToo. And then come to terms with the number of the aforementioned elites whose potential criminal liability has been taken seriously by prosecutors ― approximately zero."}
{"original": "This is all the evidence you need to see how things are likely to go whenever the Trump administration meets its demise."}
{"original": "There will be the inevitable establishment calls to look forward and not behind. Elites of all stripes will argue for the president's successor to allow Trump and his accomplices to avoid legal accountability for everything from the Trump Foundation scam to conspiring with Russian agents."}
{"original": "The story of 21st-century America is complex, but the narrative of powerful people behaving terribly and getting away with it is arguably the common thread."}
{"original": "One can already imagine the Washington Post editorial board's calls to remember how Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon and healed the country, setting aside the fact that failing to prosecute Nixon for a wide swath of violations far beyond merely covering up political espionage undoubtedly encouraged future presidents to think they are above the law."}
{"original": "Indeed, few of the generally hagiographic obituaries of George H.W. Bush mentioned his lame-duck pardons of senior Reagan and Bush administration officials to foil the special counsel's investigation into serious criminality (including potentially Bush's own) in the Iran-Contra affair."}
{"original": "Trump, who has spent a lifetime stretching (and seemingly bursting) the legal limits on tax avoidance, money laundering, housing discrimination, deceptive consumer practices and sexual assault, ran a presidential campaign that represents the apotheosis of elites breaking laws to achieve massive gains. Since taking office, Trump has plausibly been implicated in a broad array of crimes, including breaking campaign finance rules, violating state and national tax laws, conspiring to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and of course, obstructing justice."}
{"original": "Should Trump's successor, be it Mike Pence or a Democrat, pardon Trump? How should New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and other state and local officials treat Trump as well as his children and cronies who seem exceedingly likely to have acted in a manner that warrants prosecution?"}
{"original": "That Americans no longer trust their institutions or elites should not be a source of wonderment ― it should be seen as a rational response to the declining trustworthiness of the people with the most power in this country. If with great power comes great responsibility, then why is our criminal justice system so focused on jailing poor people for being unable to pay fines for modest offenses or nonviolent drug possession?"}
{"original": "A just America would seek, first and foremost, to hold the most powerful Americans to account."}
{"original": "There is a reason that Equal Justice Under Law is carved into the physical architecture of the Supreme Court above its primary west entrance. Far, far too often, America has not been a society where we are all actually subject to law equally. And yet the notion that politicians and billionaires are supposed to be the same under the law as the poor and the oppressed is a powerful principle. This aspiration is necessary for the development of a sense of community and has served as a powerful impetus for America becoming generally less unfair over time."}
{"original": "When the idea of equality under the law is breached serially and nearly irrevocably, that sense of commonality fractures. We won't be able to address our many challenges ― for instance, a Green New Deal ― as an actually *united* United States unless we can create a sense that the rule of law applies to all equally."}

{"original": "In 2009, then president-elect Obama expressed a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards in previewing his administration's free pass to George W. Bush alumni. That view was at odds with a commitment to justice, since, by its very nature, justice is always retrospective ― crimes are committed, criminals are charged, juries or judges weigh the evidence and proceed to punish (or not) accordingly."}
{"original": "The view was also a political calamity ― Obama's governance strategy of burying the broadly accepted failures of the Bush presidency created a path for Bush's enablers in Congress to secure historic victories in the 2010 midterms. And the Obama administration's failure to prosecute bankers and other elites responsible for economic cataclysm added fuel to the fire of resentment that led so many Americans to the tea party, and ultimately, Trumpism."}

{"original": "Treasury recently gave Senate Republicans potentially damaging financial information related to former vice president Joe Biden's son Hunter, but blocked a Democratic request for President Donald Trump's tax returns."}
{"original": "It seems that Democrats' requests get shoved in the back of a filing cabinet while somehow Republican requests get the red carpet treatment, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said during a Senate Finance Committee hearing."}
{"original": "Mnuchin said the department thought it would have been illegal to grant the Democratic request for the president's tax returns because of tax privacy laws, saying it was very different from the Republican request for reports by financial institutions regarding suspicious activities related to Hunter Biden."}
{"original": "Wyden interrupted him: Mr. Secretary, you are stonewalling about stonewalling."}
{"original": "That's just not fair, Mnuchin said, before again zooming in on the different details of the two requests."}
{"original": "Democrats sought Trump's tax returns under a federal tax disclosure law granting certain committee chairs access to private tax information by request. Mnuchin argued that the president's personal returns would be subject to protection under the law."}
{"original": "But Democrats asked for the president's taxes under a subsection of the tax code that delineates specific exceptions to the confidentiality of private tax information, including exceptions enacted by Congress as a check on the executive branch. If committee chairs make a request for tax returns, the law says, then the Treasury shall hand them over."}
{"original": "Instead of complying with the Democrats' request for Trump's taxes last year, however, Treasury said it had concluded Democrats had no legitimate legislative purpose for their request, and they have continued that argument in federal court, where the case is currently stalled."}
{"original": "Mnuchin has not said if he thought Republicans' request for suspicious activity reports pertaining to Hunter Biden did have a legislative purpose. In a Tuesday letter to Wyden, Mnuchin said the applicable regulations provide that the Secretary of the Treasury may 'within his discretion' disclose this information 'for any reason consistent with the purposes' of the Bank Secrecy Act."}
{"original": "That 1970 law requires financial firms to file reports with Treasury if customer transactions exceed a certain monetary threshold or if there's some reason to believe they're connected to illegal activity."}

And he's a familiar face to anyone with a television. Booker's been touted as a potential presidential candidate virtually since the day he was elected mayor of Newark in year 2006. It's a city with about 280,000 largely African-American and Latino residents — and a tough reputation."}
{"original": "You know, I still live right off Martin Luther King [Boulevard], Booker told Stephanie."}

{"original": "Yes. Isn't it nice? Booker replied. We follow through. That was the promise we made. Remember?"}

{"original": "Booker got a similar greeting when he walked into a bodega around the corner from his house."}
{"original": "Yo! Presidente! said the man behind the register."}
{"original": "And it's not just in Newark. In the hallways of Capitol Hill and at the speeches he gives around the country, Booker is regularly urged to mount a White House bid. It happens so often that he's got something of a standard response."}
{"original": "When pressed about a presidential campaign by Yahoo News, Booker admits he's going to mull the possibility."}
{"original": "Look, my focus right now is two things; my own reelection and making sure we're in a strong position for that and the 2018 elections, Booker said. I think, that passes, I'll sit down and give a hard consideration about a lot of folks that are talking to me about doing something else."}
{"original": "Booker's term — he was elected in 2013, in a special election after the death of Sen. Frank Lautenberg, and then again in 2014 — ends in 2020. In the meantime, he's become an in-demand campaign surrogate for other Democrats. In the past year, Booker has traveled to at least 11 states to stump for his colleagues."}
{"original": "JIM WATSON via Getty Images Cory Booker with then senatorial candidate Doug Jones in Birmingham, Ala., last December."}
{"original": "So far, Booker has strenuously avoided any key early primary states that would fuel presidential speculation. But in an interview, Booker let slip that he is planning one trip that might raise eyebrows: a red state farmers tour. It's the kind of thing that screams White House run, but Booker insisted it's not going to be a public listening tour."}
{"original": "We're going to do it and not tell anybody were doing it, he explained, adding, We're not going to be doing it with lots of media coverage."}
{"original": "The reasons for the presidential buzz surrounding Booker are clear. Whenever Booker hits the campaign trail, he is a potent weapon. His rise has largely been propelled by his inspiring personal story — and his unique ability to tell it."}
{"original": "Asked about Booker's future, David Axelrod, the veteran Democratic strategist and former top adviser to President Obama, sees Booker as an exceptional political talent who is a real potential 2020 contender."}
{"original": "I think he is a brilliant guy; big-time personality, interesting thinker, and an at times spellbinding presenter and … obviously, a really good story. So, I take him seriously, Axelrod said."}
{"original": "Axelrod currently leads the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago. He recently hosted Booker there, and the strategist left with the impression that Booker's flair for the dramatic can sometimes go a bit too far and reach a place where the senator sacrifices a sense of authenticity for performance. Axelrod offered up a classic piece of baseball lore from the early days of Dodgers pitching great Sandy Koufax as advice for Booker."}
{"original": "Some catcher … told him, 'You know you are a great pitcher … and you throw the ball 100 miles an hour, but if you threw it at 97 and got it over the plate you'd be untouchable,' recounted Axelrod."}
{"original": "I think that Booker is a great, great talent. … I think that he's in public service for the right reasons, but he probably could take three miles off his fastball, and get the ball over the plate, and be even better, added Axelrod."}
{"original": "Indeed, the captivating narrative and presentation that has inspired support for Booker has also provoked skepticism, including fears from progressives about his close ties to donors from Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry. There are also substantive questions about his record in Newark and in the Senate."}
{"original": "Booker has in many ways mastered the art of retail politics. He has a boundless energy that he credits to a vegan diet supplemented by iced tea and his newest discovery, intermittent fasting. He knows just when to deploy a dad joke, fist bump, broken Spanish, a lesson from one of the many religions he's studied, or a warm embrace. Booker is also a gifted orator. His speeches are crafted from what he calls riffs, including tales from his own life and anecdotes that have touched him from people he's met or read about. Working without a script, Booker turns these set pieces into symphonies of rising emotion and soaring inspiration with his voice alternately breaking and booming before rapt audiences."}
{"original": "Tasos Katopodis via Getty Images Sen. Cory Booker at a rally outside in Washington last January."}
{"original": "The Cory Booker origin story is a staple of his oratorical arsenal. His parents were pioneering black executives at IBM who were active in the civil rights movement. They were able to raise Cory and his brother in the wealthy New Jersey suburb of Harrington Park, with the help of housing activists who worked with the family to force unwilling property owners to sell them a home."}
{"original": "When Booker tells it, this isn't just a tale of defying injustice. Booker calls the story a conspiracy of love and paints himself as the physical manifestation of the kindness and decency of those who helped his father as a poor young man and later in the face of housing discrimination. Booker sums it up with the words of a man he often quotes, Martin Luther King Jr."}
{"original": "This was the lesson of my childhood, that we all are connected, said Booker. As Martin Luther King said, we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a common bond of destiny. That injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."}
{"original": "Booker constantly returns to King's legacy and teachings to discuss modern problems and his own ideals. But he doesn't just channel King by echoing his values. Booker's impassioned delivery has deep echoes of the black church tradition that shaped the civil rights icon. And both Booker and King can provoke a similar reaction from supporters. When we saw Booker present his personal story during a speech at the Parkinson's Policy Forum on March 20, he left the ballroom full of activists on their feet. Some were in tears."}
{"original": "It's a typical reaction. But these sermons do leave some wondering whether the emotion could possibly be genuine."}
{"original": "An aide to a senior Senate Democrat told Yahoo News about listening to one of Booker's speeches. Booker wept on stage and had much of the audience joining him. The staffer was shocked when the senator abruptly left amid the applause."}
{"original": "I've seen him give that speech five times — and each time he cried, the senator said."}
{"original": "Booker began his community work attending college at Stanford. I wanted to make a difference in the world. … I felt like I had all of this privilege, he told a group of high school students.. I was working in a place called East Palo Alto and found my calling. I wanted to do big things."}
{"original": "Hunter Walker/Yahoo News Sen. Cory Booker with a group of New Jersey high school students at the Capitol."}
{"original": "Booker went on to earn a law degree at Yale and then to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship for an honors degree in American history. At Oxford, the decidedly non-Jewish Booker helped run a chapter of Chabad House and picked up biblical wisdom and Yiddish witticisms that still pepper his speeches."}
{"original": "Then comes the final chapter in the Cory Booker origin story."}
{"original": "Before I even graduated from law school, I decided that I was going to move to the most dangerous neighborhood I could find in the city I loved, Booker told the students."}
{"original": "In 1997, his final year of law school, he began working — and living — as a tenants' rights advocate in Newark, about nine miles from Manhattan. The once-thriving city had seen steep drops in population and wealth, especially after the notorious riots in 1967."}
{"original": "Through his work in Newark, Booker met Virginia Jones, who led the Brick Towers tenants' association in one of the city's most troubled public housing complexes. Booker eventually moved in to an apartment there and, he says, Jones pushed him to run for city council."}
{"original": "This story is one of Booker's main speech riffs. I always say I got my BA from Stanford but my PhD on the streets of Newark, Booker likes to say."}
{"original": "Booker also regularly recounts lessons and maxims passed down from Jones. She taught him that hope is the active conviction that despair will never have the last word."}
{"original": "In 1998, Booker, who was then 29, won a seat on Newark's municipal council. He quickly began displaying the media savvy that would become a hallmark of his career, earning attention far beyond the city by moving into a tent and going on a hunger strike to protest crime."}
{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Then mayoral candidate Cory Booker outside his campaign headquarters in Newark in 2002."}
{"original": "Booker had a film crew by his side when he first ran for mayor in 2002. The subsequent documentary, Street Fight, captured his ultimately unsuccessful bid to unseat Mayor Sharpe James, who led a local political machine for two decades. Booker gained exposure as a crusader against corruption, but also saw some people questioning his authenticity."}
{"original": "James and his allies attacked Booker with a series of wild allegations, including that he was Jewish and a Republican. There were also insinuations Booker, a bachelor, was gay. That last accusation would stick with Booker through his ascent to the Senate."}
{"original": "Booker has addressed the gay rumors by saying, So what if I am? But he has dated women, most recently the poet Cleo Wade. When asked about Wade, Booker declined to comment. Wade did the same in a recent interview with the New York Times."}
{"original": "Booker made it to City Hall on his second attempt in 2006. After becoming mayor, he quickly became a national figure with an early presence on Twitter, where he promoted his own hands-on do-gooding: shoveling snow, delivering diapers, welcoming people into his home during a hurricane, and even helping to rescue a woman from a burning building."}
{"original": "The heroics led to fantastic press. However, the outsized characterization brought a unique political problem. As one of his many national headlines in the Washington Post put it, Booker was almost too good to be true. Advisers knew people could be skeptical."}
{"original": "It can be frustrating when you're working for him because, with any politician, people are cynical, one former Booker campaign staffer said. They believe that there's a difference between your private self and your public self. But he is who he is. It's almost unbelievable, but he is."}

{"original": "I would say he's for real, Parish said. What people are going to be skeptical about is, Where is the proof in the pudding? What has he done? Where is the manifestation of all of the rainbows and unicorns? He's so good talking about the challenges that we face, but what has he done?"}
{"original": "Booker is aware of his doubters, but says his record speaks for itself."}
{"original": "This is the beautiful thing about this point in my career … and folk in this community know it, said Booker as he walked through the city. Stuff I hear, 'Everything I say is sizzle and no whatever.' And I'm like, Wait a minute. Now you have a 20-year career to analyze."}
{"original": "His seven years leading Newark had highlights and lowlights."}
{"original": "As mayor, Booker's burgeoning brand as a social media superhero coupled with his charisma and connections from his elite education brought support from celebrities and business leaders including Oprah, Bon Jovi, hedge funder Bill Ackman, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The star power helped Booker attract an influx of donations and development to Newark."}
{"original": "Booker wooed major businesses, including Panasonic and Prudential, to the city. Newark saw its first major new grocery stores and hotels in years, new office towers, a $150 million real estate and educational complex. Booker notes all of this occurred against the backdrop of the national recession and a fiscal crisis that saw a quarter of the city's employees laid off. After years of decline, Newark's population grew. And along with the corporate donations and development, after inheriting a deficit Booker found savings in the city budget and left it balanced for the first time in a decade."}
{"original": "Not all of the change during Booker's tenure was positive. While the crime rate initially dropped sharply, it ticked back up in 2010, a situation Booker attributes to widespread police layoffs that he blames on New Jersey's former Republican Gov. Chris Christie. And the new real estate developments and revitalized downtown have raised the specter of gentrification with Newark even getting dubbed a new Brooklyn."}

{"original": "While walking through the city with a correspondent from Yahoo News, Booker acknowledged rising rents are a concern that comes with growth. Booker said he tried to address this by requiring affordable housing, educational facilities and jobs for locals to be part of new projects in Newark. Booker doubled the number of affordable housing units in the city during his tenure. He described his philosophy as inclusive development."}
{"original": "Nevertheless, for a progressive Democrat stepping onto the national stage, Booker's past reliance on corporate development and philanthropy could be a liability. But Booker is unapologetic."}
{"original": "I would challenge any of those people to be mayor of a city in a recession. … Your job is to help people and by any means necessary, said Booker, adding, Live where I live for a year and tell me you wouldn't do whatever it took."}
{"original": "One of Booker's grandest gestures caused the biggest controversy of his mayoralty. In 2010, Booker teamed with Christie and Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg to launch a $200 million plan to overhaul the Newark's school system. The effort, which Booker dubbed a bold new paradigm, was backed by donations and launched on an episode of Oprah Winfrey's talk show. It included a new teacher-evaluation system aimed at increasing accountability and an expansion of charter schools in the city. But with students being moved to charters, many district schools were closed, which angered many residents."}

{"original": "Booker's $200 million school reform effort was chronicled in a 2015 book by journalist Dale Russakoff called The Prize: Who's in Charge of America's Schools. While she depicted Booker as well-intentioned, Russakoff was sharply critical of the way changes were communicated to city residents and how much of the money went to highly paid consultants. The book led to a spate of negative headlines questioning whether Newark's schools really improved after the influx of cash."}
{"original": "Last October, Harvard's Center For Education Policy Research released a detailed report analyzing Booker's schools overhaul. The assessment found that, on net, by the 2015–2016 academic year, Newark students had seen a significant improvement in the rate of growth in English and no significant change in math."}
{"original": "Booker believes the effort was judged too quickly and feels vindicated by the new research."}
{"original": "It was a success! he said of the school reform push."}
{"original": "Booker has won over some of his critics in recent years, notably Newark's current mayor, Ras Baraka, who has developed what allies of both men characterize as a strong partnership with Booker."}
{"original": "During Booker's time in Newark, Baraka represented the South Ward on the council. It was Sharpe James's base and a hotbed of anti-Booker sentiment. Baraka was a prominent opponent of the schools plan."}
{"original": "Baraka and Booker's improved relationship was on full display in February, when the former mayor appeared alongside his successor as he filed petitions for reelection."}
{"original": "In a phone call with Yahoo News, Baraka said Booker has done an outstanding job as United States senator in opposing Trump administration appointments and in advocating for Newark in Washington. He cited Booker's successful push to include opportunity zones in the tax reform bill last year. The program, which evolved from a proposal by Booker and South Carolina Republican Tim Scott, provides tax benefits for businesses that invest in census tracts designated by governors as areas in need of growth. Baraka even has kind words for his former foe's tenure as mayor."}

{"original": "Not everyone is on board. Donna Jackson, a current council candidate and longtime Booker critic, calls the relationship between Booker and Baraka an unholy alliance."}
{"original": "Jackson was a Baraka supporter and staunch opponent of Booker's school reform effort. During a phone call last week, she described the expansion of charters as an onslaught and argued the focus should have been on improving existing district schools rather than opening new ones."}
{"original": "When Booker ran for Senate in 2013, Jackson worked with his Republican opponent, Steve Lonegan, to raise more questions about Booker. She appeared alongside Lonegan at an event where he made the false claim Booker does not live in his house in Newark's Central Ward. Lonegan and his campaign also revived the gay rumors about Booker, saying it was kind of weird Booker never refuted the allegations."}
{"original": "Booker defeated Lonegan, but more serious questions emerged during the Senate race. In 2013, the National Review published a piece that accused Booker of making up some of the dramatic anecdotes he deployed in his speeches."}
{"original": "Specifically, the magazine questioned whether Booker made up a man named T-Bone who featured in many of his trademark riffs. Booker regularly described T-Bone as a young man who threatened his life when he first moved to the Central Ward, but later became a friend. The National Review talked to a Booker ally who said the future senator once privately admitted that T-Bone was a composite."}
{"original": "Questions about T-Bone first popped up in 2007 when Newark's Star-Ledger newspaper tried to find the man behind the riffs. The local reporters could find no evidence the nicknamed city resident was real. At the time, Booker said T-Bone was 1,000 percent a real person. And there are multiple veterans of Newark's police force who are willing to back Booker up on this point."}
{"original": "Spencer Platt via Getty Images Sen. Cory Booker after winning a special election in 2013."}

He was a police officer in Newark and served as the city's top cop under James, a position he lost when Booker took office. When asked by Yahoo News, Ambrose said multiple criminals in the city used the T-Bone alias so he never doubted the senator's tale."}
{"original": "Jimmy Wright, who recently retired after a long career that included stints as a beat cop and homicide investigator, lived in Brick Towers at the time and witnessed an incident where Booker was threatened by local drug dealers. Wright said the men were angry over the increased police presence Booker brought to the neighborhood."}
{"original": "I know for a fact that there were some guys that threatened Cory one day in front of the building. They were selling drugs. Basically, when Cory moved in, he messed up [their business], said Wright."}
{"original": "Wright also said Booker worked to befriend the young dealers and they ended up loving him."}
{"original": "And Booker definitely does have relationships with some colorful characters in his Newark neighborhood. As he walked with Yahoo News, a man named Earl Best ran up to say hello. Best is a current city worker and former convicted bank robber who became known as the Street Doctor by delivering blankets, food and supplies to Newark's homeless."}
{"original": "This is a legend in Newark. The Street Doctor, Booker said as the two men embraced."}
{"original": "That's my buddy! Best said pointing at the senator."}
{"original": "The Street Doctor had some bad news for Booker."}
{"original": "Your buddy died. Binky, said Best."}
{"original": "He explained that Robin Binky Brown, a retired detective and longshoreman who helped produce a 2009 Sundance Channel documentary that featured Booker, had died the night before. Booker exchanged numbers with Best and asked to be apprised about Brown's funeral."}
{"original": "Keep taking care of the kids, man, Booker said as the two men parted. They look up to you."}
{"original": "Booker says his connections with the people in his Newark neighborhood are vital to him on Capitol Hill, where a map of the Central Ward hangs over his desk."}
{"original": "I just feel like, if I ever lose that, like the connections in my neighborhood, the connections in my city, the connections to urban spaces in New Jersey, I feel like I'm rudderless and rootless, Booker explained."}
{"original": "Newark provides Booker with firsthand experience about the challenges facing the poor and people of color. But these issues aren't unique to urban areas, Booker repeatedly stresses whether you're in Appalachia or Newark, people around the country are dealing with common pain, including economic insecurity, water and air quality issues, gun violence and the opioid crisis."}
{"original": "I'm the only United States senator that lives in what could be characterized as an inner city, Booker said. I've stayed rooted in the community. If all of our senators lived in pockets where there's poverty and … the struggle for America was going on, I think it might be better for our country."}
{"original": "These beliefs have led Booker to focus on justice in three areas — criminal justice reform, environmental issues and economic inequality."}
{"original": "But opponents question his legislative record."}
{"original": "Before he launches his 2020 presidential bid, Booker might want to accomplish something in the Senate, Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens said of Booker."}
{"original": "But as a member of the minority party, he has a steep hill to climb towards passing legislation. Besides adding the opportunity zone amendment to the tax bill, Booker also authored provisions including a ban on solitary confinement for juveniles in the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, a criminal justice package that has passed out of committee and has bipartisan support."}
{"original": "Booker has also worked with state and city politicians to help them implement versions of proposals that may be unable to pass Congress. Specifically, since he introduced the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act last year, a dozen state houses have introduced similar legislation. The act includes steps designed to improve conditions for women in prison, including giving them mentors and greater access to health care products. Three weeks after Booker introduced the act, the Federal Bureau of Prisons issued a memo calling for female inmates to have free access to tampons and pads, which was a key component of Booker's legislation."}
{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduce the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act at a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, July 11, 2017."}
{"original": "Even on matters where Booker has no chance of getting a law passed, he and his team believe he can play a valuable role raising the issue. Booker has become a leading advocate for marijuana legalization, and has proposed legislation to expunge federal marijuana convictions and penalize states where minorities have faced disproportionate rates of marijuana arrest and incarceration. He's also behind legislation for a pilot guaranteed-jobs program and a package designed to address environmental issues in poor communities."}
{"original": "Having a conversation with Booker means hearing an endless stream of data points he's picked up, including anecdotes from people he's met and facts absorbed through what is clearly a voracious reading habit. The health issues facing people dealing with poor environmental conditions are a favorite topic. He rattles off details about lead exposure, the health risks of refineries and tropical diseases in the United States. Booker said his concept of environmental justice was informed by things he's seen in Newark as well as fact-finding trips to Southern states."}
{"original": "Some observers think Booker's Senate agenda is meant to win over wary progressives, who are suspicious of the way he has courted campaign contributions from Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry. Last January, Booker provoked outrage from the left when he joined a bipartisan group that included Republicans in opposing a proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders designed to lower drug prices. After adding steps to address safety concerns, Booker joined Sanders and worked with him to announce a new bill that would legalize drug imports from Canada."}
{"original": "Mark Wilson via Getty Images Sen. Cory Booker comforts 4-year-old Morgan Hintz, who suffers from a rare form of epilepsy, during a news conference on medical marijuana."}
{"original": "Ahrens, the Republican Party spokesman, predicts that tacking left could kill any chance Booker has to be a viable presidential candidate."}
{"original": "Given how much the base dislikes him, Booker's going to keep adopting radical policies that will destroy his presidential aspirations, like his massively expensive and totally impractical plan for the government to provide jobs for everyone, Ahrens said."}
{"original": "Booker certainly has friends in the two major wings of the divided Democratic Party. A source familiar with Sanders's thinking said the former presidential candidate clearly enjoys working with Cory on the issues. The source pointed to a chummy joint appearance the pair made on Facebook Live last month to discuss marijuana legalization. Booker has come around on some good progressive policies, the source said, mentioning his support for Medicare-for-all universal health care. And Sanders, whose socialist brand of politics was dismissed by some Democratic moderates, also appreciates Booker's large platform."}
{"original": "There is value to having someone who is perceived by the Beltway as more 'mainstream' supporting these ideas, the source said."}
{"original": "Sanders's presidential primary rival, Hillary Clinton, also has a positive relationship with Booker. A top Clinton campaign source said Booker was her second choice for a running mate, and multiple sources confirmed it was a tight decision."}
{"original": "Booker's chance of successfully leading a presidential ticket of his own hinges on his ability convince a cynical electorate that he's more than just an incredible speechmaker. And he'll have to prove the stories in those speeches — and perhaps more important, the emotions behind them — are real."}

{"original": "If you don't know the man, you can't judge him, Quocko said of Booker. What you might think is insincere is because you don't know him."}
{"original": "Quocko said she jokingly calls Booker her little brother because he was like an other son to Jones. Booker has stayed in touch with the family since her mother's passing."}
{"original": "Being mayor never stopped him from being around my mother, Quocko added. When my mother became ill, Cory was there to visit her quite often."}

{"original": "When my mother was in the hospital he saw to it that she had her own private room and was well taken care of, said Quocko."}

{"original": "UPDATE: Jan. 7 ― The IRS will likely begin paying out tax refunds in the coming weeks after the White House decided to reverse past IRS policy on Monday, according to The Washington Post. Previously, the IRS was prohibited from issuing refunds during a shutdown while the majority of employees were on furlough. However, Trump administration lawyers decided it was legally permissible to proceed with processing tax returns. The IRS employees who return to work in order to process these returns will not be paid during the shutdown. Final details are still up in the air, including how many workers will be recalled and when the official tax filing season will begin."}
{"original": "PREVIOUSLY: Today we reach the two-week mark of the partial government shutdown, the result of a standoff between Congress and President Donald Trump over funding of a border wall that he originally said Mexico would pay for."}
{"original": "In addition to the 420,000 government employees who continue to work without pay, the shutdown has left an estimated 380,000 government workers on furlough, including nearly all Internal Revenue Service employees."}
{"original": "So what does that mean for your taxes? As you might have guessed, it's not great news."}
{"original": "How The Government Shutdown Affects Tax Refunds"}
{"original": "According to the government's shutdown plan, only 12.5 percent of IRS employees are authorized to work during the current non-filing season. The plan also states that processing certain tax refunds and issuing tax refunds are non-excepted activities during this time, meaning that the employees responsible for performing those duties will be furloughed during the shutdown."}
{"original": "Jay Williams, a West Virginia-based financial adviser who focuses on tax-advantaged investing, noted there are a few exceptions. Specifically, the government will continue processing of returns that are deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property."}
{"original": "Currently, there's no official plan for how tax returns would be handled in the event that the shutdown extends into tax filing season, which begins Jan. 15 ― an unprecedented situation, according to Fox Business."}
{"original": "So what does this mean for the majority of taxpayers expecting a refund? The government shutdown won't impact the ability to submit a tax return, but it will impact the issuance of refunds, said Jeff Fosselman, a certified financial planner, certified public accountant and senior wealth adviser at Relative Value Partners. Refunds don't start getting issued until mid-January, so depending on how long the shutdown lasts, this may or may not impact early filers."}
{"original": "Williams predicts that if shutdown lasts past Jan. 15, the potential delay would be one and a half days for every one day of continued shutdown. Past February 1, that delay could balloon to an extra two days per one day of shutdown, he said."}
{"original": "And if the shutdown rolls into March ― Trump threatened Friday to continue for months or even years ― there's really no telling what could happen. Playing catch-up could be a nightmare for the IRS and consumers, Williams said, noting that the issue would disproportionately affect Americans in lower-income brackets who count on refunds to pay down debt, save money or simply stay afloat."}
{"original": "Here's the real kicker: Though Uncle Sam could indefinitely dole out IOUs to tax filers awaiting refunds, those who owe taxes will be expected to pony up by the usual deadlines, regardless of whether or not the government is shut down."}
{"original": "There's no language in the IRS plan for a shutdown that calls for payments to be withheld or delayed, Williams said. Filing deadlines most certainly still apply, and the IRS takes postmarks very seriously."}
{"original": "Conservative, anti-Trump attorney George Conway warned that Donald Trump must suffer the consequences of his acts, or the nation is doomed to be victimized by presidents unrestrained by the law in the future."}
{"original": "Conway, the husband of Trump's former White House counsel Kellyanne Conway, presented a lengthy examination in an opinion piece in The Washington Post of Trump's suspected misconduct and even possible criminal behavior in a variety of actions in the White House — and before his presidency."}
{"original": "Particularly troubling was Trump's post-election behavior, Conway noted. Fear of indictment for past crimes seemed to animate Trump's frenzied efforts to overturn the results of the election he so clearly lost and retain the protections of the presidency, he added."}
{"original": "A desperate fear of criminal indictment may even explain Trump's willingness to break any number of laws to stay in office despite losing his reelection bid — democracy and the Constitution be damned, Conway wrote. Trump even insisted to Georgia's secretary of state in a stunning recorded phone call to find enough votes for him to overturn the state's actual election results."}
{"original": "Then, as the clock wound down on his time in office, he committed the ultimate impeachable offense for a president: fomenting a violent attempted putsch at the Capitol to stop Congress from confirming President-elect Joe Biden's electoral victory, Conway wrote."}
{"original": "If there could be any doubt about whether Trump can be given a pass without the rule of law paying too high a price, that ended in the ugly final weeks of Trump's presidency, Conway added. His attempts to reverse a free and fair election — by any means he saw necessary, including by fomenting violence — have not only undermined the rule of law but also threatened to destroy it altogether. No other president has ever done that, or attempted to do that, or probably even thought of doing that. Not even Nixon."}
{"original": "Trump's post-election conduct makes it impossible for the Justice Department to look away, noted Conway. If prosecutors don't investigate and, if warranted, charge, this former president, then we might as well say that all presidents are completely immune from criminal consequences for their conduct — whether during their term or after; whether the conduct occurred before their presidency or while in office, Conway added."}
{"original": "We might as well say, flat-out, that presidents are above the law."}
{"original": "There's a sick feeling of déjà vu for those of us in Manitoba these days. Here's why."}
{"original": "From 1986 to 1996, the provincial pig industry doubled with the industrialization of animal agriculture and massive support from the then-Conservative government in the form of lax regulations, financial support and trade missions."}
{"original": "Today, Manitoba has the largest pig industry in Canada, producing over 8 million pigs a year -- a number which doesn't reflect the total number of pigs born into the industry, as an estimated 11 per cent die before even leaving the farm."}
{"original": "As a result of the unrestricted growth, Manitoba suffered devastating ecological and social consequences. Lake Winnipeg's phosphorus load doubled, contributing to deadly algae growth, giving Lake Manitoba the rather dubious title of having the worst algae problem of any large freshwater lake in the world."}
{"original": "In response, a number of non-profit environmental and animal welfare organizations, as well as small-scale, mixed farmers, formed an unlikely coalition to address the issues. Because of all the uproar, in 2006, the province placed a temporary freeze on the construction of new pig barns pending a Clean Environment Commission review of the pig industry."}
{"original": "All these protections could be undone with the stroke of a pen."}
{"original": "In 2008, after protracted negotiations, public hearings and demonstrations, the NDP government passed Bill 17 which banned new construction of pig barns in 35 Manitoba municipalities."}
{"original": "In 2010, after a lengthy campaign by Canadians For Ethical Treatment of Farmed Animals, the Office of the Fire Commissioner released the Manitoba Farm Building Code, which laid out specific regulations for farm buildings, thereby providing some protection for animals from barn fires, which, by then, had reached epidemic proportions."}
{"original": "Then, in 2011, the province adopted The Save Lake Winnipeg Act which effectively prevented new or expanded pig barns throughout the province."}
{"original": "Now, all these protections could be undone with the stroke of a pen."}
{"original": "This past February, the Manitoba government announced its intention to repeal the Manitoba Farm Building Code. Under the new regulations, the requirements for fire stops on load-bearing walls, as well as the requirement for a water supply to fight fires, will be eliminated."}
{"original": "Then, last month, under the guise of red tape cutting, Premier Brian Pallister (PC) introduced Bill 24, which calls for the amendment or repeal of 15 pieces of legislation. If adopted, the new legislation would eliminate the ban on the construction of new pig barns and weaken environmental regulations governing the handling and spreading of untreated pig manure."}
{"original": "The industry's new goal - supported by the Pallister government - is to increase production by 25 per cent."}
{"original": "Environmental organizations are rightfully criticizing this bill, but little has been said about the animals suffering at the centre of this issue -- the pigs themselves. As undercover investigations have shown, cruelty is rampant on Manitoba pig farms. As former animal cruelty investigators, we have documented routine abuses in the pig industry, including the confining of pregnant pigs in barren crates so small they are unable to turn around, the mutilation of piglets without any pain relief, and the complete lack of medical attention for sick and suffering pigs."}
{"original": "Manitoba already has 1,379 pig farms. Yet, the industry's new goal -- supported by the Pallister government -- is to increase production by 25 per cent through the addition of 50 to 100 new barns, subjecting another 1.3 million pigs to lives of confinement, deprivation and cruelty."}
{"original": "Decades of observation reveal that the pig industry in Manitoba is a cyclical one, repeatedly expanding and contracting, aided by government efforts and funding. In 2007, when decreased profitability because of high feed prices and a high Canadian dollar combined with a new disease outbreak (Porcine Circovirus), the industry began to collapse. Barn fire numbers exploded tenfold over the previous year, killing over 30,000 animals, and reached a peak in 2009, when Swine Flu was detected. The Canadian government then paid out a whopping $300 million in tax-payer dollars to pig producers to exit the industry."}
{"original": "In a disturbing case of history repeating itself, we find ourselves in the same place we were 17 years ago with the Manitoba government once again assisting in the unrestricted growth of the pig industry, with devastating environmental consequences and immeasurable animal suffering sure to follow. It's again up to us as citizens to prevent this from happening. Please submit your concerns to publicregistry@gov.mb.ca by May 12."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Bernie Sanders' commanding Nevada caucus victory made him a top target for his Democratic rivals and a growing source of anxiety for establishment Democrats worried that the nomination of an avowed democratic socialist could cost the party in November."}
{"original": "Sanders' win solidified his front-runner status in the crowded field as the race turned to Saturday's presidential primary in South Carolina, where his moderate opponents scrambled to try to blunt the Vermont senator's momentum. But with so-called Super Tuesday just three days later, when 14 states vote and one-third of the delegates are awarded, time was running short for Sanders' opponents to consolidate support."}
{"original": "That prospect on Sunday amplified concerns among Democrats who believe Sanders' call for a political revolution would drive moderate and independent voters away from the party, both in the matchup against President Donald Trump and in House and Senate races."}
{"original": "I think it would be a real burden for us in these states or congressional districts that we have to do well in, South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, the House majority whip and the top-ranking black Democrat in Congress, said Sunday on ABC's This Week."}
{"original": "Clyburn, who said he'll endorse a candidate on Wednesday, specifically pointed to the districts Democrats flipped to take control of the House in 2018. In those districts, it's going to be tough to hold on to these jobs if you have to make the case for accepting a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, he said."}
{"original": "Sanders' campaign argued he will bring in new and infrequent voters — largely progressives, young people and voters of color — who have been alienated from the process and seek a drastic overhaul of Washington, not merely trying to oust Trump."}
{"original": "He successfully relied on that coalition Saturday to dominate his Democratic rivals in Nevada, pulling far ahead of the second-place finisher, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who came in third. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren landed in fourth, while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer were in a close race for fifth as the Nevada Democratic Party continued to tabulate results."}
{"original": "Sanders celebrated the win in Texas, a top Super Tuesday prize and a state that Democrats see trending their way thanks to a growing Hispanic population and opposition to Trump in the suburbs."}
{"original": "Sounding like a candidate who had already secured the nomination, Sanders told thousands of cheering supporters who filled a basketball arena on the campus of the University of Houston that he would win in the state both next month and next fall."}
{"original": "If working people and young people of this city, black and white and Latino, gay or straight, if our people stand together, come out to vote, we're going to win here in Texas, he said."}
{"original": "Sanders was announcing a plan to provide universal, government-funded child care until age 3 and universal pre-kindergarten programs after that. In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired Sunday night, he said he'd pay for it using part of the proceeds from his previously announced wealth tax, which would be levied annually on fortunes worth more than $32 million."}
{"original": "Sanders' new status was clear as most of his rivals sharpened their focus on him."}
{"original": "On Sunday, Buttigieg ripped Sanders' for his massive and often combative online following, saying the nominee's job is to call people into our tent, not to call them names online."}
{"original": "Speaking to a crowd of thousands gathered in a high school football field in Arlington, Virginia, Buttigieg said Democrats should nominate someone who will focus on mobilizing, not polarizing the American majority."}
{"original": "Politics will be fierce sometimes, but it is not just combat, he said."}
{"original": "Biden, meanwhile, swiped indirectly at Sanders, noting Sanders is an independent and not a member of the party he's seeking to represent in November, and at billionaire candidate Mike Bloomberg."}
{"original": "I ain't a socialist. I'm not a plutocrat. I'm a Democrat, Biden told supporters Saturday."}
{"original": "But some Democrats were worried that the new focus on Sanders may be too little, too late. For months, as several Democrats jockeyed to become the chief alternative to Sanders, they largely attacked each other on debate stages and in ads while taking relatively few punches at the Vermont senator."}
{"original": "Indeed, even after Sanders' strong finish in Nevada, Warren avoided launching a direct hit at Sanders even when asked directly whether a Sanders nomination would be a risk for the Democratic Party. The Massachusetts senator is aligned with Sanders on a number of key policies and competing with the Vermont senator for many of the same progressive voters."}
{"original": "Speaking to reporters in Denver, Warren instead continued her attacks on Mike Bloomberg, calling him the riskiest candidate standing on that stage because of his history of hiding his taxes, his history of harassment of women and his history of defending racist policies."}
{"original": "And Party leaders have been reluctant to appear to be putting their thumb on the scale, so as not to rile Sanders voters and further divide the party. It was not clear Sunday that there was any new strategy to try to knock Sanders off course or consolidate support behind a single moderate."}
{"original": "We gotta hope that some of these candidates develop political skills quickly, said James Carville, a Democratic strategist and one of the noisiest anti-Sanders voices in the party. The risk in losing the election is deep and profound. We just gotta pray."}
{"original": "Dan Pfeiffer, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, said if no candidates drop out before Super Tuesday and the moderates continue to split the delegate, Sanders likely has a lock on the nomination."}
{"original": "It's just simple math, Pfeiffer said, noting that he's not advocating that any candidates drop out to stop Sanders, and that he doesn't ascribe to the belief among some Democrats that Sanders can't win."}
{"original": "Each of these campaigns have a legitimate rationale for staying in the race, he said of Sanders' opponents."}
{"original": "On Sunday, those Sanders opponents pledged to stay in the race through South Carolina, and several signaled they would stay in through Super Tuesday."}
{"original": "Klobuchar rallied supporters near the North Dakota-Minnesota border, speaking to voters in her home state, which votes on March 3, while North Dakota on March 10. Warren campaigned in Colorado, also a Super Tuesday state. Biden was in South Carolina, the state his campaign hoped would revive his candidacy after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire and only modest improvement in Nevada."}
{"original": "Biden resisted predicting victory in South Carolina and said he isn't banking on Clyburn's endorsement, a blessing that could help Biden shore up support with the black voters his campaign has long argued will be the springboard to a nomination. Clyburn said Sunday he had heard from Democrats disappointed in Biden's debate performances."}
{"original": "Democrats will debate on Tuesday in Charleston, South Carolina. California billionaire Tom Steyer said Sunday he has qualified for that debate, after missing the mark for the stage in Nevada."}
{"original": "The stakes were high for Nevada Democrats to avoid a repeat of the chaos in the still-unresolved Iowa caucuses, and it appeared they did not entirely avoid complaints. Buttigieg's campaign raised questions about the results, citing more than 200 reports of problems allocating votes. It wants the state party to disclose more details of the votes and address concerns before releasing final results."}
{"original": "But the party said it was not planning to offer a more detailed voting breakdown and appeared to be inviting the campaign to follow recount rules if it wanted to challenge the results."}
{"original": "This story has been corrected to show that Rep. Jim Clyburn is the House majority whip, not the minority whip."}
{"original": "As many as 150,000 low-income Kansans stand to gain health coverage under a compromise plan to expand Medicaid that Gov. Laura Kelly (D) announced on Thursday."}
{"original": "If the state legislature passes the measure, Kansas would join 37 other states and the District of Columbia in broadening eligibility for the health care program to anyone earning up to 133% of the federal poverty level, which amounts to about $16,000 a year for a single person and $33,000 for a family of four."}
{"original": "Kansas had been one of 14 holdout states, as Kelly's Republican predecessors Jeff Colyer and Sam Brownback opposed Medicaid expansion. But since defeating then-Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach in the 2018 gubernatorial election, Kelly has been negotiating with the state's majority-Republican legislature over the policy. On Thursday, she jointly announced a deal with state Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning (R) to move ahead."}
{"original": "This process is far from over, as there are still several critical steps to be taken by the Kansas Legislature, Kelly said in a press release. But today, Sen. Denning and I are proud to stand together to propose a bipartisan compromise that will expand Medicaid and lower health care costs for Kansas families."}
{"original": "The 2010 Affordable Care Act called for a nationwide Medicaid expansion; a Supreme Court ruling two years later made it optional for states. Republican-led states mostly rejected the expansion at first, but states have gradually signed on to the program. The Affordable Care Act guarantees that the federal government will cover 90% of the costs associated with people who enroll in Medicaid under the expansion, while the states must finance the remainder."}
{"original": "Unlike recent bipartisan compromises on Medicaid in Virginia and other states, the Kelly-Denning plan is a straightforward expansion. The proposal would not, for example, make enrollees sign up for private health insurance plans via the Affordable Care Act's exchanges, nor does it include work requirements. Beneficiaries would, however, be required to pay at least $25 a month in premiums. A new tax on hospitals would fund the expansion. Kelly previously estimated the expansion would cover 150,000 Kansans."}
{"original": "The plan also includes a measure designed to reduce costs for private health insurance purchased by individuals and families through the federal HealthCare.gov exchange or directly from insurance companies."}
{"original": "My top priority is to lower the cost of health care for Kansans across the board. We want to give as many Kansans health care coverage as we can, in the Medicaid market and the non-Medicaid market, Denning said in a press release."}
{"original": "A reinsurance program would compensate insurers whose policyholders had extraordinarily high expenses, with the goal of stopping insurers from passing along those high costs to other consumers in the form of premium increases. President Donald Trump's administration has encouraged states to apply for federal approval of reinsurance plans and has already OKed them in 13 states, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation."}
{"original": "Several other states are actively considering joining the Medicaid expansion. Legislation to open up the program to more poor adults is advancing through the Wyoming legislature. In addition, grassroots activists in Missouri and Oklahoma are working to put the question of expansion before voters in ballot initiatives this year. A similar effort in Florida fell short."}
{"original": "Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act itself are still at risk, however. Trump and congressional Republicans remain committed to repealing the law and making significant additional cuts to Medicaid funding. In addition, a Trump-backed lawsuit brought by GOP state officials threatens to eliminate the entire law. Democratic state officials defending the Affordable Care Act have asked the Supreme Court to take up the case this year."}
{"original": "It has been a long time since Congressional appropriations, the process by which government funding is determined for the next fiscal year, has gone exactly according to plan."}
{"original": "Normally, the President will submit a budget request for what he believes national spending should reflect in January or February. Then, using (or completely disregarding) that framework, the House and Senate appropriators will begin hammering out details of where our tax dollars will go. It is a long, contentious process - sometimes, so much so that Congress essentially gives up on consensus and just extends the funding levels from the last year."}
{"original": "Remarkably, a few priorities have broken through the partisan gridlock as things that appropriators from both parties agree that the U.S. budget should support. For the past few years, wildlife trafficking has been one of those priorities."}

{"original": "That's why we need to keep pressure on our elected officials to continue the fight against wildlife trafficking. Though it wasn't emphasized in President Obama's proposed FY17 budget, Congress has the opportunity to maintain its longstanding support for these essential programs."}
{"original": "Wildlife trafficking is something that people of all political stripes can agree on because in many ways it is a national security issue. The people who are trading illegal wildlife products like elephant ivory, rhino horns, shark fins and tiger skins are members of intricate criminal networks. Many of these syndicates are the same ones engaged in the illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, and even people. Stopping wildlife trafficking is a way to shut down the networks that engage in other forms of crime."}
{"original": "Endangered wildlife are often poached from places that suffer from poor governance, a lack of law enforcement resources, and corruption. When countries like the U.S. commit funds to protect wildlife on the ground, we are supporting the rule of law and stability in those countries. That makes those places less likely to collapse into a breeding ground for more extremist groups, which threaten U.S. global interests."}

{"original": "These ideas have brought the Congress together around the issue of wildlife trafficking. Three years ago, appropriators created a new fund, administered jointly by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, dedicated solely to tackling wildlife trafficking. That money goes directly toward supporting wildlife rangers, on-the-ground law enforcement, addressing demand for wildlife products; the fund began at $45 million in FY14, and Congress has supported it every year since then, culminating in $80 million in Speaker Paul Ryan's FY16 budget agreement last fall. That agreement also saw record support for the USAID Biodiversity Program and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), as well as other anti-trafficking programs."}
{"original": "President Obama's FY17 budget request contained some very good environmental provisions, but it was missing support for the fight against wildlife trafficking. The dedicated wildlife trafficking account was proposed at $41 million, a little more than half of what Congressional Republicans and Democrats agreed upon just last fall. The USAID Biodiversity Program and the GEF also saw reduced proposals."}

{"original": "The Obama Administration has been a strong voice for wildlife conservation, having put forward a National Strategy on Wildlife Trafficking and leading the charge for a strong federal ivory ban. But as the Congress now considers the future of federal spending, we look to members of both parties to continue that legacy of bipartisanship and support the anti-trafficking programs that enhance our security and help protect our iconic wildlife from criminal networks."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― Most people want Democrats to get copies of President Donald Trump's tax returns and make them public, something Democrats said they would do but haven't done yet."}
{"original": "Sixty percent of Americans say Democrats in charge of the House of Representatives should use their power to obtain and release Trump's tax returns, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll."}
{"original": "Federal law lets certain committee chairs ask the IRS for copies of anyone's tax returns. Republicans declined to use their oversight power to get Trump's returns, even after he broke with decades of precedent by not voluntarily releasing them during the 2016 presidential campaign."}
{"original": "Now that Democrats control the House, they control its committees, and can make the request whenever they want. Some experts have criticized House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) for not doing so immediately."}
{"original": "Neal says his committee is methodically drafting the request and plans to submit it this year."}
{"original": "It's going to involve precedent, it's going to involve legality, and it's also going to be 'what do you do when you get them, if you get them,' Neal told HuffPost earlier this month."}
{"original": "It's possible Neal won't be able to get the returns, at least not right away. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, said last year that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin would review a tax return request for legality ― hinting that Mnuchin might not obey the law and that a long court battle could ensue."}
{"original": "If it's not done carefully and the case ends up in court, then it could conceivably be sent back to you based on procedure, Neal said."}
{"original": "Liberal groups have spoken out against Neal's delay. And so has Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow with the independent Tax Policy Center, who said it was a mistake for Neal not to make the request immediately. But he said it does matter how the request is made, and that it should relate to a legislative purpose."}
{"original": "There are a variety of legitimate legislative purposes, including how the IRS is administering the tax law, Rosenthal said."}
{"original": "Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) has defended Neal, saying the chairman is juggling the tax return issue with other committee priorities, which include not only taxes but also health care and Social Security. But Trump's tax returns are still in the top four, he added."}
{"original": "We got a lot at stake here, Pascrell said. We want to see if the president of the United States has a conflict of interest that he brought with him or that he created since he got here. The only way to do that is to get his tax returns."}
{"original": "Unlike previous presidents ― most of whom released their tax returns as a matter of course ― Trump hasn't divested from his businesses, meaning he could be making policy decisions that directly enrich his family."}
{"original": "In the ABC News/Washington Post poll, 57 percent of respondents said they think Democrats should investigate possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and 61 percent said Democrats should look into the president's financial ties to foreign governments."}
{"original": "Even 39 percent of conservatives and a quarter of Republicans said Democrats should try to obtain Trump's tax returns, which would reveal information about his sources of income."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Monday it will hold arguments by teleconference in May in key cases, including President Donald Trump's bid to shield his tax and other financial records."}
{"original": "The court will make live audio of the arguments available for the first time. It had previously postponed courtroom arguments for March and April because of the coronavirus."}
{"original": "The court will hear 10 cases in all between May 4 and May 13. In addition to fights over subpoenas for Trump's financial records, they include two cases about whether presidential electors are required to cast their Electoral College ballots for the candidate who won their state."}
{"original": "The justices and the lawyers arguing the cases all will participate remotely. The court said a live audio feed will be provided to news organizations."}
{"original": "The court has never live-streamed courtroom arguments and only rarely has it made the audio available on the same day."}
{"original": "Six of the nine justices are 65 and older, at higher risk of getting very sick from the illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."}
{"original": "Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87, and Stephen Breyer, 81, are the oldest members of the court."}
{"original": "The only other time Supreme Court arguments have been held outside the 85-year-old court building was in October 2001, when anthrax was detected in the court mailroom. That led the justices to hold arguments in the federal courthouse about a half mile from the Supreme Court, but only for one week."}
{"original": "In 1918, when the court still met inside the Capitol, arguments were postponed for a month because of the flu pandemic. Smallpox outbreaks in the late 1700s also caused postponement of court business."}
{"original": "Illustration by Isabella Carapella/HuffPost; Photos: Alamy and Getty Images Seen here: Oprah Winfrey in Lee Daniels' The Butler, Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke and Angela Lansbury in Murder, She Wrote."}
{"original": "Do you ever notice the way actors eat on-screen? I do. Take the volatile dinner scene in American Beauty. It lasts three minutes, but we only see one bite of food enter someone's mouth; the rest is just a lot of argumentative fork-waving. After the central family in Spike Lee's Crooklyn blesses their supper, they spend a lot more time discussing the meal than actively consuming it. The Thanksgiving comedy Home for the Holidays used 64 turkeys, according to director Jodie Foster, but not a single one got eaten. And though Paul Newman downing 50 hard-boiled eggs in Cool Hand Luke is one of cinema's most stomach-churning moments, the frenzy is pure wizardry: I never swallowed an egg — the magic of film, Newman told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1993."}
{"original": "Maybe I should have posed a different question. Do you ever notice the way actors don't eat on-screen? The creative lengths they go to avoid chewing in front of the camera, even if food is essential to the scenery? The sly editing that cuts away right before a spoon meets a mouth?"}
{"original": "Angela Lansbury taught me and I share it with other actors: She would always start with her fork in her mouth and take it out and pretend to chew, said veteran food stylist Nancy Goodman Iland, who worked on the last few seasons of Murder, She Wrote. Actors need to speak intelligibly, and shooting multiple takes of the same scene requires them to limit their intake and maintain continuity. Start observing food closely and you'll see what I mean. You know, I don't really eat on set, Diane Keaton recently told Vulture."}
{"original": "Of course, sometimes an actor has to gobble it up ― picture Bill Murray hoisting an entire slab of cake past his chompers in Groundhog Day or the gobs of syrupy spaghetti that Will Ferrell inhales in Elf. That demands some very different strategies (more on that less appetizing revelation later)."}
{"original": "In making all the food movie magic, modern actors are added by the food stylist, an unsung position that has become fairly ubiquitous in Hollywood over the past couple of decades."}
{"original": "Archive Photos via Getty Images Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell in Groundhog Day."}
{"original": "Food stylists have mastered a number of ways to approach their complex workloads, which include researching, purchasing and preparing the food necessary for any given project and arranging said food so it photographs well take after take after take. Curious about their process, I talked to a number of stylists who help bring these tasty scenes to life."}
{"original": "Food on film is the most temperamental actor, said Christine Tobin, a Boston-based stylist whose credits include American Hustle, Ghostbusters and 2019's Little Women, in which a savory Christmas banquet is the plot point that propels the March sisters' neighborly romances."}
{"original": "Before they can start cooking, stylists must find out what actors are willing to eat. The several I spoke to agreed that most stars, however powerful, are only as exacting as they have to be when it comes to food. Lee Daniels' The Butler stylist Richard Papier assumed someone as famous as Oprah Winfrey or Jane Fonda would have many stipulations, but neither had any. Susan Spungen said that Julia Roberts requested asparagus for a lunch scene in Eat Pray Love because it was easy to stomach. And sometimes actors are downright playful, like Brad Pitt, who told Ocean's Eleven stylist Valerie Aikman-Smith that he'd prefer sweets while playing a slick crook routinely dining on the go — hence Pitt's lollipops and ice cream."}
{"original": "And yet actors in general, stylists agreed, are still a lot more exacting now than they were before gluten-free and paleo became part of our everyday lexicon. When Melissa McSorley started out on series like Freaks and Geeks and The Bernie Mac Show, if performers were vegetarian, they'd simply avoid the meat on their plate. But with more food stylists on sets comes the expectation that everyone's predilections will be accommodated."}
{"original": "Universal Pictures Alfre Woodard, Delroy Lindo and their brood in Crooklyn."}
{"original": "That coordination is nothing compared to the detailed process that follows: creating a culinary composition in sync with the story's aesthetics, tone and production schedule. Part of that equation is the meticulousness of the director in question. David Fincher and Nancy Meyers, for example, are known for doing dozens of takes, so if there's food involved, the actors will need a lot of it. Basically, your job is to plan a menu for every week, said Papier, a New Orleans chef who took on movie gigs in the early 2010s when Louisiana was offering some of the best entertainment tax credits in the country."}
{"original": "That might mean hunkering down in a library to research old menus, like McSorley did when she was tasked with making every detail on Mad Men historically accurate. (Sample investigation: Was red velvet cake a thing during the 1960s?) Or it could mean inventing something fantastical, like McSorley did when she fashioned an enchanted LED apple native to a fairy wonderland for HBO's True Blood."}
{"original": "Unlike home cooks, the food stylist must prioritize appearance over taste, which leads to all sorts of tricks we're not meant to notice. Papier discovered that adding Elmer's glue to a glass of milk prevented it from developing a blueish tint on-camera. Others have grabbed spray bottles to maintain that oven-fresh glisten or tweezers to refine the microscopic details of how some delicacy is arranged on a plate. (No wonder actors shy away from actually eating the food in front of them.) On Julie & Julia, Spungen took matters into her own hands, literally: Now, you really think that Meryl Streep is going to stand there for hours lacing up a duck when it's not necessary? she said. It's the same thing as having a body double for sex scenes. You don't want to have to have the actor on set if they don't need to be."}
{"original": "Before alleged Matilda thief Bruce Bogtrotter (Jimmy Karz) could cram down an obscene amount of chocolate cake as punishment, prop master Emily Ferry had to find a baker who could fashion a three-layer confection that was sufficiently messy but didn't resemble a giant pile of excrement. Ferry ordered numerous versions, testing the size, color and filling. She also commissioned styrofoam replicas because the real cakes were too heavy for the actors to carry."}
{"original": "We shot that for weeks, Ferry recalled. There are laws in California as to how many hours a child can work, and also, poor Jimmy, he could only do that for so long before he started getting green around the gills. So we would shoot for a while and then we would come back to it. And we would have to call the poor baker in Long Beach and say, 'We need another six cakes.' And finally, towards the end of it, she was going, 'Oh no, not another one.'"}
{"original": "TriStar Pictures Jimmy Karz and Pam Ferris, otherwise known as The Trunchbull, in Matilda."}
{"original": "If you were to watch the raw footage, Ferry said, you'd see a props person scurrying around between takes to hand Karz a spit bucket — a receptacle common in scenes that demand heavy consumption. Kate Winslet used one while making the 2013 melodrama Labor Day, in which she had to eat scone after scone after scone, Tobin said. Even nonfiction programming uses spit buckets, as Spungen saw while working on an episode of PBS's American Experience about Industrial Revolution-era food manufacturing."}
{"original": "All of this is to say that food stylists have one of the most interesting jobs in Hollywood. It's only going to get more complicated in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, McSorley participated in an industry-wide committee dedicated to determining new safety protocols. While the virus isn't known to be transmitted via food, stylists still need to shield their equipment."}
{"original": "You have to be a very specific personality to be a food stylist, I will tell you that, said Goodman Iland, the Murder, She Wrote stylist whose other credits include The Good Place, A Star Is Born and Straight Outta Compton. That means that you have to be ready to show up, rush, set up, get it done, and then sit down and wait for hours. Or you might show up and wait for hours, and then rush and get it together. And it might be that you are given some wild food scenes, and you have to figure out how to do it and how to make it work."}
{"original": "Turkish soccer executives campaigned this month for major constitutional change that would grant President Recep Tayyip Erdogan far reaching executive powers. The Turkish Football Federation's (TFF) backing of Mr. Erdogan's effort to accumulate more power put to bed any notion of a separation between politics and soccer. So did the failure of world soccer body FIFA and UEFA, its European affiliate, to condemn the TFF's violation of a cardinal principle of international sports governance."}
{"original": "Speaking at a TFF conference, Mr. Erdogan punctured the fiction upheld by sports officials and politicians of a Chinese Wall that separates sports and politics. I believe politics and football share many common aspects at the core. Just like sports, the essence of politics is competition, race... Just as a team, playing without any plan, tactic or strategy, have zero chance of winning the cup, politicians, political parties that have nothing to tell the people have no chance of success. Just like football, politics cannot be done without passion, love and dedication. You have to dedicate yourself, Mr. Erdogan said."}
{"original": "If Mr. Erdogan set the ball up, TFF president Yildirim Demiroren, a businessman who built his fortune in liquid gas distribution, sealed the goal by campaigning for a vote in favour of enhancing the president's power in a referendum scheduled for April 16. . Speaking at the same conference, Mr. Demiroren expressed the hope that Turkey would wake up on the morning of April 17 to discover that a majority of Turks had voted yes."}
{"original": "Turkish soccer's partisan alignment with politics with no sanctioning by international and regional sports associations responsible for policing maintenance of the fiction of separation of politics and sports goes however further than simple endorsements. It involves sanctioning soccer officials, players, and club members for holding potentially dissenting political views."}
{"original": "Cumhurriyet, one of Turkey's few remaining independent newspapers, reported last week that the TFF had suspended a referee in the Black Sea town of Sinop for publicly calling for a no vote in the referendum. The referee, Ilker Sahin, charged that the TFF was applying double standards by de factor stipulating that campaigning in favour of a yes vote was legitimate, campaigning against was not."}
{"original": "Similarly, Istanbul-based Galatasaray FC, one of Turkey's leading clubs, scrambled last week to expel two prominent former players, Hakan Suker and Arif Erdem, hours after sports and youth minister Akif Cagatay Kilic, took the club to task for not already having done so."}
{"original": "Galatasaray had voted a day earlier not to include Messrs Sukur, Turkey's all-time top scorer, and Erdem in the expulsion of alleged followers of Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Muslim preacher, whom Mr. Erdogan blames for last year's failed military coup. Those expelled included former provincial governors and prosecutors."}
{"original": "Messrs. Sukur and Erdem were members of the Galatasary squad that won the UEFA Cup in 2000. Mr. Sukur, like Mr. Gulen, has sought refuge in the United States from where both men condemned the failed military attempt to topple Mr. Erdogan."}
{"original": "A former recruiter for the Gulen movement, Said Alpsoy, who successfully focused on winning support for the preacher among Turkey's top soccer stars said he had recruited half of Galatasaray's team by the time he broke with the group in 2003."}
{"original": "US President Donald J. Trump's short-lived national security advisor, Retired Army Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, reportedly discussed while in office with senior Turkish government officials ways of extraditing Mr. Gulen to Turkey without going through the U.S. extradition legal process."}
{"original": "Traitors to our country and our state have no business in our established sports clubs. The board's voting is inexplicable to the families of our martyrs and veterans, Mr. Kilic said."}
{"original": "Heavily indebted clubs like Galatasary cannot afford to cross Mr. Erdogan who prides himself on having engineered financial relief for various clubs, partly through tax amnesties. UEFA executive Andrea Traverso noted that Turkey is the only member of the European association where debts and liabilities outstrip clubs' assets."}
{"original": "Turkish soccer also owes Mr. Erdogan for protecting clubs from the potentially devastating fallout of the worst match-fixing scandal in Turkish history. The scandal in 2011 was the first public skirmish between Messrs. Erdogan and Gulen, who until then had been allies, particularly in successfully asserting civilian control of the armed forces. Aziz Yildirim, the head of Fenerbahce SK, the political crown jewel of Turkish soccer, who was at the core of the scandal, has accused Mr. Gulen's followers of engineering the scandal."}
{"original": "The financial troubles of Turkish clubs are aggravated by a severe drop in match attendance following the introduction of a mandatory electronic ticketing system in 2013. Fans have boycotted the system in the belief that it was designed to identify them as part of a crackdown on popular, politicized fan groups. Soccer fans played an important role in mass anti-Erdogan protests in 2013, the largest since Mr. Erdogan first became prime minister a decade earlier."}
{"original": "For his part, Mr. Erdogan outlawed Mr. Gulen's Hizmet movement as a terrorist organization in the wake of the failed coup. Critics of Mr. Erdogan have questioned his assertion and accused him of exploiting the coup to label most of his critics as Gulenists and act against them."}
{"original": "German intelligence chief Bruno Kahl told Der Spiegel earlier this month that Turkey had been unable to convince Germany of Mr. Gulen's guilt. Turkey has tried to convince us on a number of different levels. But they haven't yet been successful, Mr. Kahl said."}
{"original": "A former soccer player, Mr. Erdogan has sought to enhance his popularity in soccer-crazy Turkey in advance of the referendum by publicly identifying himself with the sport. The president was among the first to congratulate the Turkish national team on the pitch in Ankara for its defeat of Finland in a World Cup qualifier."}
{"original": "In doing so, Mr. Erdogan is in good company. Many world leaders see identification with a popular sports team as way to enhance their own popularity. Congratulations are, however, a far cry from turning soccer into a willing political tool. It raises questions about where the dividing line is in the alleged separation of sports and politics as well as about the integrity of international sports governance."}
{"original": "Retailing stores are skyrocketing in sales, cars and houses are sold using credit like never before. On the other hand, politicians are hard at work trying to garner support of a certain group of people - countries' economies are greatly powered by a collective called the middle class."}
{"original": "This phenomenon of the Middle Class is swiping right across the world - who is benefiting, governments, business or people in the middle class?"}
{"original": "Politicians are capitalizing on the middle class with rhetoric that appeals to them, or urging the poor to vote for them in order to get them in the middle class - nobody campaigns with a message to make everyone rich, but they preach a message of making leaving stands better and creating jobs; essentially politicians' message rotates around the middle class."}
{"original": "The rise of populism led by certain leaders, due to income inequality, the public tends to go after the wealthy, financiers and elites etc - therefore is in the best interest of the wealthy to cultivate the ground on which the middle class can grow and thrive."}
{"original": "The middle class act as a cushion for the wealthy, this spectacle is working in their favour from a tax perspective where the tax pool is enlarged, secondly, protects them from the poor, the retaliation and tension that might erupt if there is a wide gap between the rich and poor without a substantial number of those in the middle class; for the poor will have to go through the middle class before they reach the upper class - even though, it is often the middle class that is inclined to go against the upper class."}
{"original": "What really is the middle class?"}
{"original": "Numbers vary gauged by income - reasonable standards by few researchers regard them as those who earn between $47 000 to $125 000 annually per household, spending at least $100 per day. If you go further, the definition of middle class in developing countries might be those spending on average of $12 a day, inevitably changing the aggregate of their annual income bracket."}
{"original": "Fascinating thing about most people, they regard themselves as the middle class, even those by true definition are in the lower class, basically poor. Somehow, even those who are earning in the region of $1m-$6m annually, this kind of people are suffering from a reference dilemma, they may happen to be comparing themselves with those making much more than them."}
{"original": "Middle class spenders are economic drivers, the rich spend less than they earn, the poor spends all they have and even more in debt."}
{"original": "More than 50% of a middle class family is spent on their house and car payments."}
{"original": "Middle class is over burdened by debt and responsibility of taking care of extended family members, particularly in developing countries. Many of them are the first generation of middle class with other family members with lower income, automatically casting the responsibility to look after the rest."}
{"original": "In mid 1900s mainly in the US and Europe, one income in a middle class household was enough to sustain a family, not affluent, but enough. Came the 80s and 90s where a significant number of mothers started to work like no other time before, however since then coming into the 2000s, two incomes are not enough. Loans are summoned right and left for children's school tuition, housing and cars etc."}
{"original": "What happened right there??! Are we going to put this concern at the feet of inflation or what? What happened?"}
{"original": "Let me further pose more questions than answers. Did lobbyists influence law makers to tax more the middle class and the poor, than the rich percentage wise? The CEOs start to earn way more than their average worker?"}
{"original": "Did manufacturing jobs get shipped to countries with cheap labour like China, and certain jobs outsourced to countries like India? Houses we live in, have they increased higher than the inflation rate over these years, making them more expensive than ever? Automation and technology, has it taken away good paying jobs?"}
{"original": "All I'm asking, is what happened, and more importantly how can the middle class stand up for themselves, how can law makers work in favour of the collective than one segment?"}
{"original": "Here is a subtle factor, the bourgeoisie generation, the rise in consumer behaviour, a materialistic driven world, too many things to buy, gadgets added to our budgets. Today we are buying many things we did not spend money on in the past like smartphones, internet and many more. Increasingly fashionable to go on holidays in various countries - although all of these is good and necessary for many."}

{"original": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) went after fellow Democratic presidential candidate and billionaire Michael Bloomberg on Sunday for deciding to bypass campaigning in early primary states while asking the Federal Election Commission to push his financial disclosure deadline until after those states vote."}
{"original": "Warren's comments came just days after the FEC granted Bloomberg's request to delay publicly disclosing his finances until March 20, which is well after voters in over a dozen states cast their votes in the primary election. All presidential candidates must disclose their investments and streams of income, though Bloomberg is the only Democratic candidate to have not yet filed the paperwork."}
{"original": "The timing of the delay matters because the former New York City mayor has decided against campaigning in early voting states to instead invest his money in later states. The FEC delay means that Bloomberg is denying early state voters important information about his finances and how he spends his money."}
{"original": "If he has entanglements with China, serious conflicts of interest, business interests in other parts of the world or other corporations, when are we going to know about that?

That is not how democracy is supposed to work."}

{"original": "The Bloomberg campaign did not respond to HuffPost's request for comment."}
{"original": "Warren was asked at the forum whether she'd take Bloomberg's money in the general election if she won the Democratic nomination, referring to the billionaire's recent comments that he'd spend big to help whoever is the nominee beat President Donald Trump, even if that nominee is not Bloomberg himself. While the senator did not completely reject the notion that she'd embrace Bloomberg's efforts, she stressed that she is running a grassroots campaign and will not sell special access ― something she has declared before."}
{"original": "He wants to put money into getting a Democrat elected? Good for him, Warren said. But understand this: I do not sell access to my time. I don't spend time sucking up to billionaires. People want to make a contribution, that's great. But I'm going to keep fighting the fight I'm fighting, and that is a fight to make this government work, to make this democracy work, not just for a thinner and thinner slice at the top [but] to make it work for everyone. That's why I'm here."}
{"original": "Warren has criticized Bloomberg several times as she makes an issue of the advantages of the billionaire class, an integral part of her presidential campaign thanks to her proposed wealth tax that would levy an annual two-cent tax on net worth over $50 million and a 6% tax on fortunes over $1 billion."}
{"original": "In November, the senator accused him of trying to buy the nomination after he paid for at least $37 million in campaign ads over a two-week period. In December, she appeared for an interview that aired on Bloomberg's own media network, Bloomberg TV, and said she was deeply concerned that the billionaire had already spent so much on the presidential race and alluded that he was only doing so to save money on his taxes."}
{"original": "Democratic presidential candidates, led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, are starting the new year by stepping up their criticisms of former Vice President Joe Biden's ability to defeat Republican President Donald Trump, directly confronting the national front-runner's greatest strength."}
{"original": "Biden's continued healthy lead in national polling, and his still-strong-but-not-dominant position in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire is directly linked to the perception, backed up by polling data showing Biden with a healthy lead over Trump, that he is best positioned and best equipped to defeat the incumbent."}
{"original": "Sanders, Buttigieg and close allies of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren have all launched attacks on Biden since the new year that are focused on convincing Democratic primary voters both that they shouldn't vote for Biden and that Midwestern swing voters won't want to. The strategy is designed to give voters whose first concern is electability ― a majority of the Democratic primary electorate, according to public polling ― to vote with their liberal-leaning hearts instead of their Trump-focused heads."}
{"original": "Everyone thinks Biden is electable because everyone keeps saying how electable he is. I think it's important to have the conversation, said Rebecca Katz, a progressive Democratic strategist who has been critical of the former vice president. There's been no vocal progressive bullhorn presenting a counter-message."}
{"original": "There are major questions about the effectiveness of these attacks, most of which the Biden campaign dismissed as old news. And so far, none of the campaigns have been willing to attack Biden with paid advertising ― which would dramatically increase the number of voters exposed to criticisms."}
{"original": "Mike Blake / Reuters Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders speak toward the end of the sixth 2020 U.S. Democratic debate, Dec. 19, 2019."}
{"original": "During an appearance on CNN Monday night, Sanders ticked off a number of potential attacks on Biden, noting his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, the war in Iraq and his past support for cutting Social Security."}
{"original": "You think that's going to play well in Michigan or Wisconsin or Pennsylvania? Sanders asked host Anderson Cooper, ticking off three midwestern states won by Trump that are largely seen as crucial to the eventual Democratic nominee's path to 270 electoral votes."}
{"original": "Warren and Buttigieg have not been as direct. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee ― a group that has long functioned as Warren's political enforcers ― questioned Biden's electability after the Massachusetts senator unveiled a plan to roll back many of the provisions of a 2005 law making it harder to qualify for bankruptcy, arguing it would allow Trump to seize the outsider mantle."}
{"original": "When thinking about electability, it would be complete malpractice to nominate someone who conspired in backrooms for years with credit card lobbyists and voted for every corporate bankruptcy bill, Wall Street deregulation, and trade deal that voters hate, said Adam Green, the group's co-founder."}
{"original": "Buttigieg, meanwhile, has criticized Biden over his support for the Iraq War and even questioned the former Vice President's handling of his son Hunter's work for Ukranian energy company Burisma ― an attack most Democrats have avoided."}
{"original": "Even entrepreneur Andrew Yang has gotten in on the action, hitting the self-styled Middle-Class Joe, for being out of touch with blue-collar workers. Yang, whose candidacy is premised on aiding workers made redundant by technology, seized on Biden's suggestion that coal miners could learn to program."}
{"original": "Someone who suggests that coal miners become coders is generally neither of those things, Yang said."}
{"original": "The Biden campaign, meanwhile, is confident they can rebut these attacks. A long list of Democratic candidates ― California Sen. Kamala Harris, California Rep. Eric Swalwell and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, to name a few ― have dropped out of the race not long after lobbing an attack at Biden. They're prepared to respond with examples of Sanders and Warren praising the former vice president: On Wednesday morning, a Biden endorser tweeted out a clip of Sanders praising Biden for devoting his entire life to public service and to the well-being of working families and the middle class."}

{"original": "And they're doubling down on their electability argument. On Sunday, after three members of Congress who won Republican-held House seats during the 2018 Democratic wave endorsed Biden, the campaign released a memo arguing Biden was in far better position than other Democratic candidates to drive down-ballot success and help Democrats win control of the Senate."}
{"original": "This election is defined by the urgent need to defeat Donald Trump and the toxic values he represents. Poll after poll has shown that Vice President Biden would beat Donald Trump like a drum ― and Donald Trump proved he knows that when he became the only president in American history to attempt to extort a foreign country into lying about the rival candidate he fears the most, Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said."}
{"original": "And Sanders' attacks come as the Democratic establishment is warning about the Vermont socialist's ability to beat Trump. Biden allies, in particular, suggested they would welcome a debate with their major challenger on foreign policy issues."}
{"original": "Bernie's the only presidential candidate who talked up the Soviet Union and said breadlines were indicative of a healthy economy, one Biden ally said. If he really wants to go there, God bless him."}
{"original": "Electability has defined the 2020 presidential race, and several candidates have attempted to redefine the conversation around it, arguing Biden won't be able to generate turnout among Black voters or young people. Those attempts have largely failed, and voters in Iowa and New Hampshire have remained focused on Midwestern swing voters. Sanders' attacks, in particular, are designed to question Biden's appeal there."}
{"original": "Veterans of Democratic politics are divided on whether the electability-focused attacks on Biden will have an impact, particularly given voters' strong associations of the former vice president with former President Barack Obama, a sacrosanct figure in Democratic circles."}
{"original": "When it comes to questions of electability, perhaps no issue looms larger than Biden's long history of support for corporate-friendly international trade agreements, including NAFTA, permanent normalized trade relations with China and the now-defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership. Many Democratic officials from the industrial Midwest and allied labor unions credited Trump's fulminations about trade policy for helping him pick off just enough historically Democratic voters to put him over the top in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania."}
{"original": "But Tim Waters, the former political director of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based United Steel Workers union, which was frequently at odds with Obama and Biden on trade policy, argued that Sanders' and Warren's attacks were liable to backfire."}
{"original": "It seems a little desperate to me, said Waters, who has not formally endorsed in the Democratic presidential primary. Joe Biden was in the United States Senate for a long time … He has many decades of standing up for working families and trying to do the right thing."}
{"original": "By contrast, Larry Cohen, a Sanders supporter and former head of the Communication Workers of America, which has also fought trade agreements that could jeopardize domestic jobs, insists that it is a relevant point of contrast. Cohen recently returned from a tour with the pro-Sanders groups Our Revolution and Labor for Bernie promoting Sanders in Eastern Iowa's manufacturing-heavy cities and towns. The Eastern part of the state is also home to many of the counties that flipped from Obama to Trump."}
{"original": "These cities from Dubuque to Burlington are devastated and people are wondering: Is there somebody who still believes in manufacturing jobs and standing up for the rights workers doing them? Cohen said. For a Democrat to have credibility they have to have the record. Vice President Biden ― lots of great things about his career ― his record on trade and foreign policy is not among them."}
{"original": "Still, Biden's greatest vulnerability may be on Social Security, which Sanders only mentioned in passing in his CNN interview on Monday night."}
{"original": "That may be a foretaste of future attacks. Following the interview, spokespeople for the Sanders campaign tweeted out video of Biden expounding on the need to reduce Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits in a mid-1990s speech on the Senate floor."}
{"original": "More recently, Biden served as the point person for the Obama White House during budget negotiations with Republicans in which Obama offered to cut Social Security in exchange for tax hikes elsewhere. And in an April 2018 speech at the Brookings Institution, Biden declared that Social Security and Medicare benefits would need adjustments, including, he implied, lower benefits for affluent retirees."}
{"original": "Joe Radinovich, a former Minnesota House candidate and congressional staffer who hails from Minnesota politically purple-hued Iron Range, believes that a Social Security-driven critique could resonate in his home region."}
{"original": "In a notable departure from Republican orthodoxy, Trump promised to protect Social Security as a candidate in 2016. And though he has since sought to restrict access to Social Security disability benefits, he might well try to blur his differences with Biden on the issue, predicted Radinovich, who endorsed Sanders in 2016, but is unaligned this time around."}
{"original": "His long history in Washington leaves him open to criticism that he's been on both sides of every issue or been part of what Trump calls the swamp, and you can tie that to the false allegations of what Trump alleges about Biden and Ukraine, Radinovich said."}
{"original": "When I joined the Assembly, one of the first issues I started working on was making diapers more affordable and accessible to parents. The lack of sufficient supply of diapers to keep an infant or toddler clean, dry, and healthy has ripple effects through the community, and with nearly 5.3 million babies in the U.S. age three or younger living in poor or low-income families, and one third of infants and toddlers with at least one parent working full time living in low-income families, it's a problem that demands real action."}
{"original": "We know diaper need is a serious, widespread problem, but while our existing government support programs work around the edges to define the problem, we still don't actually address it. California alone is home to about 2.5 million children under age five. One third live in single parent households, and the number of low income working families with children is more than one-in-five and rising. Medicaid currently covers over 1/3 of all births in the U.S. each year, and perhaps not surprisingly 1 in 3 U.S. moms report suffering from diaper need."}
{"original": "We have programs like CalFresh and CalWORKs to support low-income families, but despite being a clear necessity, direct diaper assistance remains 100% non-governmental. Low-income parents have to rely on a network of diaper banks, food banks, social service agencies, community and faith based groups, because government assistance programs like food stamps and CalFresh do not cover diapers. Unfortunately, this blind spot is getting worse."}
{"original": "California's cost of living continues to rise, especially for low-income families, and everyday necessities of life like diapers are expensive. Diapers cost anywhere from $72 to $100 per child every month, adding up quickly for those struggling to make ends meet."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, California's formula for calculating the income limit making families eligible for subsidized child care and preschool has been falling over the last decade relative to the state's median income. As a result, families are disqualified for subsidized child care at a lower income than in the past. According to the California Budget and Policy Center, that means a single mother of two would have to spend 70% of her income to cover the full cost of child care."}
{"original": "Diaper need impacts not just economics, but the physical and mental well-being of children and parents. Parents who lack diapers may change diapers less often or reuse disposable diapers, putting their children at risk for preventable medical problems while generating unnecessary medical costs and pulling parents away from work for doctor visits."}
{"original": "It's also well established that children who participate in early childhood education are almost three times more likely to go on to higher education. But without providing the six to 10 diapers they need each day, babies cannot participate in early childhood education programs. In most cases, parents who can't provide diapers are shut out of daycare options altogether, not only making it extremely difficult to provide a good start for their child early in life, but making it even harder to rejoin the workforce."}
{"original": "I've raised two kids myself as a single mom, so I know the financial and logistical strain this issue creates for parents. And the country understands this too: 95% of Americans strongly agree that clean diapers are a basic need for children, and 97% agree that clean diapers are as important as shelter and food."}
{"original": "If we want family support programs like those offered by CalWORKs to be effective, we have to ensure that parents are in a position to take advantage of the help that's available. That's why I have authored two legislative approaches to relieving California's working families of diaper need."}
{"original": "Assembly Bill 717 would exempt diapers from sales tax like in seven other states, a simple bit of financial relief for new parents that can add up to the cost of a full month of diapers annually. While the policy isn't explicitly need-based in the same way as the CalWORKs voucher in Assembly Bill 492 that I have also authored, we all agree sales tax is an extremely regressive tax that impacts working families the hardest, costing them upwards of $100 annually on diapers alone."}
{"original": "AB 492 provides vouchers to specifically help make diapers more affordable for parents trying to get back to work. This proposal would make sure California's kids are on track for success early, and that parents have every opportunity to get back to work to provide for their families. We're beginning our 2016 efforts this week as the Assembly Committee on Human Services considers AB 492 to finally address diaper need in California, and I hope you'll be with us."}

{"original": "Millions of individuals volunteer to help raise funds or perform other tasks on behalf of charitable organizations like religious groups, schools and hospitals. When the annual reckoning with the IRS rolls around, the reward for their willingness to help out can take the form of write-offs for unreimbursed expenses incurred while they do volunteer work."}
{"original": "But what's in store at tax time for animal-rescue volunteers who work on behalf of organizations like the Humane Society of the U.S. and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals? Are they also entitled to claim charitable deductions for their unreimbursed expenses?"}
{"original": "The IRS says such outlays are nondeductible personal expenditures, unless the rescuers establish that they incur the expenses to further the efforts of charitable organizations--for instance, foster care for stray animals."}
{"original": "A U.S. Tax Court decision in 2011 is good news for animal-rescue volunteers across the nation. Jan Van Dusen of Oakland, California, used her home to care for over 70 abandoned cats. She shelled out about $12,000 for vet bills, food and other care expenses and deducted those payments as charitable contributions."}
{"original": "The IRS's ever-vigilant computers bounced her return. The agency's predictable response: Jan's use of her home meant that the write-offs at issue were nondeductible personal expenses."}
{"original": "Undeterred, the cat rescuer took the dispute to the Tax Court, where she argued her own case. Jan persuaded the court that she rendered services for an IRS-approved charity that specialized in the neutering of wild cats. The decision opens the way for volunteers to claim deductions for rescued animals cared for within their homes, provided they can distinguish between expenses for rescued animals and expenses for their personal pets"}
{"original": "Paperwork. Volunteers shouldn't rush to uncork the bubbly. Jan didn't completely prevail. The court curtailed her write-off because she failed to comply with the substantiation requirements. Jan could've deducted the entire $12,000, had she kept the required records for pertinent expenses."}
{"original": "The key requirement is a letter from the charity acknowledging your volunteer work for expenses of $250 or more. The charity must issue it prior to the due date for the return in question. If the IRS disputes your deductions, expect the agency to ask for a letter that authorizes you to keep animals in your home."}
{"original": "Lots of out-of-pocket outlays pass muster. Animal-rescue volunteers can claim charitable deductions for many kinds of outlays. Qualifying expenditures include: animal feed; medicines; cat litter; litter boxes; pet dishes; cleaning supplies, garbage bags, paper towels, laundry detergent and dish detergent; animal bedding; animal toys such as those that help with behavior modification and well-being; fees paid to veterinarians and behavior trainers; and food for volunteers building temporary shelters for pets evacuated from flood zones in hurricanes."}
{"original": "Travel. Other often-missed outlays become available to rescuers as soon as they leave their homes. Allowable deductions include travel expenses to and from animal shelters, veterinarians, committee meetings, fundraising events, and so on. Volunteers who travel to and from their charitable chores by planes, trains, buses, or taxis should keep track of their fares and claim them as travel expenses."}

{"original": "We saw that there was more to be done than just networking, Unsworth said. We wanted the same women attending those events to come to city council meetings and have their stories told, not just in these women's meetings."}
{"original": "Around the same time Supernova Women formed in 2015, California cannabis policy went into overdrive, and legalization seemed inevitable."}
{"original": "Lencho studied cannabis prohibition and policy in law school at Stanford. When she entered the field as an attorney providing guidance for cannabis businesses, she was surprised how little consideration was given to addressing the harms that had been caused by criminalization."}
{"original": "When you came to the business side of things, there was a complete dearth of conversation about inclusion, even though social and racial justice were at the forefront of the talking points around why you should legalize and why you should allow local jurisdictions to give permits, Lencho said. But no one was talking about providing permits for those who actually went to jail for cannabis."}
{"original": "In November 2016, California passed Proposition 64, which legalized recreational, or adult use, marijuana and included sweeping measures to address harm caused by its prohibition. Localities would establish their own rules for approving licenses to sell recreational cannabis beginning on Jan. 1, 2018."}
{"original": "Lawmakers and advocates began to discuss what it might look like if legalization policies embraced restorative justice. How can communities of color, whose access to the networks and means required to start a business for cannabis had long been oppressed by the rules governing it, now benefit from what is projected to be the largest and most profitable market in the U.S.?"}
{"original": "Christina House/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Customers line up in West Hollywood as the legal sale of recreational marijuana begins in California."}

If nothing else, we wanted to slow it down and make sure that these other considerations were on the table."}

{"original": "In early 2017, Oakland City Councilwoman Desley Brooks put forward a radical equity permit plan to address the harmful effects of prohibition on communities of color: When handing out permits, prioritize those who had been hit the hardest by marijuana criminalization."}
{"original": "When you look across this country, the people who are making money in respect to cannabis and recreational marijuana are white men, Brooks told Rolling Stone earlier this year. The people who have historically gone to jail for the same activity are predominantly African-American and Latino."}
{"original": "Prior to Jan. 1 and the implementation of Proposition 64, California state licensing policies prohibited anyone with a felony conviction for cannabis from starting a cannabis business, so any person previously in possession of a plant the state now considered legal was excluded from the legal market."}
{"original": "Nationally, black people are 3.5 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people, even though the two groups consume cannabis at similar rates. In Oakland, 90 percent of cannabis arrests from 1995 to 2015 were people of color."}
{"original": "Oakland's newly created department of race and equity, led by Darlene Flynn, produced an equity analysis to see how outcomes for people of color might be improved by the kind of equitable cannabis policy Brooks had proposed."}
{"original": "We did outreach through the network of cannabis folks in the city of Oakland and sat with folks and asked them questions about what the barriers were and what it would take for them to overcome those barriers and to engage in the legalized cannabis market, Flynn told HuffPost."}
{"original": "Supernova Women provided expertise and stakeholder perspectives for Flynn's equity analysis. The city finalized and adopted its equity permit program in May of 2016."}
{"original": "The program reserves half of medical and recreational marijuana business licenses for applicants who meet certain criteria: They must live in Oakland, make less than 80 percent of the area median income, and had either been convicted of a cannabis crime or live in an area of the city with disproportionately high marijuana arrests."}
{"original": "It also creates incentives for applicants who don't meet those criteria to incubate equity applicants and provide capital and real estate for their businesses. Those who qualify receive no-interest loans from the city."}
{"original": "Supernova Women urged lawmakers in San Francisco to consider a similar program. Without equity language in place on Jan. 1, when cities could officially license adult-use cannabis businesses, the city might lose a chance to ensure that those who had been hurt by the racist criminalization of the plant were first in line to create wealth from it."}

{"original": "The programs are slightly different, but they all have the same basic themes, Lencho said. You can't exclude people who have been formerly incarcerated, you can't fail to provide certain technical assistance, financial assistance or real estate assistance to those people.

{"original": "Last week Bill Gates called for taxing robots. He argued that we should impose a tax on companies replacing workers with robots and that the money should be used to retrain the displaced workers. As much as I appreciate the world's richest person proposing a measure that would redistribute money from people like him to the rest of us, this idea doesn't make any sense."}
{"original": "Let's skip over the fact of who would define what a robot is and how, and think about the logic of what Gates is proposing. In effect, Gates wants to put a tax on productivity growth. This is what robots are all about. They allow us to produce more goods and services with the same amount of human labor. Gates is worried that productivity growth is moving along too rapidly and that it will lead to large scale unemployment."}
{"original": "There are two problems with this story: First productivity growth has actually been very slow in recent years. The second problem is that if it were faster, there is no reason it should lead to mass unemployment. Rather, it should lead to rapid growth and increases in living standards."}
{"original": "Starting with the recent history, productivity growth has averaged less than 0.6 percent annually over the last six years. This compares to a rate of 3.0 percent from 1995 to 2005 and also in the quarter century from 1947 to 1973. Gates' tax would slow productivity growth even further."}
{"original": "It is difficult to see why we would want to do this. Most of the economic problems we face are implicitly a problem of productivity growth being too slow. The argument that budget deficits are a problem is an argument that we can't produce enough goods and services to accommodate the demand generated by large budget deficits."}
{"original": "Gates' notion that rapid productivity growth will lead to large-scale unemployment is contradicted by both history and theory."}
{"original": "The often told tale of a demographic nightmare with too few workers to support a growing population of retirees is also a story of inadequate productivity growth. If we had rapid productivity growth then we would have all the workers we need."}
{"original": "In these and other areas, the conventional view of economists is that productivity growth is too slow. From this perspective, if Bill Gates gets his way then he will be making our main economic problems worse, not better."}
{"original": "Gates' notion that rapid productivity growth will lead to large-scale unemployment is contradicted by both history and theory. The quarter century from 1947 to 1973 was a period of mostly low unemployment and rapid wage growth. The same was true in the period of rapid productivity growth in the late 1990s."}
{"original": "The theoretical story that would support a high employment economy even with rapid productivity growth is that the Federal Reserve Board should be pushing down interest rates to try to boost demand, as growing productivity increases the ability of the economy to produce more goods and services. In this respect, it is worth noting that the Fed has recently moved to raise interest rates to slow the rate of job growth."}
{"original": "We can also look to boost demand by running large budget deficits. We can spend money on long neglected needs, like providing quality child care, education, or modernizing our infrastructure. Remember, if we have more output potential because of productivity growth, the deficits are not problem."}
{"original": "We can also look to take advantage of increases in productivity growth by allowing workers more leisure time. Workers in the United States put in 20 percent more hours each year on average than workers in other wealthy countries like Germany and the Netherlands. In these countries, it is standard for workers to have five or six weeks a year of paid vacation, as well as paid family leave and paid vacation. We should look to follow this example in the United States as well."}
{"original": "If we pursue these policies to maintain high levels of employment then workers will be well-positioned to secure the benefits of higher productivity in higher wages. This was certainly the story in the quarter century after World War II when real wages rose at a rate of close to two percent annually."}
{"original": "Of course these policies will not ensure that no workers ever suffer from automation. While we can never guarantee that no worker is harmed by improvements in technology in a dynamic economy, we can look to soften the impact."}
{"original": "One obvious policy would be to require severance pay, for example two weeks of pay for each year worked. This would both give displaced workers somewhat of a cushion and changes the incentives for employers. If a company knows that it faces large payout if it lays off a number of long-term employees, then it has more incentive to think about modernizing its facilities and retraining workers. This would be a win-win where the company has an interest in ensuring that its workers are as productive as possible while the workers get to keep their jobs."}
{"original": "In short, there is no reason that productivity growth should ever be viewed as the enemy of workers. We just need the right set of policies to ensure that they share in the gains."}
{"original": "Attorneys general from over a dozen states where some form of marijuana use has been legalized are urging Congress to pass legislation that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis businesses without risking federal prosecution."}
{"original": "In a letter sent to congressional leaders on Tuesday, attorneys general from 17 states, Washington D.C. and the U.S. territory of Guam said they shared a strong interest in protecting public safety and bringing grey market activities into the regulated banking sector."}
{"original": "To address these goals, we urge Congress to advance legislation that would allow states that have legalized medical or recreational use of marijuana to bring that commerce into the banking system, the letter stated."}
{"original": "Such a law would bring billions of dollars into the banking sector, and give law enforcement the ability to monitor these transactions, the letter said. It added that compliance with tax requirements would be simpler and easier to enforce with a better-defined tracking of funds. This would, in turn, result in higher tax revenue."}
{"original": "Medical marijuana is legal in 29 states and several U.S. territories, including Guam. Eight of those states and the District of Columbia have also passed laws legalizing recreational cannabis use by people who are at least 21 years old. The new year ushered in a newly legal recreational weed market in California."}
{"original": "But the federal government still classifies cannabis as an illegal substance, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this month rescinded four Obama-era memos that discouraged enforcement of the federal ban. The abrupt announcement sparked confusion among banks on how to work with cannabis businesses without running afoul of federal money laundering laws."}

{"original": "The last couple of years have been even more confusing for taxpayers than usual. Thanks to major changes stemming from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Americans who file their 2019 taxes this season are less likely to claim the same deductions they did in the past (and less likely to get a refund)."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump's tax plan reduced or eliminated several tax deductions, while also increasing the standard deduction significantly. That made it more difficult for taxpayers who usually itemize deductions to write off expenses, such as state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable donations."}

This deduction is part of what's officially called bonus depreciation, which helps business owners invest in new equipment by providing them with a tax break."}
{"original": "Prior to the 2017 tax overhaul, taxpayers could deduct up to 50% of the cost of machinery, software, furniture and other equipment during the first year it was put into use. The rest of the deduction would be amortized over multiple years, based on how long that equipment was expected to last. The new tax law, however, made it possible to deduct 100% in the first year and expanded the deduction to cover used property in certain instances."}
{"original": "When it comes to your private plane, it needs to be used for business purposes at least 50% of the time after the first year to keep the deduction. The other half of the time, feel free to jet-set as desired."}

{"original": "This deduction falls under the mortgage interest deduction, which allows homeowners to deduct interest on loans for their first and second homes. Previously, this deduction let taxpayers write off interest on loan balances up to $1 million, but the Trump tax law cut that amount down to $750,000."}
{"original": "In order to qualify as a home, the vessel must have a head, sleeping berth and a galley (that's a bathroom, bed and kitchen to you landlubbers). If any of these features are missing, you can't claim the deduction. But any respectable yacht surely has all three, and then some."}
{"original": "In life, you win some and you lose some. But when it comes to gambling, losses could qualify to be deducted from your taxable income."}
{"original": "The key is that you also need to win some money. When calculating the taxes owed on that cash (yes, you have to claim gambling winnings as income), you are allowed to deduct any losses incurred, up to the amount of your winnings. And it's not just chips lost to the roulette or craps table that you can write off; any other reasonable expenses incurred, such as travel to the casino, can also be included."}
{"original": "This tax deduction was once only available to professional gamblers, but the new tax law expanded it to cover amateurs, too.

{"original": "Like millions of other Americans, financial journalist Janet Alvarez was laid off from her job in 2009. She decided to ride out the recession by pursuing her MBA, racking up six figures in student loan debt along the way."}
{"original": "But when she graduated, the economy was still sputtering, and there were few jobs available for her, despite her advanced degree. Her credit score was in the gutter, and to top it off, she had tens of thousands of dollars in medical debt."}
{"original": "I was really at a rock bottom, said Alvarez."}
{"original": "But thanks to her professional background, she had the skills to dig up solutions to her massive debt problem. Through a combination of income-driven repayment and refinancing, she was able to lower her payments until she was in a position to aggressively tackle her loans. Today she is nearly debt-free, and as the executive editor of personal finance site Wise Bread, she helps others navigate similar difficulties."}
{"original": "Whether you're barely scraping by or simply want to pay less per month on your student loans, there's hope for getting those payments lowered."}
{"original": "When you graduated from college, you were automatically enrolled in the standard repayment plan, the default plan for federal borrowers, which requires you to pay off your loan over 10 years. What you might not realize is that this plan is not your only option ― far from it, in fact."}
{"original": "One way to lower your monthly payments is to enroll in an extended payment plan. Adam Minsky, a lawyer whose practice is dedicated entirely to helping people with student loans, said this allows you to stretch out payments over up to 25 years. With more time to pay, the amount you have to hand over each month decreases."}
{"original": "The extended repayment option is available only to federal student loan borrowers (as are most repayment benefits). Additionally, you cannot have had an outstanding balance on any Direct loans or Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans before Oct. 7, 1998, and you must have at least $30,000 in Direct or FFEL loans."}
{"original": "The drawback? The longer you take to pay off your loan, the more you'll pay in total interest. It's important to ask yourself whether lower payments now are worth spending more on your loans over time."}
{"original": "2. Opt for a graduated payment plan."}
{"original": "If your income is low now but you expect it to increase over the next few years, a graduated repayment plan might give you the breathing room you need."}
{"original": "Rather than fixed payments over 25 years, this variation of the extended repayment plan starts off with monthly payments that gradually increase. Most federal loans require a payment period of just 10 years. However, if you consolidated any loans through the Department of Education, you may have 10 to 30 years to pay off the consolidated loan, depending on how much you owe."}
{"original": "3. Enroll in an income-driven repayment plan."}
{"original": "If you're unemployed ... your payment might actually be $0. - Janet Alvarez, executive editor of WiseBread"}
{"original": "You also have the option of enrolling in one of four available income-driven repayment plans, which cap monthly payments as a percentage of your discretionary income."}
{"original": "In fact, according to Alvarez, if you're unemployed or your earnings dropped to a very low level, then your payment might actually be $0."}
{"original": "These plans promise to forgive any remaining balance after the repayment period is up, though borrowers must pay taxes on the full forgiven amount the same year it's discharged."}
{"original": "Pay as you earn (PAYE): Payments are capped at 10 percent of your discretionary income and can never exceed what you would pay on the standard plan. Any remaining balance is forgiven after 20 years."}
{"original": "Payments are capped at 10 percent of your discretionary income and can never exceed what you would pay on the standard plan. Any remaining balance is forgiven after 20 years. Revised pay as you earn (REPAYE): Payments are capped at 10 percent of your discretionary income. However, there's no cap on how high payments can go; if your income increases significantly, so can the payments. Additionally, if you're married, your spouse's income and student loan debt will be considered when determining payments, even if you file taxes separately. Any remaining balance is forgiven after 20 years for undergraduate loans and 25 years for graduate loans."}

Any remaining balance is forgiven after 20 years for undergraduate loans and 25 years for graduate loans. Income-based repayment: Payments are capped at 10 to 15 percent of your discretionary income, depending on when you took out your loan. Payments will never exceed what you would pay on the standard plan. Any remaining balance is forgiven after 20 to 25 years, again depending on when you borrowed."}
{"original": "Payments are capped at 10 to 15 percent of your discretionary income, depending on when you took out your loan. Payments will never exceed what you would pay on the standard plan. Any remaining balance is forgiven after 20 to 25 years, again depending on when you borrowed. Income-contingent repayment: Payments are capped at 20 percent of your discretionary income or what your payments would be on a 12-year fixed repayment plan, whichever is less. However, there's no cap on how high payments can go. Additionally, the amount of student loan debt you have is considered along with your income when determining payments. Any remaining balance is forgiven after 25 years."}
{"original": "Another reason to consider an income-driven plan: You might get your debt forgiven sooner, tax-free."}
{"original": "Certain loan forgiveness programs require that you be in certain types of repayment plans, said Minsky. For instance, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program requires that borrowers be on an income-driven plan. So if you're not in one of those plans, you might not be able to make qualifying payments toward that program."}
{"original": "If you are considering one of these income-driven plans, be sure to fully investigate all the rules before committing. Then you can use the Department of Education's repayment estimator to crunch the numbers and see which plan would work best for you."}
{"original": "If you have multiple federal student loans with varying interest rates, repayment terms and payment due dates, a direct consolidation loan is a convenient way to roll all those loans into one. Plus, borrowers with loan balances exceeding $60,000 can extend their loan term up to 30 years, according to Minsky."}
{"original": "Consolidating is often required to enroll in certain repayment and forgiveness programs, including those outlined above. But even if you don't pursue one of these programs, simply consolidating and extending the repayment period beyond 10 years is another way to see lower payments."}
{"original": "Keep in mind that federal consolidation doesn't save you any money. Not only will you pay more interest over time, but also the interest rate you pay on your new loan will be a weighted average of your old loans, plus a small percentage. Again, you'll have to decide what's more important to you: more cash now or more savings overall."}
{"original": "5. Refinance at a lower interest rate."}
{"original": "One of the few options available to borrowers who took out private loans is student loan refinancing."}
{"original": "The process of refinancing involves taking out a new loan through a private lender and using that money to pay off your old loans. The goal is to achieve better terms with the new loan, such as a lower interest rate or different repayment term. Since refinancing is available only through private lenders, you'll be subject to a credit check and other eligibility requirements to qualify, all of which vary by lender."}
{"original": "[With private loans,] basically, you owe what you owe, and you have to pay it. - Janet Alvarez"}
{"original": "Although it's possible to refinance federal and private loans, refinancing federal loans is generally ill-advised. That's because refinancing with a private lender strips you of any federal protections, such as income-driven options, forgiveness programs, deferment and forbearance."}
{"original": "Private loans generally don't include any provisions to protect borrowers during times of unemployment or financial difficulty, said Alvarez. Basically, you owe what you owe, and you have to pay it."}
{"original": "Even so, if you have older federal loans or high-interest PLUS loans, scoring a lower interest rate might be worth giving up those benefits."}
{"original": "It comes down to the borrower's risk tolerance ... whether they're comfortable giving up those rights and protections that are inherently part of the federal loan system, said Minsky."}
{"original": "If you have private student loans, be sure to opt into your lender's autopay program. Most lenders will provide a rate discount in exchange for the guarantee that they'll get paid on time and in full every month."}
{"original": "Usually, the discount is a small 0.25 percent. Even so, every bit helps, especially if you have a large balance. Some lenders will offer an additional discount if you've made consistent payments for a certain period, according to Alvarez."}
{"original": "You don't have to be held hostage by student loans."}
{"original": "Most of us will at some point encounter difficulties that are beyond our control, said Alvarez. A recession, we can't control. Layoffs, we often can't control."}

And while that may be the case for many championship bouts, the mysteriously polarizing effect that Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton seems to have on people has only heightened the tension surrounding this year's contest."}
{"original": "Either you respect the emotional manner in which Newton plays the game -- and celebrates his victories -- or you don't. Either you're an admirer or a detractor, and goodness knows we've heard plenty from both sides over the course of this season."}
{"original": "And while other NFL players have spoken out in support of Newton all year, Monday's Super Bowl Opening Night revealed that one unexpected league veteran has also sat himself in Newton's camp: rival QB Peyton Manning."}
{"original": "Declaring that Newton was without a doubt the 2015 MVP, Manning told reporters that the reason he himself doesn't celebrate highlight-reel scoring plays like Newton is simply because, unlike Newton, he doesn't run for any touchdowns. A notoriously, er, un-mobile quarterback at this point in his career, the 39-year-old Manning raised eyebrows in the AFC Championship game a week ago simply by rushing for 11 yards."}
{"original": "I promise if I run a touchdown on Sunday, I will celebrate, Manning joked, before continuing to praise Newton. … I think his passion, his enthusiasm for the game, I think it's great. I think it's good for football."}
{"original": "Please, please let Manning make his way into the end zone this weekend. There aren't many sights we'd rather see in Santa Clara on Sunday than this guy dabbing."}

{"original": "A Government agency tried to deny a business rates rebate to a food factory with killer cladding the day after the Grenfell Tower tragedy, it has emerged."}
{"original": "The Press Association has learned that the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) – funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) – argued at a tribunal on June 15 that the highly flammable cladding, similar to that blamed for the tower block blaze on June 14 which killed around 80 people, did not affect property values."}
{"original": "Food factory Adams Pork Products, in Boston, finally won its appeal following a two-year battle to cut its business rates bill after the tribunal ruled that the VOA was wrong to deny the appeal."}
{"original": "The Valuation Office Agency is funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government (PA)"}
{"original": "The tribunal found in favour of the firm in July, triggering a seven-year tax rebate for the company."}
{"original": "Its decision also provided further evidence suggesting the fire risks of this cladding – now dubbed killer cladding – were known well before the Grenfell blaze."}
{"original": "The tribunal said in its ruling that awareness of the danger created by cladding comprising flammable compounds was known prior to the material day of 1 April 2010, which is when the business rates were last set."}
{"original": "But the effect this creates on rental values (and consequentially on rating assessments) was probably less well known, it added."}
{"original": "Adams Pork Factory, whose premises have been vacant since at least April 2010, argued that a number of fires had occurred in premises with this or a similar type of cladding and that insurance was difficult to secure and costly as a result – often at a 300% premium."}
{"original": "The tribunal was told that fire services would not attend blazes with such cladding unless there was a threat to life."}
{"original": "It is thought the decision could lead to an influx of business rates appeals from schools, hospitals, factories and offices whose buildings have combustible cladding, as the Grenfell tragedy is likely to have had an unprecedented effect on demand and values for affected properties."}
{"original": "The DCLG said it was unclear how many factory buildings might have the cladding, although it is working with local authorities to identify numbers."}
{"original": "It added that efforts were focusing initially on residential buildings over 18 metres tall, but said there is an independent review of building regulations across the board which is due to report with interim findings later this year."}

{"original": "If he ordered me to reopen in a way that would endanger the public health of the people of my state, I wouldn't do it, Cuomo said Tuesday on CNN. And we would have a constitutional challenge between the state and the federal government, and that would go into the courts. And that would be the worst possible thing he could do at this moment, would be to act dictatorial and to act in a partisan, divisive way."}
{"original": "After widespread evidence that Trump and the federal government botched the U.S. response to the pandemic, governors like Cuomo have largely been at the forefront of those efforts, often in a collaborative way. That became more formalized Monday, when two groups of governors, in the Northeast and on the West Coast, announced joint task forces to develop a plan to reopen their states together."}

{"original": "The propaganda video showed several cable reels of reporters downplaying the virus's risk in January, and then showed a timeline of the White House's response to the pandemic. A CBS reporter asked Trump what he did to mitigate the spread in the month between announcing travel restrictions from China and announcing that pharmaceutical companies were beginning to develop a vaccine; Trump did not directly answer the question."}

{"original": "The White House's nascent effort to bail out oil and gas producers struggling with plunging oil prices could become a political boondoggle, legal and industry experts say, given the difficulty of finding congressional support for offering federal dollars to an industry plagued by reckless financing and devastating effects on the climate."}
{"original": "The price war that broke out between Saudi Arabia and Russia on Sunday pushed the price of crude into its steepest single-day nosedive since 1991. Both producers vowed to continue oversupplying the market even as the panic over the coronavirus pandemic grounded planes and shuttered factories, significantly reducing demand. The combined effect sent the price of oil below $33 a barrel Wednesday and threatened what one analyst called a financial bloodbath for the U.S. fracking industry, whose rapid expansion over the past decade was fueled by precarious debt."}
{"original": "In response, the Trump administration, which has aggressively bolstered the oil and gas sector, this week began strongly considering offering low-interest government loans to drillers, The Washington Post reported Tuesday."}
{"original": "It's unclear what form such an aid package would ultimately take and whether it would require congressional approval if it reached fruition. The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's largest and most powerful lobby, told reporters it was not asking for a bailout and denied having any talks with the administration. At a Wednesday hearing on Capitol Hill, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration was considering a loan package to certain industries similar to the federal program to prop up airlines after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks caused an abrupt drop in air travel."}
{"original": "That measure, which provided direct aid worth $7.3 billion in today's dollars and $14.6 billion in loan guarantees for the airline industry, came through Congress and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on Sept. 23, 2001."}
{"original": "Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Pump jacks swing in the Midway Sunset oilfield in California, near a large shale formation."}
{"original": "Mnuchin, according to a separate Washington Post report, insisted four times that such a program would not amount to a bailout and specifically zeroed in on airlines, hotels and cruises. Legal experts said those industries may be an easier sell than assisting the oil industry."}
{"original": "For one, we don't want these businesses to go under, and, two, we do want them to shut down and stop spreading disease, said James Coleman, an associate professor at Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law in Dallas. With respect to the oil industry, what are we getting for our money? That's less clear."}
{"original": "Hydraulic fracturing, the drilling technique known as fracking, transformed the United States over the past decade from a nation concerned about oil and gas shortages to a top exporter of both fuels. But the fracking wells that now pincushion the landscape in states such as Pennsylvania, North Dakota and Texas came at high costs. The industry relied heavily on debt to finance its rapid expansion, raising about $300 billion from bond issuance from 2009 to 2019."}
{"original": "That credit line started to shrink over the past few years as investors demanded more disciplined spending and a sharper focus on profits. The 30 largest shale producers in the sector lost more than $50 billion from 2012 to 2017, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. From 2015 to 2016, the market research firm Moody's estimated, a whopping 91% of all corporate debt defaults in the country were in the oil and gas sector."}
{"original": "Unlike previously bailed out industries, such as banking or travel, which provide economically vital services that are difficult to replace if companies go out of business, oil and gas resources don't go away if the firms that tap them do, said Ed Crooks, vice chairman of the energy research consultancy Wood Mackenzie. By stepping in, he said, the federal government would effectively penalize energy companies that borrowed money cautiously and prevent overdue bankruptcies that he surmised would lead to a necessary consolidation of the industry. He compared the process to a sobering up."}
{"original": "One of the potential silver livings of this crisis is it will accelerate that [consolidation] and impose economic rationality and traditional, commercially sound behavior on the industry, Crooks said. If the government intervenes and starts throwing money at it to prop it up and prevent that disruption and turbulence you go through as you're having a rationalization, in the long term it's counterproductive."}
{"original": "The industry has gotten quite a few things off its wish list from this administration. Yet the administration is still willing to do more. It's just, like, when will it ever end? Caitlin McCoy, environmental and energy fellow at Harvard Law School."}
{"original": "The industry carries important symbolism for the Trump administration, which cast its efforts to deregulate and expand the industry as vital to its nationalist agenda. The president's reelection campaign embraced the fossil-fuel industry in its outreach to voters in critical swing states such as Pennsylvania. But it's hardly been a job engine. Despite 30% increases in productivity over the past two years, employment in the industry has remained flat since May 2018, Crooks said."}
{"original": "The effects of the downturn were likely to primarily hurt small-scale producers, Crooks said. But even oil majors, such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp., saw their stock prices drop this week. Some companies benefited from the market dive. Investors flocked to some small fracking companies that primarily drill for gas, not oil, under the theory that, in the short term, oil giants might scale back production. But drillers' sensitivity to price swings shows significant weakness in the industry overall as green alternatives gobble up fossil fuels' market, said Tom Sanzillo, the finance chief at the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis."}
{"original": "You have an energy transition taking place, so what that means is the nature of the cyclical markets in fossil fuels, the up and down, is taking place in an environment where there are now non-fossil fuel competitors at every level, Sanzillo said. They are taking what looks like small amounts of market share, but, in a constricted market, any amount of market share hurts profitability."}
{"original": "Climate change is the other proverbial elephant in the room. United Nations scientists determined in 2018 that the world had to halve emissions by 2030 to maintain a climate that resembles that of today. But even that looks like a conservative estimate. In November, a paper published in the journal Nature warned that a point of no return, at which human-caused warming triggers uncontrollable releases of natural greenhouse gases and rapid, violent climatic changes, are more dangerously close than previously believed. New research published in the journal Nature Communications this week found that the tipping point at which irreversible changes ravage the world's ecosystem could come in a matter of years, far sooner than expected."}
{"original": "The United States' planet-heating emissions fell only slightly, by 2.1%, in 2019 due to an 18% drop in coal-fired electricity production, a study by the consultancy Rhodium Group found in January. But increased oil and gas production supplanted most of the reduced emissions. By 2025, the sum of all projected emissions from planned oil and gas projects in the U.S. equal 50 coal-fired plants' worth of greenhouse gases, a report by the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found."}
{"original": "By 2030, the U.S. is on track to produce 60% of the world's new oil and gas supply, 90% of which will come from fracked wells, according to a 2019 report by scientists at more than a dozen environmental groups. By the middle of the century, those emissions would total the equivalent of 1,000 coal-fired plants."}
{"original": "The fracked gas sector boasts that its product is less carbon-intensive than coal, the fuel it has eclipsed as the nation's primary source for electricity. But methane, a powerful planet-heating emission and the main component in fracked gas, is responsible for roughly 25% of global warming. The oil and gas industry's methane emissions are also 60 times higher than existing federal estimates, according to a University of Colorado study published in 2018 in the peer-reviewed journal Science."}
{"original": "Yet this reality hasn't stopped President Donald Trump, who rejects climate science altogether, from eliminating regulations to curb emissions or limit oil and gas drilling. Before Trump took office, the industry took in the lion's share of the $20 billion in federal and state subsidies given each year to fossil fuel companies, a report by the nonprofit Oil Change U.S. found. Since his administration began, the White House moved to scrap rules on limiting methane emissions and offshore drilling, relaxed protections on an endangered bird that lives on oil-rich lands, and opened up public lands with fragile ecosystems to oil and gas leasing."}

The hypocrisy, for some, was difficult to ignore today."}

{"original": "Billionaire hedge fund operator Leon Cooperman inspired many Twitter users to take up a musical instrument on Thursday: the really tiny violin."}
{"original": "Cooperman appeared on CNBC to discuss how Reddit users are buying up shares of GameStop to troll Wall Street traders like, well, Cooperman."}
{"original": "He predicted things would end badly. Very badly for the trolling traders."}
{"original": "I'm not damning them. I'm just saying from my experience, this will end in tears, Cooperman said. GameStop is not worth $500, not worth $400, not worth $300, not worth $200, not even worth $100, not even worth $50."}
{"original": "After a pair of professional investment firms placed big bets that the money-losing video game retailer's stock would crash, a group of smaller investors have been buying up shares to support the company and beat back the professionals, according to The Associated Press."}
{"original": "Cooperman blamed the phoenix-like rise of GameStop stock on a variety of factors including people [who] are sitting at home, getting their checks from the government, basically trading for no commissions and no interest rates."}
{"original": "But what really set off Cooperman was the idea that billionaires like him aren't paying their fair share in taxes."}
{"original": "I hate that expression with a passion! Cooperman said. What does fair share mean? … I'm willing to work six months a year for the government, and six months for myself — which means a marginal tax rate of 50%. If you live in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, you're already well past that. This fair share is a bullshit concept! It's just a way of attacking wealthy people."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A new government report says that the U.S. budget deficit is set to hit $897 billion this year and predicts that economic growth will slow as the effects of President Donald Trump's tax cut on business investment begin to drop off."}
{"original": "The Congressional Budget Office Report predicts a $118 billion increase over last year's $779 billion deficit."}
{"original": "The CBO predicts in a report released Monday that the economy will grow by 2.3 percent this year, a slowdown from 3.1 percent last year."}

{"original": "There is plenty of data suggesting that education, particularly a college or university degree, leads to higher incomes. Less is known about the impact of higher education -- and specific schools -- on socioeconomic mobility, that is, moving from one rung of the income ladder to another."}
{"original": "A new study by The Equality of Opportunity Project sheds valuable light on this question: Which colleges in America contribute the most to helping students climb the income ladder?"}
{"original": "Many Elite Colleges Have Chosen Affordability Over Access"}
{"original": "Researchers found that poor students who attend top (i.e. selective or elite) colleges do about as well in terms of income as their rich classmates, but many fewer lower income students attend these institutions. According to a New York Times article on the study, at 38 colleges in America, including five in the Ivy League - Dartmouth, Princeton, Yale, Penn and Brown - more students come from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire bottom 60 percent."}
{"original": "Further, less than one-half of 1 percent of children from the bottom fifth of American families attend an elite college; less than half attend any college at all."}
{"original": "As Danny Yagan, one of the study authors, noted, Free tuition only helps if you can get in."}
{"original": "The authors of Mobility Report Cards: The Role of Colleges in Intergenerational Mobility tracked more than 30 million students born between 1980 and 1991, linking anonymized tax returns to attendance records for almost every college in America."}
{"original": "There are a number of interesting reflections on higher education policy that emerge from the interpretation of this data. The New York Times reports, These patterns are important because previous research has found that there are many highly qualified lower-income students who did not attend selective colleges--and because the low- and middle-income students who do attend top colleges fare almost as well as rich students."}
{"original": "Put a different way, lower-income students end up earning almost as much on average as affluent students who attend the same college."}
{"original": "The New York Times also concluded, most Americans remain on a similar place on the income distribution graph from their late 30s through the end of their careers."}
{"original": "College Mobility Rate Measures Graduates Movement Up Income Ladder"}
{"original": "The researchers in the new study also developed a new data point -- a college's mobility rate - which combines a college's share of students from lower-income families with its success in moving them into a higher permanent level on an income earning's chart. A disparate collection of mainly mid-tier public colleges, including California State University - Los Angeles and the City University of New York System -- and not the Ivies -- have the best college mobility rates."}
{"original": "Of course, any number of factors can come into play to affect these conclusions. Most Ivies are mid-sized institutions, for example, so the impact that they have on national rates reflects the aggregate number of students that they contribute to the national findings."}
{"original": "Still, the findings raise important policy questions as American higher education continues to evolve and re-invent itself. For example:"}
{"original": "Do elite colleges have a special mission to educate broadly across all income levels as the justification for their continuing status as non-profits?"}
{"original": "If so, should they be held any more or less accountable for their ability to do so given their sticker prices, the size of their endowments, and their published statements on institutional mission?"}
{"original": "What is more important: affordability or access?"}
{"original": "It is widely accepted that public colleges typically educate the most first-generation students and those from the lowest socioeconomic class. In the race for students, do public and private colleges and universities really educate different students by income level or is the pool of applicants from which they select similar in 2017?"}
{"original": "Is there differentiation by income between public and private flagship research universities or between the research universities and four-year predominantly undergraduate institutions?"}
{"original": "Do non-elite institutions serve students from lower socioeconomic classes successfully?"}
{"original": "If so, given the level of preparedness affecting the social, familial, cultural, psychological, and financial challenges that these students face, should different standards apply to admission, retention, and graduation rates across colleges and universities?"}
{"original": "In fact, should a college's accountability be measured more fairly against the challenges that the college faces when working with students who require more attention than similar students at highly selective colleges?"}
{"original": "Is it the money that matters most in the free college tuition plans now being proposed, when retention and graduation rates do not support greater student success if only the financial barriers are lessened?"}
{"original": "Is a partial solution to design policies that better reflect institutional missions, intentions, and projected outcomes?"}
{"original": "Should state and federal governments set education, including higher education, as a much higher priority in planning and funding cycles given rising income inequality in America?"}
{"original": "For the past several years, consumer and political polling have relied on high tuition sticker prices, rising debt, and anecdotal personal stories to shift the blame of higher education's failures on to America's colleges and universities."}
{"original": "There is plenty of blame to go around with a good share of it borne by higher education. But politicians and their policy planners must also accept their own failures to read the research, understand and anticipate the demographic shifts, and assess the impact of technology on American society."}
{"original": "There is a persistent and growing problem with income inequality in the United States."}
{"original": "Rather than police American higher education, perhaps our political, social and economic leadership should find a way to partner with colleges and universities on developing solutions. It begins by doing the homework necessary to ask the right questions."}
{"original": "This article first appeared on the Edvance Foundation blog."}
{"original": "This story was produced and originally published by CityLab and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration."}
{"original": "It's no surprise that a list of places most at risk from climate change and sea-level rise reads like a Who's Who of global cities, since historically, many great cities have developed near oceans, natural harbors, or other bodies of water. Miami ranks first, New York comes second, and Tokyo, London, Shanghai, and Hong Kong all number among the top 20 at-risk cities in terms of total projected losses."}
{"original": "Cities in the less developed and more rapidly urbanizing parts of the world, such as Ho Chi Minh City and Mumbai, may experience even more substantial losses as a percentage of their total economic output. Looking out to 2050, annual losses from flooding related to climate change and sea-level rise could increase to more than $60 billion a year."}
{"original": "But global climate change poses another risk for cities: accelerated gentrification. That's according to a new study by Jesse Keenan, Thomas Hill, and Anurag Gumber, all of Harvard University, that focuses on climate gentrification. While still emerging and not yet clearly defined, the theory of climate gentrification is based, the authors write, on a simple proposition: [C]limate change impacts arguably make some property more or less valuable by virtue of its capacity to accommodate a certain density of human settlement and its associated infrastructure. The implication is that such price volatility is either a primary or a partial driver of the patterns of urban development that lead to displacement (and sometimes entrenchment) of existing populations consistent with conventional framings of gentrification."}
{"original": "The study, published in Environmental Research Letters, advances a simple elevation hypothesis, arguing that real estate at higher elevations in cities at risk for climate change and sea-level rise appreciates at a higher rate than elsewhere. It focuses on Greater Miami (defined as Miami-Dade County), the area of the country and of the world most at risk from climate change. The authors track the differential in values, between 1971 and 2017, of properties at different levels of elevation and risk from sea-level rise (based on data from the U.S. Geological Survey), while controlling for other factors. They draw from data on more than 800,000 property sales (from the Miami-Dade County Property Appraiser's Office), including information on property value, building size, year built, bed and bath counts, and tax-assessment values."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump's flagship Scottish golf resort in Turnberry pays its female employees less than men and has four times as many men as women in executive spots, according to an official filing with local authorities, The Scotsman reported."}
{"original": "The mean rate for female pay at Trump Turnberry is 13.7 percent less than the pay for men, according to gender pay equality documents required by Scotland. So for every $1 men were paid, women got 86 cents."}
{"original": "The average mean bonus paid to men was $4,414, which was nearly twice as much as the average bonus paid to women — $2,256 — in the 12 months to April 2017, the newspaper reported, citing the filings. Only seven women and 11 men were given bonuses."}
{"original": "Turnberry management flatly attributed the pay gap to male-dominated functions at golf resorts, as well as the number of senior leadership roles undertaken by males at Turnberry."}
{"original": "The widest gender gap was to be found in the bonus culture at the 800 acre resort. The average median bonus paid to men is £2,506, but the sum drops to just £1,116 among women, a shortfall of 53.5 per cent. The average mean bonus paid to men is £3,317, which drops 48.9 per cent for female employees, who receive £1,695. While seven women received bonus in the 12 months to April 2017, the number jumped to 11 for men."}
{"original": "Women fill 46.8 percent of the lowest paid jobs at the 800-acre resort, and just 31.2 percent of the highest paid positions, report added."}
{"original": "The discrepancy emerged in what's believed to be the first time pay rates and executive numbers have been revealed by any Trump business. Trump has owned the resort since 2014, and it's run by his sons Eric and Donald Jr."}
{"original": "Patrick Harvie, a member of the Scottish Parliament from the Green Party, told The Scotsman: Trump is a sexist bully, so the fact that equal pay doesn't seem to matter at his golf course should surprise no one."}
{"original": "The U.K. Equality Pay Act requires any company with more than 250 employees (Turnberry has 313) to file annual reports detailing gender pay rates."}
{"original": "When Trump was running for president he insisted he had been very, very good for women and way ahead of the curve as an employer. His attorney Michael Cohen boasted that there were more female executives at the Trump Organization than men, but did not provide any evidence to substantiate that claim."}
{"original": "Helping working women has been a major talking point for Trump's daughter, Ivanka, but she supported her dad's move last year to dismantle the Obama-era initiative bolstering equal pay. Similar to the requirement in the U.K., the initiative would have required private employers with 100 or more workers to submit pay data."}
{"original": "Earlier this month, The Scotsman reported that the U.S. government paid $7,800 to the golf resort to cover expenses and security for unnamed VIP guests earlier this year."}
{"original": "The resort last year got a $147,000 tax break from Scottish taxpayers. But the government has since jettisoned the property from the program that was intended to give struggling companies a break, the Sunday Herald reported."}
{"original": "It's bad enough that he has a business presence in Scotland, Harvie told the newspaper after the decision was made. It's galling to learn that the public purse is giving him a helping hand."}
{"original": "This feeds the misconception that having men in high-paid jobs and women in low-paid jobs is an inevitable outcome."}
{"original": "March, shows that the mean gender pay gap for female employees is 13.69 per cent lower than the male equivalent, meaning they earn 86 pence for every £1 that their male colleagues earn."}
{"original": "Turnberry, one of Mr Trump's most prestigious overseas properties, blamed the male dominated functions associated with golf clubs for the shortfall in female leaders and the wide bonus gap, which means women receive nearly £1,400 less than their male counterparts."}
{"original": "There are four times as many men as women occupying executive positions at the US president's Trump Turnberry company."}
{"original": "Last year, his administration rolled back an Obama-era policy aimed at eliminating the gender pay gap. The ruling, which would have compelled large firms to report breakdowns to the US government of what they pay employees by race and gender, was denounced by the Trump administration as enormously burdensome. An analysis of Mr Trump's hiring policies by The Atlantic magazine in March claimed his White House has named twice as many men as women to appointed positions."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― Republicans in the U.S. Senate last month did not oppose funding the government without giving President Donald Trump money for a border wall."}

{"original": "But if this Congress worked as the founders intended ― as a branch of government that is equal to the White House ― lawmakers could at least be given a chance to vote on a bill to reopen the government ― especially one they already passed less than a month ago."}
{"original": "The Constitution doesn't make Congress subservient to the president, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said. No one here has to follow the order of President Trump, especially when he's doing something bad for the country."}
{"original": "The funding bill that the Senate passed in December ― which would have kept the government operating until February but did not include any wall money ― passed easily, without a roll call vote, meaning zero out of 100 senators opposed it strongly enough to demand a roll call. Any Republican senator currently repeating the Trump administration's line about a crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border could have forced a recorded vote on the measure over its lack of border security funding, but none did."}
{"original": "Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) said Wednesday that he was one of two senators who said no to the December funding bill on the Senate floor during the voice vote. The Appropriations Committee member did so, he said, because of a general objection to funding government via a short-term continuing resolution ― not the fact that it contained no funds for Trump's wall."}
{"original": "I keep telling myself I'm never voting for a CR again, Moran told HuffPost."}
{"original": "Before the Senate agreed to the resolution, McConnell said Republicans would fulfill our duty to govern even though Democrats were being intransigent about funding Trump's border wall (which, after all, the president had previously said would be funded by Mexico, not Congress)."}
{"original": "But then the House of Representatives, which was still under Republican control at the time, refused to hold a vote on the Senate bill because Trump had belatedly decided he opposed it, contrary to previous signals from the White House. The new Democratic House has approved funding but couldn't send the previously passed Senate measure to the president without the Senate passing it again."}

{"original": "Trump repeated Wednesday that the shutdown could continue for as long as it takes, raising the possibility that his push for a border wall could result in mass hunger for the 38 million Americans who currently receive food benefits each month."}
{"original": "Nevertheless, a funding bill that didn't include money for Trump's wall would not succeed now, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said."}
{"original": "What we need is a negotiated outcome, not trying to vanquish your political foes, which is the exercise we're engaged in right now, Cornyn said."}
{"original": "HuffPost pointed out to Cornyn that Congress and the White House are coequal branches of government and that lawmakers could override a presidential veto."}
{"original": "With 67 votes, Cornyn said, implying that the higher vote threshold for a veto override would be unreachable."}
{"original": "While presidential veto overrides are rare, they have occurred many times in history. Most recently, Congress voted overwhelmingly to override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill that allowed families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia."}
{"original": "Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-V.t.), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, predicted that a bill funding the government that did not include money for a wall would pass overwhelmingly if it was allowed to come to the floor."}
{"original": "Every Republican will tell you that privately, Leahy told HuffPost on Wednesday."}
{"original": "Still, there are no signs that Republican leaders are planning on backing down."}
{"original": "Trump visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday to reassure uneasy rank-and-file members and urge them to stand firm as the shutdown barrels toward its fourth week.

{"original": "The Dot was the brainchild of founder and CEO Eric Kim. He had the idea while he was attending the University of Washington and noticed a blind classmate lugging large, bulky books to class while most students were using tablets. After learning that these were Braille textbooks, he was disheartened to learn that this student couldn't take advantage of new technology."}
{"original": "Though the concept is novel, it does have its flaws."}
{"original": "Not all people who are visually impaired read Braille. Fewer than 10 percent of the 1.3 million people who are legally blind in the United States are Braille readers, according to a report by the National Federation of the Blind. The BBC also points out that because the watch face is small, reading long passages on the watch could be a pain."}
{"original": "Yet, because the Dot also has an open API, developers can constantly improve upon the technology and perhaps improve upon its technology."}
{"original": "The Dot smartwatch has been in the development for about 3 years, and will hit selected stores in the UK in March. The company told the Huffington Post that they hope to get units to the U.S. next and will hopefully have them available before April. They will retail for about $300 before tax."}
{"original": "Standing beside senator and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo made national news when he announced this month the most recent in a growing number of free college tuition proposals. Coming on the heels of similar proposals by Sanders, presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo, Cuomo's Excelsior Scholarship Program would provide free tuition for low- and middle-income families to attend public colleges and universities in New York if their families earn $125,000 or less per year."}
{"original": "This New York proposal can serve as a case study (or cautionary tale) about how such free tuition plans nationwide can produce unintended consequences if they are not informed by input from higher education leaders."}
{"original": "Like all of the free tuition plans proposed to date, the Cuomo plan in its present form will have unintended consequences that could be devastating to the state's economy. In New York, more degrees are conferred each year by private institutions than by public colleges. Suddenly injecting massive funding into public-sector colleges could result in an immense flood of students from private to public colleges, thereby immediately overwhelming state institutions."}
{"original": "Faced with a deluge of new students, state colleges would have no choice but to appeal to state government for millions of dollars in additional permanent funding to handle the influx. New faculty and staff would need to be hired and buildings built in order to accommodate these new students."}
{"original": "The state's community colleges would also be endangered. Many students attend community colleges because of the low tuition. If state institutions were tuition free, there would be no incentive to attend the local community college rather than the nearby research university. Consequently, the community colleges would also experience a sudden precipitous drop in enrollment."}
{"original": "What's more, if students abandon private colleges and inundate the state's public institutions, independent colleges that are already experiencing financial difficulty could potentially collapse, as Dowling College on Long Island did last year and other small colleges do across the nation every year."}
{"original": "Collectively, the independent not-for-profit colleges in New York have an estimated economic impact of 79.6 billion dollars annually. Even small private colleges contribute substantially to the economy. For example, Daemen College with a student population of just under 3,000 has over 600 employees and contributes nearly $130 million to the economy annually. If multiple colleges collapse as a result of the governor's proposal, the economy would suffer a huge blow because hundreds if not thousands of faculty and staff would suddenly be out of work, and tax revenue would necessarily shrink."}
{"original": "If the New York governor had consulted with higher education leaders in both the public and private sectors, he would have discovered that he can achieve his objectives and avoid these unintended consequences by simply investing the funds into the state-wide college financial aid system, thereby allowing families to decide which colleges to attend--state universities, community colleges, or independent institutions. This is precisely how it has been done in New York. The state's Tuition Assistance Program has worked well and would work even better with additional funding."}
{"original": "So, as the New York proposal illustrates, public officials on both the national and state levels need to consult with higher education leaders as they craft proposals that potentially could affect hundreds of thousands of students. Not doing so increases the chances that a plan could have serious negative consequences both for institutions and--most importantly--for our students."}

{"original": "We have more than four years of evidence revealing what Trump is and who is attracted to his ideas. Nobody in American politics is confused about the danger he represents to democracy. The accumulated evidence includes a murderous Charlottesville, Virginia neo-Nazi riot in 2017 and a shoutout to a fascist street gang from a presidential debate stage last fall."}
{"original": "Most Republicans, we know, are not torch-bearing fascists. GOP leaders have been especially keen to draw a distinction between respectable business-class conservatism and the MAGA mob. And yet they have bet their careers and the country on an alliance with Trump's authoritarianism."}
{"original": "Wednesday's attempted coup is the price Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), former House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), tea party darlings Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), nouveau nationalist Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and arch-militarist Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) were willing to pay to advance their policy priorities under Trump's banner."}
{"original": "Nor were the standard-bearers of the conservative movement ever confused about what they were doing. Explaining his decision to vote for Donald Trump in 2020, conservative debate-me icon Ben Shapiro ― once a Trump critic in the far-gone days of 2016 ― declared that he had been wrong to think Trump would stand in the way of right-wing policy priorities."}
{"original": "As for the rest, well, how bad could it get? I wasn't really wrong about Donald Trump on character, but whatever damage he was going to do, he's already done, and it's not going to help if I don't vote for him, Shapiro said."}
{"original": "The alliance between these cufflinkers and the catastrophists has proved overwhelmingly successful for the conservative elite. McConnell has reshaped the federal judiciary, with three Supreme Court Justices and well over 200 other lifetime appointments. Ryan was so satisfied with the Trump tax bill's offerings for the rich that he retired in glory, his life's work at last accomplished. Former Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney resigned as special envoy to Northern Ireland in ostensible protest Wednesday night, having taken advantage of his previous post to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Cotton has been correctly denouncing Republicans who bought into Trump's conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, but only after he got Trump to rip up President Barack Obama's diplomatic detente with Iran and move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a longstanding goal of both the ultranationalist right in Israel and the apocalyptic evangelical Christian fringe in the United States."}
{"original": "Cruz even got Trump to stop mocking his wife in public. Which leads us, as all pathetic roads eventually do, to Rubio. After tweeting his frustration with 3rd world style anti-American anarchy, Rubio gave a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday night comparing the events of the day to the activities of mid-century Marxist revolutionaries in Cuba."}
{"original": "My entire life I have lived with and next to people who came to America because their country was chaotic and their country was unsafe, Rubio said. What I saw today, what we have seen, looks more like those countries than the extraordinary nation that it is my privilege to call home … I think politics has made us crazy. Everybody in this country has lost their minds."}
{"original": "O Politics, what hath thou wrought ― be there no agency nor accountability to thine abstract malevolence!"}
{"original": "Of course there is. Rubio, like nearly all of his colleagues, got in bed with Trump because he recognized, correctly, that Trump was the best way to achieve his near-term political goals. Now that the alliance has blown up in his face, Rubio hopes to concoct some weird formula in which the whole thing is really the fault of the radical left ― Cuban Marxists and American anarchists."}
{"original": "GOP leaders have been especially keen to draw a distinction between respectable business-class conservatism and the MAGA mob. And yet they have bet their careers and the country on an alliance with Trump's authoritarianism."}
{"original": "Wednesday's MAGA riot was the work of the Republican Party, not of the left or politics. There have always been politics and there always will be, but not all of it leads to QAnon lunatics storming the Capitol at the behest of a Republican president hoping to overturn the result of an election that didn't go in his favor. Most Americans are not, in fact, bloodthirsty authoritarians."}
{"original": "The authoritarian strain in the Republican Party, however, is not merely a product of its unwashed fringe. Take, for example, Trump's most aggressive attorney general, William Barr, who did not rise to power through Breitbart or Facebook paranoia. He has a long and illustrious career serving on corporate boards and as AG for George H.W. Bush in the long, long-ago days when Republicans were supposedly so much more refined and sensible. But as Tom Hamburger and others have detailed, Barr has long championed the unitary executive ― a fancy name for a theory of monarchical presidential power embraced by, among others, former Vice President Dick Cheney. Though its adherents embrace different definitions and engage in various micro-doctrinal disputes, the basic idea is, as Richard Nixon once put it, When the president does it, that means it's not illegal."}
{"original": "Nor is Barr the only ghost of Fancy Republicanism Past to make his way into the Trump administration. Trump's Supreme Court nominees have all been members of the ultra-elite conservative Federalist Society. His labor secretary, Eugene Scalia, is the son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. His treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is a Goldman Sachs alum. His former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Jay Clayton, was a Goldman lawyer. His commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, was a private equity kingpin. His CIA director turned secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is a former businessman whose enterprise was backed by an investment from the Koch Brothers. His education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is the billionaire ex-chair of the Michigan Republican Party, and his vice president, Mike Pence, is a career conservative movement man who eventually became governor of Indiana before joining the Trump administration."}
{"original": "Every one of these people knew what they were doing when they signed up to work with Trump."}
{"original": "The Republican rot, in short, did not arise in January 2021 or even 2016. Party power brokers have been advocating various strains of authoritarianism for decades because they are the surest way to ensure that the unpopular policy agenda of the American elite remains politically viable."}
{"original": "CORRECTION: This article previously mischaracterized Mick Mulvaney as Trump's chief of staff, a role he left in March 2020, and Mike Pompeo as CIA director, a role he left in 2018."}
{"original": "NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are closing sharply higher on Wall Street Tuesday, adding 4.9% to major indexes, as hopes build for a greater response from the Trump administration to the economic threat from the coronavirus outbreak."}
{"original": "The gains recovered about half of the market's historic losses from the day before and came after another wild day of whipsaw trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 1,100 points."}
{"original": "Market watchers say more big swings are likely until the outbreak starts to slow down. The price of oil bounced back a day after cratering nearly 25% after Saudi Arabia started a price war with Russia."}
{"original": "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below:"}
{"original": "Wall Street endured another day of dizzying trading Tuesday, whipping up and down with hopes that the U.S. and other governments will cushion the economy from the pain of the coronavirus."}
{"original": "The S&P 500 surged as much as 3.7% in the morning and recouped nearly half its historic drop from the prior day, but all of those gains evaporated by midday. The index then bounced up and down before turning decisively higher after President Donald Trump pitched his ideas for a break on payroll taxes and other economic relief to Senate Republicans. It was up 3.2%, as of 3:15 p.m. Eastern time."}
{"original": "The moves reflected the mood of a market that seems just as preoccupied with the virus as the rest of the world. Since U.S. stocks set their record high just a few weeks ago, traders have crossed over from dismissing the economic pain created by COVID-19 — thinking it's similar to the flu and could stay mostly contained in China — to being in thrall to it — worrying that it may cause a worldwide recession."}
{"original": "Such big swings are likely to continue as long as the number of infections accelerates, market watchers say. In the meantime, investors want to see a big, coordinated response from governments and central banks to shore up the virus-weakened economy."}
{"original": "Monday's plunge for U.S. stocks was the sharpest since 2008, when global authorities banded together to rescue the economy from the financial crisis."}
{"original": "Investors saw glimmers of such a coordinated response, which led to Tuesday's early optimism."}
{"original": "At a White House press briefing Monday night, Trump said his administration would be asking Congress to pass payroll tax relief and other quick measures aimed at easing the impact of the coronavirus on workers."}
{"original": "In Japan, a task force set up by the prime minister approved a 430 billion yen ($4.1 billion) package Tuesday with support for small to medium-sized businesses."}
{"original": "But markets on Tuesday were still waiting for details on Trump's plan."}
{"original": "In a meeting with major health insurers, Vice President Mike Pence said those companies have agreed to waive co-pays on coronavirus testing. Trump, meanwhile, said the government is working with the cruise line industry, one of the hardest hit by the virus."}
{"original": "The comments helped lift the market, which had turned to losses, but neither Pence nor Trump said anything during the brief televised remarks about a potential cut to payroll taxes. The index shuffled along with modest gains until after Trump made his pitch for economic aid on Capitol Hill."}
{"original": "I would expect the authorities to pull out all the stops to reduce uncertainty, said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. This may be their one opportunity to do that."}
{"original": "Perhaps the most notable move in markets Tuesday was that Treasury yields pushed higher. The bond market rang warning bells about the virus long before the stock market, and a rise in yields is a sign that fear has receded a bit."}
{"original": "The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 0.77% from 0.49% late Monday. A week ago, it had never been below 1%."}
{"original": "The S&P 500 was up 3.2%, as of 3:15 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 780 points, or 3.3%, to 24,631, and the Nasdaq composite was up 3.5%."}
{"original": "The recovery is pulling the stock market a bit further from the edge of a bear market, signified by a drop of 20% from a record. The S&P 500 is down 16% from its high. If it can rally back to that point, it would extend the longest-ever bull market, which began its climb after the market hit bottom on March 9, 2009."}
{"original": "Brent crude, the international standard, rose $2.86, or 8.3%, to settle at $37.22 a barrel, while benchmark U.S. crude rose $3.23, or 10.4%, to $34.36 a barrel. Oil prices plunged 25% on Monday amid a price war between producers, who are pulling more oil out of the ground even though demand is falling due to the virus."}
{"original": "For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia."}
{"original": "The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered."}
{"original": "But because the virus is new, experts can't say for sure how far it will ultimately spread. That has investors worried about the worst-case scenario for corporate profits and the economy, where factories and supply chains are shut around the world due to quarantines and people stay huddled at home instead of working or spending."}
{"original": "Investors expect central banks around the world, which have done some of the heaviest lifting to prop up markets the last decade, to do more to cushion the blow."}
{"original": "Traders expect the Fed to cut rates again at its meeting next week. They're also expecting some kind of action from the European Central Bank, which meets on Thursday."}
{"original": "But central banks have limited firepower, and some have already cut rates blow zero. That adds pressure on governments to do what they can as well. Investors are asking for quick, coordinated aid to provide support to companies and households who are going to be out income because of the virus."}
{"original": "For strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute, that could include generous sick-pay programs or even direct payments to households. For businesses, governments could suspend collecting tax revenue to give them some temporary relief and hold on to cash as the world waits for the outbreak to be contained."}
{"original": "That would prevent these temporary disruptions from turning into a full-blown global recession, strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute wrote in a report."}
{"original": "Until then, many investors have had a sell-first, ask questions later reaction to the uncertainty, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com."}
{"original": "Still, he urges investors to avoid changing their long-term investment strategies, which can play out over years or decades, because of short-term volatility."}

{"original": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leon Black said on Monday he would relinquish his chief executive post at Apollo Global Management Inc following the buyout firm's independent review of his ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein."}
{"original": "The review, conducted by law firm Dechert LLP, found Black was not involved in any way with Epstein's criminal activities. Black, the review found, paid Epstein bona fide fees for advice on tax and estate planning, and other related services."}
{"original": "Nevertheless, Apollo said it would undertake efforts to strengthen its corporate governance to allow the board to oversee all aspects of the buyout firm and delegate less of that work."}
{"original": "Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan will take over as CEO, with Black remaining Apollo's chairman, the firm said."}
{"original": "The sudden end to Black's management of Apollo, a New York-based firm he co-founded 31 years ago and turned into one of the world's largest private equity and credit investment groups, reflects the toll that revelations of his ties to Epstein took on the investment firm's business."}
{"original": "Apollo executives had warned in October that some investors had paused their commitments to Apollo's funds as they awaited the review's findings."}
{"original": "Apollo shares missed out on a stock market rally and are down 1% since the New York Times reported on Oct. 12 that Black paid at least $50 million to Epstein for advice and services, when most of his clients had deserted him. Shares of peers Blackstone Group Inc, KKR & Co Inc and Carlyle Group Inc are up 19%, 10% and 23% over that period, respectively."}
{"original": "The conflicts committee of Apollo's board pursued the review with Black's support in October. In a letter to Apollo's fund investors earlier that month, Black said he regretted previous business and social relationships with Epstein, while denying any wrongdoing or inappropriate conduct."}
{"original": "On Election Day, a majority of Utah voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid coverage to an estimated 150,000 low-income adults. The Republican-led state Legislature has other ideas."}
{"original": "The Utah Senate approved a bill Wednesday that would toss out a grassroots-driven, voter-backed ballot initiative to offer Medicaid benefits to any Utahn earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (about $16,000 a year for a single person), paid for by raising the sales tax on certain goods from 4.7 percent to 4.85 percent."}
{"original": "The legislation instead would expand Medicaid to fewer people, enable Utah to receive less federal money for the program and impose limitations on benefits, including work requirements. And the entire plan hinges on a dubious promise of federal approval for aspects of the state Senate bill."}
{"original": "The Utah GOP clearly is prioritizing overturning the voters, considering the Legislature has been in session since just Monday and the bill made it out its Senate committee Tuesday and to the floor Wednesday. The fact that 53 percent of voters spoke in favor of a full Medicaid expansion at the ballot box in November is not swaying Utah Republican legislators, who have resisted the expansion since it became available in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act."}
{"original": "The Utah ballot initiative, known as Proposition 3, not only received majority support statewide but also in most state Senate districts, the Utah Health Policy Project reported. According to a Salt Lake Tribune analysis of the vote Wednesday, 10 Republican senators representing districts where a majority voted in favor of the expansion are supporting the bill to modify it, including the legislation's main sponsor, Sen. Allen Christensen. A plurality of Utahns opposes changing the voter-backed policy, according to a UtahPolicy.com poll conducted by Dan Jones & Associates."}
{"original": "You've got to defer to the will of the people at some point, said state Rep. Brian King, the minority leader of the Utah House of Representatives and one of 16 Democrats in the 75-member lower chamber of the Utah State Legislature. We should not be doing anything to substantively alter that Proposition 3 in a way that delays the implementation one more day."}
{"original": "The GOP bill sends a message to voters, King said: We don't really care what the people of the state of Utah want to do or say they want us to do at the Legislature. We're going to do what we want to do. That's very troubling to me."}
{"original": "These actions by Utah Republican lawmakers are reminiscent of how then-Gov. Paul LePage (R) defied Maine voters last year by refusing to carry out a Medicaid expansion they approved in 2017. LePage's successor, Gov. Janet Mills (D), has already begun the process of implementing the expansion. In Idaho, where voters also passed a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid, a conservative organization is challenging it before the state Supreme Court."}
{"original": "Efforts by Republicans at the state level to undo or limit the Medicaid expansion, including the seven states that received federal approval for work requirements and the eight more seeking it, mirror the national Republican strategy on health care."}
{"original": "The GOP-led Congress devoted most of 2017 to attempting and failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with plans that would have left millions without health coverage. And in December, a federal judge ruled in favor of 20 GOP state officials who argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in a lawsuit supported by President Donald Trump's Justice Department."}
{"original": "Rick Bowmer/Associated Press Tiffiny Malo, left, and Pam Harrison, supporters of a voter-approved measure to fully expand Medicaid, at a rally to ask lawmakers not to change the law during the first day of the Utah Legislature on Monday."}
{"original": "The Utah Senate must vote again on the bill to significantly alter the Medicaid expansion enacted by voters, which it approved once this week against the opposition of all six Democratic senators and one of the chamber's 23 Republicans. The state House is poised to act quickly on the legislation after the Senate is finished."}
{"original": "It's moving very quickly, said King, who expects the Utah House will pass the Senate bill by the end of next week."}
{"original": "Republican Gov. Gary Herbert has not taken a public position on the Medicaid bill. In response to questions from HuffPost, Herbert's office provided a statement from a spokesman."}
{"original": "Gov. Herbert has long supported the kind of common-sense guardrails for Medicaid expansion that are being discussed in the legislature. Many were components of his proposed Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion in 2015; most of these were part of legislation that he signed into law last general session. His primary concerns are that the state honor the will of the voters to fill the hole in the social safety net by helping those under the poverty line without health insurance and to implement without delay, Paul Edwards said in the statement."}
{"original": "Last week, Herbert said he believed the state should allow the expansion to move forward as approved by voters and then be revisited at a later date. During his State of the State address Thursday, Herbert said only that the much-needed Medicaid expansion passed by the voters needs to be implemented in a fiscally sustainable way. And with some common-sense adjustments, I know that we can implement this program without delay."}
{"original": "Because Republicans have supermajorities in the Utah House and Senate, however, the GOP would have the votes to override a veto even if Herbert decided to oppose the Medicaid legislation."}
{"original": "The Affordable Care Act calls for Medicaid benefits to be available to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, and the federal government finances at least 90 percent of the cost. This expansion was meant to be in place nationwide, but a 2012 Supreme Court ruling allowed states to refuse to participate. To date, 14 states have declined it. Utah, Idaho and Nebraska voters all approved expansion via ballot initiative last year, but the program is not yet in place in those states. Under the terms of the Utah initiative, benefits are supposed to become available April 1."}
{"original": "The Utah ballot initiative was straightforward in its approach by simply instructing the state to join the Medicaid expansion without any changes to the state's existing program or the need for federal approval. The Utah Governor's Office of Management and Budget assessed that the sales tax increase would raise more than enough money to finance the state's 10 percent share of the expansion's cost, although it noted that the revenue and costs in future years may not match up."}
{"original": "By contrast, the Utah Senate bill would trigger a complicated and uncertain process that would cover fewer people under Medicaid. The Senate began action on the measure before the Legislature's budget scorekeepers could analyze the legislation's effects, but it is designed to limit the Medicaid expansion's reach. That's despite the fact that the measure would leave the sales tax increase in place while also imposing a tax on hospitals that alone is intended to be large enough to cover the state's entire share of the expense of Medicaid expansion."}
{"original": "Under the Senate legislation, Medicaid benefits would be available only to those with incomes below the poverty level, which is about $12,000 for a single person. Utahns with incomes higher than that would continue to have access to subsidized private coverage via the health insurance exchange in the state. Unlike the Medicaid expansion voters approved, the state would receive about 70 percent of the funding for the partial Medicaid expansion from the federal government instead of the 90 percent offered by a full expansion."}
{"original": "The bill lacks detail on many key elements of the modified expansion, leaving those to the state's executive branch and federal officials to hash out. In order to maintain April 1 as the day benefits would come online, legislative Republicans are counting on all of that happening on an extraordinarily expedited basis."}
{"original": "This entire thing is being rammed through the Senate and the House as quickly as possible. It is a sloppy piece of legislation that couldn't be further from what voters wanted, and they're rushing it because they know that they're going against the will of voters, that they're disrespecting voters by doing so, said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, a Washington-based organization that supported Medicaid ballot initiatives in Utah, Idaho, Maine, Montana and Nebraska over the past two years."}
{"original": "It is a sloppy piece of legislation that couldn't be further from what voters wanted, and they're rushing it because they know that they're going against the will of voters. Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project"}
{"original": "The Herbert administration would have to resolve all the outstanding questions the bill poses and the federal government would have to approve waivers for standard Medicaid rules in less than two months, which is much more quickly than it typically acts."}
{"original": "Nothing about how the federal government moves and operates gives me much hope or assurance that you're going to get a waiver at all, much less one in a time frame that is going to be less than 60 days, King said."}
{"original": "The biggest uncertainty pertains to the funding. Under the legislation, Utah would ask the federal government to break precedent by providing the full 90 percent funding for a partial expansion. The Trump administration last year rejected such requests from Arkansas and Massachusetts, following the Obama administration's policy against partial expansions."}
{"original": "Utah has even tried this before. Herbert signed legislation last year approving a partial expansion and submitted a request for approval to federal authorities. That would have covered about half as many people as a full Medicaid expansion. The state withdrew its application after the ballot initiative passed."}
{"original": "The new bill also calls for work requirements and for locking out enrollees who fail to meet them, but it does not specify what they would be and how they would be enforced. It also would cap enrollment for otherwise eligible Utahns if cost projections for the expansion exceed the amount of money appropriated for the year."}
{"original": "The attempt to overturn voters on Medicaid expansion comes a month after Herbert signed legislation to replace a medical marijuana initiative voters approved last year with a new law. In the aftermath of voters passing the marijuana and Medicaid measures, Utah lawmakers also are eying changes to the ballot initiative process to let the Legislature alter voter-backed policies before they take effect."}
{"original": "This article has been updated with a statement from a spokesman for Utah Gov. Gary Herbert."}
{"original": "CORRECTION: The minority leader of the Utah House of Representatives is Rep. Brian King, not Brian Frank."}
{"original": "After nine years of playing defense on Obamacare, Democratic leaders at the state and local level want to go on offense when it comes to health care."}
{"original": "New plans announced by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio this week also demonstrate that ideas short of single-payer could partially address the shortcomings of America's health care system ― and reach people the Affordable Care Act did not."}
{"original": "Newsom, Inslee and de Blasio all support the implementation of a national, government-run single-payer health care system, but that's not the focus of this round of policy proposals."}
{"original": "Instead, the two governors are calling for new programs ― and spending ― to shore up the health insurance market for people who find Affordable Care Act exchange policies too expensive. In New York, the mayor is eyeing a local plan to use city money to cover medical expenses for uninsured residents. The California and New York City proposals include assistance for undocumented immigrants, who are ineligible for federal programs like Medicaid and the health insurance exchanges."}
{"original": "Democrats are bullish on health care as an electoral issue after focusing on President Donald Trump's agenda during the midterm elections last year, during which the party won control of the U.S. House and made gains in state legislatures and governors' offices around the country. In addition, voters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah ― three reliably Republican states ― approved ballot initiatives to expand coverage for low-income residents through Medicaid."}
{"original": "Notably, Inslee and de Blasio are potential presidential candidates this cycle, something Newsom has ruled out. Newsom is in his first days as California governor after winning election in November, while Inslee and de Blasio are each in their second terms in office."}
{"original": "Single-payer health care proposals have become mainstream among Democratic officials at all levels of government in the wake of Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders's 2016 Democratic presidential campaign and electoral wins last year by proponents of the policy who now serve in Congress and state legislatures."}
{"original": "Other Democrats have proposed an expanded government role in providing health coverage and medical care through means such as a public option plan that would compete with private health insurance or proposals to allow consumers to buy into Medicare or Medicaid."}
{"original": "But it's virtually certain that no major expansions are going to happen in Washington for the next two years because Republicans still control the Senate and the White House. Their agenda has focused for years on scaling back federal and state programs that provide assistance to low- and middle-income families and would lead to millions fewer Americans covered."}
{"original": "At least for now, it's up to the states ― and cities ― to act."}
{"original": "Lots of time and energy has been put into taking away health care from tens of millions of people, de Blasio said Tuesday during a press conference at a Bronx hospital. What we're doing here in New York City, we're getting health care to a lot of people who never had it before. We're going the opposite direction."}
{"original": "California, New York and Washington are among the states that embraced the Affordable Care Act by immediately adopting its Medicaid expansion for low-income adults and by creating state-run health insurance exchanges."}
{"original": "These states also already have relatively generous health care safety nets. The uninsured rates in all three states are below the national average of 10 percent as of 2017, the most recent year for which Census data on the uninsured at the state level are available."}
{"original": "We have done fantastic things in the state, with one of ― if not the ― most successful health care efforts in the United States, Inslee said at Tuesday press conference, just hours after de Blasio's. But there is more to do."}
{"original": "Jae C. Hong/Associated Press California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is pushing for policies to expand health care access in his state."}
{"original": "Single-payer is still the main topic of political discussion in California, and among the moves Newsom made on Monday was to send a letter to the Trump administration and congressional leaders calling for legislation that would give states like his the authority to craft their own single-payer systems."}
{"original": "But given that single-payer is staunchly opposed by Republicans in Washington and has struggled to get sufficient support even in California's Democratic-controlled legislature, the more consequential action, for now, will likely be on three other parts of Newsom's announcement."}
{"original": "One is a call to substantially increase the financial assistance available to people who buy private insurance through Covered California, which is the online insurance marketplace that the state runs as part of the Affordable Care Act."}
{"original": "Under the Affordable Care Act, tax credits are available to people whose incomes are up to four times the poverty line, or $48,500 for an individual and $100,400 a year for a family of four. People with higher incomes can find coverage difficult, if not impossible, to afford ― even in California, where the marketplace is considered among the most successful in the country."}
{"original": "And because the tax credits are available on a sliding scale, relative to income, even some people eligible for assistance struggle with either premiums, high out-of-pocket costs or both."}
{"original": "Newsom is calling for legislation that would make many more people eligible for assistance ― increasing the thresholds all the way up to $72,840 for individuals and $150,600 for a family of four. The legislation would also provide more assistance for people who already qualify."}
{"original": "In order to offset the cost of those new subsidies, Newsom wants to reinstate the financial penalty for people who do not have insurance ― a penalty that was part of the Affordable Care Act until congressional Republicans and Trump eliminated it, effective this year. This would make California the fourth state to adopt an individual mandate with a penalty; Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont already have such a policy in law."}
{"original": "Finally, Newsom called for legislation that would open up Medi-Cal, the state's version of the Medicaid program, to undocumented young adults. California already offers Medi-Cal to undocumented immigrants until they turn 19. This would push the eligibility age up to 26."}
{"original": "A similar proposal that the state legislature considered last year would have cost an estimated $250 million per year, according to the Los Angeles Times, and it would all have to come from California because federal dollars cannot be spent on health care programs for undocumented immigrants under the Affordable Care Act and other laws."}
{"original": "The outlook for any of these proposals in the state legislature is unclear. California has a history of aggressive action to help people get health care, up to and including its implementation of the Affordable Care Act. But some of its more ambitious initiatives have failed because legislators could not agree on funding and the state constitution requires a two-thirds vote for new taxes."}
{"original": "The other initiative Newsom announced Monday will affect prescription drugs and won't require legislative action because Newsom was able to use executive authority. He issued an order that will allow one state agency to negotiate prices for all state programs that purchase drugs. That includes Medi-Cal, which by itself insures some 13 million people."}
{"original": "Whether it succeeds in reducing drug prices meaningfully ultimately will depend on a number of factors, not least among them the ability ― and willingness ― of state negotiators to exclude popular but duplicative drugs from coverage because manufacturers won't agree to lower prices."}
{"original": "Ted S. Warren/Associated Press Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) called for a public option in his state."}
{"original": "Inslee's plan is the most straightforward and most familiar, because he wants the state legislature to create something that progressives have wanted as part of the Affordable Care Act all along. He's calling for the state to create a public option ― a stand-alone insurance plan, which a state agency would manage, available to people buying coverage on their own through the state's exchange, Washington Healthplanfinder."}
{"original": "At the Tuesday press conference, Inslee said the plan would be available in all parts of the state, in part to fulfill one of its chief goals: to make sure everybody has coverage available. Washington, like many states, has had trouble keeping insurers from abandoning rural areas. This year, 14 counties in the state have only one carrier."}
{"original": "The public option would reimburse doctors, hospitals and other providers of health care at the rate that the federal Medicare program uses, Inslee said."}
{"original": "That is no minor thing. Medicare pays far less than commercial insurers and hospitals say the reimbursements are not sufficient to cover their costs. It's why a public option could potentially offer lower premiums but also why, historically, proposals have generated such intense opposition from hospitals."}
{"original": "In his remarks, Inslee talked about the Washingtonians who were grateful for the coverage they'd gotten from the Affordable Care Act over the last few years ― and those who were still struggling, even with the law fully in place."}
{"original": "We still have thousands of people in the state of Washington who still do not have that comfort, who still live under the anxiety of a potential loss of coverage, who still are dealing not only with the problem of a disease but the problem of anxiety over their economic circumstances, Inslee said."}
{"original": "Drew Angerer/Getty Images New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said his plan would be available to the 600,000 city residents who currently are uninsured."}
{"original": "The goal of the New York City plan is to promise access to health coverage and health care services to all of the city's 8.6 million residents, de Blasio said."}
{"original": "From this moment on, in New York City, everyone is guaranteed the right to health care, de Blasio said."}
{"original": "According to the mayor, 600,000 New Yorkers who currently are uninsured would be eligible for existing programs he wants to expand and for a new medical care program. Based on that figure, the uninsured rate in New York City is about 7 percent, the same as New York state and lower than the national rate of 10 percent as of 2017, according to Census data."}
{"original": "Medical services for this population will cost the city about $100 million a year once his plan is fully implemented over the next two years, de Blasio said."}
{"original": "About half of those newly eligible people are undocumented immigrants, de Blasio said. The remaining uninsured generally are people who don't qualify for Medicaid or other city, state and federal programs, including New York State of Health, the insurance exchange. The new initiatives will target young adults in particular, he said."}
{"original": "The plan has two parts. The first is an expansion and enhanced enrollment outreach for MetroPlus, a city-run insurance program. The second is the creation of what de Blasio called NYC Care, which would give uninsured residents ― especially undocumented immigrants ― access to medical and mental health care services provided by hospitals and clinics managed by a city agency."}
{"original": "Patients would pay for care on a sliding scale based on their income, he said. These programs would build on New York City's and New York state's health care safety net, which is more comprehensive than in most states."}
{"original": "De Blasio reiterated his support for single-payer health care, both at the national level and in New York state."}
{"original": "The majority-Democratic New York Assembly passed single-payer health care bills several times in recent years, but the state Senate ― then controlled by Republicans ― didn't take up the measure. Democrats now have a majority in both chambers of the legislature and are set to reconsider single-payer, although Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has expressed skepticism."}
{"original": "New York wouldn't be the first municipality to carry out a plan seeking universal coverage. San Francisco enacted a similar plan in 2007, while Newsom was mayor, and one of that plan's architects now is a de Blasio adviser. Los Angeles County, California, and the District of Columbia also have local programs that provide coverage and services to uninsured residents that predate the Affordable Care Act."}
{"original": "Tax season is quite literally the worst time of the year."}

{"original": "George Frey via Getty Images Sen. Mike Lee (right) has made it his mission to pass the First Amendment Defense Act."}
{"original": "Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) reintroduced on Thursday the First Amendment Defense Act, a bill that would provide a range of federal protections for individuals and companies that discriminate against LGBTQ people."}
{"original": "Framed as a religious liberty measure, the legislation aims to prohibit the federal government from taking discriminatory action against a person for speaking or acting in accordance with a sincerely held religious or moral belief against same-sex marriage, polygamy or sexual relations outside of marriage."}
{"original": "The government itself would be barred from disfavoring such people in terms of tax status, grants, contracts, loans, licenses, employment, benefits, access to facilities, and a long list of other federal goodies."}
{"original": "And the bill defines the term person to include nonpublicly traded for-profit companies."}
{"original": "What an individual or organization believes about the traditional definition of marriage is not ― and should never be ― a part of the government's decision-making process when distributing licenses, accreditations, or grants, Lee said in a statement on Thursday."}
{"original": "The bill, he argued, would ensure that federal bureaucrats will never have the authority to require those who believe in the traditional definition of marriage to choose between their living in accordance with those beliefs and maintaining their occupation or their tax status."}
{"original": "LGBTQ advocates warn that the First Amendment Defense Act could set a dangerous precedent for what is protected under the banner of religious freedom. David Stacy, government affairs director for the advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, said the bill's protections would amount to state-sanctioned discrimination."}
{"original": "Supporters of this legislation are using religious liberty as a sword to hurt LGBTQ families, Stacy told HuffPost."}
{"original": "Lee and Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) first introduced versions of this legislation in 2015. Neither of those bills made it out of committee."}
{"original": "But the revived bill ― which has a total of 22 GOP co-sponsors, including Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Ted Cruz (Texas) and Rand Paul (Ky.) ― reframes the original wording to exclude publicly traded for-profit companies, federal employees and contractors, and health care facilities from the list of protected entities. That revision could make all the difference."}
{"original": "The reintroduction of the bill comes as the Trump administration has overturned multiple protections for LGBTQ people established under President Barack Obama. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in October released a memo announcing that federal civil rights legislation does not protect transgender people from discrimination in the workplace."}
{"original": "The Trump administration has also thrown its support behind a Colorado baker who was penalized for refusing to make a cake for a gay couple and whose case is before the U.S. Supreme Court. And perhaps inspired by the president, several states passed anti-LGBTQ adoption laws last year."}
{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden's speech on Thursday night was his best in years ― a calm, clear-eyed assessment of the trials facing the United States in the year ahead, and a morally compelling call for an assertive government to fight the pandemic and provide economic relief to its people."}
{"original": "A crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight, Biden said. We have to act, and we have to act now."}
{"original": "Biden not only spoke convincingly to the struggles families are facing in a time of real pain overwhelming the real economy, but he also provided a sophisticated economic rationale for his program. A growing chorus of top economists no longer believe apocalyptic warnings about the dangers of government spending and government debt, he said. The real danger, according to this new intellectual consensus, is not spending enough."}
{"original": "We cannot afford inaction, the president-elect continued, noting that a bold, multitrillion-dollar economic agenda will prevent long-term economic damage and provide near-term social rewards."}
{"original": "The benefits will far surpass the costs, he said."}
{"original": "The details of the plan Biden put forward fall a bit short of the emotional and intellectual grandeur of his speech, however. By relying on tax credits to deliver some key relief funds ― particularly his expanded child care tax credits ― important elements of the $1.9 trillion package will not be delivered until 2022, which is a long way from the imperative now in which Biden urged Congress to act. More immediate measures, such as the $400-a-week expansion of unemployment benefits, come with a hard deadline in September, setting up another round of high-stakes negotiations with Republicans. Republicans may very well choose to sit that out entirely, as they did when the initial batch of expanded unemployment benefits expired in July."}
{"original": "With the economy running about $3.5 trillion a year short of its February 2020 output, according to economists Mark Paul and Adam Hersh, Biden's $1.9 trillion price tag will not be sufficient to close the gap between the economy we have today and what we called prosperity under President Donald Trump."}
{"original": "And the politics of the package are murky. Biden hopes to pass his plan with the support of at least 10 Republican senators, which is all but impossible to imagine regardless of how obstructionist soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) chooses to be. Republican-aligned business groups are cheering the Biden plan, but the party these days is more beholden to QAnon than the Koch family."}
{"original": "Biden's package will likely have to be passed through the budget reconciliation process, allowing Democrats to bypass a Republican filibuster. If reconciliation is the route, Biden's $15 minimum wage proposal will have to be discarded. And with a mere one-vote Democratic majority in the Senate, Biden will almost certainly have to make concessions to conservative Democrats who, for whatever reason, are eager to show voters at home that they just won't stand for all the nice things Biden wants to give them. We will probably never see the full $1.9 trillion."}
{"original": "Despite these oddities and disappointments in Biden's proposal, there is simply no denying that his program is more ambitious and progressive than the economic agenda of former President Barack Obama. Relative to the size of the economy, Biden's stimulus is more than a third larger than Obama's 2009 bill."}
{"original": "Where Obama offered corporate tax cuts, Biden would provide small-business rescue funding. The roughly $1 trillion in aid to families is concentrated among those who need it most ― the unemployed and those who are low-income ― but includes measures like an additional round of $1,400 that will reach most middle-class families."}
{"original": "The tax credits may not come until next year, but will be welcome when they arrive: Biden would expand the earned income tax credit for workers of modest means from $530 a year to $1,500 for 2021. He would bump the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,000, and $3,600 for children under 6 years old. A separate child care tax credit would be increased from $3,000 to $4,000 per child, with a maximum family benefit of $8,000."}
{"original": "All told, these three changes alone would give a low-income family of four with two adult workers an $8,200 boost. Add in the checks, which go out to each individual in the household, and that same family would see a $13,800 increase in their income across the next two years."}
{"original": "This is real money that will help millions of households weather the storm. But it will not update the deteriorating foundations of the U.S. economy. Biden was being honest when he called it the first in a two-step economic program of relief and recovery."}
{"original": "His $160 billion vaccination program and $350 billion in federal aid to state and local governments are best understood as public health measures to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. You can't get vaccines out the door if local governments are laying off everyone who would provide them."}
{"original": "There is simply no denying that Biden's program is more ambitious and progressive than the economic agenda of former President Barack Obama."}
{"original": "Indeed, Biden's most ambitious language on Thursday night was focused on his recovery step, to be revealed in detail next month."}
{"original": "American manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War II, Biden said. It will be so again."}
{"original": "He promised historic investments in research and development on everything from batteries to artificial intelligence to clean energy, as well as a massive domestic infrastructure project to repair roads, bridges and public transportation."}
{"original": "This is where Biden has the opportunity to be a transformational president. For decades, public economic investment has lagged, as leaders in both parties have insisted that all important new developments are spawned by the genius of the private sector. But the type of innovations we have seen in this era are not particularly inspiring. The brightest minds in Silicon Valley are largely devoted to uncovering new ways of dodging regulations and slashing labor costs. Uber makes it easier to get a ride, but it doesn't establish a new foundation for middle-class prosperity."}
{"original": "There's a reason. One company, even a massive tech monopoly, can't provide the sustained investment and coordination necessary to upgrade American industry. Any company that tries will be flushing money away. Only the government can provide this economic stability, and once it does, new productive private innovations taking advantage of that public investment will follow."}
{"original": "We don't yet know what Biden will propose for his rebuild stage, and the politics of rebuilding are even more precarious than those of relief. Trump has thundered about domestic manufacturing and infrastructure for four years, and Republicans in Congress have delivered nothing of substance on either measure. How Biden will convince them to deliver for a Democrat is unclear."}
{"original": "But a domestic investment program will be popular, and Biden will have a strong case that it's critical for public health. In Taiwan, for example, the government ramped up the domestic manufacturing of face masks to the point where every household was receiving a fresh supply of high-quality, government-regulated masks every week as early as April 2020. This was not just an economic program — it was part of an enormously successful public health program. To date, only seven people have died from COVID-19 in Taiwan."}

Andrew Cuomo (D), who leads the state with the most COVID-19 cases in the U.S., issued an urgent plea at his daily press conference, warning that the rate of growth for cases continues to increase and will peak in 14 to 20 days, making it essential that the state strengthen its hospital capacity and obtain much-needed medical supplies."}
{"original": "We're not slowing it, and it's accelerating on its own, Cuomo said, explaining that experts describe it not as a freight train but a bullet train."}
{"original": "They say 'flatten the curve, flatten the curve.' We're not flattening the curve, he added. We have exhausted every option available to us."}
{"original": "In addition to shutting down nonessential businesses and greatly increasing testing, the state is retrofitting facilities such as New York City's Javits Center to use them as extra hospitals, recruiting more medical staff and using hotels and empty college dorms for extra beds."}
{"original": "Cuomo estimated the state will need an additional 140,000 hospital beds and 30,000 ventilators. Warning that the state could not do enough on its own to stem the spread of the virus, the governor did not mince words in criticizing the federal government's response."}
{"original": "Where are they? Where are the ventilators? Cuomo said, after calling on Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to release a federal stockpile of ventilators."}
{"original": "Cuomo also blasted the Federal Emergency Management Agency for sending the state only 400 ventilators."}
{"original": "You pick the 2,600 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators! he said, practically yelling."}
{"original": "The governor called on the federal government to encourage states to collaborate, as each state will reach its peak in cases at different times and will require the same resources. He called New York the canary in the coal mine."}
{"original": "I will take personal responsibility for transporting the ventilators, he said. I'll send ventilators, I'll send health care workers, our professionals ... Let's learn from each other and help each other."}
{"original": "Without directly mentioning Trump, Cuomo referred to the president's suggestion Monday that the economy could reopen sooner than expected."}
{"original": "Although he acknowledged the need to consider the economy, Cuomo said it's important to focus on the looming crisis of the growth in COVID-19 cases and ensuing hospital shortages."}
{"original": "We are not putting a dollar value on human lives. First order of business: Save people's lives, Cuomo said, reiterating that there can be an economic startup strategy that is consistent with a public health strategy."}
{"original": "On Monday, Cuomo had suggested allowing young people to return to work sooner and testing people who have recovered to ensure they're no longer carriers of the virus."}

{"original": "A few years ago, Sarah was living in a drafty garage belonging to one of her friends. Despite being a smart, highly qualified teacher to sixth- and seventh-graders at a public middle school not far from San Francisco's international airport, she simply could not afford to live anywhere else in the city."}
{"original": "San Francisco is facing an unprecedented housing affordability crisis. That was the conclusion of an analysis published in July by the city's planning department documenting the huge challenge facing the city and the wider Bay Area. Rapidly rising rents and soaring property values, combined with high construction costs and prohibitive zoning policies, have stymied the missing middle housing options needed for public sector employees like Sarah, who earn too much to qualify for low-income housing, but not enough to afford the Bay Area's often outlandish market rates."}
{"original": "While teachers may be invaluable to society, their pay and working conditions are deteriorating as housing costs rise. On Monday, Los Angeles public school teachers began their first strike in 30 years after more than a year of failed negotiations over issues that include pay."}
{"original": "It's so important for our public servants to be able to live in their communities, says Kristy Wang, community planning policy director at the nonprofit San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, or SPUR. But we live in such a high-cost housing market that it's really difficult for them to do that because they just don't make enough."}
{"original": "ROBYN BECK via Getty Images Striking teachers and their supporters rally in downtown Los Angeles on Jan. 15, 2019, the second day of the teachers strike."}
{"original": "Sarah (who asked that her real name not be published to protect her privacy) is a 32-year-old originally from the East Coast who moved to the Bay Area after gaining her master's degree and teaching credential in Southern California. In 2011, she was living with her boyfriend and their young daughter on the outskirts of San Francisco in a one-bedroom apartment that cost around $1,500 a month. When she and her boyfriend split up four years later, the market rate for a similar apartment was at least $2,400. As a newly qualified teacher earning $2,700 a month, she just couldn't make her budget stretch that much."}
{"original": "Basically, we had nowhere to live, she says. Then her best friend, also a single mom and struggling to afford her duplex rent, suggested that Sarah move in. My daughter shared a room with my friend's son — they're the same age, went to preschool together and know each other well, Sarah says. And I lived in her garage for a year."}
{"original": "Listening to Sarah's matter-of-fact account of how she bought carpet and space heaters to make her new sleeping quarters more comfortable, the rationale is compelling. Her rent was now $1,300 a month, and sharing grocery shopping with her friend also cut costs."}
{"original": "But, she says, the situation was ridiculous. The poorly insulated garage was stifling hot in summer, uncomfortably cold in winter, and lacked direct access to the duplex, which meant going outside at night to reach the bathroom. The move added up to 40 minutes each way to her daily commute. And she had to buy a baby monitor so that her daughter could hear her mom's voice before she fell asleep."}
{"original": "These are the people that the city needs to survive. Sonja Trauss, founder of the San Francisco Bay Area Renters' Federation"}
{"original": "It's really upsetting to be a working adult who can't even afford a one-bedroom apartment by myself, she says. That makes me very angry."}
{"original": "She criticizes tech companies — whose presence in the Bay Area has been blamed for rocketing rents and house prices — for not helping to manage the problems they've created."}
{"original": "The Bay Area's affordable housing crisis has made stories like Sarah's shockingly common. Assuming a household spends no more than 30 percent of income on rent, it would need to earn $180,000 a year to be able to afford the median rent in the city, according to the planning department's analysis published last summer. In San Francisco, the starting salary for a credentialed teacher is $55,461."}
{"original": "Two-thirds of teachers spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent, according to a 2018 survey by Stanford University for San Francisco Unified School District. Of those, 14.7 percent say rent accounts for more than half their income. Annual teacher turnover is around 12 percent, which translates to the district having to fill an average of 400 classroom vacancies each school year."}
{"original": "Andia via Getty Images The Victorian houses known as the Painted Ladies in San Francisco. Assuming a household spends no more than 30 percent of its income on rent, it would need to make $180,000 a year to afford the median rent in the city."}
{"original": "Housing affordability is the biggest reason given for teachers leaving, according to Daniel Menezes, SFUSD's chief human resources officer."}
{"original": "Educator turnover hurts a school because children need to experience safety and stability, says Elaine Merriweather, executive vice president of the United Educators of San Francisco union. Educators develop relationships with students that really help to support their growth and learning."}
{"original": "Collective bargaining and the parcel tax approved last June ― which will provide teachers with a 7 percent wage rise over the next two decades funded by a $298 annual tax on San Francisco property owners ― have increased basic teacher salaries by over a third since 2014, according to SFUSD's Menezes. But, he says, the costly housing market means these pay increases aren't enough to attract and retain educators, particularly those just starting out or who have a family."}
{"original": "Every year, it is getting harder and harder to go out to national universities and convince a teacher to come to San Francisco because of the affordability issue, Menezes says."}
{"original": "To address the crisis, SFUSD has partnered with the city and the teachers union to build its first teacher housing complex, with occupancy expected in 2022. The Francis Scott Key development in San Francisco's Outer Sunset neighborhood in the west of the city will convert a surplus school district site into 130 apartments, costing from around $1,600 for a studio to $2,300 for a three-bedroom."}
{"original": "BAR Architects for MidPen Housing An artist's impression of the Francis Scott Key development in the Outer Sunset neighborhood of San Francisco."}
{"original": "We'll have teachers at the higher end of that scale and we'll have para-educators — special needs teachers and assistants in the classroom — who earn less, says Kate Hartley, director of the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development. We're really excited about being able to serve that wide range of school employees."}
{"original": "While Sarah welcomes the idea of dedicated housing for teachers, she says she wouldn't be able to save any money or afford a house if she stayed in the Bay Area and had to pay those kind of rents."}
{"original": "To genuinely address the teacher housing crisis, the Bay Area needs protections for existing tenants and a deluge of new housing units, says Sonja Trauss, founder of the San Francisco Bay Area Renters' Federation."}
{"original": "Trauss, who was a high school math teacher in the East Bay, quit her job a few years back when housing and commuting costs became too much for her to afford. Since then, she has campaigned for higher-density zoning."}
{"original": "Too much of the city is zoned for low-density housing in a place that is incredibly in demand, Trauss told HuffPost. It's not just San Francisco, but all over the Bay Area."}
{"original": "Trauss has also fought against homeowners who block development to preserve neighborhood character. The situation we have now is that people who already have their homes really don't care if there's a [housing] shortage, she says. Their feeling is that allowing the city to grow would change neighborhood character ... But these are the people that the city needs to survive."}
{"original": "In a recent example of the kind of Bay Area nimbyism Trauss has called out, more than 6,500 people signed a petition against proposals to build low-cost teacher housing in the wealthy Almaden Valley neighborhood of San Jose. San Jose Unified, the largest school district in the South Bay and a good one-hour drive from San Francisco, is considering converting eight schools with aging buildings or declining enrollment into affordable teacher housing. The plans, however, have attracted criticism from residents."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Jefferson Union High School District just outside San Francisco plans to use a $33 million voter-approved bond to fund 116 low-cost apartments for teachers and other staff, due to break ground this year. Teacher pay in the district is reportedly among the lowest in the county — $49,500 to $87,300 a year."}
{"original": "The plan will definitely be a game changer for a lot of people and would really help me out because housing will be low market rate, which would allow me to have more of a long-term outlook in the district, says Mike Rodriguez, a 12th-grade math and economics teacher at Jefferson Union's Thornton High School."}
{"original": "Rodriguez, 30, has a master's degree and has been teaching for four years. He makes $50,000 a year and has $100,000 of student debt. He drives for Uber for at least two hours each day to boost his income, lives with three others and looks forward to the day when he might not need to rent a room in a shared apartment."}
{"original": "Rafael_Wiedenmeier via Getty Images Alt-Erlaa municipal housing in Vienna. The Austrian capital's affordable social housing model could provide San Francisco with one potential solution for teacher housing."}
{"original": "The region's teacher housing crisis needs both investment and political will, says Wang from SPUR. While there is no magic bullet, she adds, European models such as Germany's baugruppen co-housing communities and Vienna's affordable social housing, which offer city-based, lower-cost accommodation with shared facilities, could provide solutions for middle-income earners such as teachers and other public-sector workers."}
{"original": "For Sarah, change isn't coming quickly enough. For the last two years, she has been living with her parents and her daughter in Redwood City, a 30-minute commute to her current school. Once the school year ends, she plans to move to a more affordable city like Sacramento."}

{"original": "Let's face it—end-of-life planning isn't fun. The topic can seem morose, depressing -- maybe even a little scary. But it's also a critical aspect of managing your assets and protecting your family, which is why it's surprising that nearly 6 out of 10 Americans are unprepared for the inevitable."}
{"original": "According to a new Caring.com survey, only 42 percent of U.S. adults currently have estate planning documents such as a will or living trust. For those with children under the age of 18, the figure is even lower, with just 36 percent having an end-of-life plan in place."}
{"original": "I think many Americans avoid setting up a will because they simply don't want to think about their death, says Texas-based financial coach Craig Dacy. However, setting up a will not only takes care of your loved ones financially, it can save them a lot of emotional stress after you're gone."}
{"original": "The study, conducted in January by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, asked 1,003 adults whether they currently have estate-planning documents in case of their death, as well as the reason why not (if applicable)."}
{"original": "Forty-seven percent of survey respondents without estate documents said, I just haven't gotten around to it. This is unsurprising to experts, who say an aversion to end-of-life planning is not only rooted in fear but also procrastination."}
{"original": "This is the 'I'm going to live forever' theory. No one literally thinks that, but we all want to believe we are going to live until our 80s or 90s so we don't think we need a will right now, says Debbi King, author of The ABC's of Personal Finance. This isn't true, of course. We all have an expiration date and no one knows exactly when it will be. The best thing you can do for your loved ones is have a will now."}
{"original": "Age and assets are the greatest barriers"}
{"original": "As one might expect, older Americans are the most likely demographic to have an estate plan in place. According to the survey, 81 percent of those age 72 or older have a will or living trust. However, that percentage declines significantly with younger people."}
{"original": "A staggering 78 percent of millennials (ages 18-36) do not have a will. Even more surprising is that 64 percent of Generation X (ages 37 to 52) doesn't have a will, and nearly half of respondents in the 53 to 71-year-old age group (40 percent) said they don't have one."}
{"original": "The problem, say experts, is twofold. First, younger Americans are generally unconcerned with their own mortality, which perpetuates the misconception that a will isn't necessary until later in life."}
{"original": "Young adults don't expect something bad will happen to them, and if it does, they expect their parents to step in, says estate-planning veteran Jack Hillis, president of Hillis Financial Services. Additionally, wills are generally associated with the passing of a grandparent at that stage in life. At the age of 18 you're thinking about your whole life in front of you, not what would happen if your life ended."}
{"original": "What's more, Hillis says baby boomers are aware that they should have a will in place, but planning for a possible tragedy is an uncomfortable process that forces people to answer some tough questions."}
{"original": "At the age of 50 you still don't envision the end of your life, so most will continue to put off the process as long as they can, says Hillis. And that's unwise."}
{"original": "Secondly, younger Americans tend to have fewer assets than their older counterparts, which feeds into the false impression that a will is only needed for those with substantial wealth or complex finances. In fact, the survey found that 29 percent of those without a will said it was because they don't have enough assets to leave anyone."}
{"original": "It's so important to have a will regardless of age or assets, because not only does it allow you to make the decisions about what you want but it also makes it much easier on the loved ones you leave behind, says Jody Giles, author of Missing Pieces Plan: Providing You and Your Loved Ones Peace of Mind, which helps people plan for the end of life."}
{"original": "Even if you don't have the wealth of Steve Jobs or Prince, what you do have means something to somebody. Regardless of the amount of 'wealth' you are passing on, let it be handed over based on your wishes, not your state's laws."}
{"original": "Estate planning attorney Matthew Underwood explains that the whole purpose of a will is to tell a court how to distribute your assets in a special proceeding called probate. The purpose of probate is to give a public notice of death and allow creditors to file claims against the estate. Whatever is left after the creditors are paid goes to the beneficiaries. In the absence of a will, the particular state's laws of succession direct how property gets distributed."}
{"original": "In other words, if you don't have a will, the state has one for you, says Underwood. Regardless of how old you are or how much wealth you have, would you rather have government officials dictate where your property goes or would you rather decide that for yourself?"}
{"original": "If you have children, a will is critical"}
{"original": "One of the survey's most surprising findings was that just 36 percent of those with children under 18 have an end-of-life plan in place. This is a potentially devastating oversight."}
{"original": "I can not stress enough the importance of having a will if you have children, says Giles. If you have children you need a will, if for no other reason than the sole purpose of naming guardians. Selecting someone to care for our children if something happens to us is not what anyone wants to consider, but it's imperative that we do. If you don't nominate guardians in a will, a judge will decide who should take care of your kids after you die."}
{"original": "The importance of a health care power of attorney"}
{"original": "The Caring.com study also asked respondents whether or not they have a health care power of attorney, which appoints a specific individual to make medical decisions for you if you're incapable of doing so."}
{"original": "A health care power of attorney is more common than a will or living trust, with roughly 53 percent of U.S. adults having granted someone this legal authorization, according to the survey."}
{"original": "However, demographic disparities play a role here as well. While 83 percent of those over 72 have a power of attorney in place, only 41 percent of millennials can say the same. Again, experts say you should not wait until you're a senior citizen to get yours in order."}
{"original": "Perhaps even more importantly than a will, everyone over the age of 18 should have a power of attorney, says Underwood, who points out that once a child turns 18, his or her parents are legally cut off from making some very important decisions."}
{"original": "I've heard stories of kids going off to college or traveling abroad and then getting sick or hurt, says Underwood. When the parents call the hospital to find out what's going on, the doctors won't even talk to the parents because the student did not have a health care power of attorney."}
{"original": "You can work with a lawyer to set up a health care power of attorney and an advanced health care directive, a document that sets out your medical preferences."}
{"original": "Is estate planning complicated or expensive?"}
{"original": "Broadly speaking, the complexity and cost of setting up a will or living trust depends on how complex your circumstances and assets are. But generally speaking, a qualified lawyer can draft a simple will and power of attorney for less than $1,000."}
{"original": "For individuals with modest wealth and straightforward wishes, a simple estate plan can be prepared quickly and inexpensively, says Ashley Case, an Arizona-based tax and estate-planning attorney. Some factors that tend to complicate an estate plan include multiple marriages, children from different relationships, certain business assets, a higher net-worth, and complex wishes regarding distributions."}

I'm not OK with spending stimulus checks, sending out and spending stimulus checks on one penny or two penny stocks, which is what's been happening with this incredible story of GameStop and some of these penny stocks. That's so silly."}
{"original": "Giving out stimulus checks so people can buy penny stocks, not fine, Kudlow added. Not good."}
{"original": "Kudlow's concerns don't seem to have much of a basis in reality. According to a study released in July by the U.S. Census Bureau, 87.6% of adults in households that made $25,000 or less planned to use their stimulus payments on expenses."}

{"original": "Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) An image of President Donald Trump appears on video screens before his speech to his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― One hundred and sixty years after the first Republican president was forced to put down a violent insurrection against the United States, the party's 19th is leaving office after inciting one."}
{"original": "Donald Trump plans to leave the White House for the final time Wednesday morning, 78 days after becoming only the fourth incumbent to lose reelection in a century and seven days after becoming the first president to be impeached twice."}
{"original": "Democrat Joe Biden will take the oath of office at noon that day, becoming president and commander-in-chief of the United States, and leaving Trump suddenly vulnerable to both civil and criminal legal liabilities from which holding that office had shielded him for four years."}
{"original": "Trump is facing lawsuits from women accusing him of sexual misconduct, including rape; criminal investigations by both state and federal prosecutors in New York; a Senate impeachment trial that could bar him from holding federal office again; and potentially both civil and criminal exposure for his weekslong efforts to spark chaos at the U.S. Capitol in order to prevent Biden from being certified as the winner of the 2020 election. The Jan. 6 riot, which Trump egged on with a rally near the White House, quickly turned bloody and ended with the deaths of a Capitol Police officer and four Trump supporters. A second officer died by suicide days later."}
{"original": "While Trump will not be receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, he will now be inducted into the Guinness Book of World Records for being the only president anywhere to have been impeached for the second time, said Michael Cohen, Trump's onetime lawyer who served federal prison time for, in part, his work to pay hush money to women who'd had affairs with Trump. Congratulations, Donald, and best of luck in your future endeavors."}
{"original": "Trump's first impeachment had come a year earlier, for trying to extort the new Ukrainian leader into publicly smearing Biden, whom Trump feared even in early 2019 as the Democratic challenger most likely to oust him."}
{"original": "The Trump legacy will include: the most corrupt administration in American history, the grandest handover of policymaking to corporations of all time, the most overt and vicious racism and anti-immigrant xenophobia of any administration in modern times, unparalleled incompetence, cruelty and callousness in its mismanagement of the pandemic, and rushing the globe toward climate catastrophe at the exact moment when the world needed the United States to pivot away from fossil fuel reliance, said Robert Weissman, president of the liberal group Public Citizen. There's a long list of 'accomplishments,' far beyond these lowlights."}
{"original": "While Trump frequently claims he has done more than any previous president ― In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country, he told the United Nations just 20 months into his term ― in reality, he leaves office with among the thinnest portfolios of policy successes of any president in modern times."}
{"original": "While establishment Republicans managed to achieve their decadeslong goals of large tax cuts for corporations, the rollback of environmental and worker safety regulations, and the appointment of more than 200 pro-business judges to the federal bench, Trump himself checked almost nothing off the agenda he pushed at the start of his 2016 presidential campaign."}
{"original": "Trump promised he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to benefit U.S. workers. Instead, it was renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement but remains functionally nearly identical, with the exception of some small tweaks lifted directly from the Trans-Pacific Partnership ― another trade pact Trump pulled out of and called the worst deal ever."}
{"original": "He promised a large middle-class tax cut, but instead went along with a plan from congressional Republican leaders that gave the biggest benefit to the richest Americans. Although he again promised a middle-class tax cut heading into the midterm elections of 2018, Trump did nothing to enact one afterward."}
{"original": "There were similar results with an infrastructure plan to rebuild the nation's highways, bridges and airports and a health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act: Trump repeatedly promised to push through these tremendous proposals but never even released a single word of either."}
{"original": "AP Photo/Susan Walsh Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the border village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone, South Korea, on June 3, 2019."}
{"original": "Trump's creation of a Space Force, which he appears to believe was a major accomplishment, was merely a bureaucratic renaming of the Air Force's Space Command, which had existed since the Reagan presidency, with no change in mission or staffing. Democrats, however, were able to trade that Trump win for paid family leave for federal workers, a longtime priority of theirs."}
{"original": "In foreign policy, Trump claimed he would get tough with China to help U.S. manufacturers. Instead, he launched a fruitless trade war that devastated American farmers and manufacturers both, while hurting consumers through higher prices ― all while he turned a blind eye to China's escalating human rights abuses against its Muslim minority and increasingly totalitarian measures against all its citizens."}
{"original": "He claimed he would remove the threat of a nuclear-armed North Korea, but in the end did nothing ― apart from trading love letters with its dictator, Kim Jong Un. In Western Europe, Trump accused traditional allies of ripping off the United States through the NATO military alliance and European Union trade policies. The attacks strained those relationships, inuring to the benefit of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, who has long sought to drive a wedge between the trans-Atlantic allies and who helped Trump win election in 2016."}
{"original": "Even Trump's signature promise, that he would build a massive concrete wall along the 2,000-mile southern border of the U.S. and force Mexico to pay for it, was a failure. After four years, he managed to build only 80 miles of steel fencing in areas where there had been no barrier at all, using money he raided from the Pentagon's construction budget meant for, among other things, schools and housing for military families. Mexico has not paid anything."}
{"original": "Yet on that and any number of other issues, Trump would claim huge success, typically making assertions that were completely the opposite of the actual facts ― with those lies then amplified by Trump's aides and allies."}
{"original": "That, said longtime Florida Republican consultant Mac Stipanovich, was perhaps the most useful piece of Trump's legacy: Ruining the reputations of people who might otherwise have continued in public life with the extent of their moral bankruptcy still unknown, Stipanovich said, offering as examples: Bill Barr, Mike Pompeo, Lindsey Graham."}
{"original": "Despite failing to deliver on his promises, despite a botched coronavirus response that began with months of denial, despite tens of thousands of lies to the public on any number of topics, and despite funneling many millions of dollars from domestic and foreign lobbyists, Republican donors large and small, and American taxpayers into his own pockets over his four years in office, Trump nevertheless received nearly 11 million more votes in 2020 than he had in 2016."}
{"original": "There are 74 million Americans who know exactly who Donald Trump was and voted for him anyway, said one former White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity."}
{"original": "Within days of losing the Nov. 3 election, Trump began capitalizing on that popularity to raise millions of dollars, first with the trumpeted aim of challenging the voters' decision and then under the guise of supporting GOP candidates in two Senate runoff elections. But, in fact, he can use the proceeds of the leadership PAC he created for almost anything he wants, including paying himself an eight-figure salary. He wound up spending nothing at all on the Georgia Senate races. Trump has also vowed to remain involved in Republican politics by attacking incumbents who have not shown him sufficient loyalty and has hinted at another White House run himself in four years."}
{"original": "Win McNamee via Getty Images A pro-Trump mob invades the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, bent on violence, destruction and halting the certification of Joe Biden's election victory."}
{"original": "Those threats have kept Republicans largely muted in their criticisms since the election. A recent Axios-Ipsos poll showed that, even after his incitement of the mob attack on the Capitol, 64% of Republicans said they supported his recent behavior, and 57% said they would like to see him as their 2024 nominee. Indeed, in the House impeachment proceedings against him a week after the attack on the Capitol, only 10 of the 211 Republican lawmakers voted with the Democrats in favor of the resolution."}
{"original": "At a Republican National Committee gathering in Amelia Island, Florida, Trump called into a breakfast meeting the morning after the violence he had incited. A lot of members sat quietly, while others cheered him, said one member on condition of anonymity. There were a lot of RNC members who were hesitant to say anything."}
{"original": "Yet that desperation to hang onto power, even if it meant shredding the Constitution and endangering the lives of his own vice president and hundreds of lawmakers, may finally bring an end to Trump's political career. While Trump remains popular among Republicans, that support is less than it used to be, while his support among independent voters has plummeted."}
{"original": "If enough Republican senators vote with Democrats to reach the two-thirds supermajority needed for conviction in his second impeachment trial, a subsequent simple majority vote in the Senate could then prevent him from holding any federal office for the rest of his life."}
{"original": "And even if the conviction vote fails, the former White House official said, Trump likely will never recover from Americans' searing memory of the insurrection itself, particularly as more details emerge and more prosecutions are filed in court. It'll be next to impossible because he'll be saddled with it, the official said. He'll be saddled with Jan. 6 forever."}
{"original": "Tourism, a topic discussed when China Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani last January in Tehran, has become central to the Islamic Republic agenda, especially after finalizing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action last month."}
{"original": "In recent years, Iran has laid the groundwork to capitalize on the large number of Chinese citizens traveling abroad, more than 100 million in 2014. Deputy of Iran Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization (ICHHTO) Morteza Rahmani Movahed, disclosed in June 2014 that Iran plans to attract 5 percent of China's overseas tourists and desires to boost the number of overall foreign visitors from 4.5 million in 2013 to 10 million by 2019 within the framework of the 2025 Vision Plan. He noted that Iran desires to draw 20 million annual tourists in the next decade, generating an estimated $25-30 billion."}
{"original": "Iran has steadily invested in its tourism infrastructure and the world is taking note. Its ranking in the World Economic Forum, Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, has improved in the past four years, from 114 in 2011 to 97 in 2015. However, Tehran did not make the report's Middle East and North Africa list of Top 10 most tourism-ready economies."}
{"original": "Steady progress notwithstanding, Iranian officials have stated that improvements are needed because it lacks adequate tourism infrastructure."}
{"original": "Iran lacks the proper infrastructure required to survive in the highly competitive tourism market, chairman of Iran-China Chamber of Commerce Assadollah Asgaroladi said in 2014. Even if we succeed in attracting the targeted 5 million Chinese tourists by [2015], we would not have sufficient hotels of international standard to accommodate the travelers nor do we have enough number of trained Chinese tour guides, he added."}
{"original": "To its credit, Tehran has recognized these weak spots and moved to increase the number of hotels and create educational framework to produce quality Chinese speakers."}
{"original": "In 2014, Iran overhauled its hotel industry, investing $220 million in hotels and other similar establishments. Officials have strategized to build more four-and-five star hotels, as only 130 out of 1,100 hotels hold this status."}
{"original": "By 2025, the number of four-and-five star hotels in Iran must rise to 400, ICHTO head Masoud Soltanifar, recently told PressTV, further noting that 125 are presently being erected."}
{"original": "Starting this March, Iranian officials plan to offer an income tax-exemption for five-years to incentivize companies to build more hotels, particularly in less developed parts of the country, Seyed Kamel Taqavinejad, head of Iranian Tax Administration said, according to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, IRNA reported."}
{"original": "In 2009, University of Tehran and Yunnan University of China joint-sponsored the first Confucius Institute in Iran, educating 57 students during its inaugural year. Other institutions, including University of Tehran last December, have launched Chinese language programs."}
{"original": "To entice Chinese travelers, Iran has overhauled its entire visa protocol, decreasing visa processing time to less than 48 hours, removing visa requirements for Chinese visitors touring Iran for up to five days, and lengthening its on-arrival visas from 14 days to 30 days."}
{"original": "To accommodate a rise in tourists, last October, direct-flights increased in frequency between the two nations. Iran's Mahan Air, now departs three-times per week and China Southern Airlines also flies nonstop to Iran. Direct travel will benefit Iran's business and tourism sectors, as economic and investment delegations jockey to enter the Iranian market."}
{"original": "Why has Tehran gone to such lengths to court Chinese tourists?"}
{"original": "Renminbi, Chinese currency, will become official world tenure in October 2016, therein allow Chinese travelers to carry hard currency. This exchange, given that Chinese travelers spent a combined $165 billion in 2014, should spark the Iranian economy."}
{"original": "During President Xi's first trip to Iran last month, the two countries decided to escalate trade to $600 billion during the next decade, and agreed on major financial deals, including likely having the world's largest bank in terms of money, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, open branches in Iran. This deal, if finalized, should pay high dividends to both countries."}
{"original": "With a report by Fung Business Intelligence Center and China Luxury Advisors forecasting the number of Chinese outward tourists to swell to 234 million and their spending to hit $422 billion by 2020, according to Wall Street Journal, Iran is poised to see a return on investment."}
{"original": "I have been a Canadian tax lawyer for almost 30 years. Being a tax lawyer is not as sexy as being a famous criminal defence lawyer like Brian Greenspan or Marie Heinen. For the most part, I toil in the tax trenches and fight with Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) officials."}
{"original": "Having dealings with CRA for three decades, you form an opinion on the calibre of the people, the quality of the work being done, the management and the organization's overall effectiveness."}
{"original": "I wish I had good news for Canadian taxpayers."}
{"original": "THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Canada Revenue Agency headquarters in Ottawa."}
{"original": "My experience has been that CRA staff are unreasonable. Some tax audits seem like make-work projects or a game of chicken, but the problem in many cases comes down to lack of training or plain smug behaviour. Too often, the CRA creates problems rather than solving them."}
{"original": "There have been articles about CRA's systemic problems with their call centres, with various employees giving taxpayers wrong information and blocking 50 per cent of calls."}
{"original": "The issues of inadequate training compounded with ample attitude are worse now than 20 years ago. I was speaking to a colleague who had complained about this to a senior CRA official. His response was that CRA expects tax lawyers and accountants to help train their people."}
{"original": "Do you train your roofer, plumber, or mechanic?"}
{"original": "You can expect to get put through the wringer by CRA auditors who defy logic and reason."}
{"original": "CRA has extraordinary powers that inspire fear and loathing. The Income Tax Act gives collections officers the power to garnish amounts owing from a taxpayer who has an outstanding balance on their tax account. This can include an employee's wages, accounts receivable, and the seizure of bank accounts or investment accounts, all without court authorization."}
{"original": "If you get audited, you can expect to get put through the wringer by CRA auditors who defy logic and reason, even when presented with clear evidence of no wrong-doing. For the record, about five to 10 per cent of Canadians have ongoing issues with CRA in any given year; these are unpublished figures."}
{"original": "So, fighting with CRA really is like the proverbial fighting City Hall."}
{"original": "Here's an example. We have a client who is a car dealer. He buys cars, generally at auction and exports them to Africa and the Middle East. When you buy a vehicle, you pay HST. When you export it, the HST is supposed to be refunded. When dealing with volume, the amount of HST paid quickly adds up. Our client applied for the refunds which were denied. The arguments made by the CRA auditor made no sense."}
{"original": "We filed an appeal and refuted every point made by the tax auditor. The appeal officer kept asking for more paperwork, much of it unnecessary. We advised our client to comply. After almost two years from when the refunds were first denied, our client received his refund cheque for $900,000, including interest. However, the client's business had serious cashflow problems for two years."}
{"original": "The CRA is wasting our time, energy and taxpayer's money."}
{"original": "Here's another example. We have a file that is now in appeals after the CRA auditor ignored a 30-page submission, with detailed schedules, showing how our client did not have $25 million in unreported earnings, based on a wrong CRA analysis of casino records."}
{"original": "Armed with a detailed explanation of each report, we sent an analysis to CRA that showed the auditor was completely wrong in his determination. The auditor did not respond and we kept following up, with no reply. Finally, the auditor came up with a new unreported amount of over $10 million, without responding to any of the points raised in our submissions."}
{"original": "Our request for a meeting with the CRA team leader was ignored and the auditor confirmed the tax assessment at $10 million. A tax appeal is still ongoing."}
{"original": "The CRA is wasting our time, energy and taxpayer's money in pursuing this. And our client is incurring more legal fees."}
{"original": "In November 2016, the auditor general of Canada released a damning report on CRA's performance. The handling of tax appeals was a particular target of opprobrium; there is a huge backlog, generally well in excess of a year. So, CRA has to hire more people and implement better systems because tax auditors get it wrong so often."}
{"original": "CRA has repeatedly said that the underground economy — everyone using cash and not charging HST/GST — is a major target of CRA tax investigations. Waiters and waitresses in P.E.I. are being audited, with other communities having been targeted in the past."}
{"original": "Last week, it was announced that under threat of court action from the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO), CRA was finally releasing the so-called tax gap information to the PBO. The tax gap measures the size of the tax loss to the underground economy."}
{"original": "Importantly, CRA has fought the release of the tax gap for years. We suspect that the information, when finally available, will not show CRA as being especially effective at clamping down on big-time tax cheats. No date was given for the release of the tax gap."}
{"original": "So, the rest of our tax bills have to be raised to compensate for the inability of CRA to collect what is owed by tax crooks."}
{"original": "Divorce expenses can soar, especially when spouses start suspecting each other of hiding property. Consider what happens when wives or husbands hire private investigators to track down assets concealed by their future exes. Fees to find those hidden assets can add up to many thousands of dollars, as I can confirm from my work as a tax lawyer and investigator."}
{"original": "Fortunately, there's a no- or low-cost source of information for spouses who are compelled to litigate their divorces or for already-divorced spouses who seek to recover overdue payments of alimony or child support. And frequently the means for unearthing this information is tucked away in their file cabinets--unbeknownst to those seeking the information. This is because still-marrieds and ex-spouses can glean a good part of what they need from the separate schedules submitted with their jointly filed federal tax returns."}
{"original": "Indeed, a treasure trove of names and amounts that could considerably shorten searches for hidden assets can be found in the 1040 forms, as follows."}
{"original": "1. Check the Schedule B. This schedule requires listing the names of mutual funds, brokerage companies, banks and other sources of dividends and interest. At the bottom of Schedule B are questions about the existence of banks and financial accounts in foreign countries or foreign trust transactions. Not everyone will have a Schedule B, however. For those whose interest or dividend income is less than $1,500, the totals for dividend and interest income are listed on the first page of Form 1040. Taxpayers with bank or other financial accounts in foreign countries and those involved in certain foreign trusts have to continue filing Schedule B, regardless of the level of dividends or interest income."}
{"original": "If the dividend and interest amounts aren't listed on a Schedule B, this can make it harder to find out where the investments or bank accounts are. But just listing totals of interest and dividend income reveals that an ex owns assets that generate interest and dividends, at least during the year covered by the return. This, in turn, gives spouses endeavoring to find hidden assets a starting point for their quests."}
{"original": "2. Check the Schedule D. This schedule discloses capital gains and losses from sales of fund shares, individual stocks and other assets. Let's say an ex's Schedule D reports a profit or a loss from a sale of some fund shares. The details of the sale establish that he or she owned and unloaded those shares. Chances are the ex owns more investments."}
{"original": "3. Check the Schedule E. This schedule discloses income or loss from the following sources: rental real estate (including the type and location) and royalties; partnerships and S corporations (S corporations are companies--taxed much the same way as partnerships are--that pass profits or losses through to their shareholders, who pay taxes at their own individual rates); and estates and trusts."}
{"original": "So if Schedule E reveals rental income, it might be worthwhile to drop by the property. Ditto when there's partnership or S corporation income--track down the outfit in question and ascertain whether it continues to generate income for the dear ex-spouse in question."}

{"original": "LOS ANGELES — Two years ago, Sherolyn Scott lost the apartment she had been living in for 16 years due to rising rent costs. She took the money from her security deposit and started sleeping in motels, but when that money was gone, she resorted to parks and porches."}
{"original": "Sleeping outdoors, unprotected, set off a cascade of medical emergencies, often the result of violence. Attackers raped Scott, she said, and as she was recovering from the assault, she suffered a stroke. Later, robbers beat her so viciously that she ended up with her jaw wired shut."}
{"original": "Each of these events sent Scott to the hospital, after which she was released back to a life on the streets."}
{"original": "It wasn't until the third hospital visit that police, worried that those who assaulted and robbed Scott would return to hurt her again, suggested the hospital find somewhere for her to stay after discharge."}
{"original": "The hospital then referred Scott to a recuperative care facility ― a temporary shelter with nursing staff and social workers ― run by a local nonprofit, the National Health Foundation. She spent the next four months recovering and working with a housing program. At the end of her stay, she was able to move into her own apartment in South Los Angeles. Scott, now 60 years old, believes she wouldn't be alive today if it hadn't been for recuperative care."}
{"original": "If they had sent me back to the streets one more time, I [would] be dead, Scott said."}
{"original": "People who don't have their own homes to return to after a hospital stay may be transported to homeless shelters, although a significant minority are released directly back onto the streets. A survey among 98 homeless people who had been hospitalized in New Haven found that 67 percent stayed in a homeless shelter the first night after being discharged from the hospital, while 11 percent slept on the street."}
{"original": "Both crowded, chaotic shelters and the street are obviously inappropriate places for medical recovery, which can have serious consequences for the patient, including a return to the hospital. Being homeless can increase the odds of re-hospitalization within 30 days almost four-fold."}
{"original": "One small study that followed homeless people after hospitalization in North Carolina found that they ended up living in church closets, ill-prepared family homes, addiction recovery centers or homeless shelters. Their recovery times were often prolonged because of infection, re-hospitalization, falls and lack of basic assistance."}
{"original": "This hospital-to-street pipeline also perpetuates homelessness. Repeated bouts of illness and injury can prevent people from finding or keeping a job or even navigating the maze of social services a city may offer, experts say."}
{"original": "In an attempt to fill the gap between acute care at a hospital and life on the street, nonprofits, funded by a mix of private and public money, are starting to open recuperative care facilities like the one Scott used. These centers provide services that homeless shelters cannot, including semi-private rooms and more support staff to help people with basic needs while they recover."}
{"original": "Courtesy of National Health Foundation Sherolyn Scott believes her life was saved when she was referred to a recuperative care facility."}
{"original": "Recuperative care facilities are not a new idea. The first U.S. programs began cropping up in the mid-1980s, and there are now at least 78 known programs in 29 states and Washington, D.C."}
{"original": "Like most services for the homeless, these facilities suffer from a lack of funding, and the data to prove their effectiveness is expensive and difficult to gather. But as the number of homeless continues to grow in major American metropolitan regions, officials and experts keep trying to identify and invest in programs that help people survive and exit homelessness."}
{"original": "California leads the country among states that have invested in recup facilities, as they are sometimes called. At last count in 2016, it had 23 known recuperative care programs. By comparison, Florida, the state with the second largest number of programs, had five."}
{"original": "Los Angeles County has the highest number of recuperative care beds in the state, which makes sense considering it also has the second-highest homeless population and the greatest number of unsheltered homeless people in the nation. If recup facilities can work here, experts hope to hold up the state as a model for the rest of the country."}
{"original": "California has the most respite programs, and that's partly related to the population of homeless in the state, but also the innovation in the state as well, said Julia Dobbins, an expert on respite care with the National Health Care for the Homeless Council. I think other states are interested in emulating [that]."}
{"original": "The benefits of entering recuperative care are undeniable. According to LA County's own records, about 50 percent of people who spend time in a recuperative care facility go on to secure permanent housing. For hospitals both private and public, recuperative care also has the potential to lower overall costs and decrease the rate of hospital readmission."}
{"original": "Health officials estimate that each day in a bed at LA County's safety net hospital costs the county more than $3,000, while a bed at a recuperative care facility averages about $150 per day."}
{"original": "We're spending a lot of money on emergency services for these vulnerable homeless individuals, said Libby Boyce, director of access, referral and engagement in the Housing for Health division of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services."}
{"original": "More thoughtful and impactful solutions are not only the right thing to do, Boyce said, but we believe that it results in significant cost avoidance."}
{"original": "Those cost savings have motivated local safety net programs, insurance companies and private hospitals to invest in recuperative care to lower their own expenses."}
{"original": "Even the voters saw the light in LA County. Faced with a growing homeless population, voters decided in 2017 to tax themselves an extra quarter-cent to fund homeless services. That steady stream of funding will help the county double its recuperative care bed count from 500 to 1,000 within the next two years."}
{"original": "But nationally investments in these programs have come in fits and starts, propelled by factors like the cluster of controversies over patient dumping in 2007, implementation of the Affordable Care Act penalties to prevent hospital readmission within 30 days in 2013, and Medicaid expansion, which opened up a new source of funding in states that chose to participate in 2014."}
{"original": "Most recup facilities must rely on a hodgepodge of public and private money that includes funding from private hospitals, community health grants from Medicaid and Medicare, private donations, local and state government spending, and donations from faith communities, according to a National Health Care for the Homeless Council report."}
{"original": "Currently, LA County ― again, the region with the largest investment in this kind of care ― has dedicated funding to pay for only 500 beds in recuperative care. That's a drop in the bucket given the approximately 55,000 county residents without a home."}
{"original": "Private hospitals in Los Angeles pay for recuperative care as well, contracting with the National Health Foundation, the nonprofit that helped Scott get her life back. But counties and hospitals can't cover the start-up costs for these facilities. The foundation's latest facility in Los Angeles required a coordinated effort of nonprofits to fund the construction ― and eventually operations for free or at-cost. That massive effort will result in just 100 more beds."}
{"original": "Because these are still considered experimental programs, there is no licensing structure or regulations for recuperative care. Facilities range from motel rooms to a set of shelter beds to converted homes, according to the National Health Care for the Homeless Council."}
{"original": "Gaining Medicaid reimbursement would be the next big step, experts say. With that, the recuperative care model would have the steady, sustained support it needs to make a national impact on homeless people's lives. But there's a Catch-22: Solid data are needed to justify Medicaid reimbursement as well as widespread investment in recuperative care, but gathering that data from far-flung, uncoordinated and scattershot programs requires a lot of money."}
{"original": "Henry Fader, a health care lawyer at Pepper Hamilton in Philadelphia and a member of the steering committee of the Respite Care Providers' Network, said raising money to do this proof-of-concept research is a priority for the network. But he was pessimistic about the chances of being recognized by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services."}
{"original": "Not only would government have to feel comfortable that it was a viable service, but then the intermediaries, insurance companies and nonprofits would also have to agree to split some of their money, Fader said."}
{"original": "For now, even small and underfunded recuperative care centers can deliver powerful results for the people who have access."}
{"original": "In Los Angeles, Scott had a safe, clean and comfortable space to live for four months, as she slowly regained use of her jaw. In addition to her physical recovery, she said the facility helped her learn how to live again. With simple rules to follow, like keeping her room clean, and counselors to offer mental help, it let her heal from the trauma and disorder of living on the street for two years."}
{"original": "Now that she's in her own apartment again, her two adult children are living with her — as well as a brand-new grandson, born two months ago, whom she gets to watch grow up."}
{"original": "I had to go through all the steps of the program, but here I am today, Scott said. I have my own apartment, I have my children with me, and mentally and physically [I'm] OK."}
{"original": "I saw a former colleague recently who knows that I'm greatly enjoying working as an independent consultant. He's thinking of doing the same, so he asked if there was anything I wish I had known before I began. It was a great question and gave me the chance to reflect over the last several years."}
{"original": "As I did, my ideas fell into do's and don'ts. Or more realistically, what to try to do and what to try and not do, whenever possible."}
{"original": "Drawing on my experiences, I've combined guidance that others had shared with me before I began along with ideas about what I wish I had known. I hope the following overview will help individuals thinking about working as an independent consultant or who may already be doing so."}
{"original": "1. Take the time to assess if you want to be on your own or partner (formally or informally) with others."}
{"original": "This is a foundational point. Being solo means having primary responsibility for business development and related matters."}
{"original": "2. Decide the back office model with which you're comfortable."}
{"original": "There are options if you want to handle all the business related activities (e.g., invoices and billings; expenses; tax withholdings) or if you want to engage an individual or company to do so."}
{"original": "3. Reach out to others in and outside the field in which you hope to consult."}
{"original": "This may be obvious but it's also a good litmus test to gauge your comfort level at making the kinds of overtures needed for successful business development."}
{"original": "4. Err on the side of setting expectations early and clearly with a potential client."}
{"original": "Prepare a checklist of issues that can be used for your initial meeting. Such a list could cover such core questions as anticipated length of the project, specifics about your role, fees and payment terms, and expenses that will or won't be reimbursed."}
{"original": "5. Be alert to the possibility that a client wants your participation only for the benefit your credibility and expertise add to their project or response to a solicitation."}
{"original": "Colleagues of mine have been listed as experts on successful submissions and then their services have not been used."}
{"original": "6. Establish time and fee terms upfront when a client is preparing a proposal."}
{"original": "The client may want your active participation throughout the entire process. Award decisions can take weeks or even months. Decide how much time you can devote either for free or at a reduced rate and get this established with the client before agreeing to participate.Trying to raise this issue later on can mean a less than satisfactory answer from the client."}
{"original": "1. Undervalue your expertise when setting fees."}
{"original": "This can feel difficult and uncomfortable especially when first starting. It is also an individual decision based on many variables. Fees are often set at lower levels in order to build a practice or based on the nature of the client (e.g., non-profit)."}
{"original": "2. Hesitate to request contract status updates from the client."}
{"original": "Every client will have unique contract processes. However, it can be a red flag if too much time elapses before you receive your engagement document. Vague, or no, communications can provide insights about the manner in which a potential client operates."}
{"original": "3. Assume a client will always know with whom you need to meet or work."}
{"original": "Let the client know when you need to meet or work with others. You want to be productive and efficient as that will help you advance the client's goals and project."}
{"original": "4. Feel uncomfortable raising your hourly or project fee for future clients."}
{"original": "This is important to remember especially if you set lower fees when starting out."}
{"original": "Finally, is there anything else I wish I had known before starting out? Yes -- expect and embrace the unanticipated situations you will encounter. Those situations are learning experiences that add to making independent consulting a challenging and exhilarating professional adventure."}
{"original": "Speaker [Paul] Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty, President Obama noted in his State of the Union speech. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up, and I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don't have children."}
{"original": "In fact, President Obama and Speaker Ryan not only agree on this point, but they have nearly identical proposals: expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for childless adults -- the one group that the federal tax code taxes into poverty -- to make it a more effective work incentive. That's good news, and policymakers would be wise to follow their lead."}
{"original": "The EITC has long enjoyed bipartisan support because it encourages and rewards the work of low- and moderate-income people. Rigorous research has cemented its pro-work reputation: during the 1990s, EITC expansions did more to raise employment among single mothers with children than either the 1996 welfare reform law or the strong economy, a well-regarded study found."}
{"original": "The EITC, however, largely excludes workers who aren't raising children and completely excludes them if they're under age 25. A young man just out of school who's in an entry-level job gets nothing, and a middle-aged woman with grown kids who works for the minimum wage at the local nursing home gets close to nothing."}
{"original": "President Obama and Speaker Ryan propose to change that -- in almost exactly the same way. They would phase in the credit more quickly as a worker's earnings rise, raise the maximum credit to about $1,000, and lower the eligibility age from 25 to 21."}
{"original": "These changes would make a big difference. Currently, as the chart shows, a childless worker with poverty-level wages filing their taxes now for 2015 would receive an EITC of $172, not nearly enough to offset the $1,188 he or she owes in income tax and the employee share of payroll taxes (to say nothing of the employer share, which economists generally agree ultimately falls on workers in the form of lower wages). The proposals from Obama and Ryan would give that worker an $841 EITC, a major step towards lifting the worker back to the poverty line."}
{"original": "For a childless adult working full time at the minimum wage, the proposals from Obama and Ryan would boost the EITC from just $23 to $542."}
{"original": "All told, the proposals from Obama and Ryan would lift about half a million people out of poverty and make another 10.1 million people less poor, the Treasury estimates. They also would increase the reward to work for people doing important jobs across our economy, as the table shows."}
{"original": "Policymakers found common ground last year to make permanent critical improvements to the EITC and low-income part of the Child Tax Credit that were scheduled to expire in 2017. This year, they should take up President Obama and Speaker Ryan's proposals and fix the glaring hole in the EITC for childless workers."}

{"original": "A new study offers a potent reminder of what really matters when it comes to economically empowering women: access to abortion."}
{"original": "Women who are blocked from getting abortions face significant financial distress, including higher amounts of debt and increased rates of bankruptcy and eviction, according to a groundbreaking working paper published last week by the National Bureau of Economic Research."}
{"original": "The paper looks at reproductive rights through an economic lens. It was co-authored by economist Sarah Miller, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, along with Laura Wherry, a professor at UCLA's medical school, and Diana Greene Foster, a professor of reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, who is considered a pioneer in researching women and abortion access."}
{"original": "The economic fallout of being unable to get an abortion and carrying a baby to term lasts for years, they found, when compared with women who have abortions ― and, crucially, compared with those who choose to have an abortion and then go on to have a child later."}
{"original": "In other words, women are suffering financially not simply because they've had a child but because they were forced to do so at a time when they weren't ready or prepared."}
{"original": "Of course, there's an economic impact on having a child, said Kate Bahn, an economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, who praised this study for its methodology. It's not just whether you have a child or not but whether you have control over those decisions."}
{"original": "The study comes at a time when women's reproductive rights are increasingly imperiled. Simultaneously, female workers have become a crucial part of the economy. Earlier this month, the Labor Department revealed that women now make up a slight majority of workers in the U.S."}
{"original": "The Question No One Was Asking"}
{"original": "Though there's a deep body of evidence showing that access to birth control changes women's economic outcomes, there's less research into abortion access."}
{"original": "What makes the study released last week so valuable is a revolutionary data set from UC San Francisco, known as the U.S. Turnaway Study, a survey of about 1,000 women. About 800 of them showed up at 30 abortion clinics in 21 states a few weeks within the gestation time limits set by their state and the clinic, ranging from 10 to 26 weeks pregnant. (The researchers also tracked about 200 women who had abortions in their first trimester, as a control group.)"}
{"original": "About 260 of these women were turned away. Of those, 68% carried their pregnancy to term and 32% were able to get an abortion elsewhere, miscarried or had a stillbirth. Another group of women were able to get an abortion."}
{"original": "Researchers recruited these women in 2008 and 2010 and tracked them for five years to find out what their lives were like, calling them up every six months to check in."}
{"original": "It's Not Just Economic Outcomes, It's Life Or Death"}
{"original": "When Foster first started the research project, there was some discussion ― mostly anecdotal and from those with an agenda ― about how having an abortion might hurt women."}
{"original": "Foster wanted to know: How does not being able to get an abortion affect women?"}
{"original": "It's one thing to wish you hadn't needed it, she told HuffPost. It's interesting to know if you wanted one and couldn't get one, would you be better off?"}
{"original": "In previous studies, Foster and the other researchers tracking these women found that the ones who are turned away from getting abortions have worse mental health in the short term and poorer physical health in the long term if they gave birth."}
{"original": "Women who were turned away also faced an increased risk of physical violence from the man involved in their pregnancy."}
{"original": "Two women who were unable to get abortions died from health-related complications. None of the women who were in the group that got abortions died."}
{"original": "That's a horrific death rate, about 1%. About 100 times higher than our national mortality rate, Foster said, emphasizing that the costs of not getting an abortion aren't just economic. The risks of continuing pregnancy are really overlooked in our culture."}
{"original": "Why This Study Breaks New Ground"}
{"original": "Though the previous studies did show that women were economically worse off after they were turned away from the clinic, the data behind that research was self-reported. In other words, those women were surveyed and explained their financial situation to researchers ― a less than perfect method of measuring someone's financial well-being. It's the difference between asking someone how much they weigh and making them stand on a scale."}
{"original": "This new study uses a more objective measure to examine women's financial health, looking at their credit reports (in a way that protected their privacy)."}
{"original": "Economist Sarah Miller, upon reading a paper on the Turnaway Study, came up with the idea and reached out to Foster, who encouraged her to work on it."}
{"original": "The credit report data offered a more clear-eyed view of the women's economic circumstances and this data set was more robust: First off, over the years some women had stopped responding to the survey. The credit report data was still able to capture their information."}
{"original": "Plus, Miller had the idea of looking at the women's credit reports in the years before the abortion did (or didn't) happen. That way she could truly get a sense of whether the women who managed to get abortions were somehow already better off financially. They weren't."}
{"original": "Both groups of women, those who were turned away and the near-limit group who made it just before the gestational time limit to the clinic, look similar financially. A majority were in poverty, Miller said."}
{"original": "Because of their more tenuous financial circumstances, it wasn't surprising that they tended to show up later at an abortion clinic."}
{"original": "These women might take longer to put together the money for care or, especially with fewer and fewer clinics, to plan the logistics of getting to the facility and taking time off work. Fifty-eight percent of the women who were turned away said travel and procedure costs were causes for the delay."}
{"original": "(Another big reason women show up at clinics at later stages in their pregnancies is that it may take some time to even realize they're pregnant. This is particularly true for younger women.)"}
{"original": "Though they start out similarly, the women's economic fortunes started to diverge at the point where some were turned away from the clinic. Those women saw the amount of debt they had that was 30 days or more past due increase by 78% compared with the women who had accessed abortion."}
{"original": "The Turnaway Study also saw an 80% increase in what it called court actions, i.e., bankruptcies, evictions and tax liens."}
{"original": "You can't deny the economic consequences of reproductive access in health care, Miller said."}
{"original": "Miller and her co-authors also wondered if there was any difference in the financial stress faced by the women who were forced to carry their babies to term, compared with the financial stress of simply having a child."}
{"original": "They were able to track women who received abortions and went on later to have another child. They found that their financial picture was not nearly as bad as in the Turnaway Study group."}
{"original": "However, the sample size here was relatively small, and more research needs to be done in this area."}
{"original": "Part of why women want abortions is because they don't feel like they could carry to term and afford to have a child, Foster said. When they have a child later, they probably feel like they're in better shape."}
{"original": "Miller said that often women are turned away from clinics later in their pregnancy not simply because they're past the state's gestational limit but because the clinic doesn't have a doctor on staff who can handle the procedure later on in the pregnancy."}
{"original": "In some cases, clinics in states where abortion is permitted up to 20 weeks would have only a nurse practitioner available who could handle abortions only up to 10 weeks."}
{"original": "Yet the idea of improving conditions at abortion clinics around the country seems widely ambitious at a time when abortion access is increasingly imperiled."}
{"original": "Since 2010, a growing number of states have passed restrictions on access. From 2011 through 2019, states enacted 483 new abortion restrictions, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute. Those laws make up 40% of all the restrictions put in place by states since Roe v. Wade legalized the procedure nationally in 1973."}
{"original": "Some of the more common restrictions include mandated waiting periods (a big burden on time-strapped women), mandated counseling, parental notification or consent, limits on public funding (particularly harmful for lower-income women) and so-called TRAP laws that make it harder for clinics to operate. Last year, some states tried to ban abortion after just six weeks into a pregnancy ― when many women don't even know they're pregnant yet."}
{"original": "The ultimate aim of these laws is to challenge Roe v. Wade before a Supreme Court that now has a firm conservative majority, with Trump appointee Brett Kavanaugh recently added to the bench."}
{"original": "Some researchers say these recent moves have added an element of urgency to their work."}
{"original": "This couldn't be more timely, Miller said. Considering all these new restrictions, it's natural to want to understand the real-world consequences of these policies."}
{"original": "Considering that 1 in 4 women has an abortion during her lifetime, the effects of these restrictions could prove devastating."}
{"original": "The more things change, the more they stay the same. This year promises to be a busy one in Washington, with a new administration and Congress promising plenty of action and reform. Confirmation hearings, budget negotiations, tax and regulatory reform and a rumored infrastructure package all dot the map."}
{"original": "Somewhere in there, perhaps later in the year, is the appointment and confirmation of two new leaders to the Surface Transportation Board (STB). Putting nominee prognostications aside, two things are clear: the STB will soon have five members for the first time ever - with a 3-2 Republican tilt - and the Board, even though the rail industry has asked for a freeze to all major rulemakings, will pick up where it left off in considering a bevy of regulatory proposals."}
{"original": "To begin the year and this conversation, I'd like to showcase a pointed 2014 rebuttal of the most troubling of the wayward proposals - forced access - from former STB Chief of Staff Frank Wilner. It is a must-read for all current and potential Board members, dispelling many of the arguments for railroad re-regulation."}
{"original": "The takeaway, as supported from experts across the ideological spectrum, from Brookings to CEI, from labor to UPS, is that deregulation worked - profoundly - and that forced access should be avoided."}
{"original": "A recurring and intractable thread tying together railroad history is that when the choice has been between economic liberty and government intrusion, selecting the latter has repetitively discouraged capital investment, diminished service quality, adversely affected safety, and sooner than later caused hand-wringing among those most dependent on rail transportation."}
{"original": "Undeniably, policymakers have ample precedent for the detrimental effects of government dictating rail routes and pricing. So too, as Wilner notes, do the most vocal proponents of forced access."}
{"original": "Indeed, shippers with first-hand or studied knowledge of history understand painfully the flight of investment capital and rail service deterioration in the pre-1980 Staggers Act era when regulators substituted their decisions for arms-length negotiations between those buying and selling rail transportation."}
{"original": "The questionable efforts from the small sect of rail shippers is puzzling on multiple levels, particularly given the outsized role freight rail has in safely delivering their generally hazardous goods."}
{"original": "These hazmat shipper groups' assault on railroad rates and profits defies explanation, as it is railroad profits that make possible safety enhancing renewal of plant and equipment, which includes the costly design, development and implementation of Positive Train Control, and improved handling of the dangerous cargoes their members tender railroads."}
{"original": "Which is why Mr. Wilner rightly concludes the mission not only lacks an understanding of basic economics or past precedent, but also in the high fixed-cost nature of railroads. It disregards that there is ample competition - both within the rail sector and among other modes of transportation - and that imposing new regulations, as forced access supporters misleadingly advocate in the name of a free market, is in fact oxymoronic."}
{"original": "No matter how the shipper arguments are chopped, cubed, diced, minced, sliced, shredded or otherwise presented, the substitution of government fiat for market-based solutions will adversely affect traffic flows, swell the number of time-consuming and costly interline and yard switches of freight cars, reduce network reliability, and cause an overall reduction in service quality. Any immediate price reduction will be transient, at best."}
{"original": "The year ahead offers much excitement, and freight rail will be a part of much of the action. We hope that discussions can be more productive, focusing on how to make businesses and the tax code more competitive or improving a beleaguered regulatory system; not on advancing questionable policy at the direct behest of narrow yet powerful interests."}
{"original": "Mr. Wilner's column is a good place to start. Because while things may change, bad policy will always be bad policy."}
{"original": "TORONTO — The Ontario government is abandoning its plan to trim billions off the deficit this year so it can spend big on health care and tax deferrals as COVID-19 wreaks havoc on the province."}
{"original": "COVID-19 is an extraordinary threat to the health and economy of Ontario — the greatest we've faced in my lifetime — and it demands an extraordinary response from all levels of government and civil society because we're all in this together, Finance Minister Rod Phillips said in the legislature Wednesday."}
{"original": "He was supposed to unveil the Progressive Conservatives' second budget. But Phillips said the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 made economic forecasting impossible. So instead, he tabled an economic update and said a full budget will be introduced by mid-November."}
{"original": "The update details the PCs' $17-billion plan to respond to the crisis. It provides $10 billion for tax deferrals, $3.7 billion for social services and hydro discounts and $3.3 billion for the health-care system."}
{"original": "Andrew Francis Wallace/Toronto Star via Getty Images Finance Minister Rod Phillips speaks during question period at the Ontario legislature."}
{"original": "That $3.3 billion will create 500 new intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 1,000 new ward beds in Ontario's hospitals, the economic update said. Twenty thousand patients will also be moved out of hospitals to more appropriate locations."}
{"original": "Hundreds of millions of dollars will be injected into public health, long-term care homes, COVID-19 testing centres and personal protective equipment for health-care workers. A billion dollars will be set aside for a special coronavirus contingency fund."}
{"original": "One health-care organization said this emergency funding means Ontario is catching up."}
{"original": "The bottom line is that Ontario had fallen so far behind in terms of health care funding that the emergency announcements only now bring us close to where funding should have been ... before COVID-19, said Natalie Mehra, executive director of the Ontario Health Coalition, in a press release."}
{"original": "Researchers have said that the virus could overwhelm Ontario's hospitals as early as next week. Nine people with COVID-19 have already died in Ontario and 688 have tested positive as of Wednesday afternoon."}
{"original": "A government official answering journalists' questions on background said the promised hospital beds will come online on an ongoing basis but could not provide an exact date."}
{"original": "Earlier: Premier Doug Ford says buying food trumps paying rent amid COVID-19. Story continues after video."}
{"original": "A recent CBC investigation found many Ontario hospitals were already running at or over capacity even before the COVID-19 outbreak. Ford was elected in 2018 on a promise to end so-called hallway health care."}
{"original": "In 2019, ten former provincial health ministers said the Ford government's drastic cuts to public health would make it harder to prevent a disease outbreak. Ford ended up delaying the cuts so that they would no longer be retroactive."}
{"original": "Ontario's financial watchdog also warned that Ford's plan to eliminate the deficit could mean serious trade-offs for the health-care system."}
{"original": "In light of the current COVID-19 crisis, the government won't say when it plans to balance the budget."}
{"original": "It previously said that would happen in the 2023/24 fiscal year. But it also said the deficit would only stand at $6.8 billion in 2020 — now, this year's deficit will be $20.5 billion."}
{"original": "The bulk of the government's $17-billion spending plan will go to provide temporary tax relief."}
{"original": "The province will defer property taxes for individuals and businesses, and defer taxes and Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) costs for businesses at a cost of $10 billion.

{"original": "LAS VEGAS ― Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg emerged from behind the protective shield of a $300 million-plus advertising blitz on Wednesday night, stepping into the limelight of a nationally televised debate alongside five rivals spoiling for a fight."}
{"original": "The result wasn't pretty. The media and financial services mogul got pummeled in the presidential debate over his record of allegedly sexist comments and behavior, his racist policing practices, his failure to release his tax returns, his support for Republicans, and his efforts to buy his way into the Democratic primary."}
{"original": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) led the charge, delivering a haymaker in her opening remarks."}
{"original": "I'd like to talk about who we're running against, a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. And no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg, Warren said, prompting audible gasps from the audience at the Paris Theater."}
{"original": "Bloomberg's alleged treatment of women went on to become the richest source of material for his adversaries."}
{"original": "Moderator Hallie Jackson initiated the biggest fireworks of the night when she asked Bloomberg to explain his comments defending allegations from former female employees who say he created a hostile work environment. Bloomberg, she noted, reportedly defended some of his sexist comments by saying, That's the way I grew up, and allegedly told one former female employee, I would do you in a second."}
{"original": "Bloomberg was visibly flustered, asking for his full minute and a quarter to respond. But he did not address the specific claims, instead falling back on figures demonstrating the success of women in his corporate empire."}
{"original": "I am very proud of the fact that about two weeks ago, we were voted the best place to work ― the second-best place in America, he said. If that doesn't say something about our employees and how happy they are, I don't know what does."}
{"original": "Jackson turned to Warren, noting that the senator had been especially critical of Bloomberg."}
{"original": "I hope you heard what his defense was: 'I've been nice to some women,' she said, prompting loud applause and cheers from the crowd."}
{"original": "Mario Tama/Getty Images Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg was on the defensive for much of the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday night."}
{"original": "Warren went on to ask Bloomberg whether he would commit to releasing former female employees from the nondisclosure agreements he had required them to sign."}
{"original": "Bloomberg did not, but struggled to give a reason. That's up to them, he said. (It's not.)"}
{"original": "We are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who has who knows how many nondisclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against, Warren said."}
{"original": "Former Vice President Joe Biden joined Warren in calling on Bloomberg to release the women from their NDAs."}
{"original": "Let's get something straight here, Biden said. It's easy: All the mayor has to do is say, 'You are released from the nondisclosure agreements.'"}
{"original": "When it came to Bloomberg's tax returns, which the candidate has yet to release, his explanations were similarly sheepish. It just takes us a long time, he said, eliciting gasps from the audience. I can't go to TurboTax."}
{"original": "Bloomberg promised to release the tax returns as soon as they are ready, saying they would be made public in the coming weeks."}
{"original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made sure to remind the audience that Bloomberg supported then-President George W. Bush's reelection, as well as Republican control of the Senate, in 2004."}
{"original": "Later, when Sanders asked to explain why he opposes the mere existence of billionaires, the senator pointed to Bloomberg. The former mayor is reported to be worth an estimated $60 billion."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans, Sanders said. That's wrong. That's immoral."}
{"original": "Bloomberg, who opposes the wealth tax that Sanders and Warren hope to levy but insists he does want to see the rich contribute more, defended his earnings."}
{"original": "Yes, he replied enthusiastically when asked whether he deserved his wealth. I worked very hard for it. And I'm giving it away."}
{"original": "For former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Bloomberg occupied a place previously reserved for Biden: He was the foil for Buttigieg's image as the happy medium between the party's left and right ideological poles."}
{"original": "Buttigieg pleaded with the public not to winnow down the field to two candidates whom he said were uniquely polarizing and not rooted in the Democratic Party. Sanders remains an independent who caucuses with Democrats, and Bloomberg was a Republican before becoming an independent and then a Democrat in 2018."}
{"original": "We shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out, Buttigieg said."}
{"original": "The debate, which was by far the most contentious meeting of the primary, contained its fair share of other skirmishes. Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar exchanged blows over their respective qualifications for higher office, as well as some of Klobuchar's controversial votes. And, of course, the field of candidates slugged it out over Medicare for All for the umpteenth time, with the moderates pointing to Warren's and Sanders' support for single-payer health care as bad policy and politics."}
{"original": "But the overwhelming theme of the night was who would be most electable against Trump. And whatever their differences, with their relentless attacks on Bloomberg and his less-than-stellar responses, Bloomberg's rivals united to make the case that it was not him."}
{"original": "After the debate, Howard Wolfson, an adviser to Bloomberg's campaign, argued to reporters that Bloomberg should be graded on a curve since it was his first presidential debate. I think it's fair to say he got better as the night went on, he said"}
{"original": "Bloomberg's campaign also sought to spin his performance as a sign of the impact his candidacy has had."}
{"original": "You know you are a winner when you are drawing attacks from all the candidates, campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said in a statement. Everyone came to destroy Mike tonight. It didn't happen. Everyone wanted him to lose his cool. He didn't do it. He was the grownup in the room."}
{"original": "And even as Warren drew the most blood from Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor's campaign continues to want to turn the primary into a head-to-head matchup between Bloomberg and Sanders."}
{"original": "Bloomberg's campaign argued in a memo reported about on Wednesday that Bloomberg was the candidate best equipped to defeat Sanders and that other candidates needed to drop out in order to stop Sanders."}
{"original": "Sheekey reiterated the campaign's hopes of framing the primary as a head-to-head contest again after the debate."}
{"original": "Tonight, Mike Bloomberg presented himself as the leading alternative to Bernie Sanders, he said. Everyone came to get under Mike's skin, but instead Mike got under Bernie's."}
{"original": "Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir welcomed a brawl with Bloomberg."}
{"original": "I welcome them making whatever contrast they'd like, Shakir said. His contrast that he wants to draw with us is much like the contrast Donald Trump wants to draw: 'I'm a billionaire. I can't be bought. But, by the way, all of my friends are all billionaires. I'm out of touch with the working class of America.'"}
{"original": "Watch your wallets. Republicans are pushing a new corporate tax plan that will end up costing most of you a bundle. Here's what you should know about the so-called border adjustment tax."}
{"original": "The U.S. imports about $2.7 trillion worth of goods a year. Many imports are cheap because labor costs are much lower in places like Southeast Asia."}

{"original": "Drazen Zigic via Getty Images Wages are stagnant and home prices keep rising."}
{"original": "Striving to move up the housing ladder is a fundamental aspect of the American Dream, but the lack of wage growth over the past year has been a significant hurdle for millions of Americans."}
{"original": "New home sales unexpectedly fell for the third straight month in December, dropping by 0.4%, according to the Commerce Department (economists polled by Reuters expected new home sales to rise 1.5%)."}
{"original": "When central banks cut interest rates, it typically encourages people to buy houses, since it makes mortgages more affordable and stimulates demand to build new homes. The Fed cut rates three times in 2019, and held rates steady in its first policy-setting meeting of 2020, keeping rates in the current target range of 1.50% to 1.75%."}
{"original": "So why aren't lower rates – mortgage rates have been hovering at around 3.7% – boosting new home sales?"}
{"original": "Wages have remained relatively flat for most workers, with the pace of hourly wage growth sliding below 3% in December for the first time since July 2018. Yet the price of new homes remains elevated with the median price for a new home climbing to $331,400, up 0.5% from a year ago. A shortage of homes on the market has also served to keep home prices high. (The U.S. housing market is short 3.8 million new homes, according to a new Realtor.com analysis.)"}
{"original": "Many Americans who can't afford to buy a home are sticking to renting. We've seen an incredible amount of demand for apartments and rentals as people have gotten burned from home price losses from back in 2008, 2009, Hessam Nadji, CEO of Marcus & Millichap, told Yahoo Finance."}
{"original": "And the new generation wants to be more flexible and more mobile. They prefer to rent. All of our apartment investors have benefitted from that across the country, he said."}
{"original": "Trump's tax law reduced home buying incentive"}
{"original": "The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the amount homeowners can deduct from interest paid on their mortgages to up to $750,000 worth of principal, making the tax break for owning a home less compelling."}
{"original": "A young couple or single adult professional that may have gotten a tax break by buying a home, now really doesn't need that tax break as much because the tax law changed. They're more likely to stay in a rental apartment, said Nadji. And the same thing with middle class, or midtier homeowner that would have normally stepped up to the next pricing tier and the deductibility above $1 million of mortgage, of course, went way down."}
{"original": "Low interest rates, though, have provided a small boost to sales of existing homes, which represent about 90% of U.S. home sales. Previously owned home sales jumped 10% year-over-year in December."}
{"original": "New homes are naturally more expensive than existing homes and so affordability becomes even a bigger factor, said Nadji, adding, especially as people stay in their rental housing longer which is what they're doing and are less incentivized to buy new homes than they have been in other cycles."}
{"original": "This entry has been co-written with Dr. Heikki Koskenkylä and Dr. Peter Nyberg."}
{"original": "The 1st of January 2017 marked the 18th anniversary of the European common currency, the euro. Despite its success from 1999 to 2007, after 2008 the euro has become a burden for many of its members. For example, living standards in Italy and Greece are below the levels when they joined the euro. Finland is the only Nordic country using the euro and it is also the only Nordic country which has not yet recovered from the financial crash of 2008."}
{"original": "There have been many proposals on how to fix the euro and the EMU, but they are politically unpopular and unrealistic. In this blog-entry, we will argue that the euro will almost surely fail; we just do not know the exact timing of its demise."}
{"original": "Problems of the euro are structural and persistent"}
{"original": "The problem of the euro can be visualized in the development of the GDP per capita (see Figure 1). Germany has been successful in the Eurozone, while Greece and Italy have not. France is not doing well either. The jury is still out for Finland."}
{"original": "Figure 1. Source: European Commission, Ameco database"}
{"original": "The different growth paths are a symptom of a general problem that has haunted currency unions for centuries. Competitiveness and productivity develop at a different pace in different countries. Over time, this leads to large competitiveness differences among the members of a currency union. These differences do not usually pose a problem during economic booms, because strengthening aggregate demand supports ailing fields of production. However, when a currency union faces an economic downturn or a crisis, falling aggregate demand hits less competitive industries and countries hard and the financing costs of less competitive countries jump. This is an asymmetric shock."}
{"original": "The detrimental effects of asymmetric shocks can be mitigated by transferring funds from prosperous to declining member states. When the dollar union of the US threatened to fall apart during the Great Depression, federal government enacted federal income transfers from prosperous states to aid ailing ones. The federal budget also increased rapidly and, in practice, income transfers became permanent. The no bailout policy of crisis-hit states had already been enacted earlier."}
{"original": "According to the ECB, competitiveness of the German economy has improved by around 19.3 percent, Greece's competitiveness has improved by around 6.5 percent, France's around 3.9 percent, Finland's around 1.7 percent and Italy's around 0.9 percent since 1999 . Thus, the differences in competitiveness are large. For survival in its present form and size the Eurozone needs a similar income transfer system, that is, a full political union as in the US."}
{"original": "There is no European-wide polling data on a political union, but it appears that the support for the EU is diminishing in its core. In a recent survey, 40 percent of Finns wanted to leave the EU. Also, only 53 percent of Dutch are against a new referendum on the EU, which means that 47 percent are either for it or do not know their stand. For permanent income transfers, you would need to change the Maastricht Treaty and ratify it in each member country or to negotiate several bilateral agreements. There is only a very small likelihood that these would go through, for example, in Finland and in the Netherlands."}
{"original": "Because there is no public support for a federal European Union, many have envisaged alternative ways to fix the euro. The CEO of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Klaus Regling has proposed that euro could be saved by a combination of the banking and capital market union and a rainy day fund. This fund would allegedly be used when asymmetric shocks occur. The fund would be financed jointly by all euro countries. However, because of the persistent differences in competitiveness, its transfers would become permanent, like in the US. Only the most competitive members of the Eurozone would have sufficient income to finance the fund. Any financing through the European Central Bank (ECB), would need to be covered by European tax-payers later, when it would become evident that weaker countries are unable to pay back their loans and when seigniorage revenues would be unable to cover the losses of the ECB."}
{"original": "Thus, in practice, there are only two ways to fix the euro: A far-reaching political union proposed in the Five President's report in 2015 or returning to the system described in the Maastricht Treaty, where member states would be responsible for their own economies only (no bail-out)."}
{"original": "In a full political union, there would be concentration of economic policy decision making and it would require major structural changes in the Eurozone and its member countries. Tax and social policies would be unified, labor unions would be dismantled or unified as a European-wide system, a European debt relief system and banking union would be set up. These would ensure the flexibility of wages, prices and labor agreements and guarantee convergence of competitiveness and living standards. This could work, in theory. But, the likelihood of getting all the member states to agree that their wages, debt and living conditions would be negotiated at the European level is extremely small."}
{"original": "Returning to the Maastricht Treaty and to the no bail-out rule would mean that persistent differences in living standards and market based debt restructurings would be enacted. ESM and the European Financial Stability Facility would be wound down after their current programs would end. ECB support (QE and OMT) programs would stop. This would lead to the default of Greece and its likely exit from the euro. In the long-run, asymmetric shocks and persistent income differences would be likely to force several additional countries to leave the euro."}
{"original": "The Eurozone is in a stalemate. A federal union would be needed to fix its problems, but there is no public support for it. Returning to national fiscal responsibility would lead to defaults and exits. Half-way solutions will prove insufficient but expensive and obfuscate the issues. Therefore, there may be no way to avert the partial or complete break-up of the Eurozone in the years to come. The fate of the euro may already have been sealed."}
{"original": "Here's how to plan the wedding of your dreams — without going into debt."}
{"original": "Your wedding will likely be the biggest party you've ever hosted — and the priciest. The average U.S. wedding costs $26,522 for 135 guests, according to the 2016 Brides American Wedding Study. Nearly half of couples cover the entire expense themselves, while an additional 25 percent pay for at least part of it. But here's the kicker: One in three couples goes over budget! Make sure you're not one of them by setting a realistic wedding budget — before you start fantasizing about venues in Italy, booking expensive vendors, or trying on designer dresses."}
{"original": "To make a wedding budget, you'll need to tally up your savings, maintain a detailed spreadsheet so you don't go over during the planning process, prepare for unexpected costs, as well as make meaningful cuts if you do exceed your total budget. It's hard work, we know, but putting in the time and energy now ensures you'll live happily ever after (wedding-debt free)."}
{"original": "How much you have to spend on the wedding is directly proportional to three sources of money: you and your fiancé's individual savings; the amount you can set aside from your current income; plus any contributions from parents or loved ones. Here's how to approach each:"}
{"original": "Your savings: This isn't as simple as checking your bank account. Ideally, you and your partner each have three months of living expenses set aside in case of a job loss or health setback (separate from retirement funds). Subtract that in-case-of-emergency amount from your total balance in the bank, and that's how much you could put toward wedding costs."}
{"original": "Your monthly income: After you've made payments for existing debts, like student loans, set aside up to 10 percent of your earnings each month. Establish direct deposits into a separate account for wedding expenses so it isn't just leftovers that get saved, says Erin Lowry, a personal-finance expert and the author of Broke Millennial: Stop Scraping By and Get Your Financial Life Together."}
{"original": "Any contributions from your parents: Never assume your parents or other loved ones are willing and able to help cover the cost of a wedding, says Lowry. But it certainly doesn't hurt to ask."}
{"original": "See More: The 50 Most Beautiful Wedding Cakes Ever"}
{"original": "Create a spreadsheet with three expense columns: Estimated, Modified, and Actual. Amounts under Estimated will be driven by research of costs in your area (check sites like Weddingwire and Thumbtack to find local averages for venues and vendors), proposals from the vendors you choose will go in Modified, and the final amount you pay them will go in Actual."}
{"original": "Adjust your estimates after calling in vendors' costs. Start with the venue because it's the biggest piece of the wedding pie and a major factor in determining guest count. When vendors give you estimates, verify if tax is included. If not, do the math yourself with state and local tax rates to adjust the proposal."}
{"original": "Add a column for the estimated tip. Write included if gratuity is factored into the vendor's price. (For example, caterers automatically tack on 15 to 20 percent of the total, which you pay in advance.)"}
{"original": "Add a line item called Extras that equals 15 percent of your total budget to cushion for things you'll likely forget (invitation postage, parking valets) or won't anticipate in advance (corkage and plating fees). Never spend this money up front; you'll need it throughout the planning process as incidentals arise. Trust."}
{"original": "Before you sign on the dotted line of vendor contracts or start buying gift bag items, read the fine print, because expenses that seem small early on could add up quickly. If the total of the line item isn't in your overall budget, cut it!"}
{"original": "Vendor Transportation: Hiring an out-of-town band or photographer? You might need to pay for a rental van or plane tickets. Double-check the contract to see what exactly is covered."}

{"original": "Daily life is a far cry from what it was just a year ago. The coronavirus pandemic drastically changed how we lived, learned and worked in 2020. And various relief programs were established to help those who suffered from business shutdowns and cuts to their income."}
{"original": "Most of these changes sought to provide relief to individuals and families by providing options for enduring a period of time where incomes may have been drastically cut back or eliminated and the economy on Main Street appeared to be suffering, said Jeffrey Wood, a certified public accountant and partner at Lift Financial."}
{"original": "Between these relief programs and major lifestyle changes, some people may find that their tax situation was negatively impacted for 2020. To avoid any surprises when you file taxes this year, here's a look at common situations that could cause your tax bill to increase in light of the pandemic."}
{"original": "One of the major provisions of the CARES Act was increasing unemployment insurance benefits to include an additional $600 for the first 13 weeks of the pandemic. These expanded benefits were extended for another 11 weeks after the initial period passed."}
{"original": "It's important to note that unemployment benefits are considered taxable income. Depending on how much you earned in 2019 ― and how long you had a job in 2020 ― it's possible that you earned more income overall last year with the addition of unemployment benefits."}
{"original": "Some may discover they have a higher tax liability for 2020 due to these changes, Wood said. If you didn't elect to have taxes withheld from your unemployment checks, you'll need to pay them at tax time."}
{"original": "You Withdrew From Your Retirement Account Early"}
{"original": "Another change within the 2020 CARES Act was that individuals younger than age 59 1/2 could take distributions from a qualified retirement plan through Dec. 30 without having to pay early withdrawal penalties."}
{"original": "This distribution could be considered a loan and paid back over the next three years, or it could be a taxable distribution with the tax liability spread over the next three years, Wood explained."}
{"original": "Until this distribution is paid back, it is required to be recognized as taxable income and would increase an individual's taxable income for 2020 and potentially the next two years thereafter, Wood said. If paid back, you would need to amend your tax filings from prior year(s) to recover any taxes that you already paid."}
{"original": "You Worked Remotely In A Different State"}
{"original": "Many workers who were lucky enough to keep their jobs began working remotely during the pandemic. Some saw this as an opportunity to relocate somewhere with a lower cost of living, which, in some cases, meant moving out of state."}
{"original": "However, employees who worked in two different states during 2020 may be in for a surprise at tax time."}
{"original": "It can bring some tax challenges that folks might not be aware of, said Jason Katz, wealth advisor and principal at Bartlett Wealth Management. For instance, in addition to filing taxes in their state of residence, employees may need to file returns and perhaps even pay taxes in the state where their employer is located, even if they're working remotely, Katz said."}
{"original": "This will depend on the state, how much time you spend there and how much you earned. Some states have reciprocal agreements with each other to minimize duplicative taxes for employees in this situation."}
{"original": "The job market took a major blow from the pandemic. Perhaps you lost your job or had your hours cut. Maybe you worried that your income could change at any time. Maybe you simply felt it was the right time to start your own venture or side hustle."}
{"original": "If you started a business or went freelance over the last year, you should get in touch with a tax professional as soon as possible to talk about the taxes you owe and when they're due, according to Katz. There's a good chance you need to pay estimated taxes every quarter. You could face fines if you don't pay on time, he said. It's also a good idea to discuss what kind of business entity, if any, makes the most sense from a taxation perspective."}
{"original": "If you were already a business owner before the pandemic, your tax situation could look a lot different for 2020. Business owners and independent contractors may feel a tax change due to the shift to a stay-at-home, online, remote-working economy, Wood said."}
{"original": "For example, business owners who may have had lots of travel, hotel and mileage costs to write off in prior years may find these deductions are much smaller and less frequent for 2020, given shutdown orders and social distancing recommendations. Deductions for business meals likely decreased dramatically, as many restaurants shut down for parts of the year or were otherwise limited in their ability to serve customers."}
{"original": "In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act applied a 50% limitation on deductibility of food and beverage expenses after Dec. 31, 2017, and virtually eliminated deductions for business entertainment expenses, further reducing the amount that could have been deducted to reduce tax liability, Wood added. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 changed this tax law and allows the full deduction for business meals and entertainment in 2021 and 2022, he said."}
{"original": "Your Employer Withheld Social Security Taxes"}
{"original": "Back in August, the Trump administration offered businesses a voluntary payroll tax holiday. In order to increase workers' paychecks during the toughest months of the pandemic, employers could opt to defer withholding of the 6.2% Social Security tax from the paychecks of employees who earn less than $4,000 per biweekly period, from Sept. 1 through Dec. 31"}
{"original": "The catch? Deferral is the key word here, said Jim Pendergast, senior vice president of altLINE, a division of The Southern Bank Co. Those taxes need to be paid back ― from your paycheck."}
{"original": "These taxes originally would have to be back paid between January through April of 2021, with penalties accruing starting in May, Pendergast explained. However, last-minute legislation in December postponed payment deadlines until Dec. 31, 2021."}
{"original": "I'm fortunate to live comfortably without any major money worries. But I don't have any delusions about being wealthy, either. I have popcorn ceilings, furniture from Craigslist and a special drawer in the kitchen where I save extra fast-food utensils, napkins and condiment packets."}
{"original": "In other words, I do not need to worry about Joe Biden's tax plan."}
{"original": "Yet plenty of regular Joes like myself seem to think the Democratic president-elect's plan to raise taxes on Americans earning more than $400,000 per year will somehow affect their bottom line. And Twitter is not having it."}
{"original": "Only 1.8% of U.S. taxpayers earn enough money to see higher taxes under Biden's proposal. For everyone else, here are some hilarious and brutally honest reminders from Twitter that there's no need to be concerned."}

{"original": "Republican lawmakers suddenly have a lot of thoughts on how to heal the nation ― and none of them has to do with addressing the insurrection that Donald Trump's supporters mounted at the U.S. Capitol two weeks ago in an attempt to overturn election results."}
{"original": "GOP legislators have been reluctant to accept their own responsibility for stoking massive divisions in the country. But in the two days since President Joe Biden took office, Senate and House members have been twisting his call for unity into attacks on his agenda."}
{"original": "In his inaugural address Wednesday, Biden called on Americans to come together to confront the rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism, in order to restore the soul and to secure the future of America."}
{"original": "We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury, the president added, standing on the same platform where pro-Trump rioters had invaded the Capitol on Jan. 6."}
{"original": "In response, Republican lawmakers are arguing that Biden's policies will only hurt unity. In other words, according to these lawmakers, the only way to heal the nation after a violent mob tried to overturn an election that put Democrats in power, is to do exactly what Republicans want."}
{"original": "Here are some of the policies that Republicans have claimed would undermine national unity:"}
{"original": "Bob Strong/Reuters Biden wants to restore more generous boundaries for Bears Ears National Monument in the Four Corners region of Utah."}
{"original": "As part of a broader first-day executive order to protect public health and the environment and restore science, Biden ordered a review of Trump's rollbacks of national monuments ― a first step toward his own promise to restore the sites."}
{"original": "Ten Utah Republicans, including Sen. Mitt Romney and Gov. Spencer Cox, issued a joint statement this week decrying the move, saying it will only deepen divisions in this country."}
{"original": "For over 25 years Utah has been the center of controversial and divisive unilateral national monument decisions. ... A review in name only with predetermined results, which ultimately leads to a unilateral executive order enlarging the monuments' boundaries, will not solve the root of the problem and will only deepen divisions in this country, they said."}
{"original": "Republicans invoking national monuments ― in particular, Bears Ears in Utah ― in their newfound wish for harmony is ludicrous."}
{"original": "In 2017, following a sham review in which the Trump administration cozied up to monument opponents, cherry-picked data and dismissed overwhelming public support for maintaining protected sites, Trump carved more than 2 million acres away from two sites in southern Utah."}
{"original": "Bears Ears, a landscape sacred to several area Native American tribes that is named after a pair of buttes, was shrunk by 85%. Nearby Grand Staircase-Escalante, a sweeping 1.87-million-acre monument rich in dinosaur fossils and archeological sites, was cut roughly in half. Later, in June 2020, Trump opened the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, a 4,900-square-mile protected site off the East Coast, to commercial fishing."}
{"original": "The 10 Republican critics made no mention of the five tribes that had petitioned the Obama administration to grant Bears Ears monument status and felt betrayed by Trump's rollback. After dismantling several federally protected land and water monuments, including one that honored Native American cultural heritage, Trump turned around and threatened up to 10 years in prison for anyone who vandalized or destroyed a monument to a slave-owning president or leader of the Confederacy."}

{"original": "On his first day in office, Biden issued a temporary moratorium on oil and gas drilling on federal lands."}
{"original": "Halting fossil fuel development in Alaska's pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in the middle of a rapidly worsening global climate crisis? That would go against healing the nation, Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) said. Sullivan immediately called the move divisive."}
{"original": "In his inaugural address, President Biden called for national unity and healing. However, just hours earlier, his administration took their cues from radical environmentalists in issuing punitive and divisive actions against Alaska, many other resource development states, and whole sectors of our economy, Sullivan said in a statement."}
{"original": "There's some added hypocrisy in Sullivan's comments about unity here. Biden's moratorium reverses a policy that was slipped into the 2017 tax law — a bill that Republicans crafted behind closed doors without any bipartisan input and passed without a single vote of support from Democrats."}
{"original": "To make their case for opening the Arctic refuge to oil drilling, the Trump administration and its Republican allies repeatedly touted the potential for this fossil fuel development to generate $1.8 billion in federal revenue over a decade. But when the administration held the long-awaited lease sale ― on Jan. 6 as the Capitol was being stormed by pro-Trump extremists ― it generated a paltry $14.4 million in bids, less than 1% of the administration's total revenue estimates."}
{"original": "Other GOP lawmakers echoed this unity complaint when deriding Biden's other early environmental policies, like revoking a crucial permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline and reentering the Paris climate agreement."}
{"original": "It was really ironic that he's talking one thing, one game, over here about unity, Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) said in a video posted to Twitter.

{"original": "But the vast majority of GOP lawmakers don't want to convict Trump of inciting the mob in a Senate trial.

{"original": "I think they realize that we're all dependent on the internet for so many aspects of our lives."}
{"original": "In fact, many of Canada's major media companies have said that the life-blood of their industry — money — is flowing through the internet to unregulated foreign rivals and to illegal websites that haven't paid for content rights."}

{"original": "But Geist — an advocate of net neutrality that doesn't give preference to one content provider over another — said the anti-piracy coalition hasn't made a convincing case for giving the CRTC a mandate to block websites."}
{"original": "For one thing, Geist said, Canada's copyright law provides some of the strongest anti-piracy rules in the world."}
{"original": "For another, he added, the CRTC and the proposed Independent Piracy Review Agency shouldn't be empowered to order internet service providers to block websites that are alleged to be content pirates."}
{"original": "In Geist's opinion, the regulator doesn't have the expertise to make judgement calls about the legality of content online because that invariably involves disputes over copyright, intellectual property, hate crimes and defamation."}
{"original": "It's courts that are far better suited to be able to weigh the evidence and make those decisions, he said."}

{"original": "The experience to date is that this represents an tremendous opportunity, not a risk."}
{"original": "What is America's most egregious consumer fraud? Donald Trump, populist."}
{"original": "Today, Trump proclaimed in his inaugural address, we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people. He then filled his administration with billionaires, lobbyists and ideologues in thrall to Republican donors, consigning his legislative agenda to the plutocrats' pet, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Left for his base were misbegotten trade wars, white identity politics scapegoating immigrants and minorities, and sulfurous attacks on their perceived cultural enemies."}
{"original": "These diversions obscure the scope of Trump's betrayal. The firing of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin ― the apparent prelude to a privatization scheme for veterans' care ginned by the Koch brothers ― is but the latest example."}
{"original": "The heart of Trump's agenda is the plutocratic craving for tax cuts and disdain for governmental efforts to protect the environment, regulate financial institutions, preserve unions and maintain a social safety net for ordinary Americans. Supported by the donor class, Trump is waging an aggressive war against the economic interests and security of the very people who elected him. His pseudo-populism is the plutocrats' Trojan horse."}
{"original": "For wealthy Trump supporters, income inequality is not a worry ― it's a richly deserved reflection of their achievements. The pressing needs of others ― education and job retraining for those displaced by the new economy; affordable college for the children of struggling families ― matter not. Though the uber-rich are few, the unrestrained free-for-all that is our campaign finance system empowers them to purchase public policy."}
{"original": "And they do. Roughly 40 percent of all campaign contributions during 2016 came from .01 percent of the adult population. The GOP ruling class is exemplified by the Koch brothers ― whose political dependent, Mike Pence, is Trump's vice president, and whose former chief fundraiser, Marc Short, is Trump's legislative director. For them, stoking racial and cultural resentments among the base is simply a cheap recruiting tool, providing votes for politicians who, like Trump, advance their narrow interests."}
{"original": "December's tax bill demonstrates their stranglehold on both the president and his party ― perfectly illuminating plutocracy in action. Why, after all, did virtually every GOP congressman ― and all 52 Republican senators ― support a bill that trashes their stated commitment to fiscal prudence? And why did Trump push it with such unwonted industry?"}
{"original": "Simple. As Rep. Chris Collins (R.-N.Y.) admitted: My donors are basically saying, 'Get it done or don't ever call me again.' If Republicans failed to pass this bill, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) predicted, the financial contributions will stop."}
{"original": "To rationalize their obeisance, Trump and the GOP recycled the empirically discredited claim that massive tax cuts pay for themselves. No credible independent analyst believes this. What the cuts will do, over time, is shift our tax burden onto ordinary Americans while benefiting the top 1 percent ― who already control 40 percent of our wealth."}
{"original": "Carlos Barria / Reuters President Donald Trump shakes hands with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis) as Republicans celebrate the passage of a sweeping tax cut bill last December."}
{"original": "A salient example is Trump himself, who will garner millions of dollars from individual tax cuts and whose family will gain millions more from tax breaks for real estate ventures and a doubling of the estate tax exemption. In a seriocomically Dickensian counterpoint, Ryan cited the secretary in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, whose weekly $1.50 increase in take-home pay would cover her Costco membership. Let them eat cake ― in bulk."}
{"original": "Unlike Ryan's grateful secretary, wealthy Americans can cut their own taxes simply by incorporating to exploit the drastically reduced corporate tax rate. Overall, middle-class taxpayers will get a ― temporary ― tax cut of about $900; the top 1 percent an average cut of over $50,000. And by undercutting the Affordable Care Act, the tax bill increased the cost of health insurance for millions of Americans while diminishing the quality of coverage. Little wonder Republicans jammed it through Congress without a single hearing."}
{"original": "Like a sorcerer's apprentice, this ill-considered wealth transfer conjures a host of fiscal calamities. It turbocharges income inequality ― adding at least $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years and thereby saddling future generations with crippling debt. It casts our creditworthiness into doubt, potentially raising our interest rates ― which, in turn, would make servicing our debt costlier, diminishing the government's ability to pay for other budgetary needs. The result could be economic stagnation ― or worse."}
{"original": "Selling off the government is Trump's modus operandi."}
{"original": "The subsequent budget deal, passed in February, magnifies this maleficence, producing trillion dollar deficits with no end in sight. Such a staggering shortfall starves spending for Medicaid, food stamps, educational programs, childcare, disability programs and Head Start. It renders Trump's surviving semi-populist program ― infrastructure spending ― dead on arrival for lack of federal money. And it licenses Republicans to insist they must redress yawning deficits by attacking that bête noire of its donor class ― Social Security and Medicare."}
{"original": "Altogether, Trump's economic agenda is an X-ray of hypocrisy in the service of plutocracy. Corporations, Trump assured us, would use the money generated by tax cuts to raise wages and create new jobs. Instead, they are spending on stock buybacks which enrich wealthy shareholders ― including, not incidentally, the corporate chiefs who ordered the buybacks."}
{"original": "Equally pleasing to plutocrats and corporations is Trump's scorched earth attack on regulations designed to protect ordinary Americans, conducted by a handpicked army of extraordinary Americans ― erstwhile representatives of industries seeking to eradicate governmental oversight while funneling millions to Trump and his party."}
{"original": "A vivid illustration of how money lubricates deregulation is provided, appropriately, by the oil and gas industry. After underwriting over 10 percent of Trump's $107 million inaugural fund, the payoff was immediate ― Trump flooded the Environmental Protection Agency with unqualified political janissaries inimical to its mission, spearheaded by an unqualified and hostile director, Scott Pruitt."}
{"original": "Pool via Getty Images Trump greeted Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, as the president prepared to sign an executive order in March 2017 reversing Obama-era climate change policies."}
{"original": "Pruitt is the quintessential environmental saboteur ― an ardent climate change denier and creature of the fossil fuel industry. As Oklahoma's attorney general, he sued the EPA 14 times while, as emails obtained by The New York Times confirm, he closely coordinated with major oil and gas producers, electric utilities and political groups with ties to the [Koch brothers] to roll back environmental regulations."}
{"original": "As EPA director, he is gutting its enforcement capacity; triggering an exodus of environmental scientists; expelling expert consultants deemed insufficiently sympathetic to industry; seeding its website with misinformation, and consulting with industry representatives in meetings designed to leave no paper trail."}
{"original": "Nothing captures Pruitt's political and moral bankruptcy better than his sweetheart rental deal with the wife of a lobbyist for the petroleum industry ― $50 a night for a prime location on Capitol Hill, a fraction of the going market rate, due only when Pruitt slept there. This as climate and weather-related disasters, including wildfires and hurricanes, killed 362 people in 2017 while causing $306 billion in damage."}
{"original": "But selling off the government is Trump's modus operandi. His Food and Drug Administration chief has battled the agency on behalf of the drug industry. His Federal Communications Commission chairman repealed net neutrality regulations, creating a class system which damages consumers while benefiting telecom conglomerates. At the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, archconservative Mick Mulvaney has killed restrictions on abusive payday lenders."}
{"original": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, formerly an investor in for-profit colleges and student debt collectors, now hamstrings oversight of predatory and fraudulent for-profit colleges like Trump University that cheat unwary students ― including veterans ― of millions in federal aid dollars while unleashing student debt collectors to harass them."}
{"original": "Nor have Trump and the GOP ignored the tender sensibilities of financiers offended by Dodd-Frank, passed to curb the financial excesses which precipitated the calamity of 2008. They now are softening or eliminating key safeguards of that legislation ― among other things, by exempting smaller banks from the ban against trading risky securities and loosening the capital requirements for all but the very largest banks. Should history repeat itself, many more Americans could face financial ruin."}
{"original": "The Washington Post via Getty Images Trump surrounded by members of his cabinet in March 2017."}
{"original": "Predictably, Trump has targeted another adversary loathed by right-wing plutocrats ― labor unions. At the National Labor Relations Board, Slate reports, Trump's appointees have reversed policies that helped smaller unions organize, bolstered the bargaining rights of franchise employees, and shielded workers from union-busting tactics."}
{"original": "But Trump's anti-labor coup de grace was appointing Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Pending there are two cases critical to workers' rights. One could eviscerate the negotiating and political power of public employee unions selected by the majority of their members by barring the collection of mandatory dues. In the other, businesses seek to roll back protections for low-wage and nonunion workers."}
{"original": "In both cases Gorsuch is expected to be the deciding vote. Little wonder that his candidacy was advanced by the Federalist Society, an organization funded by wealthy donors determined to populate the courts with ideologues who expressly share their contempt for unions and government regulation."}
{"original": "In the end, the quintessential plutocrat equates governance with the venal pursuit of self-enrichment ― peerlessly personified by the Trump family, which is relentless in its voracious exploitation of power and position to amass yet more money, conflicts of interest be damned. That Trump's administration is awash in petty grifters ripping off taxpayer dollars confirms the power of his example."}

{"original": "A black man's relationship with his barber is unmatched. The latest episode of Atlanta makes that clear when Paper Boi, through a series of shenanigans that put them both in legal jeopardy, remains loyal to Bibby ― his Bluetooth-wearing, toothpick-chewing, slick-talking barber."}
{"original": "Barbershop, the fifth episode of Season 2, opens with Paper Boi waiting for Bibby to arrive at the shop. In true black barber fashion, he's late. The rapper has been sitting in the chair for God knows how long, a fact made evident by the exasperation on his face. When Bibby finally walks in, dressed like your uncle who sells Vector Knives and flips tax refunds, he wants to do everything but cut Paper Boi's hair: talk on the phone, eat, watch viral videos ― you name it (Shirley Caesar voice). When a woman only known as 💦🍑, the name saved in his phone, calls, he asks Paper Boi, who has a lopsided haircut thanks to Bibby chopping off one side before going to the restroom, to come with him to run an errand. Paper Boi is fed up but he obliges because loyalty to your barber takes precedence over everything."}
{"original": "Of course, one errand turns into an entire day of bullshit. All the while, Bibby promises Paper Boi that they'll head back to the barbershop right after he finishes each task real quick. But in the midst of the day's chaos lies a message about the importance of black men seizing control of their beauty. We rarely get to see intimate scenes of a black man getting his hair cut despite it, arguably, being one of the most vital relationships in a man's life. It's the one place black men can go and just, well, be."}
{"original": "Julia Craven and Taryn Finley discuss the damn-near unbreakable relationship between a man and his barber and why the barbershop is a vital safe space, despite its flaws, on this week's Run That Back."}
{"original": "Julia: This episode was literally a ride."}
{"original": "Taryn: Accurate. I knew when Bibby walked into the barbershop at least 30 minutes late for Paper Boi's appointment that this was about to be a ride. And boy, was it."}
{"original": "Julia: I love how Atlanta got all the usual barbershop/hair salon gripes out the way early ― your stylist is late, they're on the phone, they're oversharing their personal life, they stop mid-appointment to eat, and they ask you to hold something. Then it got really absurd, borderline unrealistic, yet somehow the most realistic thing I've ever seen in my black-ass life. When Bibby said, I'm on 85 right now! I knew he was on some other shit that only Atlanta can deliver (the city and the show)."}
{"original": "Taryn: All on a Bluetooth at that. Talking shit about his baby mama and making plans with his tax refund that you know he ain't gon follow through on. Paper Boi can't tell when Bibby is talking to him or the nigga on the phone. Bibby wants to do everything but do his job. I don't know a black person who hasn't been in this position."}
{"original": "Come to think of it, I think Bluetooths are the universal symbols for finesse OGs."}
{"original": "Julia: It's hands down the universal symbol. If I see a man with a Bluetooth, I run the other way, because I know he's a scammer on the same level as Joanne."}
{"original": "And Paper Boi gets trapped in this series of ridiculous scams all because of his loyalty to his barber. And I get it, because if Reya (the woman who does my nails) ever pulled me out the chair to ride along so she could do my nails at her homegirl's house, I'd go, because NO ONE ELSE can shape my nails like her."}
{"original": "Am I supposed to let another tech no my fill-in? So I can look busted? Absolutely the fuck not."}
{"original": "Taryn: Right. Paper Boi is fed up, but he's more loyal to his barber than he is to any of the women he's dealing with."}
{"original": "But that relationship with a barber/hairdresser/nail tech is sacred. Who else am I gonna go to and they just know what I want from jump? Nobody. That's why Paper Boi deal with his bullshit."}
{"original": "Julia: Exactly! This episode, in its own absurd way, shows the deep connection black men have to their barbers. Black men are already likely to have a barber longer than they have a primary care physician. And what Paper Boi and Bibby show us is that that haircut, that trust is worth going through hell for. Paper Boi doesn't even put his hands on Bibby until half the episode is over, when last season he shot a dude over waaaaaaay less."}
{"original": "You know, another thing that makes this episode super funny is that a few weeks ago I asked #Bae about his relationship with his barber. We were listening to a podcast that was talking about the barber/client relationship. So I asked him if he'd ever leave his barber. And he said, I don't know what I'd do if he broke up with me. I'd be fucking crushed. Nobody else knows how to line my beard up like he does."}
{"original": "Like you said, it's a sacred bond. I feel like #Bae would leave me before he left his barber LMAO."}
{"original": "Taryn: So Bibby finally begins cutting Paper Boi's hair but only chops part of the side off before Bibby stops and tells him to watch a viral video of an NBA player's invisible Lamborghini hitting someone outside of the club. Paper Boi doesn't care to see it because he actually witnessed it (refer to Season 1, Episode 6) but Bibby insists. As he's watching, 💦🍑calls. And, of course, Bibby was supposed to have BEEN at her house to cut her son's hair. So what does Bibby do? He tells Paper Boi to come with him to her house."}
{"original": "Now, pause for the cause, raise your hand if you ever had to leave Point A with your beautician to go with her to run an errand with a half-done head of hair before she actually finished your hair at Point B. 🙋🏾"}
{"original": "Julia: Sis, one time she sent ME out for more hair."}
{"original": "Taryn: It's really the name of the game, and we just deal with it because who else is gonna slay our shit like we like it?"}
{"original": "Julia: I actually cannot get over how triggering I'm on 85 right now! is."}
{"original": "Taryn: It's so black. Knowing damn well you ain't no where near the car. I'd protest it if I didn't always say I'm on my way when I haven't even taken a shower to leave yet."}
{"original": "Julia: Honestly, when a man tells me he's 10 mins away, I don't start getting ready until 30 mins later and I still be ready before he pull up."}
{"original": "Taryn: You better than me. I don't start getting ready till he gets there. I also ain't shit so ..."}
{"original": "Julia: This episode is also the first time I've actually laughed in a funny haha way at Atlanta. Like, this episode was FUNNY."}
{"original": "Taryn: I fought air so many times this episode. I didn't catch it the first time I watched, but when Bibby actually decides to leave, they gotta go out through the back of the shop because them people be out there. Now, I don't know who them people are, but I do know Bibby probably owes them money."}
{"original": "Julia: He absolutely owes them people money."}
{"original": "We arrive at the house of 💦🍑 to discover that Bibby owes her son a haircut, too. The kid's appointment was technically before Paper Boi's, leaving the rapper to sit in a lounge chair and wait on his barber yet again. After Bibby delivers a beautiful cut, 💦🍑 yells from upstairs that the water isn't running and inquires if Bibby paid the water bill. He says he did ― but then the lights suddenly go out. Bibby grabs Paper Boi, and a couple dollars out of 💦🍑's purse, and scurries out of the house and on to the next scam."}
{"original": "Julia: I do wanna discuss the time we spent at 💦🍑 house."}
{"original": "Taryn: At 💦🍑's house, we see how slick Bibby's tongue really is."}
{"original": "Julia: Mainly I wanna know why no one wiped that lil boy nose."}
{"original": "Taryn: Because you know there's always one little boy who woke up and went to bed with dried-up snot on his nose."}
{"original": "Julia: That poor child. And this scene is when we see the episode's biggest gag. Bibby is an excellent barber. That boy cut was SICKENING!"}
{"original": "Taryn: It was. I also love how much of a close-up we get on black hair. Not only was the cut nice, but the way in which it was shot was beautiful. We spend a good amount of time really looking at the tenderness and care that goes into a black barber's work and how it truly is an art form. Through all the madness and chaos of the episode, I really appreciated those moments of serenity (here with the little boy and later with Paper Boi). Black men don't really have those images that reflect the beauty of their hair on mainstream TV today, so it was kinda heartwarming to me."}
{"original": "Julia: Yes! Yes, yes, yes! It was very humanizing and showed how much care black men put into their appearance. We tend to focus on women ― mainly white ones ― and how much we care about how we look, but we don't get into men's connection with beauty. And we definitely neglect black men when we do dig into it. It was really beautiful and showed that despite the shop being a time-suck filled with regressive sociopolitical views (that I thought quince meant 18! What'd she have on a wedding dress for?! shit), this is place where black men can be free and catered to."}
{"original": "Taryn: Exactly! Barbershops can be a place where black men can be vulnerable, which is rare. There are definitely some hypermasculine themes that still exist within them. But this place is like intro to therapy, low-key. Even though Bibby stressed Paper Boi tf out all day. Hell, he stressed me out."}
{"original": "Julia: Right! It's a black man's safe place where they can just exist. And I'm not defending the regressive views on women and gender ... but that doesn't change the fact that this is a place where black men find solace. They crack jokes. They talk about sports and say all the non-PC things they wanna say about women in a place they won't be dragged for it. And that's important! We all have trash views we need to deconstruct so I'm glad black men have a place they can possibly do that."}
{"original": "Now do they do that? Most of them prolly don't, which is a different conversation."}
{"original": "Taryn: Right! That safe space is so important. It's the first place many black men and boys learn to be vulnerable. There aren't many spaces like that."}
{"original": "And chile, that's a WHOLE NOTHER conversation that will last longer than Paper Boi's day with Bibby, I'm sure."}
{"original": "On the way to the next scam, Bibby asks Paper Boi if he's hungry ― specifically if he wants Zaxby's. Paper Boi, like all of us, loves Zaxby's and gets slightly excited about the possibility of having a Wings & Things plate. Bibby, like the scammer he is, drags Paper Boi into a half-built house, hands the rapper a half-eaten plate of food and then Bibby makes the rapper help him steal some lumber from the site. They're caught by the white woman who owns the property, but, once again, they manage to flee the scene without being caught."}
{"original": "Julia: Of course I love Zaxby's. ― Who said it? Paper Boi or Julia?"}
{"original": "Taryn: Trick question! It was actually Taryn."}
{"original": "Julia: I hate you. I just screamed."}
{"original": "Taryn: I love how Paper Boi got an attitude when Bibby asked him if he likes it. Like duh, nigga. It's Zaxby's!"}
{"original": "Julia: That's how I feel when I'm home and my parents ask me if I want Zaxby's. Fuck you think? (I'm sorry, Mama. Please don't cuss me out.)"}

{"original": "Julia: I'll be in an Uber and it'll suddenly get rear-ended like Bibby did that poor woman at the stop sign."}
{"original": "But who is the driver? My mother. Pulling up on my ass."}
{"original": "Taryn: fhduihuiref. Also, joke's on Paper Boi though cause ain't no Zaxby's bih! If Paper Boi wasn't on probation, I know he would've knocked Bibby tf out for bringing him to a half-built house with a box of half-eaten chicken."}
{"original": "A perfect metaphor for Bibby's half-ass ass."}
{"original": "Julia: It reminded me of abandoned houses I ended up in as a young whippersnapper. I don't know why, but I have eaten in an abandoned home before. Granted, all of my serving was there. It wasn't some nigga's scraps LMAO."}
{"original": "Well, let me not lie. I know why I was in the house but that's not America's business."}
{"original": "Taryn: Lol. I ain't mad. Don't implicate yourself, sis."}
{"original": "Presumably on their way back to the shop, Paper Boi and Bibby drive past a group of children who should be in school. Bibby slows down and stares at the group before whipping his pickup truck around and chasing after the kids. He takes a shortcut and cuts the kids off in the alley. He hops out the truck and screams at his son, Lamar, for not being in class."}
{"original": "Julia: I think my favorite scene though is when they're leaving the construction site and Bibby sees his son skipping class. The way he whipped that pickup around and cut the kids off in the alley reminded me of a cop-movie trope we always see, but I loved it. Then Lamar (of course that's his name) had an attitude about being chastised!"}
{"original": "He skipped class and ain't even put up the scammer posters his daddy gave him. I was over it. But these minor inserts of bad-ass kids were the perfect garnish to this black-ass episode."}
{"original": "Taryn: Mind you, Bibby promised about 4,789 times to take Paper Boi back to the shop. But when Bibby looked at Lamar and Lamar looked at him, shit got real! The fear in Lamar's eyes can only be evoked by a parent. (Hey again, Rhonda!) That shit had me triggered and hollering at the same time. The background music didn't help."}
{"original": "Julia: (Hey Tammy!) That look of I know this lil nigga ain't [insert something you ain't supposed to be doing here] was VERY triggering."}
{"original": "And that attitude he had upon being caught was his survival instincts kicking in. How do I know that? Well, hey Tammy. And that head cock to the side?! alikhdklahsduygerfdsg."}
{"original": "Taryn: Then when Bibby told Paper Boi to get outta the car to check his son, I died for a few reasons. 1. Lamar FLAMED Paper Boi's raggedy, lopsided haircut that he gave him before they left the shop. 2. Like you said, THAT HEAD COCK."}
{"original": "That head cock is such a black kid thing. I remember getting checked for doing some shit I wasn't supposed to be doing and cocking my neck all the way to the side just so I didn't have to look at whoever was telling me I was wrong. That attitude is like no other lmao."}
{"original": "Julia: Sometimes, this show is so black I'm like, that couldn't have been scripted. That head cock could NOT have been scripted. It was too authentic, too natural. That young man cocked his head because that's what black kids do when they're chastised. That head cocks to their left ― and only to the left ― and they start shifting their weight from foot to foot. Your hands go in your pockets and you start staring off into the background, looking past the person chastising. That couldn't have been scripted."}
{"original": "I'm shocked Bibby or Paper Boi didn't say, Look at me when I'm talking to you. But I may have had a heart attack from my Black Kid PTSD."}
{"original": "Taryn: AND ONLY TO THE LEFT! Wow. I never noticed that until just now but it is only to the left. Black Kid PTSD is real."}
{"original": "Bibby did tell him to get his ass in that tiny-ass pickup, though."}
{"original": "Julia: Get your ass in the car! shudders."}
{"original": "You going back to the shop. I am so triggered."}
{"original": "Taryn: The back of that pickup was TIGHT. And Bibby was so busy cussing his son out and threatening to call his mom (on his flip phone, which he probably doesn't have minutes on at that) on the way to the barbershop (finally) that this nigga rear-ended some lady. I SCREAMED."}
{"original": "Julia: Sis, my parents threw me behind the seat of my uncle's pickup to move me into college my freshman year. I KNOW IT WAS TIGHT, OK?! Chapel Hill is an entire 1.5 hours away from my hometown. And I sat back there, and when I said my legs were sleep, my parents cracked jokes and laughed. I've lived Lamar's life."}
{"original": "Also, just to go back a few messages, I swear only black kids will roast someone checking them. My god."}
{"original": "Taryn: LMAO YO! It's true. Why you ain't fresh?"}
{"original": "Julia: The hilarity in this is how relatable it all is!"}
{"original": "Bibby is finally taking Paper Boi back to the shop and he's berating his son as they go. Paper Boi keeps telling Bibby to watch the road. But, if you know black parents, you know that Bibby is keeping half his mind on the road and both eyes looking back at Lamar while he cusses him out for skipping school. They, inevitably, get into a wreck before returning to the shop where Bibby gives Paper Boi a haircut made for God herself."}
{"original": "Taryn: I can't imagine being in the back of that pickup when they hit that lady. Then when Bibby told Paper Boi to get in the driver's seat cause he got warrants, I was done. But when that lady got out the car hollering and holding her lower back, I genuinely couldn't take it."}
{"original": "Bibby peeled off like, I ain't going back to jail!"}
{"original": "Julia: I wanna know where they found that footage of me holding my back and screaming. I want my royalties."}
{"original": "But no, that bounce around was too much! I got warrants. I got weed in my pockets. And the last nail in my coffin was Lamar saying I ain't got a license before Bibby made the executive decision to peel off. I wanna make sure we characterize it as an executive decision he made in the group's best interest, because in a lot of ways it was. You know how the police are ― they would have pulled up and ran everybody's pockets just because the driver who caused the accident was black."}
{"original": "Taryn: Paper Boi has dodged the cops so many times already this season. I'm so glad Bibby acted in the group's best interest even though the intention was really for his best interest. He saved the day."}
{"original": "Julia: Bibby is a hero, tbh."}
{"original": "Taryn: A lying, scamming hero. But a hero, nonetheless."}
{"original": "Julia: Despite it all, he delivered a very fresh cut. And then Paper Boi broke up with him and went on to get what I assume to be a whack cut next time. Paper Boi can't win. It's tragic."}
{"original": "Taryn: Paper Boi shouldn't have paid Bibby, though. He should've just kept on walking out the door."}
{"original": "Julia: I wouldn't have paid him either."}
{"original": "Taryn: Bibby deserved to get broken up with, because he plays too many games, but that shit hurt my feelings. Paper Boi didn't even know what the other barber was talking bout when he asked him if he wanted a 2 or a 3. I know Bibby ain't shit, but I really hope they work it out and Bibby does right by him."}
{"original": "Julia: Bibby also didn't care about the breakup, which is what hurt me."}
{"original": "Taryn: Bibby's ego was bruised more than anything. He had that look like, Oh, so this want we doing, nigga? Aight. Then moved on cause he knows his blade stays sharp and somebody else can (and did) replace Paper Boi's spot in the chair."}
{"original": "Julia: Tragic. I guess the moral here is don't leave your barber ever."}
{"original": "Taryn: Also, can we just take a moment to acknowledge Bibby's three and a half jobs?"}
{"original": "Julia: No I'm done. 😂 I canna."}
{"original": "Taryn: Barber. Bootleg cable guy (with a K). Construction contractor (Read: Con artist). And street team poster hanger."}
{"original": "Oh, he also sells toothpicks for 50 cents each. One other thing and I'm done. I'm so happy we didn't see Earn in this episode. I'm still pissed at him for wasting Van's time and energy. It's still fuck him all season long."}
{"original": "Donald Trump on Tuesday began closing out his presidency the same way he began his campaign for it five and a half years ago: with lies about the nation's southern border with Mexico."}
{"original": "We're joined together to celebrate a great achievement: the extraordinarily successful building of the wall, Trump bragged in a 22-minute speech in Alamo, Texas, that cost taxpayers at least $2 million in travel and security costs to stage. They said it couldn't be done, but we got it done."}
{"original": "In reality, only about 80 miles of the 453 he takes credit for has been built in areas where there was previously no barrier, according to Customs and Border Protection figures updated on Jan. 4. The rest of the miles have replaced existing fencing of some kind."}
{"original": "Indeed, even the word wall is a falsehood. While during his campaign Trump promised a thick concrete wall extending deep underground to prevent tunneling, what's been built instead has been steel fencing ― virtually identical to what was going up during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, although under Trump the height in some places increased to 30 feet, 12 more than what was being built previously."}
{"original": "Trump began his presidential run on June 16, 2015, with a falsehood-packed speech that called Mexicans entering the country rapists and drug dealers. And while his specific boast that day that he would build a wall and make Mexico pay for it ― which was repeated hundreds of times over the course of the 17-month campaign – was not technically a lie so much as an outlandish promise, Trump's lies about fulfilling it began soon after taking office."}
{"original": "Trump explicitly told Mexico's president at the time that he understood that Mexico would not pay for the wall, but that he would prefer if Mexican officials would not speak about that publicly to avoid hurting Trump's standing with his supporters in the United States."}
{"original": "Alex Brandon/ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump departs after speaking near a section of the U.S.-Mexico border wall Tuesday in Alamo, Texas."}
{"original": "Trump likewise failed to get Congress to appropriate any new funding for his pet project in his four years in office, even the first two when Republicans controlled both chambers. Trump in early 2019 declared an emergency and raided billions of dollars from a variety of sources, including the military construction budget, to finance the project."}
{"original": "Much of what little was built was paid for by raiding the DoD construction budget. When people see him standing there they should see it as nothing but a symbol of collapsing military schools, unbuilt day care centers and moldy housing, said Fred Wellman, a retired Army helicopter pilot with 22 years of service who works with the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. Trump's wall is a symbol of his failure as a president and why he lost so much of the military and veteran vote from 2016."}
{"original": "Trump's visit to Alamo comes even as the House prepared to impeach him for a second time, with a vote likely Wednesday, because of his incitement of the violent Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by thousands of his followers in an attempt to intimidate his own vice president and other Republicans into overturning the November election and keeping Trump in the White House."}
{"original": "And although Trump has falsely labeled any number of events about his presidency historic ― from his 2016 election win to the tax cuts passed under his watch to the renamed trade deal with Canada and Mexico ― a second impeachment would, indeed, be historic. While Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached, neither was impeached twice."}
{"original": "In his Texas remarks, Trump warned congressional leaders against pushing forward with impeachment because it is causing tremendous anger and division and pain."}
{"original": "Trump, however, did not address his role in ginning up his mob's attack on the Capitol, although earlier Tuesday he told reporters that he had said nothing wrong at the Jan. 6 rally."}
{"original": "In late 2019, Trump was impeached for trying to extort Ukraine's president into publicly smearing the Democratic challenger he feared most: former Vice President Joe Biden."}
{"original": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) chose to leave Trump in office despite that impeachment, and every Republican senator with the exception of Utah's Mitt Romney went along with him to protect Trump. Trump said then and has continued to claim ever since that he did nothing wrong in that episode, either."}

{"original": "Scientists found that Americans would be willing to pay an estimated $17.2 billion to prevent another catastrophe like the BP oil spill, which leaked more than 134 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010."}
{"original": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration commissioned the study, which offers the first comprehensive appraisal of the disaster's financial impact on affected natural resources, like beaches, coral and marine life. Its findings were published in the journal Science on Friday."}
{"original": "Handout . / Reuters The offshore oil rig Deepwater Horizon burned for 36 hours in the Gulf of Mexico, off Louisiana, in April 2010."}
{"original": "In 2016, BP estimated the oil spill cost the company roughly $62 billion in cleanup and legal fees. But scientists were interested in understanding the price tag attached to natural resource damage, a much trickier value to determine."}
{"original": "To do so, researchers asked American households how much money they would be willing to pay in a one-time tax to protect natural resources by preventing another disaster similar to the BP oil spill."}
{"original": "The researchers spent the first three years after the spill developing the survey, which aimed to effectively explain the magnitude of the destruction on natural resources. They spent the next few years administering the questionnaire to a large sample of American adults and analyzing the results."}
{"original": "The average household was willing to pay $153 for a prevention program, the researchers found. To get the final $17.2 billion appraisal, they multiplied this rate by the number of households that the sample represented."}
{"original": "Sean Gardner / Reuters More than 1 million birds died during the Deepwater Horizon disaster, studies suggest."}

{"original": "Last year, a federal judge approved a $20 billion settlement, which BP is to pay out to five Gulf states and local governments over 16 years to cover environmental damage."}
{"original": "Our estimate can guide policymakers and the oil industry in determining not only how much should be spent on restoration efforts for the Deepwater spill, but also how much should be invested to protect against damages that could result from future oil spills, said Kevin Boyle, a professor of agricultural and applied economics at Virginia Tech and one of the study's authors."}
{"original": "People value our natural resources, so it's worth taking major actions to prevent future catastrophes and correct past mistakes, he added."}
{"original": "Balance transfer credit cards can be a powerful tool for paying off credit card debt. When you have a high credit card balance, a big chunk of your monthly payment is eaten up by interest. Move that debt to a balance transfer card with a 0% introductory interest rate, and your entire payment can go toward reducing your debt. In turn, you might feel motivated to throw money at your balance and make it disappear."}
{"original": "But is that the best strategy? Let's take a look."}
{"original": "In general, it's a good rule of thumb to pay off the debt that carries the highest interest rate. The higher the rate, the more it's costing you over time. Therefore, it's often a good idea to look at all your debts -- car loans, student loans, credit cards and even mortgages -- and attack the one with the highest interest first."}
{"original": "But as with most rules, there are some notable exceptions. There's a strong case to be made for first paying off any debts whose interest rates are going to get much, much higher in the future. For example, balance transfer credit cards usually have 0% or low interest for only a limited period of time -- 12 to 18 months, in most cases. After that, the interest rate will shoot up. Your goal should be to eliminate your balance before that happens, even though it might not be your highest-interest debt at this particular moment."}
{"original": "Nerd note: Other possible exceptions to the highest interest rate first rule are mortgages and student loans. The interest you're paying on these loans is sometimes tax-deductible, which means you're being reimbursed for part of that interest in the form of a smaller tax bill. That means there's an argument for paying off other debts first -- even if they have a lower interest rate."}
{"original": "Once it's clear that paying off your balance transfer before the 0% rate expires should be a priority, the next step is to map out a timeline. You'll need to figure out how many months remain before your interest rate goes up and divide your total balance by that number. The result is the amount you'll need to pay monthly to get rid of your balance before the low rate expires. For example, if you owe $15,000 on your credit card and you have no interest for 12 months, you'd have to pay $1,250 per month to retire the debt before the rate goes up."}
{"original": "If necessary, figure out a Plan B"}
{"original": "But what if you can't realistically pay off the debt before the rate goes up? Don't give in to despair, and don't start spending too freely on your other credit cards. The point here is to reduce debt, not increase it. In addition to sending your entire payment toward debt reduction, balance transfer credit card offers let you hit pause and reassess your finances."}
{"original": "Let's talk about actions you can take to manage your credit card debt and make sure it's the last time you ever deal with it:"}
{"original": "Tighten your budget. If you got into debt by overspending, you need to figure out how to live within your means. This is challenging for anyone. Start a dedicated savings account for big purchases and think about ways to reduce your spending and increase your income."}
{"original": "Create an emergency fund. Nothing can land you in debt like an emergency. A hefty savings account will help you prepare for the next emergency -- and there will be a next one. Saving up one month's worth of expenses is a good start, especially while you're trying to focus your efforts on paying down debt. After your credit card debt and other high-interest loans are retired, you can look into building up an even bigger rainy day fund."}
{"original": "Consider transferring your balance again. There's a good chance you'll be able to get another balance transfer offer when your current 0% interest rate runs out. This can buy you a little extra time, but this isn't a good long-term strategy. If you do go this route, make sure you're also thinking strategically about how to eliminate your credit card debt entirely. You don't want to find yourself moving the debt around indefinitely without really reducing it."}
{"original": "The bottom line: If at all possible, pay off the balance on your 0% credit card before the rate goes up. Also, consider this an opportunity to take a hard look at your spending habits and make plans to avoid racking up credit card debt in the future."}

{"original": "It shouldn't take a global epidemic to make people realize that paid sick leave is a critical economic policy, but here we are."}
{"original": "As coronavirus sweeps through the country, the fact that the U.S. is one of only a few developed countries that does not guarantee workers paid time off when they're sick is getting an unprecedented amount of attention."}
{"original": "Editorials from publications around the country — Raleigh, San Antonio, Orlando, Washington state and New York — are pressing for paid sick leave. House Democrats put the issue at the top of their coronavirus stimulus bill agenda. Congressional Republicans, long opposed to such benefits, are warming to the idea. Even companies long hostile to giving workers these benefits are — begrudgingly — doing something."}
{"original": "Americans, ever the individualists, are typically wary of paying for someone else's problem. It's an attitude that has held back social policies like universal health care and child care, as well as maternity and sick leave."}
{"original": "But the disease caused by novel coronavirus, COVID-19, can't be solved at the individual level. It's everyone's problem, solvable only at the collective level. The health crisis is so big that it actually may burst the American illusion that we're on our own."}
{"original": "Americans, ever the individualists, are typically wary of 'paying for someone else's problem.' But coronavirus is everyone's problem."}
{"original": "People are finally coming to see that we are only as safe as the most vulnerable person among us, said Ellen Bravo, a strategic adviser to advocacy group Family Values @ Work, who's been fighting for paid leave for over 16 years. We all are affected by this. Now that people are thinking about the subway and who they sit next to on the plane, it's finally getting through."}
{"original": "Bravo stood outside a Milwaukee restaurant years ago trying to drum up signatures for paid sick leave. She asked one man walking out the door if he'd sign. He already had sick leave, he told her."}
{"original": "I said, 'How about the guy who made you lunch?' Bravo recalled."}
{"original": "The man turned around and signed."}
{"original": "If a worker gets paid sick days through their job, which about three-quarters of Americans do, it's only natural they may not think much about the people, mainly low-income, who don't. Coronavirus changed that. It's as if a collective lightbulb has clicked on. When workers come in to work sick — and about half say they do — everyone is at risk."}
{"original": "Republicans have long been hostile to the idea of paid sick leave. Even though they concede there's a need for sick leave now, there's resistance. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said recently that he believes companies will simply do the right thing on the issue."}
{"original": "And perhaps some will. Just this week, Uber, McDonald's, Darden Restaurants (which owns Olive Garden) and Instacart all announced some kind of sick leave policy. Many major fast food companies, however, including including Burger King, Chick-fil-A and Panera, still haven't implemented paid sick leave for their workers."}
{"original": "And even the policies that have gone into effect likely won't be sufficient to help stop the spread of the virus. Uber and Lyft said they'd compensate workers, but only if they tested positive for COVID-19. That means workers who are sick but can't get tested for a myriad of different reasons will still be out driving."}
{"original": "A stricter policy is clearly still necessary. And sick leave, at least for workers who are quarantined or home with children who can't go to school, is on the table as Congress negotiates a coronavirus stimulus bill."}
{"original": "Sick leave could be tied to some kind of tax incentive for businesses to make it more palatable to Republicans, said Josh Bivens, an economist at the progressive Economic Policy Institute."}
{"original": "In normal times you'd mandate it, phase it in, he said. But it's a lot to ask companies to take on extra costs during the epidemic when they're about to get whacked on the head with less business coming in. A tax break might actually make sense in that context."}
{"original": "Advocates said they were hopeful (and doubtful)."}
{"original": "I'd say we're in a moment positioned for change except for the political landscape is so messed up, said Vicki Shabo, an expert in paid leave policy and a senior fellow at New America."}
{"original": "It typically takes a crisis to move the needle on safety net policies. Unemployment insurance and Social Security emerged as a response to the New Deal."}
{"original": "Certainly, the virus is pushing people to support sick leave who previously were on the fence. An editorial in a San Antonio paper conceded it had been ambivalent on paid leave, seeing it as an overreach by local government. But no more."}
{"original": "The possibility of an outbreak underscores the importance of paid sick leave, the editorial says."}
{"original": "Paid leave, of all kinds, has long been one of those issues that most people don't think about until they need it. The fact that the U.S. offers no maternity leave to new mothers isn't an urgent problem ― until a woman is pregnant and needs to figure out how to pay for time off after she has her baby. Family leave doesn't seem like a must-have ― until a loved one is in the hospital dying and a worker can't take time off to be with them."}
{"original": "Democrats have long supported paid leave policies, but the issue hasn't gotten the same kind of attention as big-ticket items like health care or social security. Even now, the issue of paid family and medical leave, which would cover the kinds of longer-term care needs that are clearly going to come up during this crisis, isn't getting enough attention."}
{"original": "The 2020 presidential candidates have endlessly discussed health care, but paid leave has hardly come up during the Democratic debates."}
{"original": "Perhaps a key test of the issue's salience will come during the next debate, which is set to take place on Sunday. The remaining candidates will debate in front of cameras, but with no audience in attendance because of concerns over the coronavirus."}
{"original": "Sometimes the choice to stay home doesn't require a policy solution."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz wanted to broker a compromise."}
{"original": "In 2009, progressive Democrats were working on the most significant labor law reform in decades. The Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA) would allow workers to form unions by rounding up a majority of signatures in their workplace ― a process known as card check ― thereby avoiding a secret-ballot election and any anti-union campaign from management. Business groups feared a wave of unionization if the law passed."}
{"original": "So in stepped Schultz, then the chief executive of Starbucks, along with the CEOs of Whole Foods and Costco. Billed as a deal to satisfy both unions and employers, the Schultz proposal would streamline union elections and ramp up penalties for illegal union-busting. But it would also get rid of the card check measure, which was at the heart of the reform, and toss out a major provision making it easier for unionized workers to secure their first collective bargaining agreement."}
{"original": "Schultz said his aim was to offer a voice of reason. But to those hoping to reverse the steady drop in union membership in the U.S., his plan didn't seem like much of a compromise at all."}
{"original": "I remember it was like someone was trying to be extremely unhelpful, recalled Jody Calemine, a Democratic staffer on the House labor committee at the time. It went over like a lead balloon. People quickly went back to trying to figure this out."}
{"original": "EFCA never made it into law ― several moderate Democrats wouldn't get on board with the card-check measure ― and Schultz's involvement probably had minimal impact on its fate. But with the billionaire now testing the waters for a presidential run as an independent, hoping to win over middle-of-the-road voters dissatisfied with both parties, the episode says plenty about how he fashions himself a benevolent executive and man of compromise."}
{"original": "Schultz was touting his EFCA alternative as a third way to bridge a divide between two intractable sides. But in reality, his idea would have simply preserved a system in which it was harder for workers to join unions ― a system that benefited Starbucks and Schultz."}
{"original": "I think the proposal reflects a penchant for wanting to maintain the status quo, maintain his power and his ability as a CEO to decide what's best for working people, said Calemine, who's now general counsel at the Communications Workers of America union."}
{"original": "He told people if they got rid of the union… they would do better. Dave Schmitz, former union official"}
{"original": "Starbucks has long enjoyed a reputation as an enlightened employer. While the coffee chain pays the lower wages typical of the food-and-service sector, news stories have praised the company and Schultz, its longtime CEO who stepped down last year, for offering stock grants, tuition reimbursement and a health insurance plan to hourly employees. But beneath those progressive trappings there often was a conservative antipathy to collective bargaining by workers."}
{"original": "Erin McPike, a spokeswoman for Schultz, said the former CEO believes unions have played a critical role where companies have fallen short. But in the case of Starbucks, there was not a need for a union because what he was offering was always superior."}
{"original": "He strongly believes companies have a deep and abiding responsibility to take care of all their people, she said."}
{"original": "If Schultz seemed eager to torpedo the EFCA reforms, it may have been because his company had been battling unions for years. The Seattle-based chain's Washington roastery and a half-dozen of its first stores were unionized in the 1980's by the United Food and Commercial Workers union. There were maybe 120 Starbucks union members back then, estimates Dave Schmitz, who was head of organizing at UFCW Local 1001 at the time."}
{"original": "In his 1999 memoir, Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built A Company One Cup At A Time, Schultz recounted how he viewed the union as unnecessary ― and even an affront to his management: I was convinced that under my leadership, employees would come to realize that I would listen to their concerns. If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."}
{"original": "According to Schultz, a college student and Starbucks employee began a decertification campaign aimed at ousting the union in 1987 ― a move Schultz wrote of approvingly. A majority of store workers eventually signed on. The roasting plant workers decertified their union five years later, according to the book."}
{"original": "Schmitz said the former CEO's account fails to convey just how much Schultz worked against the union. According to Schmitz, as the parties negotiated over a second contract, Starbucks' lawyers tried to reduce workers' health benefits and strip out their right to just cause, a standard provision in union contracts that protects workers from arbitrary firings. He said the company also wanted the right to change working conditions without consulting the union."}
{"original": "Schmitz still has a leaflet his union created to pass out in Chicago as the company expanded there, accusing Starbucks of not negotiating in good faith."}
{"original": "He told people if they got rid of the union… they would do better, recalled Schmitz, who's now retired."}
{"original": "Schultz viewed the union's expulsion as a sign Starbucks was primed for growth across the U.S. and beyond: Once I had their full support, I knew I could count on them to work as a team and imbue them with the enthusiasm they would need to spread the word about Starbucks coffee around the world."}
{"original": "Dave Schmitz A leaflet passed out in Chicago, circa 1987, as Starbucks expanded there."}
{"original": "Starbucks faced another major union campaign beginning in 2004, when the company was on its way to growing beyond 10,000 locations around the world. The Industrial Workers of the World, a union outside the mainstream labor establishment in the U.S., launched a grassroots organizing effort dubbed the Starbucks Workers Union in a handful of cities. The group wanted to prove it was possible to unionize workers in the all but union-free world of fast food."}
{"original": "Daniel Gross was among the Starbucks employees in New York who soon filed a petition for a union election, seeking higher wages and more stable work hours."}
{"original": "The very first response that we got from the company was a company-wide voicemail, which management transcribed and posted in stores, recalled Gross, who is now the executive director of the labor group Brandworkers. It was a message from Howard Schultz, telling us how disturbed and disappointed he was that this group of baristas at a store in New York had decided to form a union."}
{"original": "The union election never happened ― the employees eventually withdrew their petition ― but the work of the Starbucks Workers Union led to a slew of cases before the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that referees disputes between unions and employers. Testimony revealed that Starbucks corporate executives coordinated a response to the organizing efforts, conducting interviews with employees to determine if they were union supporters. When a store with union sympathies had openings, the company transferred pro-Starbucks workers there instead of hiring unknowns."}
{"original": "An administrative law judge ruled in 2008 that several of the company's tactics ran afoul of the law, including discriminating against pro-union workers and forbidding employees from discussing the union inside the store even though they could talk about other non-work issues. The same judge ruled that Starbucks illegally fired Gross for his union advocacy, forcing the company to rehire him with back pay. A federal judge reversed that ruling on appeal years later, saying the firing was related to work performance."}
{"original": "[Schultz] is very adept at selling himself as this benevolent patriarch. Erik Forman, former Starbucks union activist"}
{"original": "Erik Forman also claimed to have been fired for his activism. He filed a complaint against the company and was rehired. He said he worked for Starbucks in the Minneapolis area for roughly five years, eventually getting treated for tendonitis due to the repetitive work of making lattes. He thought a union could help workers secure better schedules, noting the company was infamous for clopenings ― workers having to close down the store at night then reopen it just a few hours later the next day."}
{"original": "The practice became widely known after a 2014 New York Times story profiled a Starbucks barista and single mother who struggled to weave her life around her erratic work schedule. The article prompted Starbucks to say it would change its scheduling policies throughout its stores."}
{"original": "[Schultz] is very adept at selling himself as this benevolent patriarch, when in reality the company he built runs on the same model of fast-food exploitation as all of its competitors, said Forman, who's now an adjunct professor at SUNY Empire State College."}
{"original": "Schultz's view of collective bargaining doesn't appear to have changed much since the Starbucks union in Washington state was decertified some 30 years ago. In an interview to discuss his possible White House campaign on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Wednesday, Schultz was asked what he would do to rebuild unions in the U.S. as a way to reduce income inequality. He said trying to reform the tax code would make more sense."}
{"original": "Unions have a role to play, Schultz said, but unions are not the answer."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― In President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial, his lawyers seemingly reversed their position on whether it's OK for Democrats to sue the administration over a subpoena."}
{"original": "Last year, House Democrats issued dozens of formal legal requests for documents and testimony from the Trump administration, and in a few cases they filed lawsuits after the administration refused to comply. The president's counsel has argued that there's no constitutional or statutory basis for Congress to ask courts to enforce subpoenas."}
{"original": "Democrats have also issued several subpoenas as part of their investigation into the president's Ukraine scandal, but instead of suing the administration for its blanket refusal to comply, they impeached the president for obstruction of Congress in addition to abuse of power."}
{"original": "In the Senate trial this week, Trump's lawyers are now arguing that Democrats should have gone to court rather than impeach the president."}
{"original": "If there is a dispute between the people's House and the president of the United States over the availability of documents or witnesses ― and there is in each and every administration ― then go to court, Ken Starr, a guest lecturer for Trump's legal defense, said Monday, expanding on an argument the president's team presented in its initial written response to the articles of impeachment last week."}
{"original": "It really is as simple as that. I don't need to belabor the point, Starr said, before repeating go to court two more times."}
{"original": "Handout . / Reuters Attorney Ken Starr speaks as U.S. President Donald Trump's legal team resumes its presentation of opening arguments in Trump's Senate impeachment trial in this frame grab from video shot in the U.S. Senate Chamber at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., Jan. 27, 2020."}
{"original": "Now Democrats are using the switch to burnish their earlier demands for documents and interviews they already requested. Lawyers for the House of Representatives on Tuesday told the judge overseeing the Democrats' lawsuit for the president's tax returns, which also involved a subpoena, that the court should not condone President Trump's maintaining these clearly inconsistent positions, where he is a party both in this case and in the Senate impeachment trial."}
{"original": "For months, District Judge Trevor McFadden has been weighing whether the District Court of the District of Columbia will even consider the merits of the Democrats' tax return complaint. Trump's lawyers said the court should just stay out of it, and earlier this month McFadden put the case on hold while an appeals court sorts out whether the House has standing to sue over a different subpoena, one seeking testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn. In both cases, the question is whether the House has standing to sue."}
{"original": "Democrats are tired of waiting, saying in Tuesday's motion that the tax case has been stalled long enough. A longstanding federal tax disclosure law says the Treasury Department is supposed to hand over any tax records that congressional tax committees request, but the Trump administration refused to give the House Ways and Means Committee copies of the president's personal and business returns last year. Democrats then issued a subpoena and ultimately sued."}
{"original": "In its motion to dismiss the tax case last year, lawyers for the Justice Department and for the president himself argued that there's no way the courts should get involved, that Congress should haggle directly with the administration to get what it wants."}
{"original": "There is no constitutional or statutory basis for a Committee of the House of Representatives to take on the role of enforcing its subpoenas in the Federal courts where the executive branch has decided not to do so, the president's lawyers told the court."}
{"original": "If McFadden, a Trump appointee, agrees that Democrats can't sue, then he can throw out the case for lack of jurisdiction instead of having to decide it on the merits."}
{"original": "In their motion Tuesday, Democrats alerted Judge McFadden to what the president's people are telling the Senate."}
{"original": "Defendants' position that the House is constitutionally barred from judicial enforcement of its subpoenas has now been disavowed by President Trump in the Senate impeachment trial, the Ways and Means Committee said, adding that McFadden should lift his stay and make a decision on the case."}
{"original": "A key difference between the McGahn case and the tax case, they argued, is that Democrats lodged their initial request for the president's taxes under a longstanding federal law giving Congress access to private tax information."}
{"original": "Trump deputy counsel Patrick Philbin acknowledged Monday that the Trump administration has taken seemingly contrary positions, but he said that since the McGahn case is still ongoing, Democrats can't complain."}
{"original": "They are in court right now asserting that mechanism [suing] in the McGahn case and simultaneously saying that, well, they don't have to bother with that mechanism; they can jump to impeachment, Philbin said on the Senate floor."}
{"original": "The appeals court will soon rule on whether McGahn has to testify. Last week Democrats sent a letter putting the court on notice about the administration's contradictory arguments; the administration responded that it was actually Democrats trying to have it both ways by simultaneously doing impeachment and litigation."}
{"original": "Alexander Reinert, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, said it's possible that unlike in electoral politics, taking wildly different positions could have negative consequences in a federal court."}
{"original": "In general, I think judges do not like it when parties take contradictory positions in different legal proceedings, particularly where, as in this case, they are doing so contemporaneously and about the exact same topic, Reinert said in an email. It is one thing for parties to change their position over time on a legal question (especially where there has been a change in counsel) ― but in this case the president appears to be taking a disingenuous position in at least one of the proceedings."}
{"original": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Seattle's city council on Monday approved a new tax for the city's biggest companies, including Amazon.com Inc., to combat a housing crisis attributed in part to a local economic boom that has driven up real estate costs at the expense of the working class."}
{"original": "Amazon, the city's largest employer, said after the vote that it would go ahead with planning for a major downtown office building that it earlier had put on hold over its objections to a much stiffer tax plan originally proposed."}
{"original": "As passed on a 9-0 vote after a boisterous public hearing, the measure would apply to most companies grossing at least $20 million a year, levying a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city - about $275 annually for each worker."}
{"original": "Reuters Staff / Reuters Sponsors of the tax said Seattle's biggest-earning businesses should bear some burden for easing a shortage in low-cost housing that they helped create by driving up real estate prices."}
{"original": "That head tax formula is designed to raise $45 million to $49 million a year over the five-year life of the tax - down from an original $75 million annually - to build more affordable housing and support services for the homeless. The tax would end after five years unless renewed by the city."}
{"original": "Amazon had led private-sector opposition to the plan, saying earlier this month it was freezing expansion planning for Seattle pending the outcome of Monday's action. The move by the world's largest online retailer, owned by billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, put in question more than 7,000 new jobs."}
{"original": "Following the council vote, Amazon's vice president, Drew Herdener, said the company has resumed construction planning for its so-called Block 18 project in downtown Seattle, following the pause it announced two weeks ago."}
{"original": "However, he added, We remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council's hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here."}
{"original": "Amazon said it is still evaluating whether to sub-lease space in a second future office tower in Seattle, a project called Rainier Square, meaning it may move some planned jobs elsewhere and thus avoid further raising its tax liability."}
{"original": "The tax also would hit such Seattle-based stalwarts as coffee retailer Starbucks and department store chain Nordstrom, as well as California-based tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook that have enough of a presence in Seattle that they would be subject to the new levy."}
{"original": "The tax is expected to be borne by about 500 companies, accounting for 3 percent of the city's private sector. Healthcare companies are exempt, as are non-profits."}
{"original": "Sponsors of the tax said Seattle's biggest-earning businesses should bear some burden for easing a shortage in low-cost housing that they helped create by driving up real estate prices to the point where the working poor and many middle-class families can no longer afford to live in the city."}
{"original": "Supporters cite data showing Seattle's median home prices have soared to $820,000, and more than 41 percent of renters in the city ranked as rent-burdened, meaning they pay at least 30 percent of their income on housing."}
{"original": "The Seattle metropolitan area also is home to the third-largest concentrations of homeless people, nearly 12,000 counted in a January U.S. government survey, and almost half of them were living on the streets or otherwise unsheltered."}
{"original": "Mayor Jenny Durkan, who expressed concern that the original proposal would lead to an economic backlash, said she would sign the new tax ordinance into law."}
{"original": "She had offered an amendment to essentially cut the original $75 million tax proposal in half, but her proposal was rejected last Friday. Council members then negotiated over the weekend to craft a compromise that would gain greater support and was certain to win a veto-proof majority."}
{"original": "On Monday, about 40 elected officials from across the United States, some representing local governments in the running to host Amazon's second headquarters, published an open letter to Seattle in support of the head tax and expressing concern that Amazon opposed the measure."}
{"original": "By threatening Seattle over this tax, Amazon is sending a message to all of our cities: we play by our own rules, the officials wrote."}
{"original": "The head tax approved on Monday is not the first. Denver has enacted a similar tax, and Chicago had one but repealed it. Seattle itself had a head tax in effect from 2006 to 2009 but it was repealed to help businesses in the midst of the recession."}
{"original": "Donald Trump's friends and allies are profiting from wealthy felons who are paying them to lobby the president for pardons, The New York Times revealed in a bombshell report Sunday."}
{"original": "The market for pardons — which cuts out the poor and those not politically connected — reflects the access peddling that has defined Trump's presidency, as well as his unorthodox use of his clemency powers to reward friends, the Times noted."}
{"original": "Presidential pardons are typically meted out in compassion to those who have more than served a just penalty, or who may have been too-harshly treated by the criminal justice system."}
{"original": "Trump has used his power to reward those with powerful connections, as well as friends and allies — including those who may harbor damning evidence about his own behavior."}
{"original": "The lucrative push for pardons has hit high gear just days before Trump is to leave office, according to the Times report, which was based on documents and interviews with more than three dozen lawyers and lobbyists."}
{"original": "One lobbyist, Brett Tolman, a former federal prosecutor with ties to the White House, collected at least tens of thousands of dollars in the last weeks to push the White House for clemency for the son of a former Arkansas senator, the founder of the online drug marketplace Silk Road, and a Manhattan socialite, according to the Times."}
{"original": "A former adviser to the Trump campaign was paid $50,000 to seek a pardon for former CIA officer John Kiriakou, who was convicted of illegally leaking classified information, the newspaper reported. The adviser was to collect an additional $50,000 bonus if the president came through with the pardon, according to a copy of an agreement obtained by the Times."}
{"original": "Kiriakou was also told that Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, could get a pardon for him for $2 million, the Times reported. Giuliani denied that claim."}
{"original": "Officials are also fearful he could issue blanket pardons to his supporters who stormed the Capitol Jan. 6."}
{"original": "An attorney for Jacob Anthony Chansley, the shirtless, horned, conspiracy theory-touting U.S. Capitol rioter, is calling for a pardon from Trump because he says his client was inspired by the president to take action."}
{"original": "In a long list of shocking earlier decisions, Trump has already pardoned felons in his campaign or administration, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, and his one-time national security adviser Michael Flynn."}
{"original": "Trump's longtime adviser Roger Stone, whom the president pardoned after he was convicted of seven felonies, admitted he had information that could have hurt the president, and appeared to be holding out until he got his pardon."}
{"original": "The president knows I was under enormous pressure to turn on him, Stone told NBC journalist Howard Fineman earlier this year. It would have eased my situation considerably. But I didn't."}
{"original": "Those pardoned have also included war criminals and law enforcement officers who violated civil rights."}
{"original": "This week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in India released its budget for FY 2016-17. Budget Day in India is met with intense scrutiny and heightened chatter among the pundits and political class in New Delhi. JustJobs Network's staff based in India shared their reactions to the new budget on the JJN blog."}
{"original": "Leaving job creation to the private sector Sabina Dewan, Executive Director"}
{"original": "As the Indian government released its 2016 budget earlier this week, a key question is whether it does enough to address one of the biggest challenges confronting the Indian economy: job creation."}
{"original": "This year's budget makes a sharp pivot from an urban to a rural focus with bigger allocations for infrastructure, like irrigation projects; the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, which promises 100 days of work per year for rural households; and schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bhima Yojana that protects farmers whose crops have been affected by natural calamities, pests or diseases."}
{"original": "These policies promise to relieve distress and protect livelihoods in some of the poorest parts of the country. The rural vote is, after all, critical to the upcoming state assembly elections this fiscal year. But the government's resolve to keep fiscal consolidation on track by bringing the fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product in 2016/2017, means that there will be little additional spending to create new jobs. This task the government largely leaves to the private sector. A more hands-on approach to skill development Amanbir Singh, Research Coordinator"}
{"original": "Finance Minister Arun Jaitley listed education, skills and job creation as one of his nine pillars to transform the economy. He is setting aside ₹17 billion (over US$ 250 million) for 1,500 multi-skill training institutes and an expansion of the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna, the program that offers youth a financial incentive to complete vocational training."}
{"original": "The funding allocation is not a surprise since Skill India has been a major policy plank for the government. It is interesting to note that there is a focus on creating new multi-skill training institutes, which could replace India's Industrial Training Institutes in the skilling landscape. Over the past few years, the government has been channelling funds to training providers - NGOs and for-profit enterprises - through the National Skills Development Corporation and other programs. This move, however, could signal a more hands-on approach by the government in realizing its skill development target of 400 million trained workers by 2022."}
{"original": "A fresh emphasis on start-ups Gregory Randolph, Deputy Director"}
{"original": "The 2016 budget places special emphasis on nurturing India's ecosystem for start-ups, especially those in the manufacturing sector, to drive job creation."}
{"original": "The budget definitely marks a step forward for India's entrepreneurs, with the promise of one-day registration and a tax holiday for three of the first five years after a company is set up. What's more, the budget holds a special allocation for start-ups run by women and lower-caste entrepreneurs; it's great to see the government recognize the problem of access to entrepreneurship."}
{"original": "But questions remain: Is there any effort to change procurement and tendering practices so that young enterprises benefit from government spending? Is one-day registration just nice window dressing, or will the government streamline other hassles that new companies face, like obtaining a tax ID number?"}
{"original": "The devil is always in the details of implementation. Ease of doing agriculture Atisha Kumar, Research Director"}
{"original": "The 2016-17 budget continues the government's emphasis on facilitating the 'ease of doing business.' While the government puts forth a variety of tools to lower the costs of doing business, a prominent theme is the use of technology to do so. Start-ups are the obvious candidates for technology-based solutions, but the union budget also introduces digital solutions designed for another group: farmers. The budget holds special provisions for both marketing of produce and procurement of agricultural produce."}
{"original": "The budget proposes a national, online marketplace for agricultural produce directed at farmers. This electronic marketplace will help provide better price information to farmers. On procurement, the Food Corporation of India will undertake an online procurement system to administer the Minimum Support Price (MSP)."}
{"original": "These Internet-based solutions for farmers could be well timed, given that the number of rural Internet users grew 77 percent in 2015 and is on track to reach 147 million in June 2016. The poorest farmers, however, are the least likely to benefit, given that the cost of any broadband device is still out of reach. Is it really the biggest year yet for NREGA? Trine M. Jorgensen, Research Intern"}
{"original": "The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) - a national program that ensures 100 days of work to rural households - is allocated ₹385 million (almost US$ 5.7 billion) in the 2016 budget. According to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, this is the highest ever allocation of funds to MGNREGA. It's a welcome turnaround after two years of Modi's government criticizing the program and giving it low priority."}
{"original": "But looking closer, we see that in 2010-11, the government allocated ₹401 million to MGNREGA; in today's rupees that would be ₹650 million, almost double this year's allocation. This year's amount is also modest considering the backlog of unpaid wages from last financial year (12 states were unable to pay due wages as of December 2015), and the promise of 50 extra days of work for people in drought-stricken areas."}
{"original": "Improvement in the timely release of funds and better monitoring to prevent corruption, however, could increase the percentage of funds that actually reach rural households."}
{"original": "Betting on the long-term dividends of infrastructure Dhruv Jain, Research Associate"}
{"original": "In 2016-17, infrastructure spending in India will be increased to ₹2.21 trillion (about US$ 32.5 billion). The emphasis will continue to be on railways and roads. Key highlights include the construction of 10,000 km of roads, upgrading of state highways, and the establishment of a National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) to source off-budget funds and facilitate Public Private Partnerships (PPP)."}
{"original": "Infrastructure spending pays big dividends in terms of economic activity, and potentially job creation, especially in a country like India where connectivity remains poor. But expenditure on railways and roads - aside from the direct jobs it creates - is a long-run investment. It holds the potential to connect markets, boost productivity and create jobs over a time horizon of five or more years. It won't help Modi fulfill his big promises around jobs in the short run, before the next election. Nonetheless, the government's resolve to provide this big push deserves applaud, given the limited fiscal space."}
{"original": "Helping companies pay for pensions Tanvir Malik, Research Associate"}
{"original": "Aside from the controversial removal of tax exemption on withdrawal of contributions to the Employee Provident Fund, the government made another significant announcement with regard to the EPF. The budget sets aside ₹10 billion (almost US$ 150 million) to pay 8.33 percent of new employees' basic salary towards pension and provident fund contributions. This provision will apply to workers earning basic salaries of less than ₹15,000 (US$ 220) per month."}
{"original": "The government's contribution will cover almost three-quarters of the 12 percent matching contribution required of employers. By reducing the cost of hiring, this could give a boost to job creation. It may also create an incentive for firms to hire more formal rather than casual workers, since provident fund contributions are one of the biggest expenses for employers when hiring permanent employees."}
{"original": "However, the move could unintentionally put a ceiling on wages at the ₹15,000 per month threshold, since any salary above it would lead to a large increase in labor costs for employers. The government should monitor wage data to make sure salaries for entry-level workers are not stagnating below the threshold."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON – At least from a ratings standpoint, America's 45th presidency without a doubt has had a successful first season, tremendous even."}
{"original": "Donald Trump made himself the center of attention like no previous chief executive, turning his every public appearance into must-watch television. He picked fights with fellow world leaders in phone calls, in speeches and on Twitter. He hinted about the size of his genitalia in a threat about nuclear weapons. He made falsehoods a defining feature of his White House, averaging nearly a half-dozen each day and racking up more than 2,000 as president. He has, repeatedly, made his own ignorance, his mental fitness and his bigot-friendly racial views a focus of national conversation."}
{"original": "The former reality TV host who improbably became the leader of the free world has unquestionably earned superlatives, although likely not the ones he and his fans had hoped: On the anniversary of his inauguration, Trump is the least-liked president in modern history, at this point in his term. Strong majorities of Americans find him dishonest, uninformed and temperamentally unfit for the job. Abroad, the United States' standing has plummeted in the past year, to the point where China is seen as a better world leader."}
{"original": "To Trump's critics, none of this is the least bit surprising."}
{"original": "He has not changed from the horrible human being that he's always been, said Kendal Unruh, a longtime Republican activist who was drummed out of her local party in Colorado for leading the effort to strip the nomination from Trump at the 2016 GOP convention. And now the whole world can see him for who he is."}
{"original": "Trump and his White House, of course, disagree with assessments like Unruh's. As he has from nearly the day he took office last January, Trump claims that his presidency has accomplished more than any previous one. I don't think any administration has ever done ― has done what we've done and what we've accomplished in its first year, which isn't quite finished yet, he said at a recent Cabinet meeting after first telling reporters: Welcome back to the studio."}
{"original": "A closer look at Trump's list of claimed historic accomplishments, though, shows that virtually all of the major ones are generic Republican Party objectives that any GOP president would have approved. What's more, they were almost entirely the work of a Republican Congress led by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and which had been waiting years for a Republican president to come along."}
{"original": "Those federal judges Trump brags about, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch? With few exceptions, they are products of the Federalist Society, the conservative group to which Trump outsourced the choosing of judicial nominees in 2016, combined with McConnell's readiness to ram those names through his Senate despite Democratic objections."}
{"original": "Cutting regulations? While Trump has started the process for rolling back environmental and safety regulations on industries, he has taken credit for slashing hundreds of other regulations that were cut under President Barack Obama or were blocked from being implemented thanks to legislation the GOP Congress started preparing before Trump even took office."}
{"original": "And the tax cuts, the only significant legislation to pass under Trump's watch? While Trump's White House participated in crafting the measure, the heart of the bill – a massive and permanent cut to the nation's corporate tax rate – has been a GOP priority for many years, and was an important part of the platforms of the other Republican presidential candidates in 2016. Trump didn't even mention tax cuts in his infamous campaign announcement speech in 2015."}
{"original": "This came out of Mitch McConnell's and Paul Ryan's world, not Donald Trump's. They just needed him to sign it. That's all, said Rick Wilson, a Republican political consultant and vocal Trump critic. Donald Trump couldn't name five tangible things in this tax law."}
{"original": "Republican congressional leaders have not been shy about where they believe the bulk of the credit for these achievements should go."}
{"original": "This has been a year of extraordinary accomplishment by any objective standard, McConnell said at his year-end news conference, specifically mentioning judges he had confirmed and the tax cuts – but not mentioning Trump by name during his six-minute opening statement. I think we've made a difference for the country in beginning to move it right of center, which was the opportunity presented to us by the American people."}
{"original": "The Best Presidency Ever – Just Ask Trump"}
{"original": "Low-key statements like McConnell's, though, have tended to get buried in the blizzard of claims Trump has made nearly from his first day in office about how successful he has been."}
{"original": "There has never been a presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time, Trump proclaimed in a White House news conference 27 days after taking office."}
{"original": "Trump boasts about having vanquished the terrorist group ISIS, even though his generals essentially continued the offensive in Syria and Iraq started by the military under Obama several years ago. He brags about the the economy and the number of jobs he has created, even though the economy has followed roughly the same trajectory it was on under Obama (the number of jobs added in 2017 was actually lower than the number created in 2016). Trump even claimed credit for the lack of any fatal commercial airline accidents worldwide last year – a circumstance he had nothing to do with."}
{"original": "Longtime Trump friend Chris Ruddy, CEO of the Newsmax website, said Trump continues his tendency to overstate his accomplishments, probably from his background as a television entertainer. I think it's a theatrical and rhetorical flourish, he said."}
{"original": "Whatever the reason, the unsubstantiated boasts, combined with daily falsehoods large and small, have undermined not just his own credibility, but that of the party he now leads."}
{"original": "Republicans learned this firsthand after passing their tax cuts. Majorities of Americans said in polls that their own households would not receive a tax cut, and were more likely to see their taxes go up – even though, in truth, the vast majority of households will see at least a temporary reduction."}
{"original": "I personally think he should be more focused on accuracy, Ruddy added. Because I think it would be better for him in the long run."}
{"original": "But given all of Trump's actual promises during the campaign, accuracy might be even worse for him."}
{"original": "Trump did pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, as he promised, and the Paris climate accord. He has also implemented a watered-down version of his promised extreme vetting of travelers from a group of mostly-Muslim countries."}
{"original": "Many, many more of his campaign promises, however, have not been kept."}
{"original": "Trump said he would get tough with China and label the country a currency manipulator. After a year, he has done no such thing. Trump said he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with better health care at a fraction of the cost. He has done neither. And repeatedly, day in and day out, Trump promised he would build a great wall along the nation's southern border and, more importantly, would force Mexico to pay for it. While some wall samples are being built in California, Trump has made no attempt to force Mexico to pick up the bill. If a wall ends up getting built, it will be American taxpayers bearing the billions of dollars in costs."}
{"original": "And of the 10 major pieces of legislation Trump promised to get passed in his first 100 days, only one – tax cuts – actually did pass, although it happened in his 11th month. The End the Offshoring Act, the Clean Up Corruption in Washington Act, the Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act ― not one of the other nine promised legislative accomplishments exists outside of Trump's October 2016 press release."}
{"original": "Growing Into The Job. Or Not."}
{"original": "If Trump's chaotic, even juvenile approach to the presidency has surprised Americans who only started paying attention to the 2016 presidential race in its final weeks, GOP leaders who had followed the primary as it unfolded in 2015 had a much better grasp of what they were facing."}
{"original": "When I first saw him go down the escalator, I was aghast, said one top Republican National Committee official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. When I saw him attack Megyn Kelly, I booed."}
{"original": "Yet, despite his outlandish statements and behavior, most Republican Party leaders largely bought into the same myth that millions of his fans had accepted for years: That Trump was a shrewd and successful businessman and would employ those skills in the Oval Office. And like those fans, they came to that view from watching his long-running TV series, The Apprentice, and its spinoff, Celebrity Apprentice."}
{"original": "They elected the character Donald Trump played on TV. They elected the character on 'The Apprentice,' who's smart, who's decisive, who's a global business leader, said GOP consultant Wilson. He stumbles into this office. Of course he's overmatched since Day One. You would not put this person in charge of a Waffle House, let alone the White House."}
{"original": "While Trump has claimed over the years that he is both successful and smart, his decades-long record suggests quite the opposite."}
{"original": "Trump took over his father's real estate business in 1974, when it was worth $200 million, a figure that inflates to over $1 billion in current dollars – meaning that the billionaire status he so frequently brags about actually came about thanks to his birth."}
{"original": "Over the years, amid the successes of his Trump Tower building in New York and various golf courses around the world, Trump's business career has been littered with failures. There were branding flops like Trump Steaks and Trump Vodka. Outright fraud in the case of Trump University. But most consequential was the spectacular cratering of his New Jersey casinos, which brought him to the brink of personal bankruptcy."}
{"original": "Mark Makela / Reuters Workers remove the sign from Trump Plaza Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Oct. 6, 2014, after Trump sued to end a licensing deal."}
{"original": "The loss of creditworthiness following the casino failures limited the scope of Trump's subsequent businesses. Instead of constructing and owning big, expensive buildings, Trump largely had to settle for renting out his name on other people's buildings – a much less lucrative endeavor. In fact, one longtime friend said privately that Trump's decision not to run for president in 2012 was based on a $15 million-a-year contract he had just been offered by NBC to renew his TV show. It was money he could not afford to turn down – a remarkable admission for a supposed multi-billionaire."}
{"original": "Of course, that Trump was not anywhere near as successful as he claimed was not a big secret. It had been the subject of numerous articles and books over the years. And thousands of publicly available lawsuits outlined the sorts of business practices Trump had used – from refusing to pay contractors what they were owed to aggressively trying to silence criticism."}
{"original": "Republican Party leaders, nevertheless, failed to perform even cursory research into Trump's background when he began his presidential run in June 2015. Instead, they bought into his self-proclaimed wealth and believed his threats that he would run as a third-party candidate using his own money if Republicans were not nice to him, a view that informed several key decisions in the weeks and months that followed. When Trump during the first GOP debate refused to promise to back the eventual nominee, then-party Chairman Reince Priebus could have informed Trump that he would not be participating in the second debate. Instead, Priebus traveled to Trump Tower and begged Trump to sign a pledge to back the nominee, whoever that might be. In so doing, Priebus instantly gave Trump the high status within the party that he had previously lacked."}
{"original": "When Trump ultimately won the nomination, party leaders did their best to keep Trump's statements to prepared speeches delivered off a Teleprompter, in the hopes of limiting off-script remarks that could hurt the chances of Republican congressional candidates."}
{"original": "Few, if any, thought Trump could actually win, and therefore gave little thought to running and staffing the government's executive branch."}
{"original": "As the transition began following Trump's stunning victory, with the job of governing less than three months away, many GOP leaders assured each other that Trump would grow into the job, that the responsibilities of the office would weigh on him."}
{"original": "You can't look at 70 years of history and say, oh, he's going to be transformed when he gets a new job, Unruh said. She added that many in her former party saw in Trump's unformed political history an opportunity to mold a rubber stamp for whatever they wanted. They truly thought they could control him like a puppet. The agenda has come to a screeching halt because of the chaos."}
{"original": "That Trump failed to grow and learn in office is a disappointment for Republicans, but probably should have been expected. In fact, Trump described his approach to work three decades earlier, in his Art of the Deal bestseller that led to the TV shows. I leave my door open. You can't be imaginative or entrepreneurial if you've got too much structure, he wrote. I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops."}
{"original": "That business model, questionable even for actual businesses, wound up generating pure turmoil in the West Wing in the early months. Trump would take meetings with whomever on his staff happened to stroll into the Oval Office. His tendency to accept the advice of the last person he has listened to meant the White House frequently was sending out conflicting messages on policy positions. When Republicans in Congress tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, for example, they were often confronted by Trump's own changing positions – confusion that was further compounded by his lack of knowledge or interest in the topic."}
{"original": "The president likes to do things by trial and error, said Ruddy, who said he predicted a big adjustment period after Trump took office. He's not a strategic planner."}
{"original": "Yuri Gripas / Reuters President Donald Trump, flanked at a White House meeting on Oct. 5, 2017, by Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly."}
{"original": "The arrival of retired Marine Gen. John Kelly as chief of staff last summer was supposed to bring order and structure to the White House, and in some measure it has. Oval Office visits are now strictly controlled, as are phone calls through the White House switchboard during business hours."}
{"original": "But Trump has responded to the reduced access by adopting a lighter work schedule – one that typically does not start until 11 a.m. and ends by 6 or 6:30 p.m. That has left plenty of time to watch cable television coverage about himself and then react to it in off-the-cuff remarks to the press and, more famously, brief statements he releases on Twitter."}
{"original": "From the start of Trump's presidency, his staff and entire administration have had trouble dealing with Trump's tendency to say untrue and inflammatory things generally, but particularly on Twitter, which Trump jealously defends as his sure-fire method of getting his unfiltered message out to his supporters."}
{"original": "Former press secretary Sean Spicer, after first ridiculing reporters who asked about the value of presidential tweets, soon was forced to concede that Trump's tweets were, by definition, official statements of the president. Since then, press staff and others have frequently responded to particularly absurd missives with the all-purpose: The tweet speaks for itself."}
{"original": "Sometimes, though, Trump's habit of typing out an idea without thinking it through has generated real consequences."}
{"original": "Trump's claims that Obama wiretapped him at Trump Tower in 2016 has required his own Department of Justice lawyers to concede, in official federal court filings, that Trump's assertions are at times completely baseless."}
{"original": "The tweet simply does not reference FISA and does not state definitively that any such surveillance occurred, DOJ lawyers recently wrote in a case responding to a Freedom of Information Act request regarding the claimed wiretapping."}
{"original": "Last week, Trump's habit of watching the Fox & Friends morning program and basing policy positions on what he sees nearly derailed renewal of a key law enabling electronic surveillance of foreigners overseas."}
{"original": "The bill had bipartisan support, with only small factions of liberals and libertarians opposing it, as well as the backing of U.S. intelligence agencies – all of which are now under Trump's control. Trump nevertheless started tweeting against it, requiring an emergency intervention by Kelly and House Speaker Ryan to explain the bill to him and persuade him to write a follow-up tweet reversing his opposition."}
{"original": "Later in the week, Trump gave an hour-long, televised performance hosting a meeting on the plight of some 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children. Democrats and Republicans backing a bill protecting their status were stunned a day later, when Trump called a much smaller meeting – not televised – where he reversed his earlier position while reportedly refusing to help immigrants from shithole countries like Haiti or those in Africa."}
{"original": "And this week, it was again Trump's Twitter feed generating chaos, as he started Thursday morning by attacking a compromise to keep the government funded past a Friday night deadline. This time, it was deputy press secretary Raj Shah who had to undo the damage, releasing a statement that Trump does, in fact, support the spending bill."}
{"original": "With Trump's first 365 days down with, at best, limited successes, Republicans confront a second year that is not merely challenging, but potentially devastating."}
{"original": "Midterm elections are just 10 months away, and the party faces the very real possibility of losing control of the House because of Trump's unpopularity. State elections in New Jersey and in Virginia in November showed big energy among Democratic voters. A special state Senate election in Wisconsin this week in a solid GOP district was won by a Democrat."}
{"original": "Very nervous, is how a key RNC member described the consensus within the party, on condition of anonymity. There's not a whole lot that can be done. A lot of it depends on the national mood, and we don't know what that's going to be."}
{"original": "In terms of a legislative record to run on, Republicans are unlikely to have much to add to the tax cuts from December. McConnell has already said he's not inclined to make another run at Obamacare. The two issues most mentioned as congressional agenda items are infrastructure spending and immigration – neither of which appears terribly likely to pass at this moment."}
{"original": "Which means that the fortunes of congressional Republicans are in all probability tied to the president's behavior in the coming months, with success riding on his ability to settle down and act more presidential. GOP leaders are not optimistic."}
{"original": "We saw this during the campaign, the RNC member said. If you were thinking about it, you said: He's 70 years old. He isn't going to change. And he hasn't changed."}
{"original": "Friend and supporter Ruddy thinks Trump, for whatever reason, believes he must hold onto the 30 percent or so of Americans who fervently support him, no matter the cost."}
{"original": "I think he's sticking too closely to the Breitbart talking points. That's fine with the base, but it's not a broad governing strategy, Ruddy said. I think it may take the loss of the House, the Senate, or both, for him to reconsider the strategy."}
{"original": "To Unruh, a rout for Republicans in November would start bringing about some rough justice. They actually knew what Trump was about. They chose to ignore it, she said of party leadership. They took the whole party down with them."}
{"original": "I've often questioned if every single country on Earth requires its own national flag carrier. Some have flown into the history books, such as Sabena (Belgium, 1923-2001), CSA Czech Airlines (1923-1995), and Malev (Hungary, 1946-2012). Many others have been grounded around the world as well."}
{"original": "TAP Portugal, that country's flag carrier, looked like it would follow suit, but instead new owners have committed to keeping it flying and now it's in pretty good shape."}
{"original": "Atlantic Gateway Consortium, led by David Neeleman, owner of Azul, a Brazil-based carrier, and founder of JetBlue, bought 40 percent of TAP (Transportes Aéreos Portugueses) last November and has big plans for the revived carrier (most of the rest is still owned by the Portuguese government)."}
{"original": "You may have noticed that it has some of the lowest airfares from the eastern U.S. to Europe among traditional airlines ($500 round-trip including tax from the New York and Boston to Spain for example), especially in business class (some of the airline's A330 and all of its A340 aircraft have fully horizontal seats) where on most routes it can't be beat. TAP flies from Boston, Newark, New York and Miami to Lisbon, its main hub, and beyond to Europe and Africa. Last minute (72 hours or less) upgrades to premium economy costs $65 per direction, another decided bargain."}
{"original": "New Airbus A321LR (for long-range) are on order (14 will be delivered by 2019)."}
{"original": "Their airfare booking website is one of the best in the world and the simplest to use for flexible destination searches and set price parameters. Tell them what you want to spend and where you're flying from and you'll see the lowest prices offered on a flexible travel date itinerary."}
{"original": "And they have the best stopover program if you're flying through Lisbon to someplace else (60 percent of passengers are indeed flying someplace else with the rest having Portugal as their final destination, a country named Travel+Leisure's 2016 Destination of the Year the capital of which landed at 8 out of 17 on Conde Nast Traveler's Destinations of the Year 2017, not least because Portugal is a secret surfer's paradise and has a temperate climate year round). If you're leaving from JFK, TAP has the last European departure of the day (11:55 p.m.), which means you get a full day in New York and are pretty certain to doze off on the ride over."}
{"original": "So while TAP might not be on your search radar, perhaps it should be."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― The Internal Revenue Service is having a hard time making its employees work during a government shutdown that has halted their paychecks."}
{"original": "The IRS recalled 46,000 furloughed workers this month, ordering them to work without pay before tax filing season starts on Jan. 28. More than half of those employees are in the division that processes tax returns and handles taxpayer phone calls. And more than 14,000 of those workers either claimed a hardship exemption or could not be reached, according to a congressional aide."}
{"original": "The staffing shortage was first reported Friday by The Washington Post."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump has refused to approve government funding legislation unless congressional Democrats agree to include more than $5 billion for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, even though he previously said Mexico would pay for the wall. More than 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or working without pay since Dec. 22."}
{"original": "The Trump administration initially said the IRS would collect taxes but not distribute refunds, which amount to hundreds of billions of dollars annually but then said refunds would be paid after all."}
{"original": "For most households, tax season should be normal, according to the Tax Policy Center, but refunds may take longer than usual. Filers who have questions for the IRS about their returns, however, may run into trouble."}
{"original": "Tax professionals have told HuffPost that the shutdown has made it difficult to help their clients because they can't get anyone from the government on the phone to resolve problems."}
{"original": "Amber Morgan-Storms is an enrolled agent, a type of tax practitioner licensed by the Treasury Department, in Redlands, California. She has clients dealing with IRS liens that were mistakenly issued, she said, and the shutdown is making it difficult to do her job."}
{"original": "I can't call the IRS and say this shouldn't have been assessed, she said. I can't advocate for the taxpayers."}
{"original": "Morgan-Storms said she has not noticed any improvement since the IRS called up more workers."}
{"original": "I tried again today, and the hold times are so ridiculous, I can't even get into the queue, she said. And then when I thought a call was getting transferred over, it got disconnected."}
{"original": "The shutdown came at a particularly bad time for the IRS, since this is the first tax filing season under the Republican tax law that Congress passed at the end of 2017."}
{"original": "One member of the House committee that oversees taxes, Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), said the shutdown probably wouldn't spoil the new law for most people."}
{"original": "For most of the complexities, the tax planning actually happened months ago, because you do tax planning before the end of the year, he told HuffPost this month, adding that the new law makes the tax code simpler for most individuals."}
{"original": "It's still a horrible way to run a government, Schweikert said."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump turned up the heat this weekend on the country's most populous state, calling California out of control and soft on immigrants."}
{"original": "He vowed to cut funding to California if officials vote to declare it a sanctuary state for undocumented immigrants, and warned that California and his administration are on a collision course."}
{"original": "California is, as you know, out of control in many ways, Trump told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly in an interview aired Sunday before the Super Bowl."}
{"original": "A state Senate committee last Tuesday approved a bill that would prohibit all local law enforcement agencies from using resources to enforce federal immigration laws. Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco are already sanctuary cities."}
{"original": "I think it's ridiculous. Sanctuary cities, as you know, I'm very much opposed to sanctuary cities. They breed crime, there's a lot of problems, Trump said."}
{"original": "The president said he doesn't want to defund the state or city ― but if they're going to have sanctuary cities, we may have to do that. Certainly that would be a weapon."}
{"original": "If we have to, we'll defund, Trump went on. We give tremendous amounts of money to California."}
{"original": "In fact, California, which has the eighth largest economy in the world, receives approximately 78 cents for every dollar it pays the feds, according to the most recent analysis available by the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit think tank. A recent survey found that California is the fifth least dependent state in the nation on federal funds. In an interview last month, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said that the U.S. needs California more... than California needs it from an economic perspective. California is the economic engine of the country. (He also called Trump's plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border laughable.)"}
{"original": "But the University of California system would be vulnerable to federal funding reductions that would have to be made up by state money in the event of a cut. It receives at least $9 billion a year in grants, financial aid and research funds. Trump threatened to cut funds after violent protests at the University of California, Berkeley, in early February forced the cancellation of a speech on campus by the right-wing agitator Milo Yiannopoulos."}

Be sure to have debtors sign agreements or notes stipulating amounts advanced and repayment provisions as well as when they must make interest payments.

{"original": "Profit from paying your kids. Can your children help out with some of the chores connected with your business? Then a savvy way to take care of their allowances or spending money--at the expense of the IRS--is to pay them wages for work they do on behalf of the business. This is a perfectly legal way to keep income in the family, while shifting some out of your higher bracket and into their lower bracket. For this business expense to withstand IRS scrutiny, your children must actually render services and you must pay them reasonable wages."}
{"original": "Another break is that you sidestep Social Security taxes on the wages you pay your children under the age of 18. To qualify for the exemption, you must operate as a sole proprietorship, meaning the lone owner of a full-time or part-time business that's not formed as a corporation or partnership or do business as a husband-wife partnership.

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― None of this would have happened if only someone in the government had picked up the phone."}
{"original": "Annette Cowen manages 50 properties in Arkansas, mostly apartment buildings for low-income tenants with government-subsidized rent. She said her usual federal contact got furloughed when several agencies shut down last month, so she had nobody to tell her if the government would pay its share this month."}
{"original": "So last week she sent her tenants some upsetting letters."}
{"original": "Due to the shutdown of the federal government, your rental assistance portion of your rent is not being paid, Cowen said in her letter. As of now, you have no rental assistance and your rent must be paid prior to January 20th or eviction procedures may begin against you."}
{"original": "It turned out to be a false alarm. This week Cowen said she finally talked to an official who said she would still receive payments for the government's portion of her tenants' January rent. She said they would all get new, more reassuring letters."}
{"original": "But the eviction threat may be a picture of what's to come if the shutdown continues."}
{"original": "Cowen's tenants are beneficiaries of a little-known U.S. Department of Agriculture housing initiative that is essentially a rural counterpart to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's much larger programs. And those programs could be severely affected if the shutdown goes on for months or years, as President Donald Trump has said it might."}
{"original": "The housing agency has already said it's unable to renew some contracts with landlords in its Section 8 project-based rental assistance program, which supports 1.4 million households. Under the program, HUD contracts with private building owners to set aside at least 40 percent of their rental units for low-income families, including seniors and people with disabilities. The shutdown has prevented the agency from renewing 1,150 contracts, affecting more than 40,000 households."}
{"original": "An additional 2.2 million households use a different kind of Section 8 voucher that is portable, meaning families use it to find landlords on their own. That program is funded until March."}
{"original": "Spokespersons for HUD have not responded to requests for comment about whether it would be legal for landlords to evict tenants because of the government's failure to pay. The department has asked landlords to dip into their own reserve funds to meet expenses if necessary. It has said shutdown evictions have never happened before. But it has not informed tenants about how the shutdown could possibly affect them."}
{"original": "For the tenant-based voucher program, HUD regulations do not allow for landlords to evict tenants in the event that the government fails to pay its share. And the regulation doesn't allow landlords to charge tenants for what the government isn't paying."}
{"original": "During the term of the lease the owner may not terminate the tenancy of the family for nonpayment of the [public housing authority's] housing assistance payment, the regulation says."}
{"original": "There's no way that they can evict anybody. Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.)"}
{"original": "Section 8 beneficiaries are typically required to devote 30 percent of their income to rent, with the subsidy making up the rest."}
{"original": "If the shutdown drags on, and landlords start going broke, it's possible they could try to justify evictions based on another part of the regulation. It says owners can evict tenants for business or economic reasons, such as sale of the property, renovation of the unit, or desire to lease the unit at a higher rental."}
{"original": "The partial government shutdown, in its fourth week, is already the longest in history. Housing policy experts say landlords can only hold on for so long before they run out of money too."}
{"original": "This is uncharted territory, Michael Kane, executive director of the National Alliance of HUD Tenants, told HuffPost. He said the Section 8 system will start to break down as the shutdown continues, and building owners will be forced to eventually shift costs to tenants."}
{"original": "It's not clear if the regulation prohibiting landlords from evicting tenants with portable Section 8 vouchers also applies to project-based vouchers or to USDA's rural housing assistance programs. Some members of Congress said they didn't think any evictions would be legal."}
{"original": "There's no way that they can evict anybody, Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), the chairman of the House committee that oversees the USDA, said in reference to the Arkansas situation."}
{"original": "The USDA told HuffPost this week that rural rental assistance is fully funded for January, but didn't say anything about the following months."}
{"original": "Panic and confusion over a given program's status are the essential byproducts of a government shutdown. In 2011, for instance, the mere threat of a shutdown prompted a social services agency in Washington, D.C., to warn more than 100 elderly residents that they would lose their next home-delivered meal. The shutdown ultimately didn't happen."}
{"original": "Panic and confusion over a given program's status are the essential byproducts of a government shutdown."}
{"original": "The Arkansas situation got resolved thanks partly to media attention. Local TV stations did stories on the eviction threat, and HuffPost and NBCNews followed up. One resident, a 76-year-old retiree named Jerald McLelland, said he had no idea how he would pay his full rent."}
{"original": "I'll have to call the finance people that my finances my car and see if they will extend my payment and I will have to take that money to pay the rent ― that's the only way I can do it, McLelland told the local ABC affiliate."}
{"original": "Cowen said that because the government had shut down, she believed her agreement with USDA to house subsidized tenants was no longer in effect. There was nobody to tell her otherwise."}
{"original": "These complexes are not designed to make money, only to try to break even on a yearly basis. This is done in order to keep the rents as low as possible, Cowen said in an email. If the government does not open soon, my management company will have to send my employees home and my maintenance people that maintain these complexes because there will not be funds to pay the employees."}
{"original": "The USDA official who contacted Cowen this week, Cowen said, did so because there had been several inquiries from members of Congress, and presumably the news coverage had something to do with it."}
{"original": "We wouldn't allow that to happen, Rep. Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) said Thursday of the eviction threats."}
{"original": "Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) walked away from a request for comment in a Senate hallway."}
{"original": "The partial shutdown isn't anywhere near a resolution, and the threat to housing assistance is just one of many mounting problems. An estimated 800,000 federal employees have already missed paychecks. More than half of them have been deemed essential and have to keep working without pay."}
{"original": "But President Donald Trump has been steadfast in his demand that Congress appropriate $5 billion for 200 miles of wall (or fence) along a border that already has nearly 700 miles of barriers. Democrats haven't budged an inch, pointing out that Trump has repeatedly promised Mexico would pay for the wall."}
{"original": "If the shutdown goes on for another several weeks, it will begin to interfere not only with housing assistance but also the tax filing season and food benefits for tens of millions. And Cowen will be right back where she was last week."}
{"original": "The president says he's prepared for the shutdown to go on months, even years, Cowen said. My concern is, where am I going to get money?"}
{"original": "HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it. If you're willing to be interviewed, please provide a phone number."}

{"original": "Of the study, Cuomo said: If it was legalized in Jersey and it was legal in Massachusetts and the federal government allowed it to go ahead, what would that do to New York, because it's right in the middle? This is an important topic, it's a hotly debated topic, pardon the pun, and it'd be nice to have the facts in the middle of the debate once in a while."}

Unlike his recent predecessors, he took office with Americans equally split between approving and disapproving of his job performance, according to HuffPost Pollster's average of public polling ― and that marked a relative high point."}
{"original": "Within a month, Trump saw his disapproval ratings begin to rise as those who'd previously been neutral became increasingly less likely to give him the benefit of the doubt."}
{"original": "Trump's first months were marked by no honeymoon period to speak of and approval ratings far worse than any president has received this early in his tenure Gallup's Jeffrey M. Jones wrote in April, after Trump posted the worst first-quarter ratings for any president elected to his first term since World War II."}
{"original": "A year later, surveys are consistent in showing that a majority of the nation is unhappy with the president's performance. About 55 percent disapprove of the job he's done, per Pollster's average as of Saturday morning, while just under 41 percent approve."}
{"original": "That's an improvement from December, but these are still easily the worst numbers for a first-year president since pollsters first began keeping track. Trump's standing is similar to President Richard Nixon's months into the Senate hearings on the Watergate scandal. And, according to data collected by Charles Franklin, the director of the Marquette Law School poll, while individual pollsters' assessments of Trump vary, nearly all find him lagging behind his immediate predecessor, former President Barack Obama."}
{"original": "2. Trump's numbers are relatively stable."}
{"original": "In the last six months, Trump's approval rating has remained between 37 and 42 percent in Pollster's average, neither soaring nor dramatically crashing."}
{"original": "Trump's approval ratings aren't just noteworthy because they are low, CNN's Ryan Struyk noted Wednesday in an analysis of Gallup data. They are also the flattest, least fluid approval ratings for any elected president since modern surveys started."}
{"original": "During his first year, Trump's approval ratings have stayed within a narrow 10-point range ― from 45% at his inauguration to a low of 35% multiple times over the last several months, Struyk said. Former President Barack Obama's had moved 18 points, George W. Bush's had moved 39 points and Bill Clinton's had moved 22 points to this point in their tenures. In fact, only Lyndon B. Johnson had less movement in approval polling during his first year in office."}
{"original": "That could indicate that Trump may be close to his natural floor of support for the current political situation (the not-inconceivable development of something like a foreign policy crisis or an economic slump would, of course, change the calculus.)"}
{"original": "But it may also mean there's little room for him to rebound to a neutral or positive rating. Most Americans who disapprove of Trump say that they don't see anything positive about his record, and that there's almost nothing he can do to change their minds."}
{"original": "By contrast, his numbers ticked up during last fall's hurricane season, perhaps both because he saw some of his best ratings as president for his handling of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and because the weather-focused news cycle kept his name out of the headlines more than usual."}
{"original": "3. Opinions of Trump are deeply polarized, but he inspires more robust opposition than support."}
{"original": "Survey after survey conducted last year showed Americans to be immensely polarized on practically every political issue, with the clearest example being opinions of Trump himself. Opinions on many of the actions Trump has taken ― for instance, concerns about his administration's relationship with Russia ― remain more or less intractably divided along party lines. That polarization is another factor in the stability of Trump's ratings."}
{"original": "Americans' willingness to support a president across the aisle has shrunk dramatically in recent years. That trend accelerated markedly under Trump, who has reasonably strong ratings within his own party but remarkably little backing from the opposition."}
{"original": "Last spring, we noted that Republicans were 78 points likelier than Democrats to approve of Trump's first-quarter job performance. Between Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Bill Clinton, that gap was never above 50 points."}
{"original": "Although it's entirely true that most of the president's voters are sticking with him, it's also true that most is not the same as all. And notably, Trump's detractors are far more unified ― and vociferous ― than his supporters."}
{"original": "Nearly 60 percent of Trump voters strongly approve of his job performance, according to YouGov/Economist tracking data ― but nearly 90 percent of Clinton voters strongly disapprove."}
{"original": "Similarly, strong disapproval of the GOP's failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its successful bid to pass tax reform has consistently outstripped the strong approval of such efforts."}
{"original": "4. Views of the economy are way out of whack with views of the presidency."}
{"original": "Throughout 2017, pollsters found Americans generally happy with the state of the economy, but less happy with Trump."}
{"original": "If you take the president's scores out of this poll, you see a nation increasingly happy about the economy, pollster J. Ann Selzer told Bloomberg in July. When Trump's name is mentioned, the clouds gather."}
{"original": "That's unusual: Economic views are traditionally among the strongest drivers of presidential approval. As FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten noted last fall, past presidents dating back to Jimmy Carter had higher ratings on overall job approval than they did for their handling of the economy. Trump breaks that pattern in a major way."}
{"original": "It's perhaps understandable that the public wouldn't give Trump much credit for an economic revival that clearly predated his presidency. Nearly a year into Trump's term, voters are still more likely to say that Obama is responsible for the state of the economy."}
{"original": "But Trump's approval rating, Gallup found, is 9 to 14 points lower than the public's views of the economy would predict."}
{"original": "5. Trump's low approval rating probably matters for this year's elections."}
{"original": "It's still a little too soon to be talking about Trump's re-election prospects, but his unpopularity poses a more immediate problem for the GOP: The president's party tends to do worse in midterms when the president's ratings are low."}
{"original": "Historically, when voters are unhappy with a president, they take it out on his party during the midterm elections, The Weekly Standard's David Byler wrote this week. Trump's approval rating and the Republican share of the generic congressional vote typically aren't far off each other. This suggests that voters who disapprove of Trump are unwilling or at least hesitant to support the congressional GOP."}
{"original": "And while good economic indicators would normally be a boon to the GOP, Trump's unpopularity, and his tendency to dominate the news cycle, may overshadow them. This year's midterms are still months away, and there's plenty of time for things to change ― several recent surveys have shown the Democratic lead in congressional polling starting to taper."}
{"original": "But as things stand, Trump's position at the head of the party seems unlikely to do down-ballot Republican candidates many favors."}
{"original": "It's hard to get any traction on anything, so far, other than the president personally, Republican pollster Bill McInturff told NBC."}
{"original": "A few more roundups of the polling on Trump's first year:"}
{"original": "Pew Research: As Donald Trump's presidency approaches the one-year mark, 41% say Trump will be an unsuccessful president in the long run, while 23% say he will be successful and 34% say that it is too early to tell."}
{"original": "CBS's Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto: A year after President Donald Trump was sworn into office, he continues to receive historically low and highly partisan approval ratings, despite widely positive views of the economy. He gets at least some credit for the economy, but most Americans don't feel they've personally benefitted from his policies – only 22 percent think they've been directly helped."}
{"original": "YouGov's Kathy Frankovic: The President ends his first year in office with an approval rating higher than he has seen in months. While a majority of the public continues to disapprove, 42% in the latest Economist/YouGov Poll approve of the President's performance, a level not seen in these poll since February 2017."}
{"original": "Gallup's Justin McCarthy: Americans are split in their views on how President Donald Trump's performance in office compares with their expectations for him. About one in five (21%) say he has done better than they expected, while more, 35%, say he's done worse. The largest segment, 44%, says his performance has been about what they expected."}
{"original": "NBC's Mark Murray: President Donald Trump ends his first year in office with 39 percent of Americans approving of his job performance, according to the latest national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll — the lowest mark in the poll's history for any modern president ending his first year."}
{"original": "The Los Angeles Times' David Lauter: As the anniversary of Trump's inauguration approaches on Saturday, the president's support has eroded, his opposition has gained energy and his party faces bleak prospects for the midterm elections in November, according to a new USC-Dornsife/Los Angeles Times nationwide poll."}
{"original": "NPR's Jessica Taylor: As President Trump approaches the one-year anniversary of his inauguration, a majority of Americans think that his first year in office has been a failure and that he has divided the nation."}
{"original": "PALMA DE MALLORCA, Spain, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Spain's Princess Cristina appeared in court on Monday on charges of tax fraud, the first member of the royal family to stand in the dock, as a lengthy investigation into her husband's business affairs finally went to trial."}
{"original": "King Felipe's 50-year-old sister is one of 18 people on trial after a six-year investigation into the Noos Foundation, a charity run by her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, that prosecutors say was used to embezzle millions of euros in public funds."}
{"original": "Details of the investigation into the royal family emerged during the economic crisis when Spain was grappling with record unemployment and austerity and tapped into popular disgust at cases of high-level corruption among bankers and politicians."}
{"original": "Cristina arrived with her husband at the Mallorcan court to be greeted by a barrage of TV and press cameras."}
{"original": "Dressed simply in a grey trouser suit, she sat motionless in the court room fronted by a framed photo of King Felipe while the accusations were read out."}
{"original": "Her lawyers asked judges to drop the criminal charges against her as state prosecutors had previously said there was insufficient evidence to back up the accusations."}
{"original": "The charges were filed by the 'Clean Hands' anti-corruption organization using a Spanish legal instrument known as the 'people's accusation'."}
{"original": "The Spanish legal system is under pressure to get tough on corruption after a string of graft cases involving the establishment from the main political parties to bankers like former International Monetary Fund (IMF) head Rodrigo Rato."}
{"original": "The law must be equal for all, said newspaper El Pais on Monday in an editorial which said the fact the probe had come to trial showed the legal system worked, albeit at a slow pace."}
{"original": "Urdangarin, a former Olympic handball player, who was seated apart from his wife in the court, is accused of using his royal connections to win public contracts to put on events through the non-profit organization."}
{"original": "Prosecutors say some of the foundation's money was transferred to a company largely owned by the princess and Urdangarin and used to pay for personal items ranging from parking tickets to children's birthday parties."}
{"original": "Cristina is charged with two counts of being an accessory to tax fraud and, if found guilty, could face up to four years in prison for each charge - a maximum of eight years."}
{"original": "Urdangarin is accused of nine crimes including fraud and tax evasion with a combined potential jail sentence of 19 and a half years. Urdangarin and his partners allegedly overcharged local governments for putting on conferences about sports and business, then hid the proceeds abroad."}

{"original": "JAIME REINA via Getty Images Urdangarin, the princess' husband, is accused of using his royal connections to win public contracts to put on events through the charity. People display Republican flags and a Catalan independence flag protest outside the courtroom in Palma de Mallorca."}
{"original": "The other 16 people in the dock included the former regional head of the Balearic Islands government and other high-ranking officials from the islands and the Mediterranean region of Valencia."}
{"original": "The popularity of Spain's royal family has revived since former king Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014 in favor of his son Felipe, who is married to a former television journalist. The new king regularly tops popularity polls of public figures."}

{"original": "Under pressure from the White House and business groups, House Democrats agreed to further water down paid sick and family leave provisions in the coronavirus emergency bill currently awaiting a Senate vote."}
{"original": "Democrats had already vastly scaled back their proposals for paid sick leave and paid family leave. Instead of covering all workers, millions were left out of the version of the bill passed over the weekend. Still, the original compromise bill included 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for workers with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, symptoms of COVID-19 or those caring for others who are sick."}
{"original": "Now, after the legislative text was updated, those family leave provisions in the bill are much weaker. Paid family leave would only be available to parents who are home with kids due to school closure. The extended leave wouldn't be available for people who are sick with COVID-19. Those workers would only be able to take 10 days of paid sick leave ― and only if they work at a company with less than 500 employees. What's more: Companies with fewer than 50 workers can apply for hardship relief and get out of providing both sick and family leave."}
{"original": "The carve-outs that came in last night through pressure from Republicans and the White House have dramatically weakened what started out as a strong paid leave proposal that would've made a difference to tens of millions of families during this crisis, said Jessica Mason, senior policy analyst at the National Partnership for Women and Families. The so-called corrections actually gut those policies and weaken our nation's response to this pandemic."}
{"original": "Employers are also allowed to secure exemptions for individual employees who are first responders and health care professionals who may have to deal with emergency issues."}
{"original": "Politicians like to talk a good game about providing paid sick days to everyone, including Trump, said Vicki Shabo, a senior fellow and paid leave expert at New America."}
{"original": "Trump touted the bill's paid sick leave provisions on Tuesday in an update about the pandemic."}
{"original": "The bill is a disappointment to advocates who'd hoped the pandemic would finally push lawmakers to enact universal paid sick leave in the U.S. However, it still does contain provisions for COVID-19 testing and Medicaid expansion that will be helpful."}
{"original": "There are other parts of the bill, provisions related to Medicaid, that are incredibly important and that is why we continue to support passage of the bill, Mason said. but Congress needs to understand that the paid sick days and paid leave provisions do not begin to address the needs of families right now."}
{"original": "It could've been worse, said a senior Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations. The White House actually wanted to weaken a longstanding law that provides Americans with unpaid time off during a medical emergency. The administration sought to get rid of part of the 30-year-old Family and Medical Leave Act, which ensures workers can get health insurance while they're on long-term leave."}
{"original": "This was a nonstarter for the speaker, the aide said, referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who was also able to get a tax credit for small businesses to make it easier for them to offer the paid time off."}
{"original": "House Democrats said the changes were necessary in order to secure a bipartisan bill that would stand a greater chance of passage in the Republican-controlled Senate. Many GOP lawmakers voiced concern that the paid leave provisions would place further stress on small businesses that are slashing jobs due to anemic demand amid the crisis."}
{"original": "Congress is scrambling to do something bigger to deal with the coronavirus epidemic. They've already passed, and the president signed, an $8.5 billion package dealing with medical issues. The Senate this week is discussing a much larger stimulus package, up to at least $850 billion, to fight the spread of the disease and prop up the economy."}
{"original": "Congressional Republicans also seem to be getting behind the idea of simply sending Americans cash to deal with the economic downturn sparked by the epidemic."}
{"original": "It is my intention that the Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps, above and beyond what the House passed, to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a floor speech on Tuesday."}
{"original": "Keep up with the latest updates on the coronavirus at our live blog."}
{"original": "In the middle of a global pandemic, money is tight for everyone. Many people who find themselves suddenly unemployed need cash quickly, and some might be considering a side gig in online sex work. Starting an OnlyFans page or dabbling in any form of online sex work might seem like a viable option, especially when it seems like everyone is doing it anyway."}
{"original": "However, whether it's selling nude clips or performing live cam shows, online sex work is much more complicated, demanding and expensive than it may seem."}
{"original": "Even for experienced, full-time sex workers, just making an OnlyFans doesn't always pay the bills. Online sex work requires an entirely different skill set than in-person work like escorting and stripping, and it can pose greater risks to privacy and anonymity that many might not be willing to take."}
{"original": "I started dabbling in sex work about five years ago, when I was a broke freelance writer recovering from a severe depressive episode. I needed cash to support the work I wanted to be doing, so I started sugar dating. I decided to try exploring online sex work a couple of years after that, hoping for a side gig that was just as flexible and didn't require me to leave the house."}
{"original": "The first time I performed a live cam show, I had an ancient MacBook and spotty Wi-Fi. I'd been naked on the internet before, and though I still felt nervous and a little awkward, I thought the show mostly went off without a hitch. My viewers disagreed. My internet was too slow, my camera sucked, and I didn't have enough toys. They thought I was pretty, but few were willing to tip for a pixelated nipple flash. I made a little less than $100 over the course of an evening — not much, but better than nothing."}
{"original": "I studied the other women on the site for weeks and noticed that the top-earning performers had one thing in common: production value. If I wanted to earn anything close to sustainable income, I would at least need a webcam ($70 for a basic model, $250 for ultra HD), professional studio lights (at least $50), and a faster Wi-Fi connection (high-speed routers start around $150). If I was really serious, I would need more dildos, bigger dildos (body-safe silicone sex toys can range from $20 to almost $200), better lingerie ($100), and a teledildonic sex toy that allowed viewers to interact with me via Bluetooth ($125). Just being a sex worker costs much more than many people realize."}
{"original": "Money talk isn't sexy, but for sex workers, it's especially important."}
{"original": "I needed to spend money to make money, but I didn't have much, if anything, to spend. Almost all of my first paychecks from camming (and a few from my day job) went toward new equipment, and it was months before I actually broke even."}
{"original": "Even with all the bells and whistles, it's tough to make money online without a following, and building a loyal, reliable one can take years. It was a full year before I started making a somewhat steady income, and despite working full-time hours some weeks, the money I make is only supplemental to my freelance writing work."}
{"original": "Beyond all the props and equipment, online sex work requires incredible patience, persistence and a thick skin. Cam rooms can fill up with hundreds of demanding viewers who each want to be seen and feel special, sometimes argue amongst themselves, ask for services without offering payment, ignore rules and boundaries, or make negative comments about performers' bodies."}
{"original": "Not everyone can perform with unshakably positive energy, chatting for hours in front of anonymous viewers who don't respond or refuse to tip, or keep up with the never-ending work of self-promotion on social media. For all the people who are willing to pay for nude content, there are plenty of others who will never follow or subscribe ― but who will continue to harass models with unsolicited dick pics and DMs. Rejection hurts, and when there isn't much cash coming in, it can be tough not to let it show."}
{"original": "It's not impossible to make money as an online sex worker, but the likelihood of getting rich overnight selling grainy foot pics is incredibly low. Most sex workers aren't rich, and some barely make enough to survive. The money won't be quick or easy, and it won't be tax-free. I pay thousands of dollars in federal self-employment taxes every year, and because I'm a sex worker, I'll probably be self-employed for the rest of my working life."}
{"original": "My income often fluctuates, and there have been days when I've made a whopping $10 after spending hours on cam. Even if I managed to rake in a six-figure sex work salary, it still wouldn't come with health insurance or job security. And I would still have bad days. A sex worker's income can vary and fluctuate depending on a number of factors that have nothing to do with how good they are at their job. Sex work is incredibly difficult work, it's even more difficult to strike it rich."}
{"original": "Most of all, sex work will cost time, energy, and, sometimes, self-esteem."}
{"original": "Self-promotion, chatting with fans, even blocking messages from time-wasting viewers who refuse to pay all take time that often goes uncompensated. There will still be people who refuse to pay for porn, who ask for free stuff, or who even steal content, and that can be a distressing reality that takes a toll. Additionally, sex work is never truly anonymous ― and being naked on the internet, and the stigma that comes with it, can't be undone."}
{"original": "Money talk isn't sexy, but for sex workers, it's especially important. It can be tough to admit when we're struggling financially, and it's even more difficult to talk about money and when we don't have much because online sex work can be so isolating and stigmatized. It may be uncomfortable and complicated, but financial transparency in sex work is critical and makes some of us feel less alone. With so many sex workers struggling financially due to COVID-19, it's more crucial than ever."}
{"original": "For those considering entering the industry, it's important to know how much the job will actually cost. There's nothing wrong with dabbling or doing your best to make ends meet, because sex work can be necessary for basic survival. Just don't expect it to make you rich, and don't expect it to be easy."}

{"original": "There's not a lot that can prepare you for baby. But as you're riding out the late night feedings and sleep deprivation, it helps if you can cross one (kinda major) worry off your to-do list: your finances. No, you can't account for every single cost that's going to come up, but you can plan in a way to prepare yourself for the long, loving and expensive haul ahead."}
{"original": "No one enjoys this type of conversation, but it's so, so important to chat through the logistics of who will take care of baby (and handle their finances) should something happen to mom or dad. An estate planner or lawyer can help you put everything in writing once you choose a guardian, and help you figure out things you might not have thought to include… like at what age you'd entrust your child with his inheritance or where you expect your children to reside."}
{"original": "Speaking of who will handle the finances, getting a life insurance policy (or bolstering your current one is the best way to guarantee that your baby is taken care of should you no longer be able to provide for her. Sure, it's an icky topic to get into, but we promise it will bring peace of mind. With the help of a financial planner or insurance agent, you can quickly map out how much you'll need and figure out what type of coverage you qualify for."}
{"original": "Daycare, nanny share, your in-laws — whatever your child care arrangements may be, you'll want to start setting aside cash (and re-aligning your overall budget) now. In most cases, you'll be able to work out a ballpark figure for the average monthly cost even if you haven't committed to care just yet. Depending on the type of care you select, it's worth considering if you want to enroll in a dependent care FSA. (This basically gives you the option to tap into pre-tax dollars to cover qualified child care-related costs like daycare.) And while you're budgeting, don't forget to account for the incidentals: For example, some nannies require you to pay for groceries or chip in for gas while daycares require you to pre-pay in large chunks."}
{"original": "Yes, an evening babysitter is a separate expense from daytime child care. (Some babysitters charge as much as $15-$20 an hour as a nighttime rate, FYI.) To carve out funds before baby, try nicknaming (or subdividing) your savings account. Most banks offer this as an option since it allows you to label a savings goal and put savings dollars specifically toward that. (Think about it: It's much easier to direct $100 a month toward an account labeled mama needs a night out vs. a generic savings fund.)"}
{"original": "College! You're still wrapping your head around the fact that there's a baby the size of a lemon/eggplant/watermelon growing in your belly. Still, even if you're not ready to begin making regular deposits yourself, opening up a 529 plan — aka a tax-advantaged savings account to help you budget for future education costs — means you're set up for your relatives to kick in funds, too, when your baby is born. They can pay by check — which you can deposit — or you could try a new crowd-funding site like UGift to help spread the word. The benefits of the plan are huge: Besides the fact that earnings on the account are tax-free, more than 30 states offer additional credits for annual contributions."}
{"original": "The reason for this is twofold: You'll want to be aware of what's covered (and what's not) when it comes to prenatal and postnatal costs, but you'll also want to find out in advance how your medical insurance premiums will change when you add a dependent. It's as simple as a phone call — and will help you anticipate huge out-of-pocket expenses. (For example, genetic testing… or delivery itself, depending on your coverage.)"}
{"original": "My daughter and husband begged me not to do it. But I had seen one too many headlines about white people calling the police on black people for breathing. I had seen too many thinly veiled classist and racist Listserv comments, deployed from behind the safety of an iPhone. I was too frustrated with a growing number of city neighbors, full of digital courage but lacking basic face-to-face human decency. And now, too many of them are wasting my tax dollars with calls to the police."}
{"original": "I re-read the post on Nextdoor, a social networking site notoriously popular among gentrifiers, about calling the police on drivers blasting their car stereos too loud in our dense urban neighborhood. I crafted a biting response, and I hit post."}
{"original": "It did not bring back Tamir Rice or Trayvon Martin, but it did make me feel better."}
{"original": "It's a problem all around the country ― a clash between changes in communications technology and changes in neighborhood demographics. For every San Diego do-gooder patting themselves on the back for using social media to catch bike-riding thieves; there are communities like the the ones in Portland that are torn apart over questions of etiquette. Beyond what could and does go wrong when racially biased civilians play cops and robbers, I worry about what all of this neighborly digital surveillance is doing to the social glue of our communities. Sometimes it seems these technological tools, designed to facilitate human connection, bring more heat than light."}
{"original": "Before social media, our neighborhood had a superb network of black grandmothers (and grandfathers) who used to sweep the front porches of our skinny D.C. row houses and report any and all suspicious activities directly to us. They would tell you if someone stole your trash can or lingered too long on your porch. They knew which kid missed curfew, and whose marriage was on the rocks, and who was out of town on business. Sometimes, they'd bring over plates of grilled rabbit or pound cake."}

{"original": "Many of our new neighbors are friendly people who caught on to the warm, porch-sitting culture of our D.C. neighborhood, which was shaped by generations of black families with roots in Virginia, the Carolinas and parts further south. But others often don't return a simple hello on the street. Instead they pull out their iPhones and to log on to Twitter or Nextdoor to inquire about the weather or a lost bike, or to brag about calling the police on neighbors."}
{"original": "I need another social media feed like I need another tax deadline. But a few years ago, I decided to get on to Nextdoor, mostly as a defensive measure. I had been hearing about people using the site to post photos of perps in our neighborhood. These grainy surveillance pictures accompanied by frenzied, vague descriptions are bland enough to describe my husband and my son, who are 26 years and 50 pounds apart. It was only a matter of time before something went wrong with these self-appointed digital vigilantes."}
{"original": "We are a black family. And black people are currently under siege for walking babies while black, waiting at Starbucks while black, barbecueing while black and sleeping while black. When there is so little you can control, this was one thing I could do."}
{"original": "I thought of it as a community service: I wanted to know if some new neighbor was popping off about a beloved but eccentric neighborhood figure like Mr. Mumbles, a schizophrenic who rode his bike singing in a basso profundo so exquisite we dubbed him the voice of an angel. Or if someone was complaining about T., a sweet and completely harmless heroin addict who lived in a homeless shelter, who would wash cars and watch your back. If a new neighbor was posting about these men, I needed to know about it right away; that way, I could intervene."}
{"original": "I worry about what all of this 'neighborly' digital surveillance is doing to the social glue of our communities."}
{"original": "Some of my neighbors log on to do the same. It is our own counter-surveillance program. We monitor what amounts to a crime blotter for gentrification-related offenses. We all agreed that we need to keep our eyes on these strange people who moved into our community of skinny row houses. They move silently. They enter and exit through fortified garages, avoid eye contact and emerge only in odd hours. Often the only time we lay eyes on them is when our kids go trick-or-treating."}
{"original": "Some of them have strange ways. Just last week, a neighbor took to Nextdoor to post photos and complain about another neighbor's trash spilling over. This neighbor always complains about rats, but look at what their trash looks like! he ranted."}
{"original": "No doubt tipped off by someone in our clandestine network, the neighbor in question signed on to respond. We speak to each other every day, she told him. You never mentioned the trash issue to me. I had no idea that my English basement tenants had been leaving trash out like this. It would have been helpful if you told me, she typed. Boom."}
{"original": "A growing number of city neighbors, full of digital courage, but lacking basic face-to-face human decency."}
{"original": "In posting my response to the police-calling neighbor, I was just doing my part for the cause. But three days later, I got a notice from the site: A message you posted was reported by another Nextdoor member as violating Nextdoor's Community Guideline: Be Helpful, not Hurtful: Public shaming."}
{"original": "My comment would be reviewed by the appointed community moderators for my neighborhood, who would decide if it will be taken down. But I could also voluntarily edit my comment."}

{"original": "We've now passed the third week of January and do you know what that means? For a lot of us, it means our New Year's resolutions are already a thing of the past. It isn't that we're not committed to positive change. It's just that often we're not clear about how to achieve it. Especially if resolutions are general--sure, we all want to lose weight or save more money, but it can be hard to follow through."}
{"original": "So what's the answer? First, when it comes to your finances, get specific about what you really want to accomplish. For instance, how much do you want to save each month? What bills do you want to pay off first? The second essential part of success is making a plan and then sticking with it. The following financial hacks are designed to help make it easy--almost automatic--to stay on track. Basically, these are simple things you can set in motion now that can keep you going in the right direction all year long."}
{"original": "Seven quick ways to set yourself up for success"}
{"original": "Set up automatic deductions from checking to savings. If you're contributing to a 401(k), you know how easy it is to adjust to an automatic deduction from your paycheck. So why not do the same for your other savings goals? Whether you're saving for a house, a child's college, or building a vacation fund, automatic deductions from checking to savings will add up without you having to think too much about it. Amp up your retirement savings. It's great to stash away money in your retirement account every month, but are you saving enough? If you're over 25 and saving less than 10 percent of your salary, you should consider increasing the percentage. Expecting a bonus? Send the bulk of it to savings. Create a calendar. Don't risk incurring a penalty by missing a due date. Put all important financial dates on your calendar such as estimated taxes, property taxes and RMDs. Set up reminders a few days in advance of the due date. Put bills on auto pay. Avoid late fees by putting your recurring bills--mortgage payments, utilities, insurance premiums, phone and Internet--on automatic. Just be sure to check in periodically to make sure the proper amounts are being deducted. Build a cash cushion. Resolutions can quickly get off track when you're faced with a financial emergency. As a buffer, you ideally want to have enough cash handy to cover three to six months' essential expenses. Sound impossible? Look back at number 1."}
{"original": "Figure out how much you can afford to put toward your emergency fund each month and have that amount automatically deposited in a savings account especially earmarked for that purpose. When you reach your goal, you can put these savings toward something else. Invest like a pro--without the hassle. If you don't have the time or expertise to monitor and rebalance your investments, consider using an automatic investment advisory service. Let the pros help build and manage your portfolio in keeping with your personal goals--minus the hassle. Make financial date-night a regular event. A little moral support can go a long way. Set up a regular time to discuss your financial goals and realities with your spouse, partner or a trusted friend to share tips and help each other stay on track. And be sure to celebrate your successes!"}
{"original": "Making positive financial change isn't a once a year event, it's a constant commitment. To me, the best way to succeed is to make staying on top of your finances a healthy habit rather than a yearly challenge. I believe that if you put these seven things in motion now, handling your finances will become second nature. Then you won't need to make annual resolutions--you'll be on the path to lifelong success."}

{"original": "Zhang Peng via Getty Images KFC opened its first restaurant in China in Beijing in the late 80s and now has more than 5,000 outlets."}
{"original": "When KFC opened its first restaurant in Beijing in 1987, people from all over the city flocked there for a taste of America. Foreign brands were still a novelty after the restrictions of the Mao Tse-tung era. Foreign fast-food restaurants represented quality and modernity, with KFC's shiny three-story restaurant in China's capital its largest in the world, seating up to 500 people."}
{"original": "A KFC meal was considered a luxury to most residents at the time, referred to as fine dining. Given that the average monthly wage in China was around 100 yuan ($15 in today's money), most people ate at the restaurant (with its 6-yuan hamburgers and 2.5-yuan fried chicken meals) only on special occasions."}
{"original": "Today, KFC is the biggest fast-food brand in China, with more than 5,000 outlets. And over the last 30 years, KFC has been joined in China by Taco Bell, McDonald's and Pizza Hut."}
{"original": "But this fast-food love affair comes at a cost. It is a diet that has been linked by health academics to the rapid rise of diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. And its popularity appears to be slowing as a younger generation begins to make more healthful choices and demand better options."}
{"original": "In October, a study published the Healthy High Density Cities Lab at the University of Hong Kong, in collaboration with Oxford University, showed that people living near fast-food outlets have higher rates of Type 2 diabetes."}
{"original": "We know it is unhealthy food, we know it adds calories, we know from other countries eating food that is disproportionately high in fats and salts is linked to obesity and hypertension, said Barry Popkin, professor of global nutrition at the University of North Carolina. Popkin has worked closely with the Chinese government on public health and nutrition, coordinating the long-running China Health and Nutrition Survey."}
{"original": "Liu Liqun via Getty Images Fast-food restaurants have proliferated in Shenzhen, a city in southeastern China."}
{"original": "The influence of junk food companies in China has been in the spotlight this month as Coca-Cola came under fire for lobbying Beijing's health ministers in an effort to obtain tax cuts and avoid regulations, such as soda taxes."}
{"original": "China is so big I think most Western [fast food] brands want a foothold there. Many of their CEOs have said this publicly and noted how important China is to their bottom lines. This has been part of the globalization project and has happened relatively quickly, said Mia MacDonald, executive director of Brighter Green, a public policy organization."}
{"original": "Rapid urbanization and the greater availability and access to fast-food outlets are driving a shift in people's diets, nutrition experts say. There is an allure around these brands because they are from the West and represent something very clean and modern — something that was previously inaccessible when lives were more rural, said Judy Bankman, a consultant and co-author of the Brighter Green report Chronic Disease, Changing Diets and Sustainability."}
{"original": "But the rise of diets heavy in salt, sugar and processed meat is linked to the increase of chronic illness across the country, said Popkin, a world expert best-known for coining the term nutrition transition, which describes the transition of developing countries from traditional diets high in cereal and fiber to western diets that are high in sugar, fat and animal-based products. That nutrition transition has been the case in China."}
{"original": "It is happening in all of Asia, but China is the fastest because its income is growing the fastest and the government is really pushing consumption, he said. But China has not done anything to regulate the intake of fats, sodium, sugar in a serious way."}
{"original": "Since 2014, China has had the highest number of obese adults (with the U.S. second), according to research from the medical journal The Lancet. Thirty percent of Chinese adults are overweight, and 12 percent are obese, according to China's health watchdog, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention."}
{"original": "The country has more than 100 million diabetics — with Chinese adolescents ages 12 to 18 about four times more likely to develop diabetes than American teenagers. The higher risk factor in China is due to the rate of urbanization and economic development (increasing access to unhealthful food in cities), which contributes to diabetes. Genetic studies have suggested that inherited factors in the Chinese population may increase the risks too when compared with Caucasians."}
{"original": "Popkin said that unless swift action is taken to improve both disease prevention and treatment, the results could be grave for China. The intake of salty snacks, for example, has increased by a factor of 2.5 from 2005 to 2017, according to research at the University of North Carolina."}
{"original": "Adult mortality will start to increase and offset the declines in mortality ... from cutting infectious diseases and undernutrition. [People in China] are slowly moving to a point where we are predicting that mortality and disability will go up. ... It is a serious issue that health professionals talk about but the government is not acting on, Popkin said."}
{"original": "However, there are signs Chinese consumers may be starting to switch away from junk food. China's fast-food sector is expected to show an annual expansion of just 2 percent in 2019, its slowest since 2016, according to Bloomberg."}
{"original": "In the pockets of affluent districts in Shanghai and Beijing, there are a growing number of organic cafes and farmers markets springing up in fashionable malls."}
{"original": "There is increasing demand for more healthful food, said Cecilia Zhou, chief project officer at the Good Food Fund, an organization based in Beijing that promotes nutritional health."}
{"original": "While China's national health has suffered as a result of worsening diets, there are younger people, such as Zhou, who are demanding something different. They care more about the environment and food ethics. That's why vegan and or vegetarian lifestyles are becoming more popular among the younger generation, she said."}

{"original": "Republican lawmakers' massive tax plan appears to be on the cusp of legislative victory. From a public opinion standpoint, that may not be such a good thing."}
{"original": "The tax bill, if enacted, would be among the least popular pieces of major legislation signed into law since the 1990s. Support for the bill stands at an average of about 32 percent, according to current polls, with nearly half of the public opposed."}
{"original": "In retrospect, support for the Affordable Care Act when it was newly enacted looks downright robust. When President Barack Obama's health care law passed in March 2010, it faced similar levels of opposition, but considerably higher levels of favor: On average, about 42 percent of Americans supported it. Yet even those comparatively rosy numbers were enough to leave Democrats ducking furious constituents and, according to some research, helped doom the party to a historic midterm election defeat later that year."}
{"original": "Today's tax bill fares at least as badly when compared to the Affordable Care Act on other measures. Just 27 percent of Americans in CNN's most recent survey think that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans made a good faith effort to cooperate with Democrats on the tax bill. In 2010, 48 percent thought that President Obama and the Democrats had reached across the aisle on health care reform."}
{"original": "According to a poll taken around the time the Affordable Care Act was passed, 35 percent of Americans expected the legislation to hurt them personally. The tax plan faces similarly inauspicious numbers — 32 percent expect it to make things worse for them according to a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, while 37 percent say the same in CNN's survey. According to two other polls, from Quinnipiac University and Monmouth University, between 44 and 50 percent of respondents expect their own taxes to rise."}
{"original": "Changing that narrative may prove difficult. In a survey conducted by Republican pollsters for a pro-Trump organization, only half of the voters in GOP-held congressional districts support the plan, even after being introduced to key features of the bill and hearing the messages on both sides of the tax reform debate. Even among Americans who'll see their taxes fall, there's no guarantee that they'll notice — or that they'll look more fondly on the Republicans' effort."}
{"original": "A cautionary tale from 2010 for R's hoping public opinion will change on tax cuts once voters experience them https://t.co/6On6f4CqEb — Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) December 18, 2017"}
{"original": "Republicans may instead be hoping that when voters head to the ballot box next year, the tax bill isn't at the top of many minds."}
{"original": "There are strong reasons to think Republicans will get that wish. In the HuffPost/YouGov poll, barely more than a third of Americans who opposed the tax bill said they were following its progress very closely. Just 13 percent of those opponents named it among the two issues most important to them. Overall among opponents, the tax bill ranked seventh on a list of 12 issues. Health care ranked first, as it has for much of this year. If that doesn't change, the tax bill's unpopularity may not help its opponents electorally in the way Obamacare did — and continues to do."}
{"original": "But although the tax bill may not drag Republicans down, it appears unlikely to prove much of an asset in the midterms either — which still leaves the GOP in distinctly bad shape."}
{"original": "It's totally plausible that this bill has no effect on public opinion relative to baseline, political scientist Jonathan Ladd tweeted Tuesday. But that's with our baseline being [that Republicans] are behind in the congressional generic ballot by around 10 points. And that's a margin that should make Republicans nervous."}
{"original": "SIphotography via Getty Images No, it really isn't an opportunity to mismanage your savings."}
{"original": "Let's face it: Nowadays, most workers don't stay in the same job or work for the same company for the duration of their careers. But what happens if you funded a 401(k) and then switch jobs, leave your company or get laid off? What happens to the money you accumulated when you move on?"}
{"original": "The important thing to know is you get to decide what happens to it. Here are some of your options, assuming you are too young to begin taking distributions:"}
{"original": "Yes, you can do absolutely nothing ― which means your 401(k) will stay with the employer you are leaving and that company will continue to manage it. You will receive regular statements on how your money is doing. Your former employer will no longer be offering any match for contributions, of course, which makes sense since you won't be making any more contributions to this account anyway."}
{"original": "Doing nothing is a perfectly sensible option. For one, if you are happy with your funds' performance, your fund choices and the fees that you are charged, it means you won't have to upset the apple cart just because you want to switch jobs."}
{"original": "But one thing you will want to check is whether the company you are leaving is OK with you leaving your money behind. You do that by asking. It's also an excellent opportunity to inquire how much your fees are and will be for leaving your money behind."}
{"original": "Most plans will let you leave your 401(k) where it is ― but not all of them. In some cases, they won't allow it if you have only a small amount saved, generally $1,000 or less. Should the company not want to continue managing your fund, you will have 60 days after you leave to figure out where to put your money. If you miss that deadline, your 401(k) money may wind up being sent directly to you, an act that could leave you exposed to early withdrawal penalties and taxes."}
{"original": "The best advice we can offer about doing nothing is this: If you are going to do nothing, do it as a proactive choice, not as a default born from inaction. In other words, understand what all your options are. And if you pick leaving it with your former company, do so because it is your best choice and not just because you forgot about it."}
{"original": "If you are leaving for another job, you may roll over an old 401(k) into a new 401(k) account with your new company. This means you will be merging your old savings and having it plus your new savings managed by your new employer. That's perfectly fine, but not without a few land mines to avoid."}
{"original": "If you've switched jobs, find out whether your new employer offers a 401(k) and when you are eligible to participate in it. Frequently, new employees are required to work for a certain number of months before they become eligible to enroll in a company's retirement savings plan. Find out when you can enroll first because you can't roll over your old 401(k) until you are enrolled in a new plan."}
{"original": "Then it's pretty easy. You can direct the administrator of the old plan to move the contents of your account directly into your new plan. It's just some paperwork ― but you don't want to get stuck holding the bag, so to speak."}
{"original": "And that's what will happen if you don't have a new account ready to receive it: The balance of your old account will be distributed to you in the form of a check if you haven't directed it to be rolled over into your new 401(k). Should you wind up with a check made out to you with the balance of your former 401(k), you must deposit the money into your new 401(k) within 60 days to avoid paying income tax on the distribution. So, make sure your new 401(k) account is active and ready to receive contributions before you liquidate your old account."}
{"original": "If you are switching jobs to work for a company that doesn't offer a retirement plan that you can roll funds into, you can consider opening an individual retirement account to move your 401(k) funds into and continue your retirement savings. (You can actually open an IRA any time, and there really isn't any downside to having both a 401(k) and an IRA.)"}
{"original": "The two platforms are similar. A 401(k) is what companies offer to workers, and companies often offer to match a certain level of contributions for each employee. A traditional IRA has no such match, but does give the saver more freedom to manage his or her own money. A Roth IRA is a third type of retirement savings plan. It offers the same ability to manage your own money as the traditional IRA, plus has no required minimum distributions in retirement."}
{"original": "Both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs have caps on how much you can contribute annually ― and those ceilings may get in the way of you saving adequately for retirement."}
{"original": "There basically isn't a wrong answer here. If you do have the option of a 401(k) at work with an employer match, generally you want to take advantage of that and fund it first. Why walk away from free money when it's offered?"}
{"original": "While there is nothing legally stopping you from liquidating your old 401(k) and taking a lump-sum distribution, you probably shouldn't. Why were you saving in the first place if you intended to deplete your retirement savings unnecessarily just because you could? You will have to include the distribution in your yearly income tax filing, and the tax burden of a full withdrawal may not be worth what feels like a windfall at the moment."}
{"original": "How big a hit will you take? You will be taxed at your regular income tax rate and pay a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the distribution if you take it before you are 59.5 years old. You can calculate just how much it will cost you with this calculator."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― Democrats on Capitol Hill are preparing to push through a large coronavirus relief package ― without Republican support, if necessary ― in order to confront what they're calling a historic health and economic crisis in America."}
{"original": "Only big, bold action is called for, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech on Thursday, pledging to move forward and pass a bill even if Republicans object to the measure."}
{"original": "Democrats can muscle through spending legislation with only 51 votes in the Senate through a special procedure called budget reconciliation ― the same procedure that Republicans utilized several times over the past two decades to advance their agenda, including to enact broad tax cuts in 2017."}
{"original": "President Joe Biden has proposed a sprawling $1.9 trillion relief bill that would send $1,400 checks to most Americans, extend federal unemployment benefits through September and increase funding for vaccine distribution ― as well as enact a lot of other economic policies, such as raising the minimum wage, that Republicans feel are irrelevant to the pandemic."}
{"original": "After Democratic senators huddled with White House economic advisers on a conference call Thursday, lawmakers seemed to emerge with a consensus on moving ahead along the lines of Biden's original proposal, which incorporates a lot of policies that congressional Democrats previously endorsed."}
{"original": "We will continue to reach out to Republicans but I'm a big supporter of having an insurance policy. ... The way things are looking now, I think we're going to need an insurance policy, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), referring to budget reconciliation."}
{"original": "Republicans, meanwhile, are upset that Biden is pushing forward a large COVID-19 package so soon after Congress appropriated $900 billion for coronavirus relief in December. They also argue that doing so via budget reconciliation flies in the face of the president's call for unity in his inaugural speech earlier this month. On Inauguration Day, Biden urged the nation to temper its political discourse and come together to reject extremism and white supremacy in the wake of Donald Trump's disastrous presidency. He didn't say Democrats would not do things they campaigned on."}
{"original": "One Republican senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity expressed disappointment with Biden for not reeling back his party and coming down from his ask of $1.9 trillion for COVID-19 relief, warning that sticking to the Democrats' current demands would poison the well for cooperation in the Senate."}
{"original": "It would be like declaring war around here. And you've got impeachment on top of it, the GOP senator said Thursday. This is not a good way to start off."}
{"original": "But Democrats dismissed GOP objections about the process, noting that using budget reconciliation doesn't mean Republicans can't vote."}
{"original": "Cry me a river, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told HuffPost."}
{"original": "I can guarantee you, no one back home cares. They just want their relief, added Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii)."}
{"original": "Bipartisanship matters more in the Senate than the House because Democrats hold only 50 seats and Senate rules effectively require 60 votes for most legislation to pass. But Democrats can use the budget reconciliation process to pass legislation with only 51 votes, including the tie-breaker from Vice President Kamala Harris. The procedure is part of the annual budget process and can be used once per fiscal year, and only for measures that affect spending and revenue. (It's not clear, for instance, if Democrats could change the minimum wage through reconciliation.)"}
{"original": "Another factor with reconciliation: It takes time, since both chambers have to pass a budget resolution before they can pass the reconciliation measure with the desired policy changes. Senate Democrats are expected to begin consideration of a budget resolution next week. They'll need every Democrat on board to proceed."}
{"original": "Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) was coy about his support for budget reconciliation when asked by reporters on Thursday."}
{"original": "We're going to make Joe Biden successful, Manchin said repeatedly."}
{"original": "The White House has indicated it wants Congress to pass a relief package by March, when federal unemployment benefits for 11 million workers will begin to expire. The Senate also has to contend with confirming Biden's Cabinet nominees and trying Trump for inciting the deadly Capitol riot on Jan. 6."}
{"original": "Lawmakers have floated the idea of passing a small bill with relief checks and vaccine money, then passing a bigger bill later, but White House press secretary Jen Psaki rejected that idea on Thursday, saying we aren't looking to split a package in two."}
{"original": "Republicans can still vote for a package even if it goes through reconciliation, Psaki added."}
{"original": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that next week the House would advance budget legislation that lays the groundwork for using the reconciliation process, which she held out as an option Democrats would use only with great reluctance."}
{"original": "We'll pass a reconciliation bill if we need it, Pelosi said. We would hope that we would have bipartisan cooperation to meet the needs of the American people."}
{"original": "The federal government would pay most parents of young children $350 per child every month under a groundbreaking new proposal from Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) that would put a serious dent in child poverty."}
{"original": "Parents would get $350 for each child younger than 6 and $250 for kids between 6 and 17 under Romney's Family Security Act, which he unveiled Thursday as Democrats prepare to pass a big pandemic relief bill in the coming weeks."}
{"original": "American families are facing greater financial strain, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, and marriage and birth rates are at an all-time low, Romney said in a release."}
{"original": "On top of that, we have not comprehensively reformed our family support system in nearly three decades, and our changing economy has left millions of families behind, Romney said. Now is the time to renew our commitment to families to help them meet the challenges they face as they take on most important work any of us will ever do—raising our society's children."}
{"original": "Romney's proposal closely resembles a Democratic plan to boost the child tax credit as part of the party's coronavirus legislation. The tax credit changes have received less attention than an extension of unemployment benefits, vaccine distribution funds and one-time payments of $1,400 for most Americans."}
{"original": "But social policy experts are watching the child credit changes closely. The U.S. is one of the only developed countries that doesn't pay parents a child benefit or child allowance. Romney's proposal shows there is bipartisan support for the policy."}
{"original": "Democrats want to raise the maximum value of the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600, make it fully refundable so that poorer parents qualify, and have the Internal Revenue Service distribute the payments in advance, on a monthly basis ― essentially reverse-engineering a child allowance through the tax code."}
{"original": "Romney's Family Security Act is bolder. It would pay benefits through the Social Security Administration instead of the Internal Revenue Service, which has less experience with monthly payments. The new payments would replace several tax benefits, including the child tax credit and the deduction for state and local taxes, as well as the entire Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program ― all likely nonstarters for Democrats."}
{"original": "Monthly payments would be available to expecting parents four months before their kids are born. Benefits would be capped at $1,250 per month and couples with combined incomes above $400,000 would get less. Something like 90% of households with children would qualify."}
{"original": "Both Romney's and the Democratic proposals would slash child poverty. An analysis by the Niskanen Center, a moderate think tank that has helped Democrats develop their tax credit ideas and that helped Romney with his, said Romney's proposal would reduce child poverty by nearly a third, while Biden's would reduce it by 39%. If Congress adopted Romney's idea without the offsetting cuts to other programs, it would reduce child poverty by 40%."}
{"original": "Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chair of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees tax policy and also Social Security, called Romney's ideas encouraging."}
{"original": "While I would not support diverting funds from other poverty-fighting programs to offset the cost, I look forward to working with Senator Romney to make a monthly child benefit a reality, Wyden said."}
{"original": "White House press secretary Jen Psaki declined to comment during a press briefing Thursday, saying the White House hadn't analyzed Romney's proposal."}
{"original": "Romney's aides described his proposal as more of an effort to encourage child-rearing than to cut poverty. Utah has one of the higher fertility rates among states, and Romney himself has five kids."}
{"original": "We simply think this is about making a national commitment to America's families, an aide said."}
{"original": "Romney has no cosponsors for his idea but intends for the proposal to jump-start the conversation about family benefits, and his aides said the senator hoped Democrats would consider incorporating his idea in their forthcoming coronavirus relief bill. Support for new family assistance has been building among lawmakers for years."}
{"original": "The Family Security Act represents a huge change for Romney himself. In the 2012 presidential election, he bogusly criticized President Barack Obama for supposedly gutting the work requirements of the TANF program, which is the federal government's main source of cash assistance for parents who aren't disabled."}
{"original": "Under Obama's plan, you wouldn't have to work and wouldn't have to train for a job, Romney's 2012 campaign ads said. They just send you your welfare check."}
{"original": "Now Romney is proposing replacing TANF altogether with no-strings-attached benefits. He'll just send you your check."}
{"original": "Dems Slowly Go After Trump's Tax Returns"}
{"original": "Now that they have a majority in the House, Democrats can go after President Donald Trump's tax returns. So why are they taking so long?"}
{"original": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) — Climate-change leaders and campaigners worldwide welcomed U.S. President Joe Biden's move to rejoin the 2015 Paris Agreement but said Washington must also cut emissions and use its influence to encourage other countries to do the same."}
{"original": "In one of his first acts as president, Biden issued an executive order on Wednesday to bring the United States, the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, back into the global treaty committing nearly 200 countries to halt rising temperatures quickly enough to avoid disastrous climate change."}
{"original": "Washington formally left the Paris accord last year but its role as a heavyweight in global climate negotiations had already stalled with the 2016 election of President Donald Trump."}
{"original": "Trump cast doubt on climate science and asserted that the accord was an economic burden. U.N. climate negotiations have stuttered since then, with multiple summits failing to deliver ambitious action."}
{"original": "I wouldn't be surprised if they get a standing ovation just by entering the room, former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said, referring to a U.S. return to global climate talks. That doesn't mean that they will have a standing ovation forever. They have to prove that they are really determined to make the changes that are necessary."}
{"original": "U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres welcomed the U.S. return to the Paris accord but added: There is a very long way to go. The climate crisis continues to worsen and time is running out to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius and build more climate-resilient societies that help to protect the most vulnerable."}
{"original": "Climate diplomats said they want to see an ambitious U.S. commitment to cut emissions this decade and a diplomatic push to convince others to follow suit. Top of the list would be China, the world's biggest polluter, which plans to become carbon neutral by 2060 but has yet to unveil a short-term plan to reduce emissions."}
{"original": "Climate agreements signed by China and the United States played a big role in securing a deal at the Paris climate talks in 2015."}
{"original": "But during the Trump administration, climate became another source of friction between the world's two biggest economies, and experts said it was unlikely that their relationship could immediately return to normal."}
{"original": "A lot has changed since the Obama years that will make the G2 climate relationship under Biden unpredictable, said Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer for Greenpeace East Asia, referring to the United States and China as the G2."}
{"original": "Li pointed to the rock-bottom U.S.-China relationship and divisive politics that create challenges for climate engagement."}
{"original": "What remains unchanged is the need for the G2 to move towards the same direction ... Now the task is for the pair to switch to high gear, holding each other's hand or not, Li said."}
{"original": "Biden has said he wants to put the United States on track to net zero emissions by 2050 but has yet to detail what regulatory tools he intends to use to achieve that goal."}

{"original": "The president-elect threw women a lifeline this week when he unveiled a massive $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal that aims to both address the pandemic and the economic crisis it's caused."}
{"original": "With the bar set so low by the outgoing Trump administration, the plan is already remarkable simply for existing. President Donald Trump never once articulated a vision on how to address COVID-19 beyond create a vaccine and open up the economy."}
{"original": "With this plan, President-elect Joe Biden and his advisers clearly recognize that the economy can't open without addressing the economic problems that have arisen as a result of the pandemic — namely, women's economic needs and the dual burden so many are facing now, and have always faced, as both caregivers and breadwinners."}
{"original": "Today, too many women are struggling to make ends meet and support their families. This was true before the COVID-19 crisis, said economist Cecilia Rouse, Biden's pick to chair the Council of Economic Advisers, on a call with reporters Friday morning about the $1.9 trillion plan. Women, particularly women of color, have never had a fair shot at getting ahead in this country."}
{"original": "AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana Every issue is a woman's issue, said economist Cecilia Rouse, pictured here in 2009."}
{"original": "For so long in the United States, women were left to figure out how to manage both a paying job and the unpaid work at home. There's no maternity leave for new parents, and a chronically underfunded child care system staffed largely by women who are underpaid."}
{"original": "What's more, women make up the majority of the lowest wage earners."}
{"original": "That already-fragile and untenable system is now at code red levels during the pandemic: Some 2.2 million women have been forced out of work, many of them mothers who had to care for children in virtual or hybrid school."}
{"original": "Millions of other women, overrepresented in some of the most hard-hit industries, have lost jobs. Women of color have borne the brunt: 154,000 Black women left the workforce in December alone; that same month, all the jobs lost in the economy were held by women, mainly women of color."}
{"original": "The Biden plan includes a raft of policies that will help: up to 14 weeks of paid family and medical leave, as well as increased funding to schools and child care centers so they can reopen (or stay open). There are also child care tax credits for parents (though they won't actually see those benefits until 2022)."}
{"original": "The idea is that parents (mostly mothers) can get their kids back to school so they can get back to work. If that's not possible, there's real paid time off — 100% of your pay up to $1,400 a week for 14 weeks ― so you don't go broke doing the caregiving work that is getting so many families through the crisis."}
{"original": "This is really throwing a lifeline to caregivers, mostly women, to make it through to the end of the pandemic, said Michelle McGrain, the director of congressional relations for economic justice at the National Partnership for Women & Families. She was echoing the sentiment of most progressive women's advocates, who are pleased with the Biden proposal."}
{"original": "This is really throwing a lifeline to caregivers, mostly women, to make it through to the end of the pandemic. Michelle McGrain, National Partnership for Women & Families"}
{"original": "There are also two key measures in the Biden plan that, at first glance, wouldn't seem to fall in the category of women's policies. Biden is calling on Congress to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and get rid of the tipped minimum wage, the reduced hourly wage floor paid to restaurant servers who must then rely on tips to get by."}
{"original": "Because women make up the majority of minimum-wage workers, raising the minimum wage is a way to narrow the pay gap between men and women. Right now, women make about 80 cents for every dollar men earn. And the gap for Black women is far wider."}
{"original": "A recent study found that raising the minimum wage back in 1966 was responsible for shrinking a significant percentage of the Black-white earnings gap, and it is far more effective than any kind of diversity training."}
{"original": "For now, though, this is all a dream, though one that is closer to coming true than at any other moment in recent memory. Advocates and others are hopeful that with a slim majority in Congress, Democrats will be able to get this plan through."}
{"original": "And policies like paid leave do have bipartisan support around the country, polls have shown. So far, even business interests seem on board. Both the Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable have put out statements supporting this massive proposal."}

{"original": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc is slated to begin a tax trial in a San Francisco court on Tuesday, as the Internal Revenue Service tries to convince a judge the world's largest social media company owes more than $9 billion linked to its decision to shift profits to Ireland."}
{"original": "The trial, which Facebook expects will take three to four weeks, could see top executives including hardware chief Andrew Bosworth and Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer called to testify, according to a document the company filed in January."}
{"original": "The witness list also includes Naomi Gleit and Javier Olivan, veterans of Facebook's aggressive growth team, and Chief Revenue Officer David Fischer."}
{"original": "The IRS argues that Facebook understated the value of the intellectual property it sold to an Irish subsidiary in 2010 while building out global operations, a move common among U.S. multinationals. Ireland has lower corporate tax rates than the United States, so the move reduced the company's tax bill."}
{"original": "Under the arrangement, Facebook's subsidiaries pay royalties to the U.S.-based parent for access to its trademark, users and platform technologies. From 2010 to 2016, Facebook Ireland paid Facebook U.S. more than $14 billion in royalties and cost-sharing payments, according to the court filing."}
{"original": "The company said the low valuation reflected the risks associated with Facebook's international expansion, which took place in 2010 before its IPO and the development of its most lucrative digital advertising products."}
{"original": "Facebook Ireland and Facebook's other foreign affiliates - not Facebook US - led the high-risk, and ultimately successful, international effort to sell Facebook ads, the company said in a pre-trial memorandum."}
{"original": "Facebook is the world's second-biggest seller of online ads after Alphabet Inc's Google. Monthly users of its core social network climbed 8% to 2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, while 2.9 billion people used one of its apps - Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger - each month."}
{"original": "Bertie Thomson, a Facebook spokeswoman, said the company stood by the decisions in 2010 when it had no mobile advertising revenue, its international business was nascent and its digital advertising products were unproven."}

{"original": "The Donald Trump presidency is now one year old and in many respects ― the unhinged tweeting, the contempt for democratic norms, the potential collusion with a hostile foreign power ― it has been unlike any presidency in history."}
{"original": "But there is one respect in which Trump's tenure in office has been rather ordinary: his administration's year-long effort to push familiar Republican initiatives that shift money and power towards corporations and the rich, and away from everybody else."}
{"original": "No, this is not the kind of presidency that Trump promised. As a candidate, he portrayed himself as a different sort of Republican, one who would attack the financial industry, govern independently of wealthy special interests, and protect public programs on which poor and middle-class Americans depend."}
{"original": "On Inauguration Day, speaking from the steps of the Capitol building, Trump reaffirmed those allegiances and priorities: We are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington D.C., and giving it back to you, the people."}
{"original": "Of course, when Trump vowed to protect the forgotten men and women of our country, he likely had a specific subset of men and women in mind ― working-class Americans and, in particular, white working-class Americans. Stoking their racial resentment has been a theme of his presidency, just as it was a theme of his candidacy."}
{"original": "In public, Trump has assailed African-American football players for protesting during the national anthem. In private, he has said he wants to stop letting in immigrants from shithole (or, in some versions, shithouse) countries. In that sense, he has been exactly the kind of president he promised to be."}
{"original": "But the attacks on people of color, both abroad and home, look less and less like an effort to protect his supporters and more and more like a smokescreen for policies that will leave them ― along with most poor and middle-class Americans ― worse off than they were before. In a presidency that already has a reputation for dishonesty and graft, what Trump policies are doing to America's workers may be the biggest con of all."}
{"original": "Giving Big Tax Breaks For The Wealthy"}
{"original": "By far the clearest example of this is the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which the Republican Congress passed and Trump signed in December. The legislation showers the vast majority of its benefits on businesses, investors and the wealthy ― by permanently reducing taxes for corporations, the owners of pass-through businesses, and holders of large estates. And although it also lowers some taxes for lower- and middle-income households, those cuts are smaller and temporary."}
{"original": "Ten years out, once the law takes full effect, more than half of all taxpayers will be paying more and most of the rest will see no change, according to analysis by the Tax Policy Center."}
{"original": "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities"}
{"original": "Trump and his allies say those numbers don't matter, because the tax cut will mean higher wages and more jobs ― both of which will benefit American workers. And lately Trump has been touting news of one-time bonuses that companies are offering, supposedly because of the tax cut, as vindication of the GOP argument."}
{"original": "But many of those same companies are laying off workers. And, in any event, the test of the tax cut's impact will be what it mean over the long term. In a survey of 42 top economists by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, just one ― one! ― thought Republican tax cuts would significantly improve growth."}
{"original": "Trying To Take Health Insurance From Millions"}
{"original": "The tax cut is Trump's only major legislative accomplishment, but it wasn't supposed to be. He and his congressional partners spent more of the year focusing on health care, as they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The effort fell short, in no small part because GOP repeal proposals looked nothing like what Trump had promised."}
{"original": "Instead of providing better, cheaper health care to all Americans ― a vow Trump made repeatedly in his campaign, sometimes using it to distinguish himself from rival GOP candidates ― repeal would have meant millions of poor and middle-class Americans losing their coverage. Some younger and healthier people would have ended up saving money, but only because older, sicker people would have ended up spending more ― or going without insurance altogether."}
{"original": "Stymied on the legislative front, Trump has carried on his war against Obamacare by using his executive authority. And here he has been more successful."}
{"original": "He cut funding for advertising for HealthCare.gov and for the groups that assist people with enrollment. He cut off a key set of payments to insurers, prompting some to raise rates and others to abandon markets altogether. And he's given states a green light to change their Medicaid programs in ways that will make it harder for poor people, especially those with chronic physical and mental health problems, to get and keep coverage."}
{"original": "Undoing Rules To Protect Workers And Consumers"}
{"original": "Trump's tax cut and health care efforts have gotten a ton of attention. But they by no means capture the full extent of his governing agenda ― or the different ways his policies break his promise to American workers."}
{"original": "In March, Trump signed a Republican bill rescinding the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Act, an Obama-era law that required federal contractors to disclose and then address violations of labor law and worker safety regulations. In August, the Trump administration announced it was postponing implementation of the so-called fiduciary rule ― another Obama-era legacy ― that requires investment managers to act in the best interests of their clients. It's widely understood that the administration is merely buying time for a more formal rewrite or outright repeal of the regulation."}
{"original": "They're just pandering to big corporations, They don't care about family farms. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) on a Trump administration regulatory change"}
{"original": "In October, the Trump administration confirmed that it intended to rewrite Obama's rewrite of overtime rules, which would have extended overtime pay to more than 12 million workers. The Trump administration intends to scale that back, although not completely. And just last week, the Trump administration announced it was putting the brakes on new regulations for payday lenders, designed to stop them from exploiting low-wage workers by loading them up with unpayable debts."}
{"original": "Another major thrust of Trump's agenda is protecting businesses from lawsuits, even when they act in ways that exploit or harm consumers ― helping to foster what Mike Konczal, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, has called a Grifter Economy."}
{"original": "An example of this was the reversal of yet another Obama-era rule that, for the first time, exposed banks and credit card companies to class action lawsuits by consumers who believed they were victims of fraud. The Trump administration and its allies claimed this was an effort to help consumers, because class action lawsuits merely enrich trial lawyers. But, as consumer advocates point out, fear of class action suits and their potentially big awards are precisely what it takes to keep large financial institutions in line."}
{"original": "Weakening Protections For Factory Workers And Farmers"}
{"original": "In some ways, though, the most revealing policy changes of Trump's first year are the ones that affect the very groups he always claims to champion."}
{"original": "Trump frequently talks about factory workers, and just this week he was in western Pennsylvania pledging to fight for them. But in the past year he has delayed implementation of rules designed to protect workers from inhaling toxic substances, including beryllium (a major hazard for steelworkers) and silica dust (a major hazard in construction). The plan, once again, is to scale back the rules in ways that expose many more workers to the hazards."}
{"original": "Yet another group that Trump loves to champion is farmers. But Trump this year overturned a regulation that made it easier for independent farmers to sue food companies and large agricultural conglomerates. And now the Environmental Protection Agency is talking about rescinding regulations that prohibit underage workers from handling toxic pesticides."}
{"original": "When defending the change in farmer lawsuits, Trump administration officials made the same basic argument they did for most of their regulatory changes: that they were merely reducing frivolous lawsuits and eliminating paperwork, so that businesses can create more jobs."}
{"original": "The idea that regulation stifles the economy, ultimately hurting consumers or workers more than they help, is one that conservatives believe sincerely ― and that, in any given case, is a reasonable subject for debate. But on the rule change for farmers, even some of the president's allies thought it was more about helping powerful friends. They're just pandering to big corporations, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said. They don't care about family farms."}
{"original": "In public, Trump always suggests otherwise. Whether he's talking about rules for farmers or bankers, or changes to taxes or health care, he always says what he did at the Capitol a year ago ― that he's fighting powerful interests and protecting the forgotten American."}
{"original": "But in private, Trump has been known to present his accomplishments in a different light. In December, just hours after signing the tax cut, Trump was back in Florida at his exclusive Mar-o-Lago club, where initiation fees are $200,000. While dining with some friends and supporters, CBS News later reported, Trump told them what they probably knew already: You all just got a lot richer."}
{"original": "The turn of each calendar year is often filled with an influx of charitable giving, much of which intends to assist those far beyond the borders of the United States. As rigorous debates surround the ethics and oversight of such foreign assistance endeavors, one of the more innovative contributions to this important conversation was produced by South Africa's renowned theologian, the late Steve de Gruchy. In consideration of the Magi and their Epiphany visit with Joseph, Mary, and the newly-born Jesus in Matthew 2:1-12, de Gruchy offers a striking interpretation of the biblical text and considers its direct relationship with international relief efforts. As private giving directed to foreign aid continues to grow (from $8.4 billion in 2000 to $19.1 billion in 2012), de Gruchy shows how benevolent intent can lead to oppressive impact, and Epiphany provides important wisdom to navigate the complexities of our policies and practices. He wrote:"}
{"original": "One of the ways of reading [Matthew 2:1-12] is to see how the Magi, from the east symbolize - in today's global configuration - people from the 'north' who possess wealth and wisdom, and who seek to contribute to those who are poorer than themselves."}
{"original": "Herod symbolizes the local elites that so often control the political economy of the 'south'. And the holy family symbolizes the millions of vulnerable people who live in poverty throughout the globe, predominantly in the 'south', but also in the 'north' (and 'east' and 'west'!)."}
{"original": "In the story, the Magi from the 'north' first make contact with those in the 'south' whom they have an affinity, namely a representative of the political and economic elite, Herod (v.1). This elite has no interest in the vulnerable poor in their own country, and they seek, as always, to use those from the 'north' to serve their own ends (v.3)."}
{"original": "However, the story turns on the fact that the Scriptures point the Magi to Bethlehem (v.5-6), where they learn that the one whom they must respect in God's scheme of things is not to be found in a palace, but in a humble shack. Their journey, guided by the words of the prophet (v.5) and God's star (v.6) lead them to meet the poor of the south in Mary, Joseph and Jesus."}
{"original": "As highlighted by de Gruchy, a key yet overlooked insight into this portion of the biblical narrative is how the Magi challenge the foreign aid community to reflect on its place - and reform its priorities - in an ever-changing and increasingly-connected world. For those with wealth and wisdom seeking to contribute to those who are poorer than themselves, the Epiphany account pushes for a dramatic reconsideration of global relationships and an enlightenment of less than perfect methods of charity and so-called development programs. In doing so, Matthew's Gospel reveals how personal beliefs, political actions, and economic alliances have an impact on various communities thousands of miles away. As de Gruchy states:"}
{"original": "Somehow, in their journey to the south, [the Magi] were touched by God's presence, became suspicious of the agenda of the local elite, and found joy in forging a relationship with the poor. They bow before the manger, and offer their gifts, symbolizing the self-emptying of power and the willingness to have their agenda shaped by the concerns of the 'south'."}
{"original": "These gifts are offered, moreover, not to bribe officials, create dependency, or leverage influence, but simply as a sign of homage and respect."}
{"original": "In striking fashion, the Magi within Matthews's narrative point toward enlightened concepts of foreign assistance and developmental efforts, for the sake of global companionships that affirm the poor as trusted subjects of history and not merely the juvenile objects. As expressed by Diana Ohlbaum, a significant amount of foreign giving has countless logistical and financial strings attached, due in part to a paternal and colonial desire to control the agendas of foreign companions (financial competitors). As a result, instead of allowing ideas to emerge from local communities and funding them to flourish, foreign assistance programs too often self-design their projects and dictate the details of implementation and accountability. Can we imagine the Magi from Matthew's Gospel acting in similar ways when opening their treasure chests for the Holy Family? Can we picture them dictating the terms by which Joseph and Mary utilized the gold, frankincense, and myrrh? Can we conceive of them insisting upon a reporting structure and over-reaching system of assessment (all while requesting a receipt for their tax deductions!)?"}
{"original": "As the private philanthropy industry continues to expand its foreign reach, there exists an increasing degree of pressure to show fast and observable progress (that falls in line with the agendas of the elite). As a result, foreign assistance organizations have responded by exerting greater control over the ways in which programs are implemented, and the expectations placed upon the perceived effectiveness of such programs are both serious and numerous, which in turn begs the question: Who and/or what is actually being assisted through such foreign assistance? Is it the local communities, or perhaps the gifts are meant to serve King Herod-like imperial interests, or perhaps to relieve those with wealth from their prosperity guilt? In light of the Epiphany narrative, we are compelled to consider whether or not our giving is genuine if strings are attached to the so-called gift and chains are wrapped around their so-called recipients."}
{"original": "As the Magi were enlightened through God's presence in the Holy Family, the time is upon us to redefine our relationships and convert our various connections within the global village. Instead of foreign assistance programs that are too often shaped by the paternal priorities of the privileged and powerful, and in place of international development schemes repeatedly saturated with labels of giver and receiver, we are moved to embody mutuality, companionship, and recognize the wisdom and assets of foreign communities. As we celebrate the ways that God continues to be manifested in and through our world, the Magi reveal that God is found in the long-term transformation of relationships and connections, thus we too are inspired to resist our imperial inclinations to accompany others for the sake of serving a global common good. As the Magi continue to reveal, such gifts without chains helps to bring real joy to all the world, so all may both give and receive."}

{"original": "In that way, the fight over how to address the coming fiscal crunch is shaping up to be the latest test of the relative strength of the Democratic Party's reigning business-friendly wing, as opposed to a rising left wing aligned with organized labor."}

By its very nature, levying the same tax rate ― currently 4.95% ― on all state residents disproportionately affects low- and middle-income people, for whom the sum is more onerous. And the system has forced Illinois to rely more heavily on property taxes, which wealthy residents have often evaded by hiring politically connected property tax appeals lawyers."}
{"original": "But conservative billionaire Ken Griffin and other big business executives went dollar for dollar with Pritzker to defeat the initiative, arguing that, among other things, higher income taxes provided no guarantee of property tax relief. The amendment, which required 60% support to pass, failed 53% to 47%."}

{"original": "In California, public-sector labor unions joined with the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative in an effort to pass Proposition 15, which would have closed a massive property tax loophole for big businesses. The ballot measure was a response to the unusual property tax system California adopted in 1978 tying property taxes to the property's value at the time of the sale, rather than a rolling system of tax assessment of the kind used in other states. As a result, many homeowners and big businesses like Disneyland pay property taxes based on values assessed decades in the past, leading to major shortfalls for local services like schools and county hospitals. Despite its progressive reputation, California ranks 42nd in the country in per-pupil education spending when adjusted for cost of living, according to the California Budget and Policy Center, a liberal think tank."}
{"original": "Prop 15 would have created a separate property tax collection system for commercial properties worth more than $3 million, generating as much as $12.5 billion in new revenue. But some of California's biggest corporations and property investors, such as the private equity giant Blackstone, spent $53 million ― nearly as much as Prop 15's backers ― trying to convince Californians that the proposal would raise taxes on ordinary people and prices for consumers. State voters voted the referendum down, 52 to 48%."}

{"original": "Proponents of the tax increases see them as the appropriate antidote to an uneven, or K-shaped, recovery from the economic fallout of the pandemic. Working-class people, including Black and Latino communities already harder hit by COVID-19, have been much more likely than upper-middle-class professionals to lose their jobs or otherwise have their lives upended since March.

President-elect Joe Biden has tapped Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D), a centrist fiscal hawk, to serve as his Commerce Secretary. Her departure and a series of progressive primary wins in the state legislature in September are already generating more momentum to address the state's $513 million budget shortfall through tax increases that target the state's wealthiest residents, rather than spending cuts."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, in New York, political will for higher taxes on the state's wealthiest residents is materializing among some key players. New York's state Senate, which was effectively controlled by Republicans until 2018, now has a Democratic supermajority fueled by progressive and even socialist victories across two election cycles. And the state Assembly, where Democrats already had a veto-proof majority, has seen some of its more moderate members ousted by younger left-wing challengers."}

Andrew Cuomo, who began his first term in 2011 by coupling tax cuts with reductions in social spending, has proven resistant to any tax increases targeted at the super-rich. He has at once argued that it would provoke multi-millionaires and billionaires ― with whom he claimed to speak all day long ― to flee the state in pursuit of lower taxes, and wielded the threat of higher taxes as part of an appeal for federal aid."}
{"original": "The Invest in Our New York campaign has marshaled the research of scholars who have found that there is no evidence that a substantial number of rich people leave states in response to tax increases. And they note that federal aid in the aftermath of the Great Recession both fell short of New York's needs and came with cumbersome conditions on how it would be spent."}
{"original": "For Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, conditions on federal aid would be a welcome dose of fiscal medicine to New York and other blue states that she believes have ratified public-sector union contracts with unnecessarily generous early retirement health benefits. Those benefits could be easier to scale back because they are not statutorily protected from cuts the way many state pension plans are."}
{"original": "Why not tie congressional aid to states and cities to reform of these retiree health care plans? she asked."}
{"original": "In his state of the state address on Monday, Cuomo, who retains a Republican budget director, said that if New York raised the state income tax rate on earnings over $1 million from 8.8% to California's top rate of 13.3%, it would only generate $1.5 billion in new revenue."}

{"original": "Once a weed critic, he is now calling for the full legalization and taxation of both recreational marijuana and sports betting on mobile devices. He has embraced these fees despite estimates that the combined revenue from marijuana and sports betting taxes would fall short of $1 billion in annual revenue ― a sum smaller than the amount generated by the millionaire tax he has sniffed at."}
{"original": "Notwithstanding their divergent ideologies, Gelinas joined Kink and Nnaemeka in panning the latter measures as tax increases that would fall disproportionately on people of modest means."}
{"original": "Legalizing sports betting and marijuana are just going to be other regressive taxes, Gelinas said, noting that New York already has high regressive sales taxes. We tax pretty much everyone pretty heavily already and it's still not enough to balance the budget. Gelinas instead favors, among other changes, demanding voluntary pay freezes from public-sector unions as a first step to avoid layoffs."}
{"original": "A spokesperson for Cuomo did not respond to a series of questions about the marijuana and sports betting taxes, as well as his other budget priorities."}
{"original": "In theory, Democratic lawmakers do not need to wait for Cuomo's approval. They have the power to pass laws raising taxes and to override Cuomo's veto if he chooses to block them. And both New York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins have expressed support for higher taxes on the wealthy."}
{"original": "But having the power is one thing, and using it is another ― especially in New York's lopsided system of state government. In the Empire State, the governor has uniquely centralized power relative to other state executives, because he or she alone can introduce the state's budget."}
{"original": "In order to negotiate their priorities with the governor in a closed process that he controls, Stewart-Cousins and Heastie have a strong incentive not to defy him on other priorities."}
{"original": "That's why the Invest in New York coalition is so committed to pressuring Cuomo directly, including by appealing to the progressive image he has sought to burnish in the wake of the pandemic and the revival of the Black Lives Matter movement this past spring."}
{"original": "Gov. Cuomo has a lot of beautiful, soaring rhetoric, but the history of his time in office is that he hasn't been able to deliver on the reality, Kink said."}
{"original": "Digital First Media/Orange County Register via Getty Images via Getty Images African-Americans are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to work for the federal government: They constitute 18 percent of federal workers and 13 percent of the population, write Angela Simms and Shamus Khan."}
{"original": "These economic costs take a severe toll on everyday people. Today, some 380,000 American families have a member sitting at home without a paycheck. At a time when around 80 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, in large part because the cost of living continues to rise at rates outstripping increases in worker pay, that's hundreds of thousands of family crises waiting to happen. It means families may not have sufficient money for rent or mortgages, groceries, transportation or school supplies, among other needs."}
{"original": "The federal government distributed sample letters for furloughed workers to send to landlords, banks and other financial institutions like student loan agencies, as they seek leniency for late or partial payments. Many will weather this income loss by using credit cards and other loans with high interest rates, which can lead families into a financial downward spiral."}
{"original": "Black communities, many of which are still recovering from the Great Recession, stand to be among the hardest hit―again. African-Americans are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to work for the federal government: They constitute 18 percent of federal workers and 13 percent of the population. Furthermore, Black-owned businesses disproportionately rely upon government contracts, though they remain underrepresented among federal contractors. And Black Americans, due to their disproportionate levels of poverty stemming from centuries of exclusion from the most rewarding jobs and underinvestment in their communities, are in greater need of federal support, even when the economy is booming."}
{"original": "African-Americans are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to work for the federal government: They constitute 18 percent of federal workers and 13 percent of the population."}
{"original": "Because they experience considerable labor market discrimination, African-Americans have long relied upon the public sector—federal, state and local government—for steady employment in good jobs. Government civil service work is an essential pillar in the foundation of the Black middle class, so furloughs stand to harm Black people significantly. This kind of racially disparate impact of government policy has a long history."}
{"original": "For generations, the federal government has invested more directly in the White middle class than in the Black middle class. The mid-19th century Homestead Acts gave White Americans access to western lands, many of which were expropriated from Native American tribes, for minimal or no cost. The Social Security Act of 1935 provided unemployment insurance and old-age pensions. And the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (commonly known as the GI Bill) offered returning World War II soldiers education benefits and low-interest mortgages. In each of these cases, the federal government either explicitly excluded Black people or failed to intervene when racist state or private industry practices were carried out."}
{"original": "Even the much-lauded New Deal was a site of racial discrimination by the federal government. The Federal Housing Administration erected barriers preventing Black Americans from taking out home loans—where most of Americans' familial wealth is located. From the 1930s to the early 1960s, 98 percent of all home loans went to White families. The federal government insured loans in White neighborhoods, making loans more financially viable for banks. Consequently, these neighborhoods grew in wealth and businesses flocked to them, reinforcing these communities' wealth accumulation. Decades of investment in White communities, and disinvestment in Black communities, is why the average Black family has $1700 in wealth, while the average white family has $116,000. That means many White families have savings allowing them to ride out hard times, like a federal government furlough. But most Black families do not."}
{"original": "Many White families have savings allowing them to ride out hard times, like a federal government furlough. But most Black families do not."}
{"original": "Then there's the fact that Black people who are struggling to afford a government shutdown are more likely to live around other people who are struggling financially. Fifty years after major efforts toward integration, our communities remain stubbornly racially segregated. The post-civil rights era integration achievements of the 1970s and 1980s have stagnated, and in many metropolitan areas eroded, even as Black Americans have become a majority suburban population. Today more than half of the Black population would need to move to attain full integration. This means the furlough will not only disproportionately affect Black families, but it will also be concentrated in Black communities. Racial segregation, itself the consequence of racist policies and practices, will only compound the negative effects Black Americans will likely experience."}
{"original": "Due to the concentration of Black households affected by the furlough, majority-Black counties should brace themselves for acute harms. County workers, like teachers and police officers, won't be furloughed, but they are at risk if the recession is protracted and the county's revenue declines because furloughed federal workers reduce their economic activity and perhaps even experience downward economic mobility as they become unable to pay for household expenses."}
{"original": "During the Great Recession, in the predominantly African-American Prince George's County, in Maryland, right next to Washington, D.C., teachers and parents lamented that their schools were in disrepair and that teacher turnover was increasing in the face of frozen wages. Church pastors said there was more demand for the food in their pantries. But as the foreclosure crisis slashed county tax revenue, the county government and nonprofits could scarcely keep pace with resident demand. The Black middle class, unlike the White middle class, already tends to live in communities with more poverty. When the Black middle class is distressed, Black communities' already fragile stability is further undermined."}
{"original": "Most furloughed workers will likely eventually receive backpay for the time they were forced not to work. But backpay can't make up for certain damages, such as ruined credit, increased interest rates on mortgages because of late-payments, or eviction for not paying rent. Black people with less wealth and concentrated in majority-Black communities, will endure these hardships more than other Americans."}
{"original": "Throughout U.S. history, Black America has experienced combinations of discrimination, exploitation and federal government neglect. With the current furlough, Black people are experiencing collateral damage from President Trump's willingness to close swaths of the government unless he receives funding for a wall along the U.S. southern border. His decision affects all Americans who rely on government's regular order, but Black people are particularly vulnerable. These hardships represent a continuation of centuries-long trends. And for many Black families and the communities they call home, these effects could be devastating."}

{"original": "So it went Monday for the Schultz, who told 60 Minutes in a segment that aired Sunday night that he is seriously considering running for president as a centrist independent, outside of the two-party system.

{"original": "The news that Schultz might run as an independent candidate in the 2020 race has provoked swift anger from Democrats, who fear that he might make President Donald Trump's path to re-election easier. Such talk isn't of concern to Schultz, at least not yet."}
{"original": "I'm not trying to win the Twitter primary, he joked."}
{"original": "Many of the event's attendees told HuffPost that they were tired of both parties. Schultz clearly feels the same way. When the night's interviewer, Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times, asked about former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's statement Monday that the country can't afford an independent third candidate right now, some in the audience clapped."}
{"original": "But Schultz, noting that about 42 percent of Americans identify as politically independent, said he believes there are also many lifelong Democrats and lifelong Republicans who are searching for something new, adding that he wants to travel the country for three months and see how people feel about the possibility of him running."}
{"original": "Those two extremes [on the] far left and far right do not represent the silent majority of Americans, he said."}
{"original": "Schultz took a number of shots at Trump and the Republican Party on Monday night. He said that he felt Trump has been on the wrong side of almost every issue and that America should not be building walls ― we should be building bridges."}
{"original": "But he spent much more time Monday dissecting the Democratic Party."}
{"original": "If you kind of look at the tea leaves today, it appears that the Democratic Party is shifting far, far left with very strong, progressive ideas, he said."}
{"original": "I believe that if I ran as a Democrat, I would have to say things that I know in my heart I do not believe, and I would have to be disingenuous. For example, what the progressive, left-leaning Democratic Party is suggesting is government-paid health care for everyone, which is free ... and government-paid college for everyone."}
{"original": "Schultz said he supported former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act and believes the country should provide quality health to everyone, but he said current health care ideas within the Democratic Party are unrealistic and a potential burden on the U.S. government, a position that brought noticeable applause."}
{"original": "If America was a company at $21.5 trillion of debt ― adding a trillion dollars a year ― we would be facing insolvency, said Schultz, who has called the national debt the greatest threat domestically to the country."}
{"original": "Asked if Democrats could do anything to change his mind, Schultz said no."}
{"original": "I don't think their views represent the majority of Americans, he said. I don't think we want a 70 percent income tax in America, and I certainly don't think we can afford the things they're suggesting."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has not proposed a 70 percent income tax, but she does want to raise the marginal tax rate to 70 percent for those Americans who make more than $10 million a year. At one point, Sorkin brought up a recent comment by Ocasio-Cortez's adviser, who said that every billionaire in the U.S. is a policy failure."}
{"original": "Schultz, who was raised in Brooklyn public housing projects and is now worth more than $3 billion, called that idea un-American and said the word billionaire has become a catchphrase."}
{"original": "I think there is a problem that she has identified. But I think the way she's going about it ― unfortunately, she is a bit misinformed."}
{"original": "On income inequality in the U.S., Schultz said the problem is real and must be addressed."}
{"original": "But not in a punitive way. What is required is leadership, he said. We can't continue to add onto the debt. We can't continue to add onto the inequality, but we can solve these problems if we come together."}
{"original": "Sorkin also asked Schultz if he would consider dropping out if evidence showed his candidacy might help get Trump re-elected."}
{"original": "I can't answer that question today, he said. But I'm certainly not going to do anything to put Donald Trump back in the Oval Office."}

The IRS appreciates everyone's patience during this period. The extra time will help taxpayers affected by this situation."}
{"original": "Taxpayers were unable to make payments or view their tax records on the IRS website for hours on Tuesday due to technical difficulties, an agency spokesperson told NPR. Those individuals who went to the site hoping to file last-minute tax returns were greeted by a message with the heading Planned Outage: April 17, 2018 - December 31, 9999."}
{"original": "The error was resolved by Tuesday evening, but to make up for the interruption, the IRS announced it would allow people an additional day to file their income tax returns and to pay those taxes."}
{"original": "Everybody who had to file and pay by April 17 now has until midnight on April 18 to do so. The agency said taxpayers don't need to do anything to receive the extra day."}
{"original": "The IRS has experienced glitches in the past that have either delayed tax refunds or blocked the electronic filing of tax returns. But in recent years, the agency has only extended the filing deadline when legal holidays or weekends overlapped with April 15. This year the deadline had already been moved back two days to avoid Sunday and the District of Columbia's observance of Emancipation Day on Monday."}
{"original": "Tami Burch, a 40-year-old single mother in Chanute, Kansas, was just getting by before the pandemic hit. She has 10-year-old twins and was working 40 hours a week overseeing the kitchen in an assisted living facility. The pay was low, around $10 an hour, but she liked the work."}
{"original": "She'd bring the twins, a boy and a girl, along when her shift started at 6 a.m. They'd sleep on the couch in the front lobby, help bus tables or serve meals, or play on their tablets. Burch's mother, a teacher, would pick them up and take them to school and then bring them back to the nursing home to finish out the afternoon."}
{"original": "Then COVID-19 struck. Schools closed and the nursing home went on lockdown ― no kids allowed. Burch had just returned to work in March after undergoing open-heart surgery. Her doctors told her she was at higher risk if she got the coronavirus. With no child care and a high-risk job, Burch had no choice but to take unpaid leave. Then her unemployment payments, which were meager but helpful, ended in October."}
{"original": "We were already sitting on the edge, and they just kind of kicked us off, she told HuffPost. I just cry all the time because there's no money."}
{"original": "Even before the upheaval of 2020, most low-income parents in the U.S. were already living one crisis away from catastrophe, one child care emergency away from losing their jobs. They can't count on the federal government for services and support available in other economically advanced countries as a matter of course."}
{"original": "At best, struggling parents in America have to navigate a confusing patchwork of partial, targeted programs ― which, in practice, means waiting months for a limited supply of subsidized child care slots to open, or making do with paid leave that was too short and came without replacement pay, or simply dropping out of the workforce with no certain source of income."}
{"original": "We were already sitting on the edge, and they just kind of kicked us off. Tami Burch, single parent on unpaid leave"}
{"original": "The struggles of working parents have received significantly more attention in Washington just in the last few years. A big reason is that 1 in 4 members of Congress are now women, double what it was 25 years ago. That includes Democratic senators like Patty Murray of Washington state and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, each of whom has experience as both an educator and working mother of young children and has made child care programs a top priority."}
{"original": "These advocates for working parents now have a new, powerful ally in President Joe Biden ― who, unlike many men of his generation, has experience serving as the primary caregiver to his two sons after the tragic death of his first wife and daughter when he was a young senator in 1972."}
{"original": "Biden made caregiving a central part of his presidential campaign, partly because his personal experience made him aware of it and partly, as he has said frequently, because the circumstances of the pandemic have demanded it. True to his promise, his proposals for a coronavirus relief package included major new assistance for America's parents in the form of billions for child care centers and paid parental leave."}
{"original": "Chase Castor for HuffPost Tami Burch watches as her kids Mia and Jesse play at a park."}
{"original": "The pandemic relief bill Biden and Democrats are now trying to pass would include these as well as new cash benefits for the majority of parents in the U.S. The policy could revolutionize the American safety net and slash child poverty."}
{"original": "Also in the bill is a proposed hike in the minimum wage, to $15 an hour, which would be life-changing for parents like Burch. There's even talk about universal pre-kindergarten, which is a year of free, quality child care for parents who previously had to pay for it, although that would likely come under separate legislation."}
{"original": "It's one thing to propose these things, quite another to enact them. Getting these programs through a Congress where Democrats have razor-thin majorities will require winning over some Republicans or, at the very least, holding the support of nearly every single Democratic lawmaker. And inevitable complaints are already making the rounds on Capitol Hill and on cable news that such an agenda would be too big, too partisan, too radical."}
{"original": "The pandemic has given lawmakers a chance to do what they could have done long ago: make life much less difficult for working parents and their children. But only if they don't blow it."}
{"original": "Even before the pandemic, children had the highest official poverty rate of any age group in the U.S., mainly because parenting often means missing wages, which impoverishes parents, especially mothers, and by extension, kids. Although low-income families are eligible for a variety of government services and targeted subsidies, most can't lean on a program like Social Security, which delivers monthly checks directly to retirees and has, over the years, dramatically reduced poverty among the elderly."}
{"original": "The pandemic has supercharged the problem by driving millions of women out of the workforce so they can care for children who are suddenly home from public school, the only reliable, free source of child care in the U.S. It has been especially tough on women who were struggling financially in the first place and can't afford to hire extra help."}
{"original": "More than 3 in 5 low-income households with children reported some kind of income shock since the pandemic, like trouble paying bills, job loss and hunger."}
{"original": "This is bad for families, but it is especially bad for children. Early research suggests child poverty rose dramatically last year. The rate of food insecurity increased dramatically in households with kids since the start of the pandemic."}
{"original": "Burch is a case study in how this all plays out and why the existing supports from the government are so inadequate. She gets food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which was sufficient when her kids were at school all day and could get free lunch, but a strain when everyone was home during early lockdown. (Both kids are back to in-person schooling now.)"}
{"original": "And she received cash from the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, two policies Congress has greatly expanded in recent decades to little fanfare."}
{"original": "Chase Castor for HuffPost Tami Burch on her front porch."}
{"original": "Burch's tax returns are a glimpse into how she managed before COVID-19. In 2019, she earned $18,000. And she received $5,828 from the earned income tax credit and $2,406 from the child tax credit as a one-time payment at tax time last year. That's a nearly 50% increase in her wages."}
{"original": "Burch has done what she can to make money over the past year. She likes to paint in her spare time and was able to earn some cash selling her artwork, mainly portraits that she puts to canvas using spray paint."}
{"original": "But Burch was out of work in January and February 2020 because of her surgery, and back to work for only a couple of weeks before the pandemic-related shutdown. This year's tax refund amounted to just $400, since the child credit only benefits workers with at least $2,500 in earnings, and the earned income credit only provides its maximum benefits for workers with between $10,000 and $20,000 in earnings."}
{"original": "Congress expanded unemployment benefits last March as part of its initial COVID-19 response, loosening eligibility rules and increasing benefits amounts, and that helped for a while. But lawmakers didn't anticipate how long the crisis would last, and Burch's benefits ran out in October. Congress finally got around to passing more benefits at the end of last year, but Kansas is one of many states that hasn't yet restarted payments."}
{"original": "Even when the checks resume, Burch may not get one, at least right away, because the Kansas unemployment office has flagged her for fraud. It hasn't sent a formal explanation in writing and she's spent hours on the phone trying to understand why."}
{"original": "They're a mess, she said of the whole process, explaining she calls the office daily."}
{"original": "Burch was eligible for a second stimulus payment, which was also part of the bill Congress passed late last year, and when she got the check in January, she stocked up on laundry detergent, trash bags, tissues and shampoo. She paid overdue bills. But that money is completely gone now."}
{"original": "It filled a hole at best, Burch said."}
{"original": "Giving People Money Is Beneficial And Popular"}
{"original": "Biden and the Democrats campaigned on a promise to provide more help as part of a broader COVID-19 relief package, and just this week, they have formally started moving legislation through Congress. Their intention is to use the budget reconciliation process, which allows a simple majority in the Senate to pass legislation without the threat of a filibuster."}
{"original": "Democratic leaders have said they would like Republican support and, on Monday, Biden met with a group of 10 GOP senators who said they were interested in negotiating. But those senators envision a lot less spending, which means a lot less help for families, and by using the reconciliation process, Democrats could pass a bill on their own as long as all 50 members of the Senate Democratic caucus vote yes. (Vice President Kamala Harris would break the tie.)"}
{"original": "SAUL LOEB via Getty Images President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris meet with Republicans including Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Mitt Romney (Utah) to discuss a coronavirus relief plan on Feb. 1, 2021."}
{"original": "The Democratic package includes a new round of stimulus checks and another extension of unemployment benefits, and those are the features that get most of the attention. But other provisions may have bigger, farther-reaching effects by transforming the way the federal government supports families — or at least by starting such a transformation."}
{"original": "Biden's American Rescue Plan includes a proposal to increase the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600 per child and to allow families with no income to qualify. The increase would last only one year, but champions of the idea have said they hope legislation later in 2021 would then make the increase permanent."}
{"original": "The plan excites Democrats on Capitol Hill and social policy experts because it resembles the American Family Act, a recent bill by Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) that would enlarge the credit by the same amount and also pay it in monthly installments instead of annually."}
{"original": "The impact would be huge, with parents getting $300 per month per child. According to an analysis of the proposal from Columbia University's Center on Poverty & Social Policy, the monthly cash would slash poverty among children 42% — because it turns out poverty is caused by a lack of money."}

{"original": "Until recently, the idea of simply giving people money, especially poor people, was politically taboo. In 1996, the Republican Congress passed and former Democratic President Bill Clinton signed a welfare reform bill that basically ended direct cash assistance."}
{"original": "That move followed decades of political attacks, many of them racist, that suggested welfare payments used tax money from hard-working people to subsidize the indolent. The only way to increase assistance for families was to hide it in the tax code through various sorts of breaks ― of the sort that Burch got on her taxes last year ― that were inevitably less available and less effective at reaching people who needed help."}
{"original": "But with the pandemic forcing so many people out of the workplace for the sake of public health, Congress signed off on direct payments as part of its initial COVID-19 relief package. And perhaps because the payments went to such a broad swath of Americans, with more than 200 million getting checks, the assistance has proven wildly popular ― and may even help explain why approval ratings for Congress in May hit 31%, a level not reached since 2009."}
{"original": "Reducing people's material suffering, it turns out, can be both beneficial and popular."}
{"original": "Other rich countries, by the way, figured this out a long time ago. Almost all of them pay parents a monthly child benefit or child allowance and almost all have way lower child poverty."}
{"original": "Just how far Biden is determined to run with this idea remains to be seen. His outline for a pandemic relief bill does not call for advance monthly payments, which is so critical for reaching people in need. And it does not formally call for extending the increase in the child tax credit past a year. The White House did not respond to questions about whether Biden supports either advance payments or making the checks permanent."}
{"original": "But champions of the idea in Congress have made clear their intentions. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.) said, in a statement to HuffPost, that expanding the child tax credit has been a long-term goal and that Democrats are exploring ways to make it even more beneficial for folks who are struggling during these exceptionally difficult times."}
{"original": "A new monthly benefit for children is an appropriate answer to the pandemic's extraordinary burden on parents, and lawmakers know it, said Samuel Hammond, the director of poverty and welfare policy at the Niskanen Center, a moderate think tank that has helped lawmakers of both parties craft policies to benefit parents."}

{"original": "Heather Boushey, an appointee for the Council of Economic Advisers, is one of the nation's leading experts on the financial strain of parents with young children and the caregiving economy. Neera Tanden, the veteran Democratic policy adviser Biden taped to run the Office of Management and Budget, is a longtime advocate for universal child care."}
{"original": "But for the pandemic relief bill or any future legislation, the question comes down to political will ― which, in turn, will depend on individual members of Congress, along with Biden's ability and willingness to push them. The Democratic caucuses of both chambers are still full of members who flinch at the idea of too much spending or fear attacks that they support welfare, or for one reason or another (including dated views on gender roles), still don't grasp the burdens that working parents really face. The politics of supporting working families have changed, but it's not clear they've changed enough."}

{"original": "It's true: Despite the coronavirus pandemic that caused skyrocketing unemployment, the stock market has soared to record heights over the last year, underscoring that it does not offer a complete picture of economic health."}
{"original": "Warren continued: For years, the same hedge funds, private equity firms, and wealthy investors dismayed by the GameStop trades have treated the stock market like their own personal casino while everyone else pays the price."}
{"original": "She concluded that it is long past time for the Security and Exchange Commission and other regulators to wake up and do their jobs."}
{"original": "″[A]nd with a new administration and Democrats running Congress, I intend to make sure they do, she said."}
{"original": "In the past month, people who frequent a Reddit message board called WallStreetBets discovered that hedge funds were shorting GameStop, or betting that the company would lose money, which in turn would make money for the funds. The speculation was grounded in some logic, given that the pandemic has discouraged people from going to brick-and-mortar stores to purchase games and gaming equipment. But the company in mid-January acquired a new board member with much-needed digital experience in an attempt to buoy itself."}
{"original": "That's when a group of amateur traders on the Reddit board decided to make a stand against the Wall Street elites, driving up the price of GameStop stock. It's now up more than 1,000% since the start of January."}

{"original": "I don't envy Marissa Mayer. Yahoo's CEO has struggled to turn the tech company around in recent years. Now she faces pressure from activist investors who want her to engage in strategic alternatives -- boardroom speak for a sale of Yahoo's core business."}
{"original": "There's no single reason for Yahoo's decline, but if there had to be one, it would be the company's inability to anticipate smartphones. Yahoo cut its teeth making popular desktop web properties like Yahoo Finance, Yahoo News, and more recently Yahoo Fantasy. By the time Mayer joined Yahoo in July 2012, the ship had already sailed on mobile. Mayer tried to stem the tide of change with a string of acquisitions, notably Tumblr in 2013, but none of them propelled the company's growth."}
{"original": "It's not difficult to see why Yahoo's investors are getting anxious. Its stock has sunk over 30% in the last year, and its valuation is being propped up by stakes in e-commerce giant Alibaba, and Yahoo Japan. Since the IRS ruled out a tax-free Alibaba spinoff last year, shareholders have insisted Mayer meet with potential suitors for its core businesses. That's too bad, because Yahoo might have made a fantastic digital media company."}
{"original": "In the world of search engines, for example, Yahoo isn't doing so hot. It claimed about 12% of search market share in January 2016, compared to Google's 64%. What Yahoo does have, however, is a massive online audience."}
{"original": "How large, you ask? Its web and mobile properties have an aggregate 205 million monthly unique visitors -- more than BuzzFeed and The Washington Post's websites combined. And while BuzzFeed has recently questioned the usefulness of unique visitors as a measure of overall reach, let's assume a content-centric Yahoo would be able to grow video and direct-to-platform audiences on top of its existing websites and apps."}
{"original": "Sustainable media companies are at least one thing Yahoo is not: lean. Buzzfeed has roughly 1,300 employees creating content for 80.4 million unique visitors. That's about 62,000 visitors per employee. Yahoo, on the other hand will have roughly 9,000 employees when it completes its latest round of layoffs -- about 23,000 visitors per employee. If the company shed some of its less popular products it could probably enjoy a healthy, if not explosive, ad business."}
{"original": "A transformation like the one I'm describing would be dramatic, and probably difficult to pull off. It would also come with caveats. Even though a slimmed-down Yahoo could be a viable media company, plenty of its users are attracted by consumer products like Yahoo Mail or Flickr. It's not clear they would return to a media-centric Yahoo. If it were to pivot, Yahoo should evaluate its properties to see what's driving traffic and what isn't. The company's traffic acquisition costs -- money it spends to attract visitors -- were up over 300% year over year in the quarter that ended last December."}
{"original": "It's too soon to know what will happen to Yahoo. It could easily spin off some of its businesses and still retain its foundation in tech. Yahoo's downsizing plans include a haircut for the editorial staff, so it's unlikely to make the pivot content in the near future. But while some see a company that's more valuable in pieces than as a whole, I see a media portfolio in a tech company's shoes."}

{"original": "LAS VEGAS ― Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) talks about the political revolution. But it's up to people like Vaneik Echeverria to make it happen."}
{"original": "Echeverria, a New York City-based theater professional spending the final week before the Nevada caucuses knocking on doors for Sanders, was in between canvassing stops in a working-class section of East Las Vegas when he spotted Adrian Silva leaning on his car."}
{"original": "Silva, a 28-year-old father of four who has earned a living through assorted warehouse and service sector jobs, had recently moved to the city from his native Los Angeles, fleeing crime and the high cost of living. He told Echeverria he has never voted in his life."}
{"original": "I just know they're all just puppets, Silva said, referring to politicians. There's a bigger system out there than the United States, you know?"}
{"original": "Echeverria, whose jean jacket flair included buttons for Sanders as well as a tongue-in-cheek image of Karl Marx, immediately expressed sympathy for Silva's perspective."}
{"original": "This feeling that you're having ― they're all fuckers, they're all liars, none of them watch out for us ― I feel the same way, except when it comes to Bernie Sanders, man, said Echeverria, who, like Silva, grew up in Los Angeles and is the son of Latino immigrants."}
{"original": "Daniel Marans/HuffPost Vaneik Echeverria, right, talks to Adrian Silva, who never votes, about Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in East Las Vegas."}
{"original": "Silva nodded. Without making any commitments, he filled out a card with his personal information so the campaign could contact him. He also accepted a button for the Las Vegas chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, which is coordinating with the Sanders campaign and is operating a staging area for volunteers called the leftist garage."}
{"original": "Echeverria's conversation with Silva seemed like it had almost been staged to illustrate the Sanders campaign's fundamental conceit: That it can not only win the Democratic presidential nomination but can do so by mobilizing infrequent voters ― often working-class, young and nonwhite ― that put the Vermont senator in a uniquely strong position to unseat President Donald Trump."}
{"original": "In order to beat Donald Trump, we're going to need the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States, Sanders said on Wednesday night on the debate stage. What our movement is about is bringing working-class people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American, around an agenda that works for all of us and not just the billionaire class."}
{"original": "Joe Buglewicz for HuffPost The Sanders campaign's literature in Nevada is offered in up to 16 languages. Ballots for the caucuses are available in English, Spanish and Tagalog."}
{"original": "As Sanders has emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination and a clear favorite to win here in Nevada, his moderate critics have increasingly expressed skepticism about the idea that a large number of unactivated voters are sitting around, waiting to be motivated by a sufficiently bold progressive ― such as Sanders, who supports Medicare for All, a substantial wealth tax, worker ownership of major companies and a drastic liberalization of the immigration system. Any spike in progressive voter turnout will be matched by a spike in conservative voters, critics argue, and Sanders's policies will alienate a shrinking but still crucial number of swing voters."}
{"original": "They also note that voter turnout didn't spike in Iowa, and while it went up in New Hampshire, the areas with a boost in turnout mostly saw voters casting ballots for former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)."}
{"original": "His whole theory of how he's going to get elected is based around the idea that he's going to get out people who have never voted before, said Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president at Third Way, a moderate Democratic think tank critical of Sanders. It didn't happen for him in Iowa and New Hampshire, it didn't happen for his endorsed candidates in 2018, and it didn't happen last time."}
{"original": "Erickson suggested Sanders's leftist policies appealed to few voters beyond his political base: His ceiling and his floor are the same thing."}
{"original": "Sanders's allies, meanwhile, argue that Iowa ― the nation's fifth-whitest state ― and New Hampshire ― the third-whitest state and the second-most elderly ― were poor testing grounds for his theory. Nevada, however, is one of the nation's most diverse states ― it has substantial Latino, Asian American and Black populations ― and a large population of young people."}
{"original": "Sanders, who has a team of volunteers translating campaign materials into 16 different languages and plenty of supporters with a robust social media presence, is poised to do well with both groups."}
{"original": "Chuck Rocha, the Sanders campaign adviser responsible for integrating Latino outreach into every facet of the campaign, embraced Nevada's significance in the post-debate spin room."}
{"original": "There's a lot of working-class brown people here, he said of Nevada. This is the first big scalability test of our program, for sure. We started early, we invested, we hired all of these great brown people ― and now we're going to see if we can turn them out."}
{"original": "The early signs are strong: More than 77,000 people voted early in Nevada ― almost matching the 80,000 who caucused at all in 2016. And the Sanders campaign said it had managed to knock on 500,000 doors ― nearly doubling its internal goal of 300,000. Though public polling is scarce, much of it shows Sanders leading with Latinos here."}
{"original": "If the strategy works, Sanders will succeed in more than just Nevada. Many of the delegate-rich states that vote on Super Tuesday, especially Colorado, California and Texas, have relatively similar demographics, which the Vermonter could use to build a healthy lead in the race to collect the most delegates to the Democratic National Convention this summer."}

{"original": "If the revolution has a heartbeat in Nevada, it's Sanders's campaign office in a strip mall in heavily Latino East Las Vegas. The office, which is decorated with Mexican papel picado (perforated paper flags) and often blares cumbia music, is home to a never-ending stream of volunteers from across the country ― some of them exchanging words in Spanish with the office's many bilingual staffers as they prepare to spread the gospel of nuestra lucha (our fight). Many of Sanders's Latino staff members have flown out from D.C. to base themselves here for the week."}
{"original": "The friendly vibe in the East Las Vegas office is by design: The campaign sees it as ground zero for its efforts to fuse culturally competent community-building with more traditional campaign work."}
{"original": "What this functions as is not only a place to send volunteers out, but also a place to bring the community in, campaign spokeswoman Maddy Mundy said. To that end, the office was the site of a raucous Día de los Muertos celebration last October and a bilingual Thanksgiving feast the following month."}
{"original": "On Tuesday night, Lourdes Esparza, a 38-year-old Sanders campaign volunteer who works for the Clark County Education Association and is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, was there to explain why she's spent so much of her time recently working to elect Sanders."}
{"original": "She doesn't cite a need to oust Trump or to restore integrity to the country, but material concerns: The educators she works with are among the lowest-paid in the country. She lives with both her disabled mother and grandmother, and the two of them are forced to share insulin because of high prescription drug prices and rising housing costs."}
{"original": "He sees me, and my family, and my struggles, Esparza said of Sanders. He speaks to my everyday life. And I think that's why he's so popular. People feel seen."}
{"original": "I don't need him to speak Spanish, she quickly added."}
{"original": "Joe Buglewicz for HuffPost Lourdes Esparza, like many Sanders volunteers, said concerns about housing and medical costs motivated her to campaign for the senator's election."}
{"original": "A potential X factor for Sanders is the de facto opposition of Nevada's mighty Culinary Workers Union. The union has informed its 60,000 dues-paying members, a majority of whom are Latino, that Sanders would end the union's multi-employer health care plan and require Medicare for All."}
{"original": "Sanders has vowed that Medicare for All, which promises to eliminate all out-of-pocket costs, would offer an improvement over their current coverage. He also updated his plan to facilitate the reopening of collective bargaining after the law's passage so unions could ensure they share in the company's health care savings."}
{"original": "But there is already some anecdotal evidence that the Culinary Workers Union's stance ― and a subsequent blowup over nasty remarks Sanders supporters allegedly directed at union leaders ― is making a dent in Sanders's performance. CNN found a union member who admitted she didn't believe Sanders's assurances that he'd make sure union members would receive even better coverage under Medicare for All; the Republican opposition research group America Rising promptly promoted a clip of the exchange."}
{"original": "Former Vice President Joe Biden and Buttigieg, who has a robust operation in Nevada, may be best positioned to take advantage of attrition from Sanders over the union's stance."}
{"original": "Buttigieg, in particular, has made preserving health care freedom of choice a cornerstone of his closing pitch in Nevada, highlighting it in Wednesday's debate in an exchange he subsequently promoted on social media."}
{"original": "Nevada Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui (D), who has endorsed Buttigieg, said the Culinary Workers Union's decision not to endorse a Democratic candidate before the caucuses, despite the union's relationship with Biden, is a sign of the inroads Buttigieg has made with his health care message."}

If they weren't home, she left a door hanger highlighting Sanders' support for affordable housing, citizenship for all, Medicare for All and ending the school-to-prison pipeline."}

{"original": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's passing is a shock to die-hard conservatives for good reason. He was the bastion and spokesperson of the originalist interpretation of the Constitution, which meant any law had to divine the original intentions of the slave-owning, landowning, founding white male fathers of our nation, which excluded women and non-landowning males (and slaves, of course) from representation."}
{"original": "So that meant turning the clock back at least one century to a time when the white male patriarchy still ruled, which was a much less democratic time. Scalia's most noted opinion was to expand Second Amendment gun owners' rights, which 'protected' every citizen's right to own a gun almost without restriction, because the Second Amendment right to bear arms also protected an individual's right of self-defense."}
{"original": "The result has been record gun sales and gun deaths (30,000+ per year), as well as mass shootings, and no limit to the purchase of military style assault rifles with unlimited magazines. Another little-noted result was the higher incidence of gun violence in households with guns, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence."}
{"original": "In fact, Research published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that living in a home where guns are kept increased an individual's risk of death by homicide by between 40 and 170 percent, said the Law Center. Another study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology similarly found that persons with guns in the home were at greater risk of dying from a homicide in the home than those without guns in the home. This study determined that the presence of guns in the home increased an individual's risk of death by homicide by 90 percent."}
{"original": "Whereas other developed countries without that Second Amendment 'right', such as Australia, do not allow the purchase of a gun for self-defense to be a sufficient reason for owning such a weapon. And Australia has not had a single incidence of mass shootings since 1996 and the passing of its gun control legislation."}
{"original": "But the Second Amendment ruling pales to Justice Scalia's opinion that gave the 2000 presidential election to GW Bush, in the Supreme Court's Bush v. Gore ruling, which overturned the Florida Supreme Court's decision to extend the vote re-count past the December 12 deadline, until a full recount had been done."}
{"original": "What was the basis for Scalia's majority opinion?"}
{"original": "The counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner Bush, and to the country, by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election. Count first, and rule upon legality afterwards, is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires."}
{"original": "The four dissenting judges disputed Scalia's claim:"}
{"original": "Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's Presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law."}
{"original": "The consequences to our democratic system were even worse. By basically interfering with Florida's right to choose its Electoral College delegates, GW Bush became president. And his eight year term included the attack on 9/11, two wars, tax cuts that created the largest federal budget deficit in history, as well as two recessions, including the Great Recession."}
{"original": "Justice Sandra Day O'Connor unfortunately only later in interviews hinted that she regretted casting the deciding vote with the 5-4 conservative majority. The damage to democratic values have only been compounded with more recent rulings of the 'Scalia majority', such as gutting the Voting Rights Act that makes it more difficult for minorities and immigrants to vote, and Citizens United v. FEC (Federal Election Commission)."}
{"original": "The Citizens United ruling overturned the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (commonly known as the McCain-Feingold Act or BCRA). Section 203 of BCRA had defined an electioneering communication as a broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that mentioned a candidate within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary, and prohibited such expenditures by corporations and unions."}
{"original": "Instead, the Scalia majority held that the First Amendment right to freedom of expression should be expanded to allow unlimited election spending by individuals as well as for profit and non-profit corporations and institutions."}
{"original": "There is probably no other individual in recent history that has done as much to protect the rights of the wealthiest and most privileged."}

{"original": "Nahhan via Getty Images Spekboom, also known as elephant bush or Portulacaria afra, is very good at absorbing carbon relative to the water it uses."}
{"original": "Peter Shrimpton always wanted to build something that could be seen from space. With his latest project, the South African social entrepreneur believes he might just manage it. In the outskirts of his hometown of Stellenbosch, Shrimpton is overseeing the planting of a vast labyrinth that he says will eventually cover the same amount of land as Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza."}
{"original": "What Shrimpton is most excited about, however, is not the size of the labyrinth but what's being used to grow it: hundreds of thousands of spekboom trees."}
{"original": "This succulent plant ― also called Portulacaria afra ― used to cover swaths of South Africa's Eastern Cape before being nibbled to a fraction of its former glory by farmed goats and sheep. In recent months it has shot back to fame amid claims it is a carbon-busting miracle shrub with the potential to negate whole countries' emissions."}
{"original": "This is in actual fact a wonder plant, said Shrimpton. He has been growing spekboom for three years via a network of growers in South Africa's slums and selling them to individuals and companies wanting to reduce their carbon footprint. Eventually Shrimpton hopes to persuade the South African government to commit to planting a billion of them."}
{"original": "Peter Shrimpton Peter Shrimpton's labyrinth of spekboom starting to take shape in Stellenbosch, South Africa."}
{"original": "Shrimpton is not the only one obsessing over spekboom. The hashtag #SpekBoomChallenge has gone viral on social media, with people across South Africa pledging to plant 10 this year and urging others to follow. The city of Cape Town has promised to plant 5,000 spekboom during April, and shops have been giving them away for free. Just before Christmas, the banking group Investec gave each of its 5,200 South African staff a spekboom to neutralize their carbon emissions at work, urging them to pay it forward by giving cuttings to friends and family."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, the government is working up plans to restore a million hectares (2.5 million acres) of spekboom thicket ― roughly 170 times the size of Manhattan ― potentially creating work for thousands of people in the process."}
{"original": "Interest has also spread beyond South Africa. A U.K. couple this month launched The Spekboom Project, with the stated aim of removing half a million metric tons of CO2 from the atmosphere by persuading millions of British people to keep one as a houseplant."}
{"original": "But is spekboom all it's cracked up to be?"}
{"original": "Spekboom is attractive, virtually pest free and very good at absorbing CO2 relative to the amount of water it uses, said Jan Vlok, a botanist and research associate with Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Once established, it also drops leaves that turn into mulch and help retain water in the soil after a storm, making it particularly valuable for ecosystem restoration in the arid zones to which it is indigenous, he said."}
{"original": "Existing data suggests a hectare of restored spekboom in dry areas will absorb up to 15.4 metric tons (17 U.S. tons) of CO2 annually ― slightly more than the average American's annual carbon footprint ― an impressive figure, said Vlok."}
{"original": "Peter Shrimpton Volunteers starting to plant the labyrinth of spekboom in Stellenbosch, South Africa."}
{"original": "But he worries that the current hype around spekboom goes beyond the science, describing a widely circulated claim that a hectare of spekboom can absorb 10 times more CO2 than a hectare of the Amazon rainforest as a ridiculous comparison. It creates this misconception that it's OK to chop down the Amazon rainforest ― you just have to plant spekboom ― which is absolute nonsense."}
{"original": "Such hype could be harmful, Vlok said: In the long term it's going to give spekboom restoration a very bad name, where actually it's doing very good work when it's done in the right way in the right place."}
{"original": "Vlok is also wary of claims that individuals will be able to slash their own carbon footprint by planting spekboom at home. Even if you have 100 plants, it's simply not going to make you carbon neutral, he said. And while people from the U.S. to Denmark have shown interest in planting spekboom, Vlok cautions that it is unlikely to be the most suitable plant outside of its natural area ― it hates frost and brackish soil, for example. I would rather advise them to look for something in their own country, said Vlok."}
{"original": "Even in South Africa, a narrow focus on spekboom planting could also bring unintended consequences, warned Sally Archibald, an environmental scientist at the University of the Witwatersrand, by email. Planting spekboom across South Africa's natural grasslands and savannas, for example, would lead to a lot of carbon being lost from the soil. Digging up natural veld [open, uncultivated landscape] to plant spekboom or any other tree will always be a carbon-costly thing to do, she said."}
{"original": "geoffsp via Getty Images An African buffalo bull eating from a spekboom bush in Addo Elephant Park, South Africa."}
{"original": "Spekboom does best in dry areas of the thicket biome ― the shrubland and low forest of the Eastern Cape ― said Kath Smart, a postdoctoral researcher in ecosystem restoration at South Africa's Rhodes University. Planting needs to be managed carefully, she said, because if planted too densely, for example, spekboom could push out other species by creating a canopy that overshadows plant life closer to the ground."}
{"original": "I do think [spekboom] has a special role to play, she said, but added, it's not the silver bullet, the panacea, that everyone is making it out to be."}
{"original": "It's hardly the first silver bullet idea to hit the climate change debate. From planet-saving bamboo to the algae that will power the world, we've been hearing about miracle fixes for decades."}
{"original": "Spekboom's growing popularity ties in with the wider interest in nature-based solutions to climate change, seen most recently with a sweep of tree-planting pledges, including Donald Trump's promise to help plant a trillion trees. But while this trend may help spur other actions, the idea that one simple plant can solve all our problems is misguided, experts say."}
{"original": "So many of us are feeling so terrified about climate change, I can see why people are thinking, ah, we can just do this. Alice Bell, co-director of U.K. climate charity Possible"}
{"original": "In an age of climate doom, it is understandable that people turn to simple-sounding solutions, said Alice Bell, co-director of U.K. climate charity Possible. So many of us are feeling so terrified about climate change, I can see why people are thinking, ah, we can just do this, she said."}
{"original": "Nature-based solutions, like mass tree planting, may have particular appeal, she added, because they lack the ick factor of, say, spraying chemicals into the sky to block the sun's rays and lower temperatures, or building nuclear power stations."}
{"original": "But the danger of the miracle framing is complacency, said Bell ― a belief that we can offset our way out of the climate crisis; or that small personal actions will be sufficient, when in fact we need to make deep and widespread changes, including cutting our emissions drastically."}
{"original": "In the case of spekboom, Shrimpton argues that the buzz around the plant can spur wider change by acting as a catalyst for mobilizing people to think about their carbon footprint."}
{"original": "Whether this is likely is still open to debate, said Stuart Capstick, a psychologist at Cardiff University in Wales."}
{"original": "There is research showing that when individual actions are perceived as effective, there is a decline in support for national policies to tackle climate change. One 2017 study in Japan, for example, found that when people were asked to report on the energy-saving measures they were taking at home, support for a carbon tax fell."}
{"original": "But there is also evidence that the opposite can happen, said Capstick — that when the conditions are right, taking one eco-friendly action triggers others. A meta-analysis of studies on environmental interventions published in Nature Sustainability, found that this was most likely when the action was seen as inherently important or interesting."}
{"original": "Feeling like your efforts go beyond an individual or household level, and are part of a wider community effort, is important, said Capstick. Since the world is still burning fossil fuels on a massive scale, a huge and concerted societal push for system change is required to tackle climate change."}

But you aren't living in an ideal world ― you're living through a snowpocalypse, and you're essentially under house arrest with the rest of your family."}
{"original": "If you can't agree on anything else, you can all probably agree that you're hungry. To that end, warm up those frozen tamales from Christmas ― or use the leftover cheese from your New Year's party for a makeshift charcuterie board. If you're really feeling ambitious, score brownie points with your spouse by making breakfast in bed."}
{"original": "Hey, you may not be at a hotel, but you can still get the hotel experience in small ways when you're experiencing this weather, said Danielle Kepler, a marriage and family therapist. Figure out what food you have in your fridge and eat it in bed, wearing robes and your pajamas as if you received room service."}
{"original": "2. Put your cellphones, laptops and tablets away."}
{"original": "This one might send a shiver up your spine ― and it's already so cold ― but hear us out: It's kind of fun to put away all your electronics and see if your family could survive, Little House on the Prairie-style. You might even end up engaging with each other."}
{"original": "Consider your snow day an old-fashioned day, said therapist Amanda Stemen. Light some candles, home cook a meal, play some records, and enjoy what may come. Focus on one another, rather than on work or other distractions. Plus, doing something different like this increases oxytocin so it feels like you're beginning something new and exciting."}
{"original": "You both might be very hesitant to get naked, but grab a blanket; there's lot of sexy fun you can have while bundled up, Hirschman said. I suggest wrapping your partner up in that warm blanket and giving them some great oral sex down below."}

{"original": "4. Divide and conquer when it comes to cleaning."}
{"original": "Sure, it's not the most fun idea on this list, but face facts: Your home has been a total pigsty since the holidays, and now you're stuck living in it. Get busy cleaning."}
{"original": "The best part of tidying up? It could lead to some of that sexy time mentioned above. A 2015 study from the University of Alberta found that couples who divvied up chores had higher relationship satisfaction and more sex than couples who didn't mutually contribute."}
{"original": "5. Get ahead on your taxes."}
{"original": "Why not just lean into the awfulness of your current situation and really get some work done? It's a supremely unsexy activity, but you're frozen inside anyway, so set your cold hearts on getting some tax work done, advised couples therapist Aaron Anderson."}
{"original": "This is a good one, because you save yourself the stress and arguments that inevitably come when you're trying to cram in April, Anderson said. Not everything couples do is romantic."}
{"original": "Anderson even provided a to-do list for snowed-in love birds: Dust off all those receipts and organize them, write down the value of donations you donated to the thrift store, and call your mortgage provider and get your latest statement."}
{"original": "6. Grant yourselves permission to be lazy together."}
{"original": "The opposite argument could be made for being super lazy: You've muddled through the holidays with your families, and now you're dealing with this snowmaggedon nonsense. Give yourself a break."}
{"original": "The kids are probably in their rooms binge watching who-knows-what, so go ahead and enjoy the silence together, Anderson said. Sit down, cuddle and just talk. You probably do this at night when the kids are asleep, but couples' nighttime conversations are different than their daytime conversations."}
{"original": "The other benefit of having quality adult conversation, according to Anderson?"}
{"original": "Student loans aren't just a nuisance plaguing today's young college grads. More than 44 million Americans collectively owe $1.5 trillion in student loan debt. There's a good chance that includes you."}
{"original": "Wouldn't it be nice to finally get rid of that debt and be able to spend money on things you actually care about? The good news: There are a few strategies you can use to pay down those loans faster. Here are seven you can try."}
{"original": "1. Turn windfalls into extra payments."}
{"original": "One of the best ways to pay down your student loan debt fast is by making more than the minimum payments. Of course, just pay more isn't realistic advice for most people. But hear me out on this one: Even a few one-off extra payments can have a significant impact on your student loan balance."}
{"original": "For example, you could apply part of your yearly bonus from work or a tax refund to your debt, said Brian Walsh, a certified financial planner and financial planning manager at SoFi. Or you could participate in a challenge like dry January or a no-spend month to come up with the extra cash. It might feel painful to put something fun like a cash windfall toward your student loan debt, but the results can be dramatic."}
{"original": "Don't believe it? Say you have a $20,000 loan at 6 percent interest and 10 years left to pay it off. If you made just one extra payment of $100 each year, you'd pay off your loan five months sooner and save $315 in interest."}
{"original": "2. Split your payments in two."}
{"original": "Another trick you can use to pay off your loan faster is dividing your monthly payment into two. For example, if you have $300 due at the end of every month, make one payment of $150 on the 15th and a second payment of $150 on the 30th."}
{"original": "This little trick could knock off an entire year of payments. - Sean Moore, certified financial planner"}
{"original": "Not only can this make payments a little easier to manage, since most people get their paychecks every other week, but paying half every two weeks equals one extra payment made each year without even noticing the difference, said Sean Moore, a certified financial planner and founder of SMART College Funding."}
{"original": "That's because, on a monthly schedule, you'd make 12 payments per year. However, splitting payments among 26 weeks (52 weeks in the year, divided by two), you end up with 13 months' worth of payments over the same time period."}
{"original": "On a typical 10-year repayment schedule, this little trick could knock off an entire year of payments (and interest)!"}
{"original": "Though it won't have the most dramatic impact on your student loan debt, signing up for automatic payments can knock off a bit of interest and help you put more cash toward the principal balance."}
{"original": "This tactic allows your student loan servicer to automatically deduct your payment from your bank account each month. Besides ensuring that you pay on time and never miss a payment, some lenders may also give you a discount just for enrolling, said Janet Alvarez, a personal finance expert at Wise Bread. Usually, that discount is 0.25 percent."}
{"original": "If you have a steady income and good credit, you might qualify to refinance your student loans. Refinancing involves taking out a new loan and using the funds to pay off the old loan. Usually, people refinance their loans to achieve a new term length, a lower interest rate or both."}
{"original": "For instance, you might refinance a 10-year student loan to a term of seven years. It would result in higher monthly payments, but you'd pay the loan off faster and save money on interest. And if you can refinance to a lower interest rate as well, more of your money will go toward paying down the balance as fast as possible."}
{"original": "Let's take our $20,000 loan example from above. With 10 years left at 6 percent interest, your monthly payments would be $222."}
{"original": "Now let's say you refinance to a slightly lower rate of 5 percent. Your bill would drop to $212. Not a huge difference, sure. But what if you kept paying $222 each month despite the new lower bill? You'd knock off six months and $335 in interest from your loan. Now imagine what would happen if the interest rate difference was even bigger."}
{"original": "Travis Hornsby, founder of Student Loan Planner, suggests creating a refinancing ladder to maximize your savings. The way you do this is start with a payment you can afford pretty easily, say, a 10- or 15-year loan. Pay extra when you have extra, and you'll cut down the amount that you owe rapidly, Hornsby explained. After a couple of years, you can refinance again to a seven-year loan, often with the same payment but with a lower interest rate. Finally, you could refinance one more time to a five-year loan before you finish paying off the entire amount."}
{"original": "Keep in mind that you should work with a lender that doesn't charge loan origination fees, which might cancel out interest savings. It's also a good idea to weigh the risks of refinancing federal student loans, because doing so would change them to private loans and permanently forfeit federal protections such as income-driven repayment and forgiveness options."}
{"original": "5. Join a company that offers repayment assistance."}
{"original": "If you're looking to change jobs, it's worth looking into companies that help pay student loans as a benefit."}
{"original": "These programs will give you money toward your student loans simply for working at the company. - Adrian Nazari, CEO and founder of Credit Sesame"}
{"original": "More and more employers are embracing an employee benefit called student loan repayment assistance, said Adrian Nazari, CEO and founder of Credit Sesame. Unlike tuition reimbursement, where you get paid for going to school, these programs will give you money toward your student loans simply for working at the company."}
{"original": "Only a small percentage of companies currently offer this perk, but those that do include Fidelity, Aetna and Staples. The amounts vary from as little as $500 per year to $10,000 per year, Nazari said."}
{"original": "According to Nazari, there are organizations that offer student loan repayment assistance in exchange for working on nonprofit projects. For example, SponsorChange and similar organizations match volunteers who have sought-after skills with sponsors who fund student loan payments for each project completed."}
{"original": "You do need to adhere to their guidelines and successfully complete the program according to their requirements in order to qualify for loan repayment assistance, he said. But it can be a great way to give back while making a dent in your student debt."}
{"original": "7. Pay according to your personality."}
{"original": "Finally, if you have more than one loan to tackle, it helps to follow a repayment strategy that aligns with your personality. According to Willie Anderson, who advises clients and writes on various financial topics, there are two main methods for debt repayment: The debt snowball and debt avalanche."}
{"original": "The debt snowball method is ideal for people who need to experience wins right away. With this strategy, you'll begin paying the smallest balance off first, Anderson said. Continue to make the minimum payments on your other accounts and put as much money as you can towards the smallest balance. Once the smallest balance is paid off, combine the amount you were paying on that balance with the minimum payment on your next-smallest balance, and so on. This strategy can help keep you motivated and encouraged since you should start to see some results right away, Anderson said."}
{"original": "If you're more about saving as much money as possible, you might want to give the debt avalanche a shot. With this method, you throw the largest payment you can at your highest-interest-rate debt every month, while paying the minimum payments on your other debts. By focusing on interest rates rather than the balances, you save more money overall."}
{"original": "Keep in mind that as annoying as student loan debt is, it might not always be the most urgent financial matter to address."}
{"original": "Before aggressively paying down your student loans, you should make sure you paid off high-interest debt such as credit cards or personal loans, said Walsh. You should also make sure you are saving enough for your long-term goals, he said ― think retirement ― since, over time, the returns from investing have been higher than the interest rate most people pay on student loans."}
{"original": "On Thursday, Amazon released the short list of cities and other localities that are still in the running to host the online retail giant's second headquarters, which it's calling HQ2."}
{"original": "Here's the list, in alphabetical order:"}
{"original": "The finalists were chosen from 238 original applicants representing locations across North America. While critics argue that Amazon's public bidding process amounts to a degrading race in which suitors are forced to one up each other with irresponsibly large financial incentives, the company's pledge to invest $5 billion and create 50,000 high-paying jobs at HQ2 has kept cities in the hunt."}
{"original": "The frenzied initial application process drove officials to pull out all the stops to catch Amazon's eye. Kansas City, Missouri, mayor Sly James bought 1,000 items from Amazon (for charity) and left a five-star review for each one along with a plug for his city as the perfect HQ2. (Kansas City did not make the final 20.)"}
{"original": "Newark dangled $7 billion in tax breaks in its bid, justifying the eye-popping figure by estimating that HQ2 could generate $9 billion in economic activity. (Newark did make the final 20.)"}
{"original": "Rick Wilking / Reuters The HQ2 pitch from Golden, Colorado, included a letter from Gov. John Hickenlooper to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos."}
{"original": "Thank you to all 238 communities that submitted proposals, said Holly Sullivan of Amazon Public Policy in a statement. Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough ― all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity."}
{"original": "Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation, Sullivan added."}
{"original": "The company said it will be reaching out to officials in the 20 cities over the next few months to dive deeper into their proposals, request additional information, and evaluate the feasibility of a future partnership."}
{"original": "Amazon said it expects to make a final decision for HQ2 sometime in 2018."}
{"original": "Democratic senators are worried about high-earning households receiving stimulus checks if the next pandemic relief bill has the same eligibility rules as before."}
{"original": "During the presidential campaign, Joe Biden vowed to deliver $2,000 checks if elected. In December, Congress approved a round of $600 payments. To make up the difference, Biden has made $1,400 checks the cornerstone of his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package"}
{"original": "But because the checks are more valuable, and because the full amount would go both to tax filers and their dependents, Democrats are squirming over the prospect of much higher earners receiving the payments this time."}
{"original": "If a certain family has a number of kids, it could spill over. Some small amount of money could go to families making $390,000, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with Democrats, told HuffPost."}
{"original": "Democrats are now weighing their options for avoiding that outcome."}
{"original": "Previously, the payments went to all individuals earning $75,000 or less (and all joint filers earning $150,000 or less). The payments gradually shrank by $5 for every $100 of income above those levels, ultimately disappearing for a childless worker who earned more than $103,000 in their most recent tax year."}
{"original": "One option Democrats have considered to cut off higher earners would be to lower the phaseout threshold to $50,000 for individuals and $100,000 for married couples."}
{"original": "Lowering the income threshold in some way doesn't break my heart. Lowering the dollar amount I think would be a bad idea, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told HuffPost. If it can be done in a way that pushes money out quickly to the people who need it the most, I'm all for it."}
{"original": "Schatz said reducing the cost of another round of stimulus checks would free up funds for additional relief measures like housing aid and food assistance."}
{"original": "But even if Congress set the phaseout threshold at $40,000, a small percentage of households with incomes around $390,000 would still get partial payments, according to an analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation. That's because the 5% phaseout rate doesn't whittle down payments fast enough to exclude high-income households with lots of children, since the baseline is for each household member to get $1,400."}
{"original": "In the first round of checks, adults got $1,200 for themselves and $500 per child. The second round was $600 for each person."}
{"original": "Another option would be to set a lower threshold and also a higher phaseout rate, so that the size of the checks diminishes more quickly for higher earners. A third solution could be to simply cap the number of dependents who can receive checks, or to reduce the size of the checks for dependents."}
{"original": "Sanders said he doesn't believe the threshold itself is going to be set at a lower level."}
{"original": "Democrats this week started the special budget process that will allow them to pass a broader relief bill with a simple majority and no Republican supporters. On Thursday, a group of nine centrist Democrats co-sponsored a budget amendment that calls on Congress to take measures to ensure upper-income taxpayers are not eligible for checks."}
{"original": "Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said the number of people affected by the move would be substantially unchanged and that he would support it if it is backed by economists."}
{"original": "With the original threshold, roughly 167 million households would receive payments, according to Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. If the phaseout started at $50,000, checks would go to 157 million households, nearly 10 million fewer. The reduction would save $50 billion, roughly 11% of the total cost of the checks."}
{"original": "If all Democrats want to do is make sure higher earners don't get checks, It's a sensible approach, Gleckman added."}
{"original": "Fully 94% of households would get payments under the original Biden proposal, according to the Tax Foundation. Even with a $40,000 phaseout threshold, 87% would still get payments."}
{"original": "Not every Senate Democrat supports setting a lower income threshold for the next round of stimulus checks, particularly senators from more affluent states where people would stand to lose money."}
{"original": "Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he likes the previous threshold of $75,000 for individuals receiving direct payments because of its overall stimulative effect on the economy."}
{"original": "This isn't just about those in need, he said."}
{"original": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package already targeted."}
{"original": "We need to get that out the door, she said. Right now I just want to see us push this thing on through."}
{"original": "Fred Shekoufeh looks a lot older than 15, but then again his son, Eric, doesn't look four either."}
{"original": "Shekoufeh and son, who live in La Mesa, California, share a unique bond that goes beyond genetics: They were both born on February 29."}
{"original": "The calendrical quirk means that even though the older Shekoufeh will celebrate 60 years on Earth on Monday, it will only be his 15th official birthday."}
{"original": "Eric is celebrating his 5th official birthday the same day. Both father and son were born on February 29, an event that has a 1 in 2.1 million chance of happening, according to Time.com."}
{"original": "Fred Shekoufeh, a native of Iran, didn't realize his birthday was unusual until 1979 when he moved to the U.S. and immigration officials commented on it."}
{"original": "Since then, he celebrates his birthday when he can, but admits it's hard to top 1996, when he turned 10 in a hospital delivery room."}
{"original": "My ex-wife was in labor and said, 'This is your birthday present,' Shekoufeh said. When the doctor found that out, she said, I will try to bring that baby out so it can share your birthday."}
{"original": "Courtesy of Eric Shekoufeh Eric Shekoufeh was only four when he graduated from high school, thanks to being born on Feb. 29. His dad, Fred, was 14 because he shares the same birthday."}

{"original": "I get lots of jokes about whether I should celebrate on Feb. 28 or March 1, Eric said, adding that he tries to stretch it out on both days."}
{"original": "It's a weird day. People don't recognize it on social media, but when they find out, they never forget it."}
{"original": "Eric's favorite Feb. 29th birthday was in 2012, when he turned four."}
{"original": "Everyone and their mother made a joke about me turning four, and that four-year-olds shouldn't be able to drive cars. Well, evidently I could, he said.

{"original": "Maria aims to purchase a house for $200, 000. Because she has financial assets of $300,000, one of her options is to buy the house for all cash. Alternatively, she can obtain a mortgage of $180,000 for 15 years at 4% and zero fees. Maria has excess disposable income of $2,000 a month which would more than cover the payment on a mortgage."}
{"original": "How does she make the choice? The method I would use is to calculate her net worth at the end of her expected period in the house, or at the mortgage payoff date. whichever comes first. I will assume the mortgage payoff period of 15years. The calculation of future net worth would be done twice, once on the assumption that Maria purchases with all cash, and once on the assumption that she borrows 90% of the price."}
{"original": "I've developed a spreadsheet to make the calculations manageable; interested readers can download the Future Net Worth spreadsheet to their computers."}
{"original": "In the all-cash purchase, future net worth after 15 years is the sum of the future value of Marie's $2000 of excess income, invested monthly to earn 4%, or $492,181; plus the future value of the $100,000 of financial assets left after buying the house for cash, or $182,030; plus the future value of the house at an assumed appreciation rate of 3%, or $313,486. The three items sum to a total net worth of $987,697."}
{"original": "If Maria finances the purchase with a $180,000 mortgage at 4%, her excess income is reduced from $2,000 to $669 because of the mortgage payment, but her financial assets are reduced only by $20,000 to $280,000. The future values are $164, 526, $509,684 and $313,486, which sum to $987, 697. The future net worth is the same in both cases because I assumed that Maria's financial assets earned the same return as the rate she paid on the mortgage."}
{"original": "The relationship between the mortgage rate and the investment rate is the major factor determining whether or not it makes sense to pay all cash. If Maria earns only 2% on investments while paying 4% on a mortgage, financing the purchase with a mortgage would result in a future net worth of only $831, 558. She should pay all cash. On the other hand If she earned 8% on investments, her net worth would be $1,470,772, so she should finance the purchase."}
{"original": "But there is a small proviso. Mortgage interest paid is deductible whereas interest earned is taxable. If Maria is in the 28% tax bracket, taking account of the mortgage interest deduction would increase the future net worth in the case where she borrows by $20,000 -$25, 000. My spreadsheet allows the user to specify any tax bracket desired."}
{"original": "And there is a major proviso that is much more likely to be overlooked. I have assumed that when the purchaser pays all cash, she allocates to monthly savings an amount equal to the monthly mortgage payment that she would have made had she borrowed. In the borrowing case, she is required to pay $1331 a month on the mortgage, leaving $669 for investment. In the all cash purchase, the obligatory payment is gone and she must invest $2,000 a month voluntarily."}
{"original": "This is critically important. If Maria spends all her disposable income in the two cases, her future net worth in the borrowing case would be twice as large as in the all cash purchase case, the 8% investment rate notwithstanding. It reminds us, once again, that the forced saving feature of the long-term fully amortizing mortgage serves many consumers well."}

{"original": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Deep in Gov. Gavin Newsom's new budget is a figure that says a lot about California's shaky legal marijuana market: The state is expecting a lot less cash from cannabis taxes."}
{"original": "The Democrat's proposed spending plan, released Thursday, projects the state will bank $355 million in marijuana excise taxes by the end of June. That's roughly half of what was once expected after broad legal sales kicked off last year."}
{"original": "Industry experts say the diminished tax income reflects a somber reality: Most consumers are continuing to purchase pot in the illegal marketplace, where they avoid taxes that can near 50 percent in some communities."}
{"original": "Tax collections are expected to gradually increase over time, but predicting what that amount will be remains something of a guess."}
{"original": "Tax collections for a newly created market are subject to significant uncertainty, the budget said."}
{"original": "Josh Drayton of the California Cannabis Industry Association credited Newsom with taking a realistic look at the challenges after a bumpy first year of broad legal sales."}
{"original": "Newsom also recommended a sharp increase in spending for regulatory programs, although it's an open question whether it will be enough to help steady the state pot economy. The budget recommends just over $200 million for marijuana-related activities in the fiscal year that starts July 1, which would be over a 50 percent boost from the current year."}
{"original": "Initially the state was too optimistic about how the implementation of legalization was going to work. This governor has paid attention to that, Drayton said."}
{"original": "That said, Drayton added that legal businesses need a break from hefty tax rates that are driving consumers to the illicit economy. Various proposals have been made to cut state pot taxes."}
{"original": "State taxes include a 15 percent levy on purchases of all cannabis and cannabis products, including medical pot. Local governments are free to slap on taxes on sales and growing too, which has created a confusing patchwork of tax rates around the state."}
{"original": "The state's top marijuana regulator, Lori Ajax, has said the state intends to get more businesses licensed and operating in 2019, while cracking down on rogue operators who continue to proliferate across the state."}
{"original": "At year's end, California's effort to transform its longstanding illegal and medicinal marijuana markets into a unified, multibillion-dollar industry remained a work in progress. By some estimates, up to 80 percent of sales in the state remain under the table, snatching profits from legal storefronts."}
{"original": "Drayton said more than half the municipalities in the state do not have laws governing the industry. That means pot businesses cannot locate there, since companies are required to have a local license before seeking one from the state."}
{"original": "The budget also includes an additional $2.9 million for the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to help chase down tax cheats."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, the courts budget includes nearly $14 million for resentencing of thousands of drug offenders whose offenses are no longer crimes since California legalized recreational pot."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats on a pivotal House panel have proposed an additional $1,400 in direct payments to individuals, bolstered unemployment benefits and more generous tax breaks for families with children and for lower earners as Congress began piecing together a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package on Monday."}
{"original": "The plan is expected to closely follow President Joe Biden's proposed package to address the tolls of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over 460,000 Americans, and the nation's still staggering economy, which has lost 10 million jobs since the crisis began last year. Biden, less than three weeks into his presidency, has declared that defeating the virus and fixing the economy are his top priorities."}
{"original": "The proposal by the Ways and Means Committee, which plans to vote on it by week's end, would also expand tax credits for families with children, for lower-earning people and for Americans who buy health insurance on marketplaces created by former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. It would also provide health care subsidies for some unemployed workers."}
{"original": "Spending by Ways and Means, one of Congress' most powerful committees, is expected to exceed $900 billion, nearly half of Biden's overall plan. The House Education and Labor Committee also previewed its plans on Monday, a roughly $350 billion package that includes $130 billion to help schools reopen safely, $40 billion for colleges battered by the pandemic and gradually raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour."}
{"original": "Top Democrats hope the House will approve the complete bill later this month and send a final House-Senate version to Biden for his signature before mid-March, when crucial emergency unemployment benefits will otherwise expire."}
{"original": "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour would reduce the number of Americans living in poverty and boost wages for millions of Americans while adding to the federal debt and joblessness, a new report from the Congressional Budget Office projects."}
{"original": "The federal deficit would increase by about $54 billion over 10 years under a Democratic proposal to gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15, largely because the higher wages paid to workers, such as those caring for the elderly, would contribute to an increase in federal spending, the estimate found."}
{"original": "Democrats are pushing to include the higher minimum wage as part of their $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan. House committees this week will begin crafting the legislation along the lines that President Joe Biden has requested. The Committee on Education and Labor included the wage hike in its portion of the COVID-19 legislation unveiled Monday."}
{"original": "Beyond the wage increase, the measure includes nearly $130 billion in grants to states to help schools repair ventilation systems, reduce class sizes and purchase personal protective equipment as communities work to safely reopen schools. An additional $40 billion would go to colleges and universities, with much of the money targeted to emergency financial aid for students. And about $39 billion would be used to provide relief to child care providers."}
{"original": "But it's the change to the minimum wage that is becoming a key early test for Biden as he seeks to build public support for his proposal and navigate differences within his own party about how far the COVID-19 legislation should go. Voices on the left like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the author of the wage legislation, want Democrats to fight now for the pay increase, but some moderates are wary, fearing the impact on small businesses during the pandemic."}
{"original": "The broader relief bill is also expected to include another round of direct payments to Americans, an expansion of the child tax credit and aid to states and local governments."}
{"original": "The report from the Congressional Budget Office cites several positive and negative effects from raising the minimum wage. On the positive, the number of people living in poverty would fall by about 900,000 once the $15 wage is fully in place in 2025. On the negative, the number of people working would decline by about 1.4 million."}
{"original": "Rep. Bobby Scott, the Democratic chair of the House Education and Labor Committee, said the report strengthens the case for including the $15 minimum wage in the COVID-19 relief bill. He emphasized that the report projected that 17 million workers making below the minimum wage would see a pay increase once the requirement is in place. An additional 10 million workers making slightly more than the proposed minimum could also see a boost in pay."}
{"original": "At a time when many of our essential workers are still not being paid enough to provide for themselves and their families, we must do everything in our power to give these workers a long-overdue raise, Scott said."}
{"original": "Scott added that the legislation takes bold and immediate action to help reopen schools and protect workers."}
{"original": "The committee's ranking Republican, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, called the proposal a partisan, slapdash scheme to push Democrats' agenda. This laundry list of left-wing proposals is astounding, she said."}
{"original": "Lawmakers worried about the ability of small businesses to pay the higher minimum wage will undoubtedly point to the job losses that CBO said would occur. Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said they can support efforts to increase the minimum wage but cite $15 as too high."}
{"original": "White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden remains firmly committed to a $15 minimum wage. But Psaki also noted that the Senate parliamentarian has the final say on whether the minimum wage hike survives in the final package. The fast-track process that Democrats are using does not allow changes to spending or taxes that are merely incidental to a larger policy purpose."}
{"original": "The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour and has not changed since 2009. Most states also have minimum wage laws. Employees generally are entitled to the higher of the two minimum wages. Currently, 29 states and Washington, D.C., have minimum wages above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour."}
{"original": "Also Monday, Democratic lawmakers unveiled legislation to permanently expand the child tax credit, with backers saying that Democratic leadership has agreed to include their legislation for one year as part of the COVID-19 relief measure."}
{"original": "Under the legislation, the value of the tax credit would become fully refundable and would be expanded from $2,000 to $3,000 for children ages 6 though 17, and from $2,000 to $3,600 for children below the age of 6."}
{"original": "If we don't act now, we'll miss a historic opportunity to give millions of children a brighter future, said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash."}
{"original": "Democratic lawmakers are also pushing for payments to be made on a monthly basis rather than in an annual lump sum."}
{"original": "If we can land men on the moon, then we can get a monthly check out to folks, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the chair of the House Appropriations Committee."}
{"original": "Perhaps the biggest question in the COVID-19 relief bill is who will get another round of stimulus payments. In December, lawmakers approved $600 checks for individuals making up to $75,000 a year and $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000, with payments phased out for higher incomes."}
{"original": "Many lawmakers have called for the next round of government checks to be more specifically targeted to those whose incomes have been harmed by the pandemic."}
{"original": "Psaki said that Biden believes families making $275,000 or $300,000 might not need direct checks, but the terms of the relief payments were still being debated."}
{"original": "There is a discussion right now about what that threshold will look like. A conclusion has not been finalized, Psaki said. His view is that a nurse, a teacher, a firefighter who's making $60,000 shouldn't be left without any support or relief either."}

{"original": "PARIS — French President-elect Emmanuel Macron's extraordinary victory should not mask the Herculean task that lies ahead. France is in a world of hurt, scarred by a series of terrorist attacks and a decade of mass unemployment and stagnation in standards of living. Without decisive fiscal, tax and labor-market reforms, and a noticeable improvement of the economy, it may well be far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen's turn to become president in 2022."}
{"original": "Whether Macron can implement market reforms depends on whether he can coalesce a majority in the National Assembly in the parliamentary elections coming mid-June. Macron's party is barely a year old and doesn't have a single seat in the Assembly."}
{"original": "Although many pundits expect Macron to ally himself with the ailing Socialist Party (which he deserted last year) to achieve a majority, he may well have something shrewder in mind. Appointing a premier from the center-right party, the Republicans, would not only forge an overture to the right to implement economic and security reforms, but also — and this has been Macron's grand scheme all along — it would create a recomposition of the French political landscape."}
{"original": "Macron's extraordinary victory should not mask the Herculean task that lies ahead."}
{"original": "In the parlor game that commenced after the presidential election, there are four plausible scenarios for the outcome of the parliamentary elections:"}
{"original": "This would be the worst outcome. There are at least four political formations besides Macron's En Marche! vying for the 577 seats in the Assembly. A poll by Kantar-Sofres released on May 7 and conducted before Macron won the presidential vote points to a small lead in the upcoming legislative election for his party (24 percent) over the center right (22 percent) and the far right (21 percent), with the far left well behind (15 percent). If there is no strict majority, Macron would have to govern with a fragile grand coalition. This would make bold reforms more improbable and possibly embolden voters to vote for the extremes in 2022."}
{"original": "Although French voters gave their president a parliamentary majority in 2002, 2007 and 2012, it's a tall order for Macron to win a majority, least of all because the movement has never participated in parliamentary elections. More critically, the first round of the presidential elections showed that nearly three-quarters of French society want, at the very least, to be protected from the massive economic, social and cultural changes brought about by globalization, and many simply wish to reverse them."}
{"original": "But the legislative elections could be just as unexpected as the presidential one. Macron is banking on a new generation of political rookies — who have never run for office and who will make up half his legislative candidates — to appeal to voters' yearning for renewal. He is also betting that the sclerotic local right-left political machines of yesteryear are dead, and that the impressive grassroots network of 270,000 foot soldiers that he built from scratch (largely online, Obama-style) in just over a year will carry the day. There is an unusually high number of incumbents not running due to a new law prohibiting local officials from also running in Parliament, which further enlarges the playing field."}
{"original": "Macron views his election as a foundational act."}
{"original": "3. Cohabitation with the center right"}
{"original": "If the center right wins the legislative elections, the parliamentary majority (and thus the prime minister) will be from a different group than the president, as was the case in 1986, 1993 and 1997. Macron and the Republicans would easily find agreement on numerous issues, ranging from labor-market reforms, fiscal discipline, a pro-Europe stance and a hawkish position on security. This scenario holds high promise for reform but may yet be undone by the center right's insistence that it is naturally in the opposition, in the words of François Baroin, who is leading the center right's legislative campaign. There's also the bruised egos of some of the center-right party bosses who, despite their eager supplications to lead a Macron government, have not appeared in the unofficial chatter of those close to Macron's circles."}
{"original": "Macron has said that he will announce his prime minister around May 15. His choice may yet usher in a fourth scenario, a big bang in French politics that he has dubbed la recomposition."}
{"original": "Macron views his election as a foundational act. In this new framework, the fracture lines of French politics are no longer about the right-left divide, but about an alliance of the progressives versus the nationalists. He has made no secret of his belief that the right as it is today is bound to implode, with a progressive wing joining him and a reactionary wing drifting toward a nationalist discourse. The renaming of his movement to La Republique en Marche on May 8 — coupled with his acceptance that candidates from other parties can carry the colors of his movement for the legislative elections, yet retain their original party membership — should leave no doubts as to his aim to rally the moderate right."}
{"original": "He is banking on a new generation of political rookies to appeal to voters' yearning for renewal."}
{"original": "Ironically, Macron shares many intellectual roots with Alain Juppé, the former prime minister who lost the center-right primary to François Fillon. Both view France as open, pro-European, multicultural and ripe for deep labor, tax and educational reform. As one Juppéist recently put it, their programs are not dissimilar, except that Macron is a little friendlier to households and Juppé to business."}
{"original": "Macron's choice of prime minister will be critical. Appointing a center-right prime minister could kill two birds with one stone: it could enhance his chances of creating a parliamentary majority under the banner of his movement in June that would fuel a strong impetus for reform, and it would give him a choice of the prime minister he wants to govern with before the center right imposes one, should they win."}
{"original": "It may be good news for Macron that the right-left divide is dead. But if he doesn't move swiftly to create a majority focused on reform in Parliament, the nationalist-globalist divide that has replaced the left-right divide may well contain the germs of a much more radical populist uprising that might open the gates to a more virulent Marine Le Pen in 2022."}
{"original": "Juppé may have the last word after all. As he stated in 2015, Maybe we should think one day about cutting both ends of the omelet so that reasonable people can govern together and leave aside the two extremes, left and right, that don't understand anything about the world."}

The latest estimates out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development include Finland, Iceland and Sweden among the seven most depressed of its member states."}

{"original": "I grew up in a country where very few people had to worry about everyday violence, or if they'd be able to put food on the table that day, or if they'd end up on the street after losing their jobs."}
{"original": "That said, Sweden is also a place where bookstores are filled with self-help manuals and where we manically renovate our kitchens but rarely cook; where every fridge is plastered with colorful sticky notes telling us to Wake up with a smile! and No carbs after 6 p.m."}
{"original": "We've been promised unconditional happiness since we were kids, so we go looking for it: in the self-help corner or in IKEA's kitchen department."}
{"original": "These aspects of Swedish culture are perfect examples of the quick-fix approach to happiness that has become the norm in Nordic countries, the United States and the rest of the world's happiest nations. Yes, the absence of acute threats to our well-being (which is a more accurate definition of what the Happiness Index is actually meant to measure) has likely helped make us happier. However, we've also consistently raised the bar of our expectations, resulting in the illusion that we can – and should! – be euphorically happy all the time."}
{"original": "It starts early. Children are sheltered from negative feelings as if unhappiness is an illness they won't be able to shake. Instead of teaching kids how to deal with the full range of their emotions, we treat them like they're fragile and incapable of navigating their way through uncomfortable feelings."}
{"original": "In the last couple of decades, childhood has transformed from a time when kids develop backbones and learn self-sufficiency into a sort of clinical microcosm of Ibuprofen, antibacterial cream and padded surfaces in which they are fed a diet of exceptionalism and an entitlement to happiness."}

{"original": "My former college roommate ― who came from Dallas, Texas ― used to make fun of the way I interacted with Swedish friends, imitating with precision the way we frantically nod our heads in affirmation, interspersing a pendulum of singing sounds with bursts of ja ja ja (yes). The sole purpose of our conversations is unequivocal agreement, so they typically consist of vague and unfocused remarks so that they can always be given an accommodating turn if we sense an impending disagreement. Otherwise, we refer to a reservoir of frivolous statements to fill any space that risks being taken for a pointed silence."}
{"original": "Imagine how diabolically opposed this quest for acceptance is to what we actually need from each other, and how it makes us even more receptive to the notion that happiness is a currency ― one that prospers independent of meaningful conversations, close relationships or a sense of purpose or engagement. Believing our well-being is defined in the eyes of others, we keep renovating our already renovated kitchens to prove that we have our shit together, and when we still feel like crap, we make sure to wake up with a smile and stop eating carbs after 6 p.m."}

What we should ask for is meaning, and we can find that even in the tedious, sad and harsh episodes of life."}

{"original": "The Utah Republican's Family Security Act, which he proposed Thursday, would slash child poverty and bring the U.S. into the ranks of the vast majority of rich nations that recognize the burden of raising children and give parents money to ensure their kids have better lives."}
{"original": "But so far, Republicans say Romney's idea is a handout to the undeserving poor, and Democrats complain that it would eliminate other parental support programs they favor. No lawmaker has yet offered an unequivocal endorsement of the Romney plan."}
{"original": "Romney, for his part, told HuffPost that getting his proposal enacted into law might be a slog."}
{"original": "It's something that's going to have to be crafted and supported by people on both sides of the aisle, he said. Hopefully, we'll get there."}
{"original": "The Senate on Friday narrowly passed a budget plan to advance President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, which Democrats were able to approve with a simple majority vote. Both houses of Congress must now write the bill, a process that is expected to last several weeks. The goal is to send the measure to the president's desk by March, when added federal unemployment benefits expire for millions of Americans."}
{"original": "Biden's relief package, which Democrats call the American Rescue Plan, would expand the child tax credit much like a recent Democratic proposal known as the American Family Act that would have the Internal Revenue Service distribute the credit to parents as cash on a monthly basis. Several Republicans have recently supported expanding the child tax credit, which Republicans doubled as part of their 2017 tax cut law."}
{"original": "Romney's Family Security Act is similar to the Democrats' American Family Act, though it would put the Social Security Administration in charge of payments instead of the IRS. Both proposals would slash child poverty. The biggest difference is that Romney would offset the cost of benefits by eliminating some tax credits and deductions as well as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the federal government's only cash welfare program for parents who aren't disabled."}
{"original": "Tom Williams via Getty Images On Thursday, Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney proposed the Family Security Act, which would slash child poverty."}
{"original": "Romney says it's advantageous to get rid of a weird patchwork of policies and replace them with simple, direct payments like his proposal does. It's budget neutral and consolidates a number of existing programs into a program where people are able to get checks on a monthly basis and therefore have capacity to care for their families, Romney said."}
{"original": "But Democrats dislike the tradeoff. Many still consider TANF sacred, even though the 1996 welfare reform law, with its paperwork requirements and benefit limits, practically designed it to fail. The program served about 1 million families per month in 2020, which is just a fraction of the eligible population even as the pandemic threw millions more families into poverty."}
{"original": "While I would not support diverting funds from other poverty-fighting programs to offset the cost, I look forward to working with Senator Romney to make a monthly child benefit a reality, said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chair of the Senate Finance Committee."}
{"original": "Romney could plausibly argue that a solid child benefit would make TANF superfluous. But his own party is hostile to the entire idea of giving people money to alleviate poverty. Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Mike Lee (Utah) said they supported increasing the dollar value of the child tax credit, but not making it universally available to people who can't work."}
{"original": "That is not tax relief for working parents; it is welfare assistance, they said in a joint statement."}
{"original": "An essential part of being pro-family is being pro-work, the senators said. Congress should expand the Child Tax Credit without undercutting the responsibility of parents to work to provide for their families."}
{"original": "The child tax credit lowers tax bills for middle-class tax filers and provides a cash refund for low-income families, but only if they have at least $2,500 of earned income. It does nothing for parents who can't work."}
{"original": "Parents face a national shortage of child care, which has only been made worse during the pandemic. That is a major obstacle to work for many parents, and a key reason why poverty is higher for children in the U.S. than for other age groups. Monthly child benefits are a key reason why other advanced countries have lower child poverty rates than the U.S. does."}
{"original": "The conservative American Enterprise Institute panned Romney's idea because it doesn't punish parents for not working. The liberal Center for American Progress commended Romney's proposal for highlighting the need for bipartisan reform, but cautioned against fussing with TANF."}
{"original": "It looks like it will be up to Democrats whether parents get new benefits in the next pandemic relief bill, and there's every indication they will at least increase the value and the refundability of the child tax credit, allowing annual tax refunds even for parents who can't work. Monthly payments might be a problem, however."}
{"original": "The IRS has said there's some challenges making the monthly benefit, Wyden told HuffPost last month. We're going to be looking if there's a way."}
{"original": "Democrats could just adopt Romney's idea to let the Social Security Administration handle payments, since monthly benefits are already the agency's mission. But they have hesitated to do something they couldn't describe as a tax cut."}
{"original": "Romney is directly reaching out to Republican senators and could still get some on board, said Samuel Hammond, director of poverty and welfare policy at the Niskanen Center, a moderate think tank that helped Romney craft his proposal."}

{"original": "Boris Johnson's claims of a Brexit dividend have been ridiculed by economists as the Governor of the Bank of England let slip that voting to quit the EU has already cost the UK £200m a week in lost growth. The Foreign Secretary's infamous claim that Brexit would return £350m a week from Brussels faced yet more humiliation after Mark Carney told a private gathering in Davos that the country had forefeited £10bn in GDP since the 2016 referendum. Asked to measure in Brexit buses the economic impact of the vote, Carney told businessmen in the Swiss resort that the hit to growth was between two-thirds and three-quarters of the sum emblazoned on the Vote Leave battlebus, the Times reported. The Bank has been careful not to publicly quantify the effect of the referendum, but Carney's words echoed those in a new report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), whose chief declared bluntly yesterday the Brexit dividend does not exist. Labour MP Wes Streeting, leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign, said: These comments by the Governor of the Bank of England reveal the truth: there is no Brexit dividend, only a Brexit deficit. The lies of Brexit charlatans like Boris Johnson are being exposed by the day."}

And a new analysis by the IFS found that lower economic growth after Brexit would be likely to mean less money for public services, including the NHS. It states that while £8bn in EU net contributions and spending will be released by quitting the block, a reduction in GDP of just 1% translates to a fall in tax revenue of more than £8bn. And the IFS cites official Office for Budget Responsibility figures implying the hit to public finances of Brexit will be about £15bn per year by the early 2020s, about 10% of the NHS budget, more than outweighing the UK's net contribution to the EU."}

{"original": "Newly released data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture provides more evidence of just how many low-income households continue to struggle to put food on the table."}
{"original": "According to a recent report from the USDA, an increasing share of individuals who receive benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance program, also known as food stamps, live in households where at least one person is working."}
{"original": "Nearly 32 percent of SNAP households are home to at least one wage-earner, according to the most recent data on the program, compared to only 19.6 percent in 1989, as far back as USDA data is availabe."}
{"original": "At the same time, a decreasing share of SNAP recipients are concurrently receiving welfare benefits from other safety net programs like the Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs. As of the most recent data, about 6 percent of SNAP recipients are also receiving support through these programs, compared to about 42 percent of recipients in 1989."}
{"original": "While the trend of SNAP recipients increasingly working is not new, Carrie Calvert, director of tax and commodity policy at Feeding America, a national network of food banks, said the USDA numbers are indicative of the U.S. economy's uneven recovery."}
{"original": "Many of the jobs created have either been part-time or seasonal, or if they're full-time they're not enough to meet the economic needs of that household, Calvert told The Huffington Post. This data highlights a big, untold story about the working poor in America today."}
{"original": "The USDA numbers mirror the organization's own research."}
{"original": "Its 2014 national report, Hunger in America, found that about 54 percent of the households that participated in its food banks and similar programs included at least one person who had worked within the past year. When it came to households with at least one child, that share was even higher — about 70 percent."}
{"original": "Credit: Jim Young/Reuters New research shows the percentage of food stamp recipients from households where at least one person is employed has been steadily increasing."}
{"original": "These findings run counter to the criticism that programs like SNAP discourage their participants from working. A 2016 analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities concluded that changes made to safety net programs over the past two decades have increased work incentives for recipients."}
{"original": "Specific to the SNAP program, Travis Smith, an applied economics professor at the University of Georgia, noted that for every dollar a SNAP recipient's wage increase, their benefit decreases just by roughly 30 cents, so there remains an incentive to work additional hours or find better-paying work."}
{"original": "SNAP encourages working for a wage, Smith wrote via email, and wage income is more fungible than SNAP income."}
{"original": "The USDA's findings are timely in light of fears that the SNAP program could see budget cuts or new state-level restrictions in the near future."}
{"original": "Though SNAP funding was not addressed as a part of the skinny budget released by President Donald Trump on Thursday, the size of the cut to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's discretionary spending — $4.7 billion, or 21 percent of its previous funding level — was significant. Additionally, the budget's proposed elimination of a Department of Housing and Urban Development program that helps fund Meals on Wheels programs isn't a good sign."}
{"original": "At the same time, efforts are underway in some states to restrict the types of purchases recipients can make, a move that advocates believe could increase the stigma associated with using SNAP."}
{"original": "Late last month, a pair of Republican lawmakers in Michigan introduced a bill proposing that the state seek a federal waiver that would allow it to restrict individuals from using SNAP benefits to purchase soda."}
{"original": "Similar pushes have been proposed this year in other states, including Arkansas and Maine, likely in response to the release of a USDA analysis of SNAP households' food purchases that was mischaracterized by the New York Times and other media organizations as proving that SNAP recipients were buying large amounts of soda using their benefits."}
{"original": "Craig Gundersen, an agriculture professor at the University of Illinois, criticized such proposals as insulting to poor people."}
{"original": "All of these things reduce the humanity of poor individuals in the United States and we should be avoiding that, Gundersen told HuffPost. SNAP works and I don't know why people want to mess with the program."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers in Florida are going a step further by working to reduce the number of people who qualify to receive SNAP benefits altogether."}
{"original": "This week, the state's Republican-dominated House Appropriations Committee approved legislation that would reduce the income eligibility threshold for SNAP households from 200 percent of the poverty level — an elevated level set in response to the recession of 2008 — to 130 percent."}
{"original": "The change, if approved, would render nearly 230,000 Floridians ineligible for SNAP benefits starting in 2018."}
{"original": "Actions like these on a broader scale, Calvert added, could create a level of food insecurity that organizations like food banks would be ill-equipped to address. She hopes that SNAP funding will be protected."}
{"original": "The SNAP program provides a safety net for so many people in need, Calvert said. We know that food banks and the charitable food assistance network cannot pick up that slack."}

{"original": "Women are marching and they are upset. For lawmakers who wants to get right with this large group of voters, here are seven concrete things they could do."}
{"original": "1. Pass a real national paid leave law."}
{"original": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton did not agree on much during the presidential campaign, but they did agree that it is time for national paid leave. The United States is one of only a handful of countries that provides no paid leave. This is bad for families and bad for business. The job of caregiving, whether it be for aging parents or children, still disproportionately falls on women. If you are a federal lawmaker, you need to make sure that the Trump Administration passes family leave that is sufficiently broad to protect American families. The plans outlined by Trump during his campaign initially only applied to women, and Republicans--to the extent they have supported family leave at all--have favored tax incentives. These are only pieces to an incomplete puzzle. Paid leave needs to apply to men as well as women. While tax incentives can be one tool, it is insufficient as a standalone solution because it leaves out low-income workers who may pay little tax. The need for paid leave is the greatest among this population."}
{"original": "2. Support equal pay for equal work."}
{"original": "Even when working in the same industry as men, women continue to experience an unjustifiable pay gap. For instance, female doctors as a rule make less than male doctors. Yet a recent study found that older patients lived longer when treated by a female rather than a male doctor. It makes no sense for these women to be paid less for providing equal or perhaps even better outcomes. A solution to this, make large employers report wages by sex to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This data would be easy to collect. Sunshine can be a powerful disinfectant for this kind of problem. Making this kind of data public would aid women who have to resort to a lawsuit under the Equal Pay Act. Pointing to a systemic pay gap makes it easier for an employee to show that the pay gap between herself and a man doing the same work is due to sex discrimination, rather than--as many companies like to argue--some other factor, unrelated to sex."}
{"original": "3. Support minimum wage increases and fair rules for overtime pay."}
{"original": "The federal minimum wage is insufficient to support a working family. An increase in the minimum wage would help families, particularly those headed by single parents, who are primarily women. Overtime rules have not been updated since 1973. This all adds up to more people--including more women--working longer hours for less. This exacerbates the problem in a country without a comprehensive paid leave law or affordable child care system. Paying employees a real wage would go a long way to help solve that. Under President Obama, the Department of Labor updated overtime laws so that many more Americans would be covered. American businesses are prepared to comply with this law; the training programs are already in place. All lawmakers have to do is keep these overtime rules in place and pass a living wage, something supported by the majority of Americans."}
{"original": "4. Pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act."}
{"original": "More women are staying in the workforce and those that get pregnant are staying longer into their pregnancies. Some pregnant workers need very basic changes to their workplace to allow them to keep working, changes like carrying around a bottle of water or getting help lifting heavy packages. Sadly, some workplaces refuse these changes. The Supreme Court's decision in Young v UPS clarified that in some circumstances employers must provide these changes. But this decision does not cover all women as it only applies to mostly large employers who offer light-duty accommodations to other workers. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would fix that. The law would allow pregnant women to stay in the workplace where they can get the salary and benefits that they need and deserve. All lawmakers have to do is pass it."}
{"original": "5. Appoint judges who will allow for more jury trials."}
{"original": "There are civil rights laws that make it unlawful to discriminate against women or pay them less simply because of their gender. But they don't work if judges kick cases out of court before they can ever get to a jury. A rule of civil procedure in most courts--called summary judgment--allows judges to dismiss weak cases. This is an appropriate and useful tool when used correctly. But judges have abused this tool as a means to clear busy court dockets or, even worse, because of an ideological bias against individuals who sue companies. The solution, use summary judgment to clear out obviously weak cases, but let others, even close calls, go to a jury. That is the way the law is supposed to work. And juries are the most direct form of democracy--a small group of individuals deciding issues of importance. Lawmakers should appoint judges that share this viewpoint that be shared by liberal and conservative judges."}
{"original": "Unions provide bargaining power to workers, particularly those, like service employees, who individually lack the leverage to negotiate working conditions with large companies. Unionized workers are more likely to get a fair wage and have real benefits, issues important to women and men. Lawmakers should support, not fight, unions."}
{"original": "7. Support protections for the 'gig economy' workers."}
{"original": "Increasingly workers are working as their own bosses by either working an independent contractor or in industries that allow work on demand--the car service Uber being a prime example. These positions are particularly important for women (and men) who need a flexible schedule due to caregiver responsibilities. Drop the kids off at school, drive for Uber or work as a carpenter taking assignments through TaskRabbit, then be home to meet the kids at the bus. While these jobs offer tremendous opportunities for workers, they leave many out in the cold when it comes to anti-discrimination laws, ability to secure benefits, and other protections that usually come with full-time work. This needs to change. There have been some steps taken to address these issues. For instance, the EEOC recently took the position that federal anti-discrimination applies to those some jobs in the gig economy. Efforts have been underway in California and New York to allow gig workers to unionize. Lawmakers need to support creative solutions to provide workers with real protections in this rapidly growing segment of the economy."}
{"original": "Women are playing a larger role in a rapidly changing workforce, yet they are continually hampered by the issues discussed above. This clearly hurts individuals in the workplace--both men and women--but it also hurts businesses which are unable to reap the full benefits of a stable and committed workforce. Individual business cannot alone solve these national issues. By providing legislative solutions, lawmakers can strengthen our families and our workforce."}

{"original": "MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images President Donald Trump greeted fellow Republican Josh Hawley in Springfield, Missouri, during Hawley's successful Senate campaign in that state. Hawley became a major player in Trump's bid -- based on lies -- to overturn Joe Biden's win in November's presidential election. Even after Trump incited a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday, Hawley pressed the fraudulent effort to decertify election results."}
{"original": "In the aftermath of Wednesday's violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, top voices on the American right have issued a call for lawmakers to move on without resorting to an impeachment proceeding against President Donald Trump. National Republican Campaign Committee Chairman Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) has said the impeachment bid would divide us as a country, a call Fox News host Brian Kilmeade and other conservative personalities quickly echoed."}
{"original": "That Trump bears responsibility for that assault on the Capitol is not in question. The president constantly broadcasted lies about the results of November's presidential election from his bully pulpit and across social media, fomenting fury. On Wednesday he repeated those lies to a mob of thousands, telling them to show strength, fight like hell, and strike fear into the hearts of lawmakers who refused to overturn Joe Biden's win in the election. He then dispatched them to the Capitol."}
{"original": "When a great crime is committed, society can only move on when those responsible have been held accountable. This is a basic tenet not only of criminal law, but of truth and reconciliation commissions and other projects aimed at national healing. What exactly constitutes accountability and responsibility are, of course, dependent on the nature of the crime and the roles different figures played in its execution. But the principle is based on the idea that to be forgiven, one must first acknowledge responsibility and, in many cases, endure punishment. Without accountability, social wounds will not heal, but fester."}
{"original": "Republican leaders are not, in fact, asking the country to move on from the insurrection in any meaningful way. They are asking everyone to politely pretend that nothing happened, so that the conservative movement and elected GOP officials can avoid unpleasant consequences for their actions and rhetoric. Kilmeade's point that people are ready to explode is, in this light, better understood as a threat than a plea for calm."}
{"original": "The political nature of the Capitol attack demands that accountability take political form."}
{"original": "Let us be clear: Trump did not act alone. At the pre-riot rally on the National Mall, his lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, urged the mob to pursue trial by combat to overturn the election results. Trump supporters who invaded the Capitol chanted Hang Mike Pence! for the vice president's refusing to throw out the electoral votes that made Biden president-elect. One rioter was photographed wearing a Camp Auschwitz T-shirt; others brought zip-tie handcuffs for detaining hostages. Still others brought a gallows to the Capitol, scrawled Murder the Media on its walls and beat a Capitol police officer to death with a fire extinguisher."}
{"original": "But the violence itself is only one dimension of Wednesday's horror. What shocked the world was its political intent. This violence was committed as part of a concerted effort to overturn an election's outcome at the direction of the losing candidate."}
{"original": "The political nature of the Capitol attack demands that accountability take political form. While the judiciary should handle criminal charges against individual insurrectionists, those who empowered and encouraged an assault on the legislative branch of the U.S. government should face consequences in the legislative branch. For Trump, there is no alternative to impeachment by the House and a conviction by the Senate."}
{"original": "The list of elected Republicans who voted with the mob is frighteningly long: eight senators and 139 House members voted against certifying the election results."}
{"original": "The president is not the only bad actor here who must face punitive measures. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) led the attempt in their chamber to overturn the election results, championing Trump's conspiracy theories. Hawley gave a now-infamous fist-pump to the assembled mob shortly before they began rioting. Reps. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) and Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) both spoke at the Trump rally ahead of the attack and spread the lie that the election had been stolen from the president through mass fraud. All four men have decried the violence that ensued, but none have apologized for their role or even acknowledged any responsibility for the insurrection. If any of them respected their offices, they would resign. Since they will not, the House and Senate should expel them and let their constituents select replacements."}
{"original": "Those are the easy cases. But from there accountability gets tricky. The list of elected Republicans who voted with the mob is frighteningly long: eight senators and 139 House members voted against certifying the election results. These votes were cast after the insurrection, when it was abundantly clear to the entire country exactly what kind of reaction those votes would encourage. On Monday night, Capitol Police briefed Democrats on three more conspiracies to overthrow the government ahead of Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, potentially involving tens of thousands of armed terrorists, including one plot aimed explicitly at murdering Democrats to give Republicans control of the government."}
{"original": "The inescapable conclusion is that the lunatic fringe of the Republican Party is no longer a fringe."}
{"original": "The further down-ballot you go, the uglier the picture of the Republican Party gets. In Michigan alone, the GOP state party chair, statehouse legislators and local election officials went to extraordinary lengths to discredit Biden's victory in the state and twist the legal system into overturning his win. The Rule of Law Defense Fund, a dark money organization Republican state attorneys general created in 2014, made robocalls encouraging people to attend the Wednesday rally and stop the steal. A Republican member of the West Virginia House of Delegates was even among those who stormed the Capitol (he has since resigned his seat)."}
{"original": "The inescapable conclusion is that the lunatic fringe of the Republican Party is no longer a fringe. It's the party. For decades, members of the GOP elite have believed that leaders committed to tax cuts and deregulation could maintain control over their coalition by indulging its crank elements on what they saw as minor points and deceiving them on others. Trump's election made clear, however, that the popular constituency for free trade and free markets in today's America is vanishingly small. And so the party's elite has become increasingly beholden to violent extremists, culminating ― so far ― in Wednesday's outrage."}
{"original": "Not all of these extremists, of course, think of themselves as murderous neo-Nazis. Early news reports were filled with stories and images of people who infiltrated the Capitol gawking at its opulence like tourists, or patiently explaining various conspiracy theories to reporters rather than assaulting them (though other members of the mob did attack journalists)."}
{"original": "But the attack on the Capitol made clear that once-disparate elements of the conservative coalition have fused into a common culture with a violent hostility to the American government at its core. The Proud Boys knelt in prayer before storming the barricades as Confederate flags intermingled with a Jesus 2020 banner. Militant fascists, devout white evangelicals, disaffected working people and ultrarich small business owners recited QAnon lies to each other."}
{"original": "Each of these different factions initially rallied to Trump for different reasons, citing different grievances, some real and some imagined, some motivated by hate and some by frustration. Trump has cemented them as a political unit and persuaded them that American democracy itself is their enemy."}
{"original": "Trump may well be right, in a sense. Wednesday's naked violence will make it still more difficult for his coalition to reach anything like a national majority. Trump lost the popular vote by more than 3 million in 2016. In 2020 he lost by 7 million. It is not hard to imagine a near-future in which the Trump coalition won't need to believe a demagogue's lies to be motivated into action against democracy, but will instead reason their way to it out of political self-interest."}
{"original": "In this they would be imitating Republican leaders, who got in bed with Trump back in 2016 knowing he was their best bet for achieving long-standing conservative economic and foreign policy goals."}
{"original": "They got what they wanted, and American democracy is paying the price. If the political system cannot or will not hold the instigators of Wednesday's horrors accountable, more leaders will make that calculation in the future, with a more violent movement behind them."}
{"original": "Journalist Frank Rich, an executive producer for HBO shows Veep and Succession, on Thursday warned Donald Trump's Republican collaborators of the price their families will one day pay for unwavering devotion to the president."}
{"original": "There's going to be a reckoning, Rich said on MSNBC's The Last Word With Lawrence O'Donnell. They will be implicated, so will their children and their grandchildren, he added. There's going to be a stain."}
{"original": "Rich said that, when it comes to Trump, it is a cult because people who in some cases did have reputations that they have now destroyed, good reputations, have made fools of themselves for their dear leader."}
{"original": "The cult leader is never going to be reformed or see the problems of their ways, he added. But the people who swirl around them and were taken in, they're going to pay a price, a human price and a reputational price forever."}
{"original": "Rich, in an article for New York magazine (where he is a writer-at-large), published on Tuesday, wrote that once Trump has vacated the Oval Office, and possibly for decades thereafter, his government, like any other deposed strongman's, will be subjected to a forensic colonoscopy to root out buried crimes, whether against humanity or the rule of law or both."}
{"original": "With time, everything will come out — it always does, he added, claiming Trump's collaborators, our Vichy Republicans, will own all of it whether they were active participants in the wrongdoing, the so-called adults in the room who stood idly by or those elite allies beyond the White House gates who pretended not to notice administration criminality and moral atrocities in exchange for favors like tax cuts and judicial appointments."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― The Trump White House is done negotiating over repealing and replacing Obamacare, senior officials said Thursday night, and Republicans are moving ahead with a vote on their bill Friday, even though they seem to lack enough support for passage and recalcitrant conservatives and moderates continued talking."}
{"original": "Tension boiled over in a meeting between top administration officials ― including top strategist Steve Bannon and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus ― and Republican lawmakers hours after House leadership delayed a scheduled vote on their health care legislation Thursday. President Donald Trump, according to Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, is done negotiating, and House Republicans are scheduled to vote Friday. If the vote fails, Mulvaney said, the president was prepared to leave Obamacare in place."}
{"original": "In calling the bluff of on-the-fence lawmakers, Trump runs a massive risk of violating a primary campaign pledge to repeal Obamacare and suffering a major legislative defeat in his first effort to pass major legislation. While many Republicans have been arguing that failure to repeal Obamacare would sink the president's entire agenda ― and likely hand Congress to the Democrats in 2018 ― Mulvaney signaled that the administration didn't intend to give up on other plans, and would move onto an ambitious tax reform effort if the repeal bid failed."}
{"original": "Chances are fairly high that Trump will have his bluff called, as the conservative bloc of House members continued to insist the bill fell short of the promised full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, left the meeting with Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and administration officials saying that negotiations continue precisely because his group was not yet on board with the final product."}
{"original": "And then Mulvaney said the time for deals was over."}
{"original": "That looked to be a clear signal of failure, but there are, at least, some indications that Freedom Caucus conservatives could be split."}
{"original": "Meadows reported Thursday night that, while he was still leaning no, there are a number of conservative wins in the new legislation, including the elimination of essential health benefits that require insurers to cover basic health care services. There also were certain assurances that the president and his staff made that could persuade conservatives, he added, though he wouldn't elaborate."}
{"original": "When Meadows was asked about Trump's book, The Art of the Deal, and how walking away from a negotiation was textbook Trump, Meadows said that in order to get the best deal, you always have to be ready to walk away from any negotiation."}
{"original": "Yeah, I read his book too, Meadows said, acknowledging that the bill has improved."}
{"original": "What conservatives view as improvements, however, are clear losses for moderates. A large bloc of rank-and-file Republicans could flee from the bill, especially if it's clear by Friday afternoon that Republicans, as is likely, don't have the votes for passage."}

It contained clear conservative wins, including the elimination of essential benefits such as maternity care and mental illness treatment. It also was meant to appease those centrist Republicans concerned too many people will be tossed from the health insurance rolls, by keeping a 0.9 percent Medicare surcharge tax from the Affordable Care Act on high-income earners for six years. That would add about $15 billion to a fund to help states defray costs."}

{"original": "Trump eventually signed the bill, but not before giving Democrats, many of whom had wanted larger checks all along, a cherished political cudgel."}
{"original": "House Democrats responded by promptly passing a bill amending the December payments to $2,000 and daring Senate Republicans to block it. When Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) declined to allow a vote on the bill in the Senate, Democrats successfully used the checks as a wedge issue in the Georgia Senate runoff races on Jan. 5. Biden himself promised that if Georgians voted out then-Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, handing Democrats control of the upper chamber, it would enable delivery of payments that add up to $2,000."}
{"original": "But there are still obstacles to the passage of Biden's $1,400 supplement in the Senate, which Democrats narrowly took over earlier this month."}
{"original": "Depending on how the legislation is structured, it may face a filibuster, which would require at least 60 votes ― and the support of at least 10 Republican senators ― to overcome. Even if a simple majority is all that is required for passage, the Senate's 50-50 split means that Biden needs the support of every Democrat. And that's far from certain: Sen.

{"original": "Feel like you are working 'round the clock for nothing? You may be right. And the culprit? The hundreds of taxes you pay every year for the privilege of working."}
{"original": "It is no secret that Americans work more than almost any other nationality. Ask someone how work is going and they're likely to reply that they're tired and burnt out. Yet, many still aren't taking their paid time off. Ever wonder why?"}
{"original": "At least one motivation is to make more money. The concept is simple enough. Work more, earn more, buy more."}
{"original": "But in spite all of this work, most Americans spend one third of their week simply trying to make enough to pay their taxes. That means for every hour you work, you work 20 minutes just to pay the IRS. Just like the former governor of New Mexico, Gary Johnson pointed out, it can feel like your money is getting wasted in the process:"}
{"original": "People don't realize that the federal Department of Education gives each state 11 cents out of every school dollar that every state spends. But it comes with 15 cents worth of strings attached. Federal government says you need to do A, B, C and D and here's 11 cents. Well, to do A, B, C and D it costs you 15 cents."}
{"original": "Couple the large cut the government gets on every dollar earned with the sheer volume of taxes we pay, and it becomes obvious why so many people feel overwhelmed by tax policies."}
{"original": "Feel Like You Are Always Paying Your Taxes? You Are!"}
{"original": "The variety and nuance of the taxes we pay is mind-boggling. The most obvious culprit is the federal, state, and city income tax you pay on every dollar you earn. Then, there is the sales tax you pay on every product or service you buy. And, the legions of other taxes, tariffs, and duties on just about every financial transaction you take part in. If you feel overwhelmed by that complexity, you are not alone."}
{"original": "In general, taxes fall into three main categories: income, property, and goods and services."}
{"original": "Income Tax : A few of the taxes that are included under this category are payroll taxes like FICA, capital gains taxes both long- and short- term, and taxes on dividends and interest. They're also the taxes that you pay out of every paycheck. Generally, they are levied on both the payor and the payee."}

They're also the taxes that you pay out of every paycheck. Generally, they are levied on both the payor and the payee. Property Tax : The second type of tax is the one most Americans are well familiar with: taxes on real estate and personal property. Again, these are not uniform across the country but you are probably familiar with paying an annual tax on your car or your home."}
{"original": ": The second type of tax is the one most Americans are well familiar with: taxes on real estate and personal property. Again, these are not uniform across the country but you are probably familiar with paying an annual tax on your car or your home. Sales Tax : The third type is of more immediate effect on pocketbooks: sales taxes, again not uniform nationally. Sales taxes are also arguably the most burdensome and regressive because they represent such a disproportionate amount of disposable funds to low-income people. Necessities such as food and gas are often taxed; and then, products like cigarettes, alcohol, even sugary drinks are further taxes thanks to their status as sin products. Many argue that these are a form of social engineering by the government to deter specific types of behavior."}
{"original": "Our tax code is so complex--and its credits, deductions and exemptions so convoluted--that the vast majority of us are stumped when it comes to threading our way through them. With enough resources, you can hire a team of experts to parse it out. But what about people without the means to pay somebody?"}
{"original": "The same logic applies to other taxes. For example, corporations can hire expert lawyers and accountants to section out their holdings and leverage their business transactions for tax credit, so that in the end, they pay very little. In other words, while the rest of us are paying 30+% of our income back in taxes, some corporations (like Facebook, for instance) end up paying about 10% of theirs."}
{"original": "Pat Bagley/Salt Lake Tribune, Cagle Cartoons (source)"}
{"original": "And, it's no accident that clever attorneys and accountants are expensive: they more than pay for themselves for those who can afford them. It takes a whole lot of book learning to be able to worm your way through a 74,600+ page document."}
{"original": "So where does that leave our small business owners? It's hard enough to develop a product, bring it to market, produce it consistently and continue to innovate. Add to that a complicated tax code and it is easy to see why so many people shy away from entrepreneurship in the first place."}
{"original": "After eight years as a special education teacher at Riker's Island and in the South Bronx, I know firsthand that the fear of filing forms was the number one obstacle in getting my kids to start selling legal products. It was hard to ignore the appeal of ever-present cash businesses with no paperwork--in other words, the drug industry."}
{"original": "Of course taxes are painful to every earner--business owner or worker. While the IRS continually cutting its budget for doing things like collecting back taxes or discovering tax fraud, our country finds itself unable to collect even those revenues that are owed. Is the answer in a flat tax? Many would argue yes. Is one likely? Perhaps not considering the interests that are entrenched in seeing the current system perpetuated."}
{"original": "But what is more disturbing is that the government has been unable to balance its budget in decades, resulting in today's national debt of $20 trillion (plus the other $74 trillion in off-balance sheet debt). If the government cannot collect enough via taxes to cover its expenses, then it has two choices: create more paper money or borrow money to pay is bills. Either way, it's our future generations who are on the hook for that unfunded spending."}
{"original": "Most Americans got a tax cut thanks to the new Republican tax law, but it's possible that millions of households will get a surprise bill from the IRS in the coming weeks."}
{"original": "Ben Williams, a lawyer in New York City, said he earned the same amount of money last year as he had the year before, but wound up with a totally different tax situation."}
{"original": "Last year I got a $750 refund, Williams said. And this year I owe $4,600."}
{"original": "There are two reasons for Williams' predicament. The 35-year-old lost his refund both because Republicans targeted wealthy (and heavily Democratic) metropolitan areas for tax hikes and also because of how President Donald Trump's administration implemented the law."}
{"original": "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cut rates for taxpayers at every income level and simplified the tax code for most filers. Part of that simplification meant getting rid of a lot of deductions, which people use to reduce the amount of their taxable earnings."}
{"original": "One of the most controversial changes limited the amount of state and local tax payments that could be deducted. Previously, a tax filer could reduce their federal taxable income by subtracting the income taxes they paid to their state and local governments. The law capped such deductions at $10,000. Williams said he usually pays more than three times that amount in state and local levies."}
{"original": "While preparing to file his taxes through the H&R Block website this week, Williams said the blood drained from his face when he realized how much he would owe. He had anticipated getting another refund that he would put toward a vacation."}
{"original": "I guess that my assumption was that the IRS withholding tables would have been updated to some degree or my company would have done something, he said."}
{"original": "There is probably no way Williams could have avoided paying higher taxes, given his circumstances. But if the government had administered the tax law more carefully, he could have been spared the February surprise. Employers are supposed to withhold federal income tax from their workers' paychecks, and the vast majority of taxpayers typically withhold more than necessary, resulting in a refund in the early part of the year. The average refund is worth nearly $3,000."}
{"original": "But Republicans rushed their tax cuts through Congress at the end of 2017, making huge changes to the tax code without so much as a hearing, and gave the IRS hardly any time to implement the law, which took effect less than two weeks after Trump signed it."}
{"original": "The IRS had to scramble to figure how it should change the way tax would be withheld from paychecks for 2018. Officials with the Treasury Department told the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, that they felt they had to work with the same basic W-4 forms that employers were already using to determine withholding amounts. A trade group for payroll providers told the GAO that substantially different forms would necessitate changes to withholding software that would have taken at least half a year."}
{"original": "The IRS knew from its simulations ― which assumed that people would not adjust their withholding amounts ― that just plugging new numbers into its old withholding tables would probably reduce the number of tax filers getting a refund from 76 percent to 73 percent, according to the July GAO report. The number that owed money would increase by a proportional amount."}
{"original": "That means millions more households getting a bill from the IRS. In Treasury's simulations, households that itemized deductions, such as New Yorkers with higher local taxes, were likelier to withhold less tax as a percentage of their total liability."}
{"original": "That is the group that ends up paying more tax under the new law, said Nathan Rigney, lead tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block. It's the people in New York who are losing such a large amount of the [state and local tax] deduction they can end up owing more tax because their taxable income goes up by so much."}
{"original": "Tax filing season opened at the end of January, and the government shutdown may have hampered the IRS' ability to process returns as quickly as in previous years. Around this time in 2018, the IRS said it had processed 30 million returns and dished out 13 million refunds. (The total for the year was 150 million returns and 111 million refunds.) Similar data is not yet available for this year."}
{"original": "The new law cut taxes for 80 percent of households, with the biggest benefit accruing to the wealthier ones, according to the Tax Policy Center, while roughly 5 percent saw a tax increase. The changes should have been evident in paychecks last year, though incorrect withholding may have obscured the policy until now."}
{"original": "Republicans knew in advance that the households negatively affected by their tax changes just so happen to be clustered in states where people tend to vote for Democrats. And according to the GAO, the Trump administration may have been more worried about people withholding too much instead of too little, even though the latter can stick people with surprise tax bills and penalties, and reduces overall compliance. Withholding too little, on the other hand, makes people's paychecks bigger immediately ― and the Trump administration wanted to make sure to help the people it intended to help."}
{"original": "Treasury officials stated that withholding more from paychecks than in past years for taxpayers whose tax liability is expected to decrease would be inconsistent with the intent of the law as they understood it, the GAO said."}

{"original": "Cohen denied that he gave Gauger cash and said payment was by check."}
{"original": "Cohen requested $50,000 for tech services during the campaign, according to an August 2018 document from prosecutors charging Cohen with eight felonies, including campaign finance violations for arranging hush-money payments to women who alleged affairs with Trump. While prosecutors didn't identify the company, people familiar with the matter say it was RedFinch, the Journal reported."}
{"original": "Cohen also asked Gauger to create the @WomenForCohen Twitter account, which was started in May 2016 and is run by a female friend of Gauger's.

{"original": "And at least Mike Pence spokesman Marc Lotter offered this moment of survivor humor, intentional or not, saying of the June 2016 Donald Trump Jr.-Jared Kushner-Paul Manafort meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, The Vice President was not aware of the meeting. He is not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket."}

The staff also heard various for-profit college operators get up at the hearing and claim, among other things, that the rules aren't needed because all the crooked for-profit colleges have shut down, leaving in place only honest mom and pop shops like the University of Phoenix, EDMC, Career Education Corp., and Bridgepoint Education, the former employer of DeVos's senior counsel Robert Eitel.

Bullied children everywhere must feel so much better now. #ThanksMelania"}

Kislyak A December 2016 meeting with Sergey Gorkov, a former Russian intelligence agent who is now the Putin-appointed head of the Russian state-owned bank Vnesheconombank The June 2016 Hillary dirt / orphans meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya"}
{"original": "Material omissions on security clearance forms are crimes if made knowingly. That it's hard to spell Vnesheconombank and Veselnitskaya is not a legal excuse."}
{"original": "Additional facts raise further concerns about these omissions. There's a troubling discrepancy between what Vnesheconombank said their Kushner meeting was about and the White House's explanation for the meeting. The bank told the Washington Post that the meeting was to pursue its investment strategy by talking with with the head of Kushner Companies, while a White House spokesperson said that, instead, Mr. Kushner was acting in his capacity as a transition official and had many similar discussions with foreign representatives after the election."}
{"original": "Also, the Times has reported that Kushner did not amend his clearance form to include the Veselnitskaya meeting until recently, and Times reporter Maggie Haberman said Tuesday on CNN that Kushner amended his form a second time to add that Trump Tower meeting around the time that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort disclosed the meeting to congressional investigators."}
{"original": "Whenever and why ever it turns out that Jared amended his form to disclose clearly relevant information, it looks like crackerjack work by Kushner's esteemed Washington super lawyer, mercenary Democrat Jamie Gorelick."}
{"original": "It also seems apparent that Kushner was not an innocent attendee at the Veselnitskaya meeting. In inviting them to the meeting, Don Jr. forwarded the entire email chain to Kushner and Manafort, and that chain included the initial message from music manager Rob Goldstone, telling Don Jr. that the lawyer would provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump. Also, the email that Jared and Manafort received bore the subject line: FW - Russia - Clinton - private and confidential. #JaredKnew"}
{"original": "3. Ivanka Trump, Assistant to the President. Last week's ranking: ―"}
{"original": "One thing that shouldn't get lost, amid all the Trump family lies and potential criminal liability around Russiagate, is the audaciously disgraceful action of Ivanka Trump sitting in Dad's seat at a closed-door session of the G20 summit meeting in Hamburg."}
{"original": "We know that Ivanka sat for a period next to China's president Xi Jinping, U.K. prime minister Theresa May, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and German chancellor Angela Merkel, only because Svetlana Lukash, a member of the Russian delegation tweeted (and later deleted) a photo of the spectacle. (Do we think maybe the Russians are messing with us?)"}
{"original": "A senior administration official proudly anonymously defended the move to CNN: Ivanka was sitting in the back and then briefly joined the main table when the President had to step out and the President of the World Bank started talking as the topic involved areas such as African development... When other leaders stepped out, their seats were also briefly filled by others."}
{"original": "Of course we are shocked that President Trump chose to leave the room ― which he tweeted was for short meetings with Japan and other countries ― during the African development portion of the meeting, given that we know how deeply engaged Trump is in African development issues. (The Trump organization apparently does not invest in Africa. Yet!)"}
{"original": "And we don't know if Trump directed Ivanka to assume his throne, a move he later tweeted was Very standard. But we don't care. She shouldn't have done it."}
{"original": "Yes, Trump officially hired Ivanka as a White House Assistant to the President, though many argued that move violated the federal law against nepotism in government hiring and posed genuine dangers. But Ivanka's decision to sit in Trump's seat was somewhere between wealthy-entitled and just plain crass. I mean she probably took dad's chair during presentations on Trump Organization construction delays in Azerbaijan , and maybe she could try to spin it as women's empowerment."}
{"original": "But on-site at the G20 were numerous Trump appointees and career officials eminently more capable and qualified to assume the U.S. chair while the president was absent."}
{"original": "This is not a monarchy. It remains a constitutional democracy. Princess Ivanka's ascension to King Donald's G20 chair illustrated how the kleptocratic Trumps are turning our country into a possession, a piece of real estate they think they own."}
{"original": "2. Donald Trump Jr., son of the President and Executive Vice President of Development and Acquisitions, The Trump Organization. Last week's ranking: ―"}
{"original": "OMG let's review. Donald Trump Jr., who has consistently yelled that the Trump campaign had no dealings with Russians, concealed from the public for a year that he, Kushner, and Manafort met last June with a Russian lawyer. Then, when caught by the Times, he gave a misleading explanation of the subject of the meeting, then admitted the meeting was instead for the purpose of getting from the Russian lawyer dirt on Hillary Clinton, and then, when he knew the Times was planning to publish them, posted emails showing that the meeting was pitched to him as a session to get dirt on Hillary from the Russian government as part of its support for Mr. Trump. Thus Trump Jr., by his own eventual admission, attended a meeting for the purpose of conspiring with Russia to influence the U.S. election."}
{"original": "Trump Jr's defense of himself Tuesday on Fox's Hannity show added to his disgracefulness: For me this was opposition research. They had something, you know, maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I'd been hearing about … so I think I wanted to hear it out.... Someone sent me an email. I can't help what someone sends me. I read it, I responded accordingly."}
{"original": "You responded accordingly? By responding I love it, taking the meeting, and bringing along the Trump campaign chairman? The way to respond accordingly would have been to call the FBI, just as the 2000 Al Gore campaign did when someone sent Bush campaign internal materials. This was not opposition research; it was an effort by a hostile foreign nation, a U.S. adversary, to secretly influence the contest for America's highest office. The fact that it might help Dad win didn't make it right. It might well have been a crime, even perhaps conspiracy to commit espionage."}
{"original": "There's some relief in knowing that crooks and liars have been outed as crooks and liars, so we like Donald Trump Jr. a little bit this week for being such an idiot. Nevertheless, we can't escape the conclusion that Donald Trump Jr. is a disgrace. Don Sr. is always talking about picking people who seem to come from central casting, and with Don Jr. he made his own: the perfect nasty, low-intellect, evil douchebag son of the president."}
{"original": "1. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States. Last week's ranking: duh"}
{"original": "Minutes after tweeting a heartfelt defense of Don Jr. as he watched Fox & Friends First at 5:12 am Wednesday, Trump followed up by telling his Twitter subjects (those he hasn't blocked), Remember, when you hear the words 'sources say' from the Fake Media, often times those sources are made up and do not exist. Trump knows his fervent followers will swallow every word, even though the New York Times piece about the Don Jr. meeting was entirely confirmed by Don Jr.'s own emails, as released by Don Jr."}
{"original": "Trump may get jealous that Don Jr. is getting so much attention for at least attempted collusion with the Russians and violation of campaign finance laws. Whether Don Sr. can be goaded into admitting that he wasn't so far out of the loop and actually knew about the meeting attended in his building by his son, son-in-law, and campaign chairman remains to be seen. What is still clear is that Don Sr. obstructed justice this year by pressing James Comey to let angry General Mike Flynn off the hook and then firing Comey when he didn't stop the Flynn probe and larger Russia investigation."}
{"original": "It's also the case that, as the public now considers Russian lawyer Veselnitskaya's 2016 plea to Don Jr. and the boys to lift the 2012 Magnitsky Act sanctions ― U.S. penalties against Russian officials that Veselnitskaya had lobbied against and that greatly pained Putin ― Trump's White House is actively working this week to water down legislation that would tighten sanctions on Russia."}
{"original": "Trump also enhanced the Russia narrative this week by being exactly the U.S. president that Vladimir Putin hoped he would be: a fool."}
{"original": "At their face-to-face G20 meeting, Putin played Trump like a fiddle. Whatever Trump said in response to Putin's denial, in the face of the unanimous findings of U.S. intelligence agencies, that Russia interfered in the U.S. election, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who was present in the meeting, told reporters that Trump accepted Putin's denial."}
{"original": "Trump's own readout of the meeting was equally fascinating: that Sunday morning tweet reporting, Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded. After that announcement ― that the U.S. would protect itself by forming a shield with the crafty adversary that hacked it ― was met with concern and derision by commentators all day, Trump that night issued a hilarious denial of his own statement: The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't... Maybe Putin sold Trump on the idea of the shield by noting that one of the negative things happening was the cyber-theft from Trump hotels of guest credit card and personal information for seven recent months. Maybe Putin might even have some insights into whodunnit."}
{"original": "Apart from the Putin meeting debacle, and Trump's grotesque attempt to defend the placement of Ivanka in his G20 chair by lashing out at Chelsea Clinton, Trump fundamentally failed to protect America's interests at the meeting. He positioned the U.S. as a reckless rogue nation, refusing to accept the need to address climate change, as the other nineteen participants committed to press ahead with the Paris agreement. He also failed to get from Russia, China, and others present a commitment to action, or even a statement, on the urgent threat from North Korea."}
{"original": "Content to deny or cheer obvious wrongdoing in his administration, attack the media, engage in celebrity feuds, and degrade our country on the global stage, Trump has little time to consider the actual details and impacts of the policy agenda his administration is pursuing, which largely consists of allowing former corporate lobbyists, ex-Goldman Sachs executives, and Koch brothers-tied ideologues to dispense with important consumer, financial, health, safety, and environmental regulations all across the government, while pursuing tax cuts for the rich on Capitol Hill. While he promised to drain the swamp and stand up for the forgotten man and woman, the Trump administration's actual agenda is exactly the opposite: a handover of policy to America's oligarchs, just as he uses the presidency to enrich his own business empire."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― On April 15, 2009, a wave of populist protests swept across the country, pegged to tax day. John Boehner, who was then-House minority leader, was curious how they'd play out, and joined one in Bakersfield, California with Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)."}
{"original": "What he saw there stunned him, and he immediately knew that if Republicans could harness that energy, he'd become speaker of the House. As he told his staff in his typically salty manner, They are fucking furious and we're going to win."}
{"original": "Boehner was right on both points, and he vowed that day to make sure he channeled the rage he was witnessing into campaigns against Democrats the next fall. To ally with his base, he and then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) resolved to engage in all-out obstruction. It worked, until it worked too well, and consumed Boehner himself, as well as his deputy, former Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.)."}
{"original": "Elected Democrats are now facing the same challenge, as a fired-up progressive base is marching far ahead of the party leadership. Democrats are scrambling to keep up."}
{"original": "This week, when progressive champions Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) voted in a Senate committee to approve the thoroughly unqualified Ben Carson to head the Housing and Urban Development Department, there was little criticism from established liberal organizations in Washington. But the grassroots lit up ― blasting them on Twitter, Facebook, in calls to their offices, and in countless emails to Huffington Post reporters, asking us what on earth their one-time heroes were doing."}
{"original": "Warren clearly felt the backlash. OK, let's talk about Dr. Ben Carson, she began a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday."}
{"original": "That the votes came just days after millions poured into the streets in more than 650 women's marches on Saturday made it that much more jarring. Those marches, after all, had not been sparked by Planned Parenthood, or the Democratic Party, or unions, or MoveOn.org, even if they did pitch in to help once it got going. Instead, they came from regular, angry people ― people who may try to replace the ones in power."}
{"original": "It's going to motivate a lot of people to activism and to run for office, said Fran DeBenedictis, a 63-year-old retired New York City cop, as she scanned the crowds at Saturday's march in D.C. She was one of hundreds of thousands who marched in the city that day, armed with a homemade sign denouncing sexism and homophobia ― amazingly, it had a photo of her on it from a women's march decades earlier ― and joined by two friends who rode in on a bus from Long Island, New York. This, she said, motioning to the scene, is what brings change."}
{"original": "I've been doing this for 40 years, she said. It works."}
{"original": "For DeBenedictis and others, the march was the most cathartic and inspiring experience they'd had since the despair of President Donald Trump's win in November. More than 3 million people flooded the streets in cities and towns across the country, donning pink cat-eared pussy hats and vowing resistance to Trump's anti-woman, anti-environment, anti-immigrant agenda. It was such a high that many went back home fired up and ready to fight, but realized, wait, now what?"}
{"original": "Jen Bendery Fran DeBenedictis protested President Donald Trump in D.C. by carrying a sign with a picture of herself on it -- from a women's march 40 years earlier in D.C. Meta!"}
{"original": "The organizers of the march provided the platform that an angry electorate demanded, but they didn't dictate what comes next. Yes, they co-hosted the march with well-established, progressive groups in Washington D.C., like Planned Parenthood and the Natural Resources Defense Council. But they didn't coordinate with those groups to collect attendees' names and email addresses to keep them engaged in those groups' fights around reproductive rights or climate change. Instead, the organizers collected contact information for the local organizers themselves, which may wind up being far more powerful than another giant list of progressives."}
{"original": "I've already gotten a follow-up email from the Women's March in D.C. I think organizers are doing a much better job of 'absorption' post-march than anything I've ever seen prior to this, said Micah Sifry, who studies technology and political activism. He recently advised the new grassroots group SwingLeft.org, which connects volunteers with progressive House candidates running in nearby swing districts."}
{"original": "Organizers also didn't try to whittle down, say, the movement's top three progressive priorities and try to keep attendees focused on those issues in Congress. In spite of this lack of a centralized plan, or perhaps because of it, something remarkable has happened: Democrats desperate for change are going around the establishment and taking action themselves."}
{"original": "In the five days since the marches, there's been a surge of grassroots mobilization online and tens of thousands of people have signed up to get involved. Hundreds of people have signed up to run for local and state offices. Some have volunteered to help Democratic candidates in swing districts. Others, frustrated by the lack of change that they'd like to see, are starting their own campaigns that make fighting Trump as simple as sending a text or downloading an online postcard to send to your member of Congress on a given issue."}
{"original": "Laura Moser, a 39-year-old writer and mom of two young kids, had never led any kind of political mobilization effort before December, when she launched Daily Action. It's perhaps the easiest and most targeted progressive campaign out there: You just text the word DAILY to the number 228466 (or ACTION), and you'll get a text message about an urgent progressive issue in your area, based on your zip code. If you want to act, you listen to a short recorded explanation on it and from there, you're routed directly to your member of Congress or senator to weigh in."}
{"original": "In 90 seconds, you can conscientiously object and be done with it, reads the Daily Action website. You can make the phone calls when you're walking to the bus stop, or waiting in line for your morning latte. One touch of the phone and you're done."}
{"original": "Moser, who leaned on her husband's tech experience to set up the mechanics of the operation, has tapped into an eager audience. Daily Action already sends 75,000 texts per day ― as many as 20,000 of those came from people who signed up after the march ― and has 30,000 subscribers on Facebook. Moser said she was motivated to create the campaign after seeing so many progressives outraged and depressed about Trump and ready to fight for their ideals, but, per usual, not having any organization around it."}
{"original": "I kept getting all these messages from people like, 'What are we going to do? We're going to die,' Moser said. This is my solution to the despair. I can't stop all the horrible things that are happening, but I can react to them."}
{"original": "Cynthia Ross A lullaby for Trump."}
{"original": "This newfound energy is driving throngs of people into the political process ― and it's quickly being turned against Democratic politicians for being soft on Trump, whether it's by approving his cabinet nominees or signaling a willingness to work with him."}
{"original": "Senate Dems' response to millions taking to the streets is beyond disappointing, said Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of the women's online advocacy group Ultra Violet. It is outright shameful."}
{"original": "Resistance means resisting, Markos Moulitsas wrote Thursday on the progressive site Daily Kos. All those people in the streets last Saturday didn't march for Democrats to make nice with the GOP. They marched to resist—whether it's Trump, or his acolytes like Carson. And if even progressive champions like Warren can't figure that out, we really are in trouble."}
{"original": "In the meantime, new grassroots groups are cropping up by the day. There's the aforementioned Swing Left, which launched the day before Trump's inauguration and has more than 220,000 signed up to participate. There's Justice Democrats, which is raising money to fund challenges to so-called corporate Democrats. There's Run for Something, a group of Hillary for America and Obama for America, which is recruiting young Democrats to run for local and state office. They launched Friday and are seeing an average of 100 people sign up every day. The organizers of the Women's March just started their own effort: 10 actions for the first 100 days, which calls on its broad base of supporters to take action on a specific issue every 10 days."}
{"original": "Brad Bauman, a Democratic consultant and former executive director of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said the progressive base doesn't think its leaders are up to challenging Trump."}
{"original": "What we're seeing here is a tacit understanding by progressives that establishment Democratic leaders are not equipped to fight Donald Trump the way that Donald Trump needs to be fought, said Bauman, who works with labor and environmental groups. Progressives … frankly would have been much happier had [Senate Democrats] said to him, 'We will not confirm a single one of your picks unless you immediately and publicly renounce breaking up families, the wall, restricting Muslim entry into the country, torture and the rest of the alt-right agenda.'"}
{"original": "Some traditional groups are paying attention and following the lead of the masses. MoveOn sponsored the march and kicked in $100,000 to support it. The group held a phone call the day after and 60,000 people joined; another 15,000 turned out for small rallies at Senate and House offices on Tuesday, calling for opposition to Trump's #SwampCabinet, as it's been dubbed."}
{"original": "The grassroots progressive base ― and more broadly, the public, which voted decisively against Trump ― is demanding clear, principled, and total opposition to the Trump Administration's extreme and unprecedented agenda. Mayors, Attorneys General and Governors are showing what real leadership looks like right now said Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action."}
{"original": "Senate Democrats should pay attention, he added. Doing business as usual or treating Trump as your run-of-the-mill threat will not do."}
{"original": "As of Feb. 1, after more than 10,000 votes cast, the tally is running at 92 percent in favor of full-on opposition, with 8 percent recommending pragmatism."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump has pledged to repeal a 50-year-old tax law that prohibits churches and other tax-exempt organizations from participating in political campaigns. If successful, the repeal could deal a major blow to the separation of church and state."}
{"original": "In an address to politicians and religious leaders gathered for the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, Trump declared: I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment."}
{"original": "The Johnson Amendment is a provision in the U.S. tax code named for Lyndon B. Johnson, who introduced it in Congress while he was still a senator. Congress /www.irs.gov/uac/charities-churches-and-politics}}>passed the amendment in 1954, banning 501(c)(3) organizations ― which includes churches and charities ― from engaging in political campaign activity. Such activity includes publicly endorsing and opposing candidates, contributing to campaign funds and distributing materials in favor or opposition of any candidate."}
{"original": "The Internal Revenue Service upholds the prohibition accordingly, investigating churches and faith leaders who use their tax-exempt platforms to engage in political organizing of this nature."}
{"original": "The amendment aims to preserve an already precarious church-state divide by limiting religious organizations' ability to sway elections. But for Trump, repealing the amendment appears to be an issue of religious freedom. At Thursday's event, the president claimed the law undermines Americans' right to worship according to our own beliefs, thus conflating political campaigning and religious worship."}
{"original": "Trump could propose changes to the current tax code, but only Congress has the power to officially repeal the amendment. But the president could effectively nullify the law by directing the IRS not to enforce it, tax law professor David Herzig told The Washington Post. The GOP currently holds a majority in Congress."}
{"original": "Progressive Christian author Jim Wallis tweeted about Trump's comments on Thursday:"}
{"original": "Trump wants to give the Religious Right what it has always wanted: the ability for congregations to be openly partisan in our elections. — Jim Wallis (@jimwallis) February 2, 2017"}
{"original": "Many Republicans favor repealing the amendment. Ahead of last year's Republican National Convention, the GOP'S official platform included a proposal to overturn the law."}
{"original": "Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Christian-based Liberty University who was recently appointed to head Trump's education task force, said at the time: This is going to create a revolution among Christian leaders, nonprofit universities, and nonprofits in general."}
{"original": "According to a 2014 Pew Research poll, nearly 60 percent of Republicans believe churches should express their political views, compared with 42 percent of Democrats. Just 38 percent of Republicans and 28 percent of Democrats, though, think churches should go as far as endorsing candidates."}
{"original": "Among the leaders and organizations, like Falwell, who favor repealing the amendment but maintaining religious organizations' tax exemption, are conservative Christian nonprofit Alliance Defending Freedom, Catholic anti-abortion organization Priests for Life, and Branch Ministries Inc., whose permit the IRS revoked in the mid-1990s for campaigning against Bill Clinton."}
{"original": "Opponents of the Johnson Amendment argue that the law violates religious leaders' First Amendment rights. Faith leaders, however, are allowed to endorse candidates and otherwise participate in political campaigns as private citizens, as long as they don't claim to be speaking on behalf of their religious organization. Those in favor of upholding the law feel it maintains the integrity of the tax system under which churches and nonprofits do not pay taxes on their income and contributions made to them are tax-deductible by donors."}
{"original": "Politicizing churches does them no favors. The promised repeal is an attack on the integrity of both our charitable organizations and campaign finance system, said Amanda Tyler, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee, in a statement."}
{"original": "Religious leaders and organizations have long held tremendous sway in the U.S. political arena. The Christian right, also called the religious right, has proven to be a particularly powerful organizing force in recent decades, spearheading the movements against abortion and gay rights, as well as so-called religious liberty cases that allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people. A leaked draft of an executive order on religious freedom suggests Trump may be mulling additional measures to fortify the Christian right."}
{"original": "Despite mounting support for repealing the Johnson Amendment, previous efforts to do so -- in 2013 and again in 2015 -- failed in Congress. As the Los Angeles Times wrote in a 2013 editorial: Churches may have a 1st Amendment right to endorse candidates, but there is no constitutional right to a tax exemption."}
{"original": "At least 14 Democratic senators have sent a letter to President-elect Joe Biden recommending that he choose former Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) as his attorney general, according to two congressional sources familiar with the letter."}

{"original": "The senators sent the letter to the Biden transition team just after Christmas. Most of the signatories are considered moderates, though both Brown and Leahy have strong progressive credentials."}
{"original": "Senator Brown is proud to support Sen. Jones for AG, a Brown spokesperson wrote in an email to HuffPost."}
{"original": "Sen. Doug Jones is an honorable public servant who has dedicated his career to the pursuit of justice. Sen. Casey believes that he would be an excellent attorney general, said Casey spokesman John Rizzo."}
{"original": "The Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment."}
{"original": "Jones is reportedly one of the top contenders for the prestigious job, along with federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland and former deputy Attorney General Sally Yates."}
{"original": "Jones, who lost his reelection bid in November, has a long history with Biden. As a law student, Jones introduced the young senator when he spoke at his school. He also worked for the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which Biden served, and was co-chair of his 1998 presidential campaign."}
{"original": "In 2017, Biden was one of the few national Democrats who campaigned for Jones in deep-red Alabama. (At the time, Biden joked he would campaign either for or against Jones ― whichever would help him more.)"}
{"original": "Democratic National Convention via AP In this image from video, then-Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) speaks during the first night of the Democratic National Convention in August 2020. A dozen of his former Senate colleagues are now advocating for him to become the attorney general of the U.S."}
{"original": "President Bill Clinton named Jones the U.S. attorney in Birmingham in 1997. There, he led the successful prosecution of two of the Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church. The heinous act killed four young Black girls during church services."}
{"original": "Jones has received the support of other Biden allies, including Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), who has praised his work around the bombing."}
{"original": "Decades they walked around free after bombing that church and killing those four Black girls. He prosecuted them and got them convicted, Clyburn said last month. You don't have to be Black to do right by Black people."}
{"original": "Biden's nominee will face the challenge of determining how the Justice Department will approach potential criminal investigations into the outgoing president and members of his administration."}
{"original": "They will also face the prospect of rebuilding components like the Civil Rights Division, which abandoned key issues like police reform and focused on controversial religious liberty cases and attacks on college affirmative action programs. And they will need to deal with the long-term consequences of President Donald Trump's attacks on the FBI, which has gutted Republicans' confidence in the nation's premier law enforcement organization."}
{"original": "Biden's nominee may also have to figure out how to combat a rise in right-wing domestic terrorism cases, some of which have been directly inspired by Trump's rhetoric against his political enemies and Muslims."}
{"original": "In addition, there will be the delicate question of how to handle the ongoing tax investigation into the new president's son, Hunter Biden, which is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware. The new attorney general will have to assure the American public that there won't be political interference in the probe, perhaps by walling off the investigation. Republicans ― the vast majority of whom were unconcerned with Trump's repeated attempts to improperly interfere in Justice Department matters ― might even call for a special counsel to assure the probe's independence."}
{"original": "AP Photo/Steven Senne, File In this May 24, 2017, file photo, former deputy Attorney General Sally Yates speaks at Harvard Law School Class Day in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She is reportedly currently being considered for the attorney general role in Joe Biden's administration."}
{"original": "Yates became a Democratic star when Trump fired her for refusing to enforce his ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries. A number of civil rights leaders want Biden to choose her for the role, believing that her knowledge of the Justice Department would help restore the beleaguered agency and that she has a proven track record on implementing criminal justice reform."}
{"original": "But Yates will likely face strong Republican opposition because of her involvement in the FBI's Russia investigation in 2016, which included signing off on the warrant application for Carter Page, a former Trump campaign aide."}
{"original": "Garland was famously denied a vote after President Barack Obama nominated him for the Supreme Court after Antonin Scalia's death in 2016, since Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wanted to hold the seat open until after the presidential election. Garland is seen as a more independent and moderate choice ― although perhaps too moderate on criminal justice issues for some reform advocates."}
{"original": "Biden, however, has also been under pressure to not tap a white candidate for the position, and he has been making diversity in his Cabinet a priority. Which candidate Biden chooses may also depend on the outcome of the Georgia Senate runoffs on Tuesday, which will determine whether Democrats or Republicans will control the Senate for the next two years."}
{"original": "The Justice Department suffered a serious blow to morale during the Trump administration. Many career Justice Department employees who held on for four years of the Trump administration were likely to depart had Trump been reelected and able to mold the department into an even more overtly political organization."}
{"original": "Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who had to rebuild DOJ after controversies during the George W. Bush administration, said Biden understands that he needs to give the attorney general the space that he or she needs to restore integrity and the independence of the department."}
{"original": "The department has been taken off a road that I think it's basically been on since the Nixon administration, where there's been that separation of the Justice Department from the White House, Holder told HuffPost ahead of the election. You really need to look at the department as a whole. The people there, both in the field and at Main Justice, their motives have been called into question, their patriotism has been called into question, and all of that has to be dealt with. This story has been updated with additional senators on the letter."}

{"original": "In a stark reminder of gaping global inequality, a report published Sunday reveals that 162 billionaires, including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, have the same wealth as the poorest half of the world."}
{"original": "There are 2,153 billionaires globally, and, in 2019, they held more wealth combined than 4.6 billion people, according to the report, which uses data from the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report and Forbes' billionaire rankings."}
{"original": "The report uses a striking analogy to put these amounts of wealth in context. If everyone sat on their wealth piled up in $100 bills, most people would be sitting on the floor, a middle-class person from a rich country would be the height of a chair, and the world's two richest men would be sitting in space."}
{"original": "Oxfam's report is published annually to coincide with the start of the World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, where high-profile policymakers, business leaders and the wealthy take their private jets to a Swiss ski town to discuss how to improve the state of the world."}
{"original": "Once someone is very wealthy, the report points out, it's easy to just watch the money accumulate because the rich can afford the best investment advice. Billionaire wealth has increased by an average of 7.4% a year since 2009, according to the report published by Oxfam, an international development nongovernmental organization. And 2019 was a good year for the ultrarich. Despite their wealth levels dipping at the start of the year, they quickly rebounded, and the world's 500 richest people managed to add $1.2 trillion to their wealth over the course of the year, according to a Bloomberg analysis."}
{"original": "For some, the ability of individuals to accumulate vast levels of wealth, more than some countries' entire gross domestic product, is a sign of the American Dream in action. The U.S. has the highest concentration of billionaires (705 individuals) and last year was the only country to see an increase in its billionaire population."}
{"original": "But for others it's a sign that something's gone wrong. Economist Stephanie Kelton last year tweeted, No one makes a billion dollars. You TAKE a billion dollars. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said in July that a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don't have access to public health is wrong."}
{"original": "Extreme wealth is a sign of a failing economic system, according to the report, which calculates that about a third of billionaire wealth exists because of inheritance. President Donald Trump's fortune, for example, was built off the hundreds of millions of dollars he was given or inherited from his father."}
{"original": "No one makes a billion dollars. You TAKE a billion dollars. You take it from your workers (Hi, Jeff, Jim, and Alice!). You plunder it from the environment (What up, Charles & David?).

{"original": "The gap between the world's richest and poorest remains stark. Research by French economist Thomas Piketty found that the benefits of global growth have not been shared equally. From 1980 to 2016, the poorest 50% of people received 12 cents of every dollar of global income growth, while the richest 1% got more than double that, with 27 cents of every dollar."}
{"original": "Even though estimates of the wealth of the world's poorest have been revised upward this year, the rate at which we are reducing global poverty has fallen by half since 2013, according to the World Bank."}
{"original": "And while huge numbers of people have been pulled from extreme poverty over the last few decades, 735 million people still live in extreme poverty ― meaning they survive on $1.90 or less a day ― and nearly half of the world (3.4 billion people) live on less than $5.50 a day."}

{"original": "Women put in billions of hours of unpaid, undervalued care work"}
{"original": "This report, called Time to Care, puts a spotlight on those who care for the young, the sick and the elderly, the vast majority of whom are women and girls working long hours for little or no pay."}
{"original": "Globally, women provide 12.5 billion hours a day of care work without pay, which the Oxfam report calculates adds at least $10.8 trillion of value to the economy every year."}
{"original": "This work is undervalued socially and economically, but, the report says, It also lays the foundations in society that make possible enormous economic wealth accrued by others and helps to generate enormous economic wealth."}
{"original": "Gowland gave the example of a woman in rural Zimbabwe who has to walk four hours a day to fetch water for her family. The consequences of that are really obvious, she said. Girls are pulled out of school to do this unpaid care work, women can't access fair, decent jobs and wages, and the biggest thing is the fact that they just don't have time to contribute to societies, to any kind of political discourse or engagement with how their societies are run."}
{"original": "This care crisis is not just affecting developing countries. The U.S. child care system, for example, is costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars a year in lost wages and lost opportunities, according to a report published Wednesday by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI). Child care providers in America are overwhelmed and underpaid, with a median wage of $12 an hour, according to the report's findings. Meanwhile, parents, most often women, are being forced to give up work or turn down better-paying jobs because of the expense of child care."}
{"original": "The burden of caregiving looks set to increase. The International Labor Organization estimates, for example, there will be 100 million more older people needing care by 2050. Then there are the effects of the climate crisis, which are causing myriad health problems, forcing people to leave their homes and depriving them of water and food."}
{"original": "These factors threaten to further exacerbate gender and economic inequalities and fuel a spiraling crisis for care and carers, says the report."}
{"original": "At the same time, most countries have no plan to deal with this, says the report, and are instead reducing public spending, increasingly privatizing health and education, and raising taxes on the poor."}
{"original": "If world leaders meeting this week [at Davos] are serious about reducing poverty and inequality, said Danny Sriskandarajah, the chief executive of Oxfam Great Britain, they urgently need to invest in care and other public services that make life easier for those with care responsibilities, and tackle discrimination holding back women and girls."}
{"original": "We know the solutions. There's just not the will to implement them."}
{"original": "The report calls for a swath of policy changes, such as free and universal public services ― like education, child care and health care ― and policies to limit the influence of companies and the superrich."}
{"original": "Oxfam suggests a progressive taxation system, which closes the loopholes that allow companies and wealthy individuals to avoid tax. Amazon, for example, paid $0 in corporate income tax in 2018 despite making $11 billion in profits."}
{"original": "The entire economy, and many corporations within it, exist solely to the benefit of its of their wealthiest stakeholders, Marshall Steinbaum, an assistant economics professor at the University of Utah, told HuffPost. Where before we had companies whose workers were collectively represented and a society in which businesses and the wealthiest were taxed proportionately more than the less wealthy, he said, now companies' only purpose is to benefit shareholders and we have low marginal income tax rates that allow huge fortunes to be amassed."}
{"original": "Increasing taxes on the wealth of the 1% by 0.5% could raise enough over the next decade to create 117 million jobs in education, health and elder care, and close the care deficits, the report says."}
{"original": "Though these kind of policy changes may feel remote in countries like the U.S., Gowland said, we are slowly seeing some governments decide to take on more progressive policies."}
{"original": "Uruguay, for example, implemented legislation in 2017 that enshrines in law a right to care for all children, older people and people with disabilities, meaning the state is obliged to provide good-quality care services."}
{"original": "And New Zealand is trying to tackle inequality with its new well-being budget. The country has pledged to prioritize citizen well-being over economic growth in its spending and in the way it measures its success."}
{"original": "Phil Walter via Getty Images New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern visits a community health center in Auckland on May 31, 2019. Budget 2019, known as the Well-Being Budget, has a heavy focus on public welfare alongside economic growth."}
{"original": "It is sobering that this is the first time we have had a national budget that explicitly focuses on well-being, Anna Matheson, senior lecturer in health policy at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, told HuffPost last year.

{"original": "What are your ideas and proposals for reforming the US tax system? originally appeared on Quora - the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights."}
{"original": "Answer by Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Senator for Massachusetts, on Quora."}
{"original": "Giant corporations tell the same story over and over: They are overtaxed. There's only one problem: It's not true. There's a problem with our corporate tax code, but it isn'tover-taxation. The tax code is so tangled with exceptions and credits that, for some of the biggest companies, the effective federal income rate is zero. That's right - not 35%. Not 20%. Zero."}
{"original": "Here are three ideas to start the tax reform discussion:"}
{"original": "The big corporations need to pay their fair share of running this country. They get a lot of benefits from being an American business, and they need to help pay for that. For decades, corporations contributed about 30% of all the revenue to the federal government, but the biggest corporations have gotten so many tax loopholes that corporations now contribute about 10% - and it's not enough to keep our infrastructure repaired, our schools well-supported, and our research funded. The current tax system is rigged to favor giant corporations over small business. Small businesses don't stash their profits in Luxembourg or put money away in the Cayman Islands. Loopholes and gimmicks are only available to the big guys, and they make it harder for the small guys to compete. Tax reform should promote investing in jobs here in the US - not subsidizing corporations to move jobs abroad. It's crazy that the US taxpayer is helping companies build jobs outside America."}
{"original": "The big corporations say tax policy is complicated, but most of this stuff is pretty simple - and most Americans probably agree with these commonsense ideas. But Congress doesn't talk to most Americans - they talk to CEOs and armies of lawyers and lobbyists who are all on the lookout for special deals. Right now Congress hands out billions in benefits to big, well-connected corporations - while middle class families and small businesses are left holding the bag."}
{"original": "Carl's company (a real client of mine with names changed) designs custom furniture. He has about 25 employees. It's a family business that he took over from his dad more than twenty years ago. Carl has a 401(K) retirement plan for his employees. It's been in place for years."}
{"original": "Sure, it's a cost--but it's not that significant. At the time Carl spent under a thousand bucks to get it setup (many good financial services firms from Vanguard to Capital One to Fidelity) will do this for a nominal charge, and some are even known to waive setup fees in certain cases. 401K plans have become cookie cutter with standard investment choices and agreements drawn from long used templates. Carl pays about a hundred bucks a month for administrative fees. He also has a matching program, which is completely discretionary and based on the company's profits. The plan is open for all to join. Unfortunately, less than half of his employees participate."}
{"original": "One of those employees is Zack. Actually, Zack is a former employee. He worked for Carl's company for almost 25 years and was a valuable, loyal part of Carl's operations. Zack didn't contribute to Carl's plan. Unfortunately, as Zack became older, he slowed down and suffered some medical issues. So he needed to retire. He had some savings, but not much. Zack was in a financial bind. Although he drew social security and received Medicaid, he still needed a few extra bucks each month to make ends meet. He wasn't able to get help from his family. So where do you think he turned?"}
{"original": "That's right--he turned to Carl--his employer of so many years. And what do you think Carl does? He helps Zack out, of course. Even though Zack is no longer employed at the furniture maker and never participated in their retirement plan, Carl still feels a moral obligation to do what he can for this long time employee. So Carl brought him back on as a contracted consultant and pays him enough so Zack can get by comfortably. Carl turned out to be Zack's retirement plan. I've seen this plenty of times."}
{"original": "The President has proposed a solution."}
{"original": "In case you missed the news--last week the President announced new proposals to help small businesses provide retirement funds for their employees. Among these proposals would be the ability to pool 401(K) plans among similar companies thereby lowering administrative costs and a tax credit for employers who participate. In return, the President wants to require employers with more than 10 people to automatically enroll those not participating into an individual retirement plan and to also require employers to let part-timers participate in company plans."}
{"original": "The National Federation of Independent Businesses is not amused. Many small businesses have a handful of full-time employees and larger part-time workforce, NFIB Research Director Holly Wade was quoted in this report. If they're forced by the government to offer retirement benefits to everyone, some may very well discontinue the plan altogether. That would be a classic unintended consequence."}
{"original": "She's right, of course. And not only that, this would require more administration from the small business owner and potentially more cost to those employers who offer matching contributions to those that participate. And yes, tax credits are available now and more have been proposed by the President."}
{"original": "Judging from my client base of over 600 small and medium sized businesses, the great majority of those that I speak to want their employees to put away money for retirement. They don't' want to be in the same situation as Carl. They can see the cost-benefits of paying a thousand bucks a year for a plan. They know that the more their employees contribute, the more they in turn can contribute. They understand the reasons why even matching an employee's contribution (and this can be done voluntarily each year, so there's no commitment) is a good thing for both parties."}
{"original": "And yet, according to many surveys, less than half of small employers have a 401(K) plan for their employees. Will the President's plan fix this problem?"}
{"original": "No. The President is missing something big. He thinks the costs of 401(K) plans are prohibiting employer participation. But this is wrong. This is not a cost thing. It's an education thing. Many of my clients who do not offer these plans are not aware of how easy and inexpensive they are to setup. They are busy people and have many other things to worry about. And many of my clients who do offer these plans have low participation rates because their employees aren't educated about the benefits."}
{"original": "And, more sadly, both employer and employee share a mutual distrust of financial markets and the financial services industry. A distrust that has partly been enabled by the President himself. That's the real problem."}
{"original": "When it comes to 401(K) plans small business owners and their employees don't need lower costs or tax credits. They need more awareness and more education about the options that exist today. They need to better understand how the benefits significantly outweigh the costs. And they need to have more faith in the both the markets and in our financial services industry. Fixing that problem would be a better use of the President's time."}

{"original": "The good news is that there are ways to offset these gains and potentially lower your tax bill if you happen to get lucky."}

{"original": "If you sell stock that you've held onto more than a year, you will be taxed on the earnings at a lower capital gains rate. Here's what the capital gains tax rates are currently for single filers:"}
{"original": "Income of $0 to $40,000: 0%"}
{"original": "Income of $40,001 to $441,450: 15%"}
{"original": "Income of $441,451 or more: 20%"}
{"original": "However, if you held that stock for less than a year, the gains are taxed as ordinary income according to whichever tax bracket you fall under. Here are current tax brackets for single filers:"}
{"original": "Income of up to $9,950: 10%"}
{"original": "Income of $9,951 to $40,525: 12%"}
{"original": "Income of $40,526 to $86,375: 22%"}

{"original": "Income of $164,926 to $209,425: 32%"}
{"original": "Income of $209,426 to $523,600: 35%"}
{"original": "Lewis shared this example: Say your taxable income for the year is $50,000, including a $5,000 gain on a stock you sold. If you owned that stock for at least a year before selling it, the tax on that sale would be $750 (15%)."}
{"original": "However, if you owned the stock for less than a year, you'd pay ordinary income tax on the profit, based on the tax bracket you fall into. In this case, that would be $1,100 (22%)."}
{"original": "Keep in mind that if you make a lot of money from stock sales in one year, you could bump yourself into a higher tax bracket, and thus, increase your capital gains rate. You can use a capital gains tax calculator like this one from TurboTax to help you understand the differences between your short-term and long-term capital gains and losses on your transactions."}
{"original": "How To Offset Short-Term Capital Gains"}
{"original": "Giving up a chunk of your stock market earnings to the IRS certainly isn't fun. Fortunately, there are a few ways to lower your tax liability and decrease your overall tax bill."}
{"original": "For example, if you have other securities trading at a loss, Molina said you can actually use those to your advantage. By selling securities at a loss, you can use those losses to offset your other capital gains, he stated. This strategy is called tax-loss harvesting and can limit your tax liability over the long term, especially in volatile markets like we currently see."}
{"original": "Another way to offset capital gains is by contributing more pre-tax funds to your 401(k) or other retirement savings account, which will reduce your adjusted gross income and maybe even keep you in a lower tax bracket. The 401(k) contribution limit for 2021 $19,500, or $26,000 for employees over the age of 50 making catch-up contributions."}
{"original": "Finally, Molina suggested holding off on other financial moves that would increase your tax burden even more. For example, if you hold company equity, you may consider waiting to sell any until you've held it for a whole year, which results in a lower tax rate as a long-term gain instead."}

{"original": "One of the year's most touching documentary films, Best and Most Beautiful Things, makes its world premiere this month at SXSW. A provocative and joyous coming of age portrait of precocious 20 year old Michelle Smith of rural Maine, she's both legally blind and diagnosed on the autism spectrum, but the film does not pander to that. She bursts off the screen as someone immensely relatable. You'll want to know her. This is a powerful, affecting journey into a young woman's mind as she searches for connection and empowerment by exploring life outside the limits of normal through a fringe community."}
{"original": "I had the pleasure of speaking with the film's Executive Producer, Kevin Bright, who has succeeded in navigating the waters of both TV (he was Executive Producer of Friends) and film (his previous documentary work includes directing the 2007 film about his vaudevillian father, Who Ordered Tax?). Kevin executive produced the film with Claudia Bright."}

{"original": "Xaque Gruber: What was it about this project that attracted you? How did it find you?"}
{"original": "Kevin Bright: My involvement with the project began in 2009 when I started a filmmaking class for students at the Perkins School for The Blind in Watertown, Massachusetts. Michelle Smith was in that first class and was part of a group that made an award winning film Seeing Through the Lens. I loved the impact the film had on these students, giving them the power to tell their stories to the world. Our director, Garrett Zevgetis, was a volunteer at Perkins who at that time was making a short film about the impact of Helen Keller on current Perkins students. After seeing an early cut, my recommendation was to focus the film on Michelle as a modern day Helen Keller. Garrett filmed Michelle - it was a 20 minute short that became a feature film and now here we are with a premiere at SXSW."}
{"original": "XG: Let's talk about Michelle Smith. She is legally blind, on the autism spectrum and lives in rural Maine - with those details she seems plucked from a Stephen King novel. She's bound to win over many fans and hearts. Tell me what it was like working with her and do you see any of yourself in Michelle?"}
{"original": "KB: Michelle is an inspiration to me. She could roll over and be a victim of her disability, instead she embraces it and challenges the rest of us to step out of our comfort zone and be open to different people and life styles, unlearning normal as Michelle says. Everyone falls for Michelle because she draws you in, makes a connection, but sometimes, can really shock you. Pity is not what she seeks, it is not in her vocabulary."}
{"original": "XG: Michelle's provocative fringe community- how much can you tell us about it? Did her participation in this community make you squirm?"}
{"original": "KB: It is pretty universal that your teens through your twenties is a time of exploration and experimentation, which includes sexuality. When I first became aware of Michelle in this community, I was concerned about her safety first and foremost, but also was afraid the audience would judge and define her by this one aspect of her life. I was her teacher and I felt responsible. Michelle made me aware that I knew nothing about this world and that my fears were being generated by simply being uninformed. Through Michelle I became informed and my concerns went away after seeing the positive impact the community was making on Michelle's self esteem and life. It still makes me squirm a little, but I'm getting there."}
{"original": "XG: Do you have a favorite scene in the film?"}
{"original": "KB: I have two. The first is when Michelle goes to watch her brother play in a basketball game. I think our editors Jeff Consiglio and Sarah Ginsburg did an incredible job of putting the audience squarely in Michelle's shoes. The second is when Michelle goes swimming with her boyfriend at an indoor pool on a winter night. The two of them alone, Michelle exhibiting wit and self-confidence, you forget that she is blind and all the challenges she is facing. Instead, you just get to sit back and enjoy two young people playing together in love."}
{"original": "XG: You are established in Hollywood as a TV comedy producer. So what is it like for you to step into the world of documentary film producing? And what have you learned about producing documentaries from Best and Most Beautiful Things?"}
{"original": "KB: On one hand, it's all storytelling, whether it's an episode of Friends or someone's life, telling that story is the key. Who Ordered Tax was about my dad Jackie, I knew that story well. To get Michelle's story right took many years of patience to allow it to unfold. I wanted to pull the plug several times. But, the incredible team of filmmakers that I got to work with convinced me to keep going. This film really belongs to them, Garrett (director/producer), Jeff and Sarah (editors), and producers Ariana Garfinkel, Jeff Consiglio, and Jordan Salvatoriello. I am very proud of this collaboration, especially because three fellow Emerson College Alumni worked on it with me, which brought it all full circle."}

{"original": "President Donald Trump's ongoing trade wars are expected to cost the average American family $1,277 this year, according to a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office."}
{"original": "The figure is based on the negative impact of tariffs on economic growth, as well as higher prices to consumers as American manufacturers and retailers are forced to pay tariffs on imports."}
{"original": "Trump has boasted that trade wars are easy to win, and has repeatedly falsely insisted that China is paying tariffs directly into the U.S. Treasury. In fact, American companies importing goods or supplies pay tariffs enacted by Trump, and typically pass on those costs to consumers. In addition, U.S. industries are hurt by retaliatory tariffs enacted by other nations when American companies try to sell their products abroad."}
{"original": "The CBO also warns in its report that uncertainty about the future and trading relationships can cause companies to delay or drop investments in their operations, further dampening American economic growth."}
{"original": "Tariffs are expected to reduce the level of real GDP by roughly 0.5 percent and raise consumer prices by 0.5 percent in 2020, the report says. As a result, tariffs are also projected to reduce average real household income by $1,277 (in 2019 dollars) in 2020."}
{"original": "The extra costs would effectively wipe out savings from Trump's tax cut enacted in 2017 for the average taxpayer, estimated by JP Morgan as $1,300 a year."}
{"original": "Every time you turn on a light or charge your cellphone, you pay a tax. Surprised? Many Angelenos don't realize that hidden in their monthly bill from the Department of Water and Power is a big surcharge in the form of a 10% City of Los Angeles Utility Tax, as well as a transfer of 8% of all electric-related revenue to City Hall. In short, you're paying almost 20% more for electricity than you should be."}
{"original": "For a typical residential DWP customer with an electric bill of $130, that's about $25 each month that gets paid right into the city's general fund and spent on things that have nothing to do with keeping the lights on. There is no question rates have to go up if DWP is to modernize its system to produce cleaner, more reliable power -- but that issue is separate and apart from the question of how much DWP revenue should be siphoned off by City Hall."}
{"original": "In the coming days, the City Council will vote on the largest power rate increase in DWP history -- a cumulative hike of more than 20% over five years. Over the next decade, that will produce a windfall for the city's coffers, almost $1 billion. To be clear -- this money is coming out of ratepayers' pockets, but none of it will be spent to improve the utility's aging infrastructure, increase wind or solar power generation, or make service more affordable and reliable."}
{"original": "How has this happened? Because there is a complete lack of public accountability at DWP."}
{"original": "The utility ostensibly is run by a board of commissioners who -- though well intentioned and hardworking -- are all part-time volunteers and political appointees. So let's dispense with the fiction that the DWP board controls utility rates, or for that matter, can control its costs, such as wages."}
{"original": "The mayor appoints the DWP general manager and the commissioners, and he can replace them at any time. (Pre-signed copies of their resignation letters are kept on file.) The ultimate decision-making authority on the upcoming rate hike and responsibility for how DWP is run rests with the mayor and City Council."}
{"original": "Four changes would transform DWP into a stronger, more efficient utility -- and one free from unnecessary political influence."}
{"original": "First, immediately cap the amount of money -- both the transfer and the utility tax combined -- that is paid by DWP ratepayers to City Hall. After increasing for years, these fees now add up to about $600 million annually. Whether the 8% transfer is even legal is being debated in the courts, but the city should get ahead of the issue and put a maximum figure on all of these funds right now. We're proposing a cap, not a cut -- so it shouldn't diminish city services."}
{"original": "Second, when rates do go up, a portion of the new revenue should be used to subsidize the power bills of low-income customers. Let's take care of our city's neediest families who sometimes can't afford to keep their lights on."}
{"original": "Third, allow DWP to do its own hiring rather than be subject to a bureaucratic civil service process. These rules add unnecessary delay when DWP needs additional people and specific expertise to run its complex business."}
{"original": "Finally, replace the volunteer Board of Commissioners to give the DWP dedicated professional oversight and more independence. All members of the new board (and its staff) should be required to have relevant experience and be paid for their work. Staggered appointments to fixed five-year terms would, over time, assemble a board that reflected a succession of the city's elected leaders but remained insulated from immediate political interference. The board then would appoint the DWP's general manager and have complete control over revenues (including all rate hikes) and costs (like union contracts)."}
{"original": "DWP services affect the daily life of everyone in Los Angeles. The city deserves a public utility that is operated in the long-term best interests of its customers, employees and our environment. For that to happen, we need the DWP to have strong, independent leadership."}

{"original": "A handshake session is an event that gives fans the opportunity to meet and shake hands with their star, often an idol group. Obviously, it's a bit much to relate a handshake session with love life.

I don't have time to love, and more."}
{"original": "The media reported, The broadcast did not provide detailed explanation about the matter. However, AKB48 is definitely popular, and there are many young people who put more emphasis on their support over their love life. But, it's questionable whether an handshake session of an idol group is the cause of young people avoiding romantic attachments."}

It is trying to raise the marriage rate of men and women aged between 23 and 49 who want to marry to 80% by 2020."}
{"original": "The government will continue to support the married couple. Since April 2015, Japan has been allowing tax exemption for cash transfers up to 10 million yen to children and grandchildren for marriages, births and child rearing."}
{"original": "Japan will also review support for long distance couples, and those undergoing fertility treatment. The government has decided to create a new system, such as holiday system, based on the survey results of companies to help married couples who want to undergo fertility treatment while going to work starting this year. This is because many women are forced to leave or take a break because it is difficult to work and undergo infertility treatment at the same time."}
{"original": "In addition, the government is considering to provide tax credits to long distance couples for moving costs if they decide to get married as well as travel costs for meeting each other. The government is reviewing these measures to include in the tax reform 2017 in order to prevent long distance couples from giving up their marriage because of long distance."}
{"original": "Some companies are beginning to pay attention to low birth rates by providing childcare subsidies. Back in October, Hitachi started a childcare support system which provides its workers' child care expenses, up to 100,000 yen a year. Honda plans to introduce a system that will offer 20,000 yen per month for each child under the age of 18 of its employees starting in April this year."}
{"original": "The maximum period of child care leave available to workers would be extended to two years. This year, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has decided to submit to the National Assembly the related amendment that allows working parents to take leave until their child reaches two years old."}
{"original": "However, aggressive support of konkatsu activities has a downside. In last December, the Japanese government decided to abandon its konkatsu mentoring program within companies plan which was considered as a plan to encourage marriages. The plan was a system where a married worker advises an unmarried worker about marriage preparation. However, many criticized it because it can put much pressure to workers to get married in a workplace where you are disadvantaged if you don't follow the advice of your boss."}
{"original": "The Nihon Keizai Shimbun (a.k.a. Nikkei) pointed out in the editorial, Too many obstacles are being placed in the path to marriage. The Nikkei revealed that radical reforms are impossible while maintaining the current tax and social security system, therefore reforms such as making social security more efficient, and putting some burden on financially stable elderly people are necessary."}
{"original": "Republican senators involved in bipartisan talks over another pandemic relief bill are unenthusiastic about Democratic proposals to expand the child tax credit."}
{"original": "Democrats have hyped the idea as a way to slash child poverty with monthly cash payments to parents, but Republicans seem to think of it as irrelevant to the health and economic crisis at hand. They also have concerns about its impact on the debt."}
{"original": "In general, I think it should be a more targeted package, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Wednesday when asked whether a child tax credit expansion should be included in the next COVID-19 relief package."}
{"original": "I'll take a look at it but I just don't know the full ramifications of increasing the child tax credit, added Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), noting Republicans had already doubled the credit in their 2017 tax cut law."}
{"original": "Capito and Collins are two of the eight Republican members of a bipartisan Senate working group that jump-started negotiations on the last pandemic relief bill Congress passed. HuffPost reached out to spokespeople for the six other Republicans, but none responded to inquiries about whether they supported or opposed expanding the credit."}
{"original": "As part of a sweeping $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan, President Joe Biden proposed boosting the child tax credit's maximum value from $2,000 to $3,600 and making it easier for families to get the credit as a cash refund. The package would also include another direct payment to households, extend federal unemployment benefits through September and raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour."}
{"original": "Republicans have dismissed the overall Biden plan as too broad, though some expressed support for another round of direct payments, and others, such as Sens. Mike Lee and Mitt Romney of Utah, have recently supported expanding the child tax credit. But the Biden child credit proposal does not seem to be breaking through as an item both parties can agree on for the next pandemic bill, and disagreements abound."}
{"original": "Bill Clark via Getty Images Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) speaks with reporters in the Senate subway after a vote in the Capitol on Jan. 26, 2021."}
{"original": "The idea of attaching a minimum wage hike to the package has also generated significant GOP opposition. Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), two moderates seen as most willing to support Biden's agenda, maintain that increasing the federal minimum wage is unrelated to coronavirus relief."}
{"original": "It's unnecessary, Murkowski told reporters on Wednesday. It just complicates politically an initiative that we should all be working [on] together."}
{"original": "Democrats have signaled their intention to go it alone on another COVID-19 relief bill if they cannot gain enough Republican support to break a filibuster. They can pass such a spending bill with just 51 votes under an arcane process called budget reconciliation, which Republicans used to pass their $2 trillion tax cut bill, as well as several other priorities."}
{"original": "We must not repeat the mistakes of 2008 and 2009, when Congress was too timid and constrained in its response to the global financial crisis, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech on Wednesday. Congress must pursue a bold response to the prevailing crisis of our time."}
{"original": "Congressional Democrats have been enthusiastic about the Biden package, and particularly its tax credit provisions, which resemble proposals Democrats passed in the House as part of an unsuccessful pandemic messaging bill last year."}
{"original": "The big idea would be to take the child tax credit ― which offsets tax bills for 90% of households with children but delivers refunds only to those with limited incomes ― into a guaranteed cash payment for everyone beneath a certain income level. And instead of delivering a lump sum after tax time, the Internal Revenue Service would pay the benefit on a monthly basis, essentially transforming the tax credit into the kind of child benefit that other advanced countries have used to achieve lower child poverty rates."}
{"original": "But the White House didn't mention the monthly payment concept in the 19-page outline of its overall relief plan, and the Biden administration hasn't spoken about it even as top Democrats trumpet the idea."}
{"original": "Democrats don't need Republican votes to increase the child tax credit as long as they are united behind the idea and pass it via reconciliation in their COVID-19 package."}
{"original": "One reason Democrats tinker with tax credits as social policy is that it helps them dodge Republican accusations that they're fostering Big Government, since the credits are technically tax cuts. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), for instance, once supported making it easier for people without children to get cash from the earned income tax credit ― another idea Democrats and the Biden administration have included in their COVID-19 plans."}
{"original": "Republicans aren't playing along. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), another of the Republicans in the working group, said he was interested in looking at the earned income credit, but not that interested."}
{"original": "I'm not sure it should be part of a COVID package, he said."}
{"original": "There are several stages that savvy credit card users go through when they find out that they can pay their taxes with a credit card. Their first reaction is usually one of delight. Paying taxes with a credit card can initially appear to create numerous opportunities ranging from interest free financing to earning rewards. But then the second stage arrives, when taxpayers realize that there will be considerable convenience fees from using a credit card to pay their taxes."}
{"original": "This fact will dash their hopes of getting a free loan or earning additional points, miles, or cash back at no additional cost. Ultimately, many taxpayers arrive at the third and final stage, where they realistically evaluate the true cost of paying taxes with a credit card, and figure out some scenarios where this can work in their favor."}
{"original": "How Much it Costs to Pay Taxes with a Credit Card"}
{"original": "The IRS authorizes several companies to accept tax payments on its behalf. This is appealing to consumers because an online tax payment is convenient; however, some money may be lost this way. A list of these companies, and the fees they charge can be found here. The fees range from 1.87% to 2.35% depending on the company and the type of credit card used. On the other hand, paying taxes with a debit card results in a flat fee of just $2.49 - $3.50 per payment."}
{"original": "The Advantages of Paying Taxes With a Credit Card"}
{"original": "First, there is the sheer convenience of paying taxes online. Taxpayers are spared the effort of writing out a check, addressing an envelope, purchasing a stamp, and mailing payment in. Paying with a credit card also produces an immediate confirmation, so taxpayers won't be concerned that their payment may be lost in the mail."}
{"original": "In addition, there are some situations where the rewards earned can exceed the cost of the convenience fees paid. For example, many cards offer a sign-up bonus that requires a minimum spending threshold be reached within a limited time period. If paying taxes with a credit card is the only way to reach that threshold and earn the bonus, than the fees paid may be worth it."}
{"original": "The Starwood Preferred Guest® Credit Card from American Express offers 25,000 Starpoints after you use your new card to make $3,000 in purchases within the first 3 months. But since spending $3,000 within six months may not be possible for some cardholders, making a significant tax payment on this card might be worth incurring $50 -$100 in order to earn the 25,000 Starpoints bonus, which is conservatively worth about $500."}
{"original": "The Barclaycard Arrival Plus™ World Elite MasterCard offers double miles for all purchases, and a 5% rebate on miles redeemed, for a combined total of 2.1% of rewards. Considering that the lowest fees are only 1.87%, cardholders can earn 0.23% net rewards on their tax payments."}
{"original": "Finally, cardholders can consider paying their taxes to receive 0% APR interest rates from a credit card that offers promotional financing. For example, the Citi Simplicity Card offers interest free financing on new purchases for a full 21 months-that's almost two years of interest-free payments. That can be well worth the convenience fees for some cardholders."}
{"original": "The Downsides of Paying Taxes With a Credit Card"}
{"original": "First, many credit cards will simply not offer rewards worth 1.87% to 2.35% of the total amount spent. But more importantly, taxpayers may be tempted to finance their tax bill using their credit cards at their standard interest rates. At these rates, typically 12 - 28% APR, interest charges will be rapidly incurred. For those who are already trapped in credit card debt, this can just put them further into debt."}
{"original": "Perhaps the biggest reason you shouldn't use high-interest rate credit cards as payment is because the IRS may have a better option. The IRS will allow taxpayers to set up installment plans at much lower interest rates than the typical credit card. And if it's just convenience that taxpayers are truly seeking, not financing or rewards, than their best option will be to pay their taxes using a debit card, absorbing the fee of approximately $2 to $3."}
{"original": "When taxpayers understand the true costs and benefits of using a credit card, they can then choose the best option for their needs."}
{"original": "In the face of a rapidly expanding global coronavirus pandemic that has already killed dozens and infected at least 1,200 within the United States, President Donald Trump delivered a strange Oval Office speech Wednesday in which he focused on banning travel from Europe, said nothing about the lack of available testing across the country, and ignored many crucial aspects of the public health crisis."}
{"original": "The president said he would ban noncitizens from traveling to the United States from Europe for 30 days amid the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the novel coronavirus now declared a pandemic. The ban will apply to anyone in the European Union's 26-country Schengen Area and those who have traveled there in the past 14 days. It begins Friday."}
{"original": "The president initially said all travel would be suspended from Europe but later clarified that the ban would exempt Americans, permanent residents and their families, although such travelers could be subject to additional screening at ports of entry. Trump also clarified, amid confusion over his remarks, that the ban did not apply to trade with Europe, only people."}
{"original": "Please remember, very important for all countries & businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe, he wrote on Twitter. The restriction stops people not goods."}
{"original": "Trump said he would soon enact a spate of economic measures meant to avert any lasting financial damage, instructing the Small Business Administration to provide aid to businesses affected by the virus. He said he would ask Congress to divert an additional $50 billion to the program and consider immediate payroll tax relief in an attempt to kickstart the economy."}
{"original": "This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and a world, Trump said. We are all in this together. We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship and unify together as one nation and one family."}
{"original": "He moved to place some blame on Europe for the spread of the virus there, touting his own efforts to ban travel from China."}
{"original": "Taking early, intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases in the virus than are now present in Europe, Trump said, using the term foreign virus for COVID-19. The European Union failed to take the same precautions. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded from [the region]."}
{"original": "Hours after Trump's speech, the U.S. State Department posted a travel advisory on its website recommending that citizens reconsider foreign travel due to the coronavirus pandemic and countries' response to it."}
{"original": "Many areas throughout the world are now experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and taking action that may limit traveler mobility, including quarantines and border restrictions, the advisory said."}
{"original": "The World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic on Wednesday as the agency said it had infected more than 113,000 people worldwide and killed more than 4,000. Infections in the U.S. continue to grow, prompting dramatic measures in some states with community outbreaks, including the closure of college campuses and some bans on large gatherings."}
{"original": "Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a news conference on Wednesday. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death."}
{"original": "Trump has so far declined to issue a national emergency declaration over the coronavirus outbreak. Democratic senators are preparing to ask the White House to do so, according to CNN, which would allow the government to use funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to assist local governments with the virus. But Politico reported Wednesday that the president is worried that doing so would stoke panic and impede the administration's efforts to bolster wild financial markets."}
{"original": "Wall Street plunged into a bear market as the outbreak was declared a pandemic, down nearly 20% since the stock market's high in February."}
{"original": "The president has repeatedly pushed back against criticism that his administration has been slow to respond to the outbreak. During a meeting with banking leaders on Wednesday, he dismissed a reporter's question on such concerns as fake news and declined to answer."}
{"original": "The president has also consistently downplayed the threat of the virus, rejecting assertions that there weren't enough kits for every American to get tested and comparing the death rate of the seasonal flu with the coronavirus in a way critics said was misleading to the public about its severity."}
{"original": "Trump didn't mention testing much on Wednesday but said health insurance companies had agreed to waive co-payments for coronavirus testing, but he said, apparently in error, that that change would also apply to treatments. A spokesperson for America's Health Insurance Plans, a major industry lobby, clarified to Politico that it had not agreed to waive co-payments for treatments but would for testing."}
{"original": "The president again suggested Wednesday that the threat of the virus could be overstated."}
{"original": "From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large-scale and very dangerous health threats, he said. This is the way it always was, and always will be. We are responding with great speed and professionalism."}
{"original": "Health officials have routinely pushed back against such assertions. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's leading infectious diseases expert, predicted Tuesday that the outbreak would only get worse before it got better."}
{"original": "We must be much more serious as a country about what we might expect, Fauci told House lawmakers this week. We cannot look at it and say, 'Well, there are only a couple of cases here, that's good.' Because a couple of cases today are going to be many, many cases tomorrow."}
{"original": "Others have been more stark. German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned her country that 2 in 3 Germans may become infected before the virus runs its course, saying it was important to follow government restrictions and take public health warnings to heart."}
{"original": "This is putting our solidarity, our common sense and our openheartedness for one another to the test, she said. I hope that we will pass it."}
{"original": "Former Vice President Joe Biden is pivoting to the left as he begins his general election campaign against President Donald Trump, promising to eliminate student debt for a huge portion of people making under $125,000 a year and lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60."}
{"original": "Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, announced both policy proposals in a Medium blog post on Thursday afternoon, arguing the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus epidemic made both moves necessary. But both shifts ― especially on student debt ― are designed to appeal to younger and left-leaning voters who were skeptical of his candidacy and instead supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the primary. Sanders ended his candidacy yesterday."}
{"original": "Recovery will require long term changes to build a more inclusive and more resilient middle class, and a greener and more resilient economy, Biden wrote. We have to think big — as big as the challenges we face. As we start to lay the groundwork for recovery, we have to build back better for the future."}
{"original": "Biden's campaign emphasized that both proposals fit within his long-standing goal to rebuild the American middle class, though it also acknowledged Sanders' influence."}
{"original": "Senator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and I'm proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis, Biden wrote."}
{"original": "As a political calculation, it shows Biden's campaign is confident about their standing with many suburban moderates who were swing voters in the past but have moved solidly into the Democratic Party during Trump's presidency, offended by his bullying demeanor and chaotic style. Many of these voters flocked to the polls in the final weeks of the Democratic primary, padding Biden's margins of victory over Sanders."}
{"original": "Instead, the Biden campaign is ― at least for the time being ― trying to improve its standing with younger voters, many of whom lean to the ideological left. Polling throughout the Democratic primary showed Sanders triumphing with young voters by massive margins, and early polling in the general election has shown Biden running weaker with younger voters than past Democratic nominees."}
{"original": "Lowering the eligibility age for Medicare traditionally performs well in public opinion surveys, while the popularity of proposals to eliminate student debt often depends on the details of the proposal and how the question is phrased."}
{"original": "Progressives and Democratic operatives focused on youth turnout have argued that Biden — who often criticized progressive priorities like single-payer health care during his primary run — would need to move on policy in order to win over voters who are skeptical of him. Sanders himself made a similar pronouncement during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Wednesday night."}
{"original": "I hope to be able to work with Joe in a more progressive direction. Joe is a good politician and he understands that in order to defeat Trump, he's going to have to bring new people into his political world, working people, young people, Sanders said."}
{"original": "He said he thought Biden was prepared to move in a progressive direction on a number of issues, including immigration, criminal justice reform and the cost of higher education. (Sanders notably did not mention health care.)"}
{"original": "Joe is not going to adopt my platform, Sanders acknowledged. But I think if he'll move in this direction, people will say, 'This is a guy that we should support.'"}
{"original": "A Sanders campaign aide, granted anonymity to discuss sensitive talks, said the conversation between Sanders and Biden's senior staffers was ongoing."}
{"original": "We understand that the Biden campaign is going through a process of trying to convince progressives that he stands with him … but it's safe to say he wouldn't be making these overtures without Bernie pushing, the Sanders aide said. This is the beginning of the process, not the end of the process."}
{"original": "The Sanders campaign warned not to expect an imminent endorsement of Biden."}
{"original": "Biden, who based his successful bid for the Democratic nomination on the importance of defeating Trump and returning to normalcy, had long resisted calls to eliminate student debt. He inched toward the position last month, adopting a proposal from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to forgive $10,000 worth of student debt per person as a part of immediate response to the coronavirus pandemic."}
{"original": "His new position ― totally eliminating student debt for those making under $125,000 a year who attended either a public college or a historically Black college ― goes further while still falling short of Sanders' proposal to eliminate all student debt, or Warren's proposal to eliminate it for 95% of borrowers. Biden would also phase out the benefit, to avoid a cliff for those who make above $125,000."}
{"original": "The number of people whose debt would be forgiven by Biden's plan is unclear, as is its total cost. But he proposes paying for the plan by eliminating a business losses tax cut included in the coronavirus stimulus package that Congress passed last month. That $170 billion cut was seen as a GOP giveaway to real estate investors."}
{"original": "Biden is also proposing expanding the federal health care program for seniors by lowering the Medicare age from 65 to 60, who would pay the same rate as any other Medicare beneficiaries. The proposal is notably different than some Medicare buy-in proposals widely endorsed by congressional Democrats, which usually have higher premiums for those under the age of 65 looking to join the Medicare system."}
{"original": "Democrats have long advocated for lowering the age for Medicare as many older Americans, at higher risk of health problems, struggle to gain secure employment, and face high average premium costs on the federal health insurance exchange."}
{"original": "Lowering the age for Medicare is a popular proposal across party lines. According to a January 2019 poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 77% of Americans supported allowing individuals between the ages of 50 and 65 to buy coverage through the program, including 69% of Republicans."}
{"original": "Biden's current health care platform expands the Affordable Care Act by creating a public option like Medicare that is open to all Americans, in addition to expanding the tax credits available for people on the exchanges. His plan would not reach universal coverage outright, but would get the country a lot closer to it."}
{"original": "While Biden credited the Sanders campaign in part for inspiring these changes to his campaign platform, they are a far cry from what the Vermont senator proposed on the campaign trail. Sanders endorsed a Medicare For All system that would move every American on to a single government-run health insurance program."}
{"original": "In March, Biden claimed to have adopted a Sanders proposal on tuition-free college for some in the run up to the final Democratic presidential debate, endorsing the compromise platform between Sanders and former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton from 2016 that would make public colleges and universities tuition-free for those from families with incomes under $125,000. Sanders said it was not enough."}
{"original": "It's great that Joe Biden is now supporting a position that was in the Democratic platform four years ago, Sanders responded in a statement in March. Now we have to go much further. We need to make all public universities, colleges and trade schools tuition-free for everyone like our high schools are. We need to cancel all student debt. And we can fund it with a small tax on Wall Street speculation."}
{"original": "The Sanders campaign said not to expect similar criticisms about the incremental nature of Biden's new proposal."}
{"original": "Like last time, this is a process that will take time, the Sanders aide said, referring to the negotiations that led up to Sanders' endorsement of Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Biden campaign will put out what they are comfortable with."}
{"original": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's first draft of a coronavirus relief bill included cash payments to most Americans ― except for those who earned no money at all."}
{"original": "The proposal set up the payments as advance tax rebates, and tax benefits typically exclude people with no incomes."}
{"original": "Then something unusual happened: Democrats complained about the income requirement ― no surprise ― but so did Republicans, arguing the poorest deserve coronavirus rebates too."}
{"original": "Just because they're on the lower end of the income scale doesn't mean they don't have some basic expenses, said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), for example."}
{"original": "And so the final bill had no income requirement. The legislation, signed into law less than a week ago, will allow just about every adult in the U.S. earning less than $75,000 (and every married couple earning less than $150,000) to be eligible for the full $1,200. People who've filed their taxes for 2018 or 2019 and set up direct deposit with the IRS should receive rebates in their bank accounts in the coming weeks. The rebates are worth $1,200 per adult and $500 per child."}
{"original": "The coronavirus recovery rebates may be the first tax-based social policy that will throw cash directly to the very poorest Americans with no condition other than having to file a tax return."}
{"original": "It's a quite significant development, said Bob Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal D.C. think tank. He noted that the last time Congress sent everybody a stimulus check, in 2008, it excluded people with no or very low earnings."}
{"original": "Another reason it's significant is that Republicans, not just Democrats, pushed to include the poorest, and that there are hints they're more willing to do so generally. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) co-sponsored a bill in December with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) that would change the Child Tax Credit to deliver cash to people with no incomes."}
{"original": "Looking at these two developments together gives me some hope that maybe we're at the beginning of a policy cycle where there could be a breakthrough, Greenstein said in an interview."}
{"original": "Tax benefits are a big part of the federal safety net. The Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit are two of the federal government's most important social programs, doling out thousands of dollars each to millions of households every year during tax filing season. Most other federal programs provide in-kind benefits for food, housing or health care, while the tax credits deliver actual cash."}
{"original": "But the benefits only go to households that are already making money. Democrats (and Greenstein himself) have defended earnings requirements as good politics, because Republicans would say people don't deserve the money and erode public support for the policy."}
{"original": "Matt Bruenig, founder of the People's Policy Project, an unabashedly left-wing think tank, has argued for years that the earnings requirements, which gradually phase in benefits as incomes rise, callously deny cash to people most in need."}
{"original": "There's been a sea change and everyone's seeing the phase-in with fresh eyes, Bruenig said. Here you've got a new program being proposed, with the same structure [as existing programs], and people see it and they're like, 'Oh, my God, it's just not right.'"}
{"original": "In recent years Democrats have increasingly pushed to eliminate earnings requirements for tax credits, including in bills that would set up advance monthly payments, essentially transforming the tax credits into universal child benefit programs (which are standard in other advanced countries). Party leaders have not yet embraced the idea, but the coronavirus pandemic could bring it more attention."}
{"original": "Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), for example, proposed giving everyone $2,000 on prepaid debit cards, then $1,000 per month until a year after the public health emergency subsides. Recurring payments had been a Democratic priority the party was unable to achieve in the bill that passed last week."}
{"original": "Tlaib's debit card idea highlights a problem with the tax rebates: Everybody beneath the income limits is eligible, but only if they file a tax return, which not everyone is required to do. Some 15 million households did not file a return in 2019, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. (It's possible to file online for free.)"}
{"original": "HuffPost readers: Are you filing a tax return so you can receive the recovery rebate? Tell us about it ― email arthur@huffpost.com. Please include your phone number if you're willing to be interviewed."}
{"original": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said more payments to individuals will be a priority for Democrats if Congress takes up another bill to respond to the pandemic fallout, and several Democrats who've pushed for big increases to existing tax credits echoed the sentiment."}
{"original": "If we pass additional measures to respond to an ongoing economic downturn, Congress has an opportunity to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit to help working families get further ahead, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said in a statement to HuffPost. Brown has been a leading sponsor of bills to make tax credits more generous and also to set up advance monthly payments."}
{"original": "The cash payments provision that passed last week was just one part of a broader bill that included higher unemployment benefits plus money for businesses, state governments and hospitals. It was the third piece of legislation Congress has passed in response to the outbreak, which has stalled the economy and killed more than 3,000 Americans."}
{"original": "Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), another advocate of more generous tax credits, said the next emergency package should make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable. Currently, the Child Tax Credit reduces someone's tax bill by $2,000 per child, but only the first $1,400 is refundable. If the full amount were refundable then people with no tax liability would be able to receive $2,000 per child as cash. Among the various proposals to expand tax credits, making the child tax credit refundable probably has the most support."}
{"original": "As the United States faces a public health pandemic and an economic downturn, our federal response must be focused on helping those in need, DeLauro said, adding that the Child Tax Credit amount should increase by $1,000."}
{"original": "Both the House and Senate adjourned after passing the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act last week. It's not clear how soon another piece of legislation could come together."}

{"original": "PHOENIX ― President Donald Trump kicked off a three-day string of rallies with a typically rambling, typically falsehood-strewn speech on Wednesday in a traditionally Republican state that he barely won four years ago."}
{"original": "We've done more than any administration in history, he told supporters during his 82-minute address, in which he veered from boasting of his accomplishments to insulting the Democratic candidates who were in the midst of a primary debate a few hundred miles north in Las Vegas. Millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our Republican Party."}
{"original": "While Trump often makes false assertions in official speeches, posts online, and off-the-cuff remarks to the media, his campaign rallies tend to deliver the largest number of falsehoods per unit of time, and Wednesday's event did not disappoint."}
{"original": "Trump claimed he had created the strongest economy ever — even though former President Barack Obama oversaw the creation of 1.5 million more jobs in his last three years as president than Trump has in his first three."}

{"original": "He claimed to have cut taxes by a record amount — even though former presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both signed larger tax cut bills."}
{"original": "On health care, Trump said, We're protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will — ignoring the fact that his administration is backing a lawsuit that would eliminate that protection and that he previously pushed a bill to repeal it."}

{"original": "David Bachman, who runs a group that aims to put more Christians in elected office, said it was Trump's critics and the news media who are dishonest, not the president. I love what Trump has done for this country, said Bachman, who is 70 and retired from his real estate and insurance businesses."}
{"original": "Leo Cote, an 18-year-old construction worker from Tucson who said he will cast his first presidential ballot for Trump this November, said Trump is only a bit dishonest. All politicians lie, Cote said. The whole political system is corrupt."}
{"original": "One woman wearing a Trump T-shirt and a Women for Trump button got so angry when HuffPost pointed out two of Trump's repeated falsehoods that she refused to participate in the interview further. This is why I hate the media, she said before walking away."}
{"original": "Trump won Arizona in 2016, but by a significantly smaller margin than previous Republican nominees, defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton by just 3.5 percentage points. In contrast, now-Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) beat Obama by 9 points in 2012, and the late Sen. John McCain won his home state by the same amount in 2008."}
{"original": "Democrats' ability to win the Senate seat vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake in the 2018 midterm election increased their optimism that they can defeat Trump this November and win the state's 11 electoral votes."}
{"original": "Trump is in the middle of a rare multi-day trip, and spent Tuesday and much of Wednesday in California raising money for his reelection campaign before coming to Phoenix. He'll hold campaign rallies in Colorado Springs on Thursday and Las Vegas on Friday before returning to the White House."}
{"original": "Moving into a place of your own for the first time is a huge step. I remember my first post-college apartment move. It was nothing special, but it was mine. It came with a few new challenges and responsibilities and all sorts of opportunities. For the first time, I was able to decide how to decorate an entire living area and turn a blank slate into a home."}
{"original": "Don't feel pressured to fill the home with furniture and decorations right away. Going overboard and overspending can put a dent in your budget. You'll want to choose your battles strategically and determine where to invest and when low-cost alternatives make the most sense."}
{"original": "Here's some advice for finding what you'll need on a budget and a few inexpensive ideas to make otherwise unimaginative rooms come to life."}
{"original": "Look for hand-me-down and used furniture. Furniture — tables, chairs, bookshelves etc. — often takes up the most space and can be the biggest drain on your budget."}
{"original": "Your first calls should be to friends, family members and friends of family members. They may have furniture that they want to get rid of and simply haven't had the time or energy to do so."}
{"original": "If you'd rather not go the hand-me-down route, some marketplace websites have free sections. The nonprofit Freecycle Network™ hosts message boards where you can find local people giving away their unwanted belongings. Particularly if you live near a university, you could find lots of great deals around the end of a term."}
{"original": "You can also find used furniture from a variety of places. Consignment stores, flea markets, estate and garage sales and buy-sell-trade social media groups may be filled with high-quality pieces. There are even startups creating online marketplaces specifically for furniture, although they're generally limited to large cities."}
{"original": "Second-hand furniture also presents an opportunity. You can sand and paint or stain solid-wood furniture, giving it a new life and ensuring it'll match the room. Couches or chairs can be made to fit your personal style with a new slipcover."}
{"original": "Before buying furniture, you may want to use online floor plan software to create a mockup of your home. You can see what fits where and get a sense for how adding something to a room will affect the space."}
{"original": "Get your kitchen in order. Many kitchen essentials, such as silverware, can also be found for cheap at second-hand stores. However, if you're looking for a matching set you might have a better chance at a garage or estate sale."}
{"original": "When buying new, you can save money by shopping at discount stores and online clearance sites that specialize in offering name-brand products for reduced prices."}
{"original": "Avid cooks wanting to invest in a few kitchen appliances might consider waiting until large seasonal sales to make these purchase. For instance, standing mixers, slow cookers and other small appliances often go on sale every Black Friday."}
{"original": "Brighten up the place. While your apartment may come with overhead lighting, a few standing lamps and reading lights can set a much nicer mood. The good news is lamps often sit in the corner and won't necessarily show a lot of wear and tear. In other words, this is another great buy-used opportunity. You may want to start with a very basic placeholder while continuing your search for a low-priced replacement."}
{"original": "Don't shop second-hand for everything. There are a few things you don't want to buy used: towels and bedding. Add mattresses to that list as well if you'll be looking for a new one."}
{"original": "When it comes to sheets, ultra-high thread counts could be more of a marketing gimmick than an indicator of quality. Try to focus on how the fabric feels, find a weave that you like and you might be pleasantly surprised by the low-cost options at big box retailers. The same texture test works for towels as its often a matter of personal preference."}
{"original": "Purchasing a new mattress can take a big chunk of your budget. At retail shops, some people put as much effort into negotiating the sale price as they would when buying a used car – and for the most expensive mattresses the same amount of money could be on the line. Consider one of the new online mattress retailers that sell high-quality goods for less. Buying a mattress without testing it first may seem weird, but many offer free returns within the first few months."}
{"original": "Add a few personal touches. You've got the necessities covered, but how do you turn a generic apartment into a place that feels like home? Think walls, windows and floors."}
{"original": "Often you can't paint a wall if you're renting. Even when you can, you may have to repaint it before moving or lose part of your security deposit. Decide whether it's worth the time and money, as an accent wall in your kitchen or bedroom could be a lot of fun."}
{"original": "Go with a cheaper (and easier) route by opting for removable wall decals or wallpaper. There are all sorts of shapes, designs, prints and even adhesive chalkboards for under $20. You could also order paper, canvas or metal prints of your favorite photographs."}
{"original": "Windows can also get a cover-up treatment. Rather than spending a lot of money on brand new blinds, you can opt for curtains that add color or a pattern to your room. Whether they're closed and keeping the light out or open and framing your window, it's a great opportunity to personalize a room."}
{"original": "An area rug can help tie a room together, but they can also be prohibitively expensive. This is another item that you might not want to buy used unless you know the seller. Luckily, home good stores and some big box retailers usually have at least a few inexpensive options."}
{"original": "Congratulations on the move. Outfitting a new apartment doesn't happen overnight. Especially if this is the first time you get to pick what to buy, it can take time to find your style and items to match. However, even with a limited budget, there's a lot you can do to make a space your own."}

{"original": "The Obama administration has made considerable progress over the past eight years to make our tax code fairer. This week, the Treasury Department is building on that progress through proposed new rules closing a loophole that allows some wealthy families to avoid paying their fair share in estate taxes."}
{"original": "A Massachusetts state legislator emailing with a citizen concerned about new gas pipelines surreptitiously shared those emails with a lobbyist who runs a fossil-fuel front group advocating for more pipelines, according to the messages that HuffPost obtained."}
{"original": "The constituent wrote to state Rep. Steve Howitt (R) to express concern that a pending climate change bill could actually pave the way for a tax to fund new pipelines in Massachusetts and allow the state to treat natural gas as clean energy. Howitt thanked the constituent, and the two exchanged follow-up emails about specific language in the bill."}
{"original": "But the emails indicate that Howitt also blind-carbon-copied another person ― William Ryan, a veteran lobbyist who owns the Boston-based firm Pilgrim Strategies and was recently hired to run the newly formed Mass Coalition for Sustainable Energy."}
{"original": "As HuffPost revealed last month, the coalition is in truth an astroturf group with funding from Canadian pipeline giant Enbridge and gas-based utilities Eversource and National Grid ― all of which are currently trying to expand the regional Algonquin Pipeline. Ryan also consults for Enbridge on its Atlantic Bridge Project, another pipeline upgrade in the area."}
{"original": "Ryan appears to have accidentally outed himself on the thread by replying all, using the same email address he has previously used to register as a lobbyist with the state. Perfect response to her, Steve, he wrote, adding a link to a study that he said really does a good job if [sic] explaining the power problem we have and how problematic the inadequate supply of natural gas is to our region."}
{"original": "When the constituent inquired about the additional person copied on the email, Howitt tried to cover by suggesting that the other individual was a government official. Wanted to forward your concerns up the ladder, Howitt wrote."}
{"original": "When the correspondent pressed further about who had been added to the conversation, Howitt replied, My liasons [sic] within the government agencies are for reps and senators only to address constituent concerns and assist or provide information."}
{"original": "The legislator did not respond to further inquiries from the constituent."}
{"original": "Many citizens in Howitt's Bristol County district, in the southeastern part of the state, are concerned about the Algonquin Pipeline expansion, which would include a new compressor station. Although the project ― a joint endeavor among Enbridge, Eversource and National Grid ― was shelved last year, the companies are trying to revive it."}
{"original": "The constituent who was writing to Howitt declined to speak with HuffPost other than to confirm the authenticity of the email thread, which the individual had shared with other concerned citizens and activists in the area. One of them was Alice Arena, an activist from the town of Weymouth fighting against the Atlantic Bridge Project."}
{"original": "I am appalled to learn that a lobbyist is overseeing conversations between an elected representative and a constituent, she said. While we are aware that the gas industry lobbyists are given free rein in legislative offices, it is quite another thing to see a representative asking the lobbyist how to respond to the legitimate concerns of his voters."}
{"original": "Neither Howitt nor Ryan responded to several requests for comment."}
{"original": "On the other side is political economy planning, which is to change a feature or features of the social-political environment to produce a certain movement of actors. Creating certain programs and offering benefits to something or someone is political economy planning. Firstly, a policymaker must ensure that they understand the social-political environment of their country, for each country is similar to different types of terrains. There are your actors, an established belief system, political structure, and so on. Once the terrain is understood, they must evaluate what they want to add to the terrain and what it may cause to the terrain and other terrains. There are many examples of this in The United States of America: the H-1B Visa program, the federal visa program, EB-5, and the recent move of General Electric (GE) to Boston. The H-1B program was designed to fulfill job shortages in specialized industries and it attracted numerous employees; whereas, the EB-5 attracted foreign investors by exchanging an investment in property for a fast track to a green card. Then GE was attracted to Boston because of their employees' preferences and the tax relief package it had received for relocating to Boston. But, despite the usefulness of political economy, it has it limits for it can increase investment too much to make a city unaffordable or it can place foreign workers into a tough living situation. The cost of political economy is what it does to a terrain, as previously described."}
{"original": "The importance of knowing both sets of tools available to policymakers can ensure that one is aware of what may be a result of certain decisions that is taken by government. In addition, this is helpful for policymakers to understand that an effective policy deals with all tools, and not solely one. A policymaker that uses economic planning and political economy planning will be able to ensure that his or her policy can be more effective because it allows one to try to manipulate certain outcomes by using history as a guidebook."}
{"original": "Just days after the House passed its version of the federal tax law slashing corporate tax rates, House Speaker Paul Ryan collected nearly $500,000 in campaign contributions from billionaire energy mogul Charles Koch and his wife, according to a recent campaign donor report."}
{"original": "Koch and his brother David spent millions of dollars to get the tax law passed and are spending millions more in a public relations campaign in an attempt to boost support for the law, The Wall Street Journal reported."}
{"original": "Koch Industries, one of the largest private corporations in the nation, operates refineries and manufactures a variety of products. The new tax law — which slices corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 21 percent, slashes estate taxes and includes a special deduction for oil and gas investors — is expected to save the Koch brothers and their businesses billions of dollars in taxes."}
{"original": "Just 13 days after the tax law was passed, Charles Koch and his wife, Elizabeth, donated nearly $500,000 to Ryan's joint fundraising committee, according to a campaign finance report filed Thursday."}
{"original": "Five other donors, including billionaire businessmen Jeffery Hildebrand and William Parfet, each contributed $100,000 in the last quarter of 2017, according to the records."}
{"original": "It looks like House Speaker Ryan is quickly being rewarded for passing this legislation that overwhelmingly benefits the Kochs and billionaires like them, Adam Smith, spokesman for campaign finance reform nonprofit Every Voice, told the International Business Times, which first reported the Koch contributions."}
{"original": "The Koch donations were paid into Team Ryan, which raises money for the speaker, the National Republican Congressional Committee and a PAC run by Ryan. On the same day, Charles and Elizabeth Koch also each donated $237,000 to the NRCC."}
{"original": "The Koch brothers, worth an estimated $100 billion together, have become the gorillas of dark money contributions distorting American democracy since the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC, which opened the door to unlimited campaign contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals to outside groups. The brothers are using their massive wealth to push a political agenda that's the most hard-line libertarian philosophy in America, according to Jane Mayer, author of Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right."}
{"original": "Ryan reportedly has indicated to confidants that he won't run again when his term is up this year, according to Politico, though he hasn't made an official announcement. If he doesn't run, his contributions would be redirected."}

{"original": "Belén Sisa recently did what many Americans are doing this time of the year: she paid her taxes. But when she posted a selfie with her tax form, it went viral."}
{"original": "That's because the Arizona State University junior is an undocumented Dreamer. Sisa and her parents visited the United States from Argentina when she was 6 and overstayed their visas, according to USA Today."}
{"original": "The 23-year-old is currently a DACA recipient, which means she's shielded from deportation thanks to the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The program also allows undocumented immigrants to apply for work authorization and a Social Security number."}
{"original": "When Sisa posted a photo of her Form 1040 on Sunday morning, she wrote a caption explaining her undocumented status to bust the myth that undocumented immigrants don't pay taxes and benefit from government aid."}
{"original": "I, an undocumented immigrant, just filed my taxes and PAID $300 to the state of Arizona, she wrote in the caption. I cannot receive financial aid from the state or federal government for school, I cannot benefit from unemployment, a reduced healthcare plan, or a retirement fund. I think I'm a pretty good citizen."}
{"original": "Sisa also noted there were many more undocumented immigrants like her who pay taxes into a system they will never receive anything from. In 2014, the chief actuary at the Social Security Administration told Vice News that undocumented immigrants have paid about $100 billion into Social Security since 2004."}

{"original": "Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), a leading progressive in the House, disappointed some liberal activists by endorsing a left-leaning senator's challenger this past week."}
{"original": "Pocan, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, announced that he is backing Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), who is challenging veteran lawmaker Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), the Senate's leading champion of a Green New Deal."}
{"original": "Markey's collaboration with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on the original Green New Deal resolution has earned him the support of Ocasio-Cortez and left-leaning Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), as well as backing from Sunrise Movement, the youth-led climate group."}
{"original": "Kennedy's bid to unseat Markey is the unusual contest where a somewhat more moderate Democrat is trying to unseat a progressive stalwart."}
{"original": "But on Tuesday, Pocan — along with former CPC co-chair Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and 16 other House Democrats — announced that they were endorsing Kennedy, shocking progressive activists in Markey's corner."}
{"original": "As a proud, progressive voice in Washington, Joe has been a tireless champion for social and economic justice, Pocan said in a statement. From fighting for mental health parity, to protecting the rights of transgender Americans and advocating for a more inclusive economy, Joe offers the moral clarity and energized leadership that our country and party need today more than ever before."}
{"original": "In an accompanying statement, Grijalva focused on Kennedy's ability to build coalitions and unite his colleagues behind progressive causes."}

{"original": "Progressives should endorse progressives, said Julian NoiseCat, vice president of policy and strategy at the think tank Data for Progress. It's not complicated. If we want power we have to stick out for our own."}
{"original": "Markey going out and working with Ocasio-Cortez was an incredible act of leadership, said Evan Weber, a political strategist at the Sunrise Movement. If he doesn't win his primary, the right-wing narrative will be that it's because he supported the Green New Deal."}
{"original": "He added that the move undermines Pocan's own support of the Green New Deal."}
{"original": "In addition to climate change, Markey is a seasoned expert in telecommunications policy. He has become Senate Democrats' top spokesman for reinstating net neutrality rules. Among other things, those rules — which the Trump administration discarded — forbid internet service providers from providing internet at different speeds based on what content creators pay them."}
{"original": "Activists have been closely watching where lawmakers are choosing to endorse challengers to incumbents in the 2020 election, encouraging sitting legislators to stand up for progressive allies and jump in where it can count. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) drew criticism in December for his refusal, thus far, to endorse immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, a primary challenger in Texas backed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ocasio-Cortez and the left-wing Justice Democrats."}

{"original": "In an interview with HuffPost, Pocan disputed the idea that Kennedy is a centrist, noting that Kennedy has a 97% score on the left-leaning congressional voting scorecard site Progressive Punch, while Markey's is 99%. (Scorecards are inherently limited, and Progressive Punch gives Markey a higher rating than Sanders.)"}
{"original": "Part of Kennedy's appeal is his family pedigree (he is a grandson of New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and grand-nephew of former President John F. Kennedy), and the money and attention it can bring."}
{"original": "When Joe Kennedy supports something it gets lots of attention because he's Joe Kennedy ― far more than when Ed Markey gets his name behind something, Pocan said, adding that Kennedy is also a passionate speaker. He does a very good job of relating to the public."}
{"original": "Alex Wong/Getty Images Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) unveils the Green New Deal resolution alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) in Feb. 2019."}

{"original": "If people want to debate that you're saying 'six' instead of 'half a dozen,' I think that's a pretty silly debate, Pocan said."}
{"original": "In fact, Kennedy, a member of the CPC, is a solid progressive by national standards. His campaign notes that he both rejected corporate PAC money and got behind marijuana legalization sooner than Markey."}
{"original": "Both Markey and Kennedy have endorsed Warren for president. And though Markey voted to authorize the Iraq War in 2002, he and Kennedy both voted against the bipartisan 2019 defense spending bill, which omitted legal restrictions on the Trump administration's ability to escalate the crisis with Iran."}
{"original": "Broadly speaking, Kennedy is personally close to House Democratic leadership, a proximity evident in his selection to deliver the official response to President Donald Trump's state of the union address in January 2018."}
{"original": "Markey, by contrast, has sought to more explicitly ally himself with the ascendant grassroots left. In speeches, he has begun cheekily arguing that if the oil and gas industry's tax subsidies amount to socialism, then the U.S. should give renewable energy sources some of that socialism."}
{"original": "The two candidates' divergent approaches to a race for district attorney in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, which includes Boston, are also revealing."}
{"original": "Markey declined to endorse a candidate in the primary. Kennedy did not formally endorse his friend Greg Henning, the centrist candidate, but campaigned with him the day before the primary vote."}
{"original": "Rachael Rollins, who defeated Henning and three others in the tight September 2018 race, is one of the most progressive prosecutors in the country. Rollins endorsed Markey's reelection in October."}
{"original": "There is also apparent concern that an expensive Senate primary, which will last until September, will prevent progressives from devoting their resources to competitive state legislature primaries and hotly contested federal contests in neighboring Maine and New Hampshire."}
{"original": "Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.) is able to generate money and attention partly due to his pedigree. But Kennedy's boosters say he is a talented speaker and deal-maker as well."}
{"original": "A lot of people in Massachusetts, even if they like primary challenges in general, are irritated with the idea of a very drawn out, expensive primary battle, said Jonathan Cohn, chair of the elections committee of Progressive Massachusetts, a statewide left-wing group, which has yet to endorse in the Senate race."}
{"original": "The left's most specific knock on Kennedy is likely his refusal to join the House's single-payer health care bill until March 2019. Markey, who is a co-sponsor of Sanders' Senate bill, has backed single-payer legislation since 2009, when he was in the House."}
{"original": "I don't know [Kennedy] as pushing the ball forward on issues and I know on something like single payer there was a lot of organizing that it took to get him to that position, Cohn said. The question for Massachusetts voters is: Who is it easier to push?"}
{"original": "When announcing his support for Medicare for All in February 2019, Kennedy maintained ― and Pocan affirmed to HuffPost ― that his objections to previous iterations of the bill were on progressive grounds. He was concerned that, prior to improvements in the new legislation, the bill did not cover long-term care and did not strike down the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funds from being used to cover abortions."}
{"original": "Joe is proud of his progressive record and deeply grateful for the support of leaders like Rep. Pocan and Rep. Grijalva, said Kennedy campaign spokeswoman Emily Kaufman."}
{"original": "Kennedy has been endorsed by three local progressive elected officials: Boston City Councilor Matt O'Malley; Berkshire County District Attorney Andrea Harrington; and Brookline Select Board Member Raul Fernandez, who was endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez, a former college student of his."}
{"original": "Brian Snyder / Reuters Kennedy and Markey attend a speech by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in Boston on Dec. 31. Both men have endorsed her White House bid."}
{"original": "In his interview with HuffPost, Pocan also admitted that the endorsement is partly based on his strong personal relationship with Kennedy, who entered Congress in 2013, the same year Pocan did."}
{"original": "That some members of Congress prioritize personal relationships over policy and ideology is a sore point with progressives. For example, activists were dismayed when then-Rep. Beto O'Rourke decided not to endorse the Democrat who was challenging his friend, Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas), in a close race."}
{"original": "Pocan is choosing friendship over progressive alliances and it's sad to see from the CPC head, said an aide to a progressive House Democrat, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter."}
{"original": "Then there's the matter of Pocan endorsing Kennedy just two days before announcing his support Bernie Sanders' presidential race, which struck even unaligned progressives as dissonant."}
{"original": "Bernie and Kennedy is a weird pairing, said a progressive strategist, who declined to be named because their organization has not endorsed in the race."}
{"original": "Pocan said he endorsed Kennedy months ago privately and the campaign chose to announce it when it did for its own reasons. He said he has no plans to campaign for Kennedy, but is due to hit the trail for Sanders."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Pocan has not announced his support for any of the progressive primary challengers taking on conservative House incumbents. He backed nonprofit executive Marie Newman's bid against abortion rights opponent Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.) in 2018, but has yet to weigh in on her rematch run this cycle. He has also stayed out of Cisneros' race against Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), a longtime gun regulations opponent who approved of Trump's assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani."}

{"original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Monday rolled out a plan under which the federal government would make child care and pre-kindergarten available to all American families, with no tuition or fees."}
{"original": "The Sanders plan, which campaign officials provided to reporters over the weekend, is the latest major proposal on early childhood to come from a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. And with a projected budget of $1.5 trillion over 10 years, the Sanders plan may also be the biggest."}
{"original": "Child care has gotten more attention than ever in this presidential campaign, in part because so many families are struggling to find it. Child care can cost more than college tuition in some parts of the country, while even well-off families can struggle to find providers that offer safe, quality care."}
{"original": "Sen Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced a sweeping child care plan more than a year ago, while former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg rolled out his proposal in December."}
{"original": "Sanders has his own extensive record of advocacy on this issue. He has long backed universal child care in principle, invoking the idea in his stump speeches and debate performances. But this new proposal represents the first time he has sketched out exactly how he would like to see such a program work in practice."}
{"original": "Under the Sanders plan, the federal government would provide that $1.5 trillion to states, who in turn would create and maintain their own networks of child care centers that meet federal standards on adult-to-child ratios and other quality measures."}
{"original": "The assumption is that most states would start by financing and expanding the child care services that are already available, whether through small, independent providers or larger ones affiliated with organizations like the YMCA. Home-based providers could also be part of the program."}
{"original": "But the Sanders plan also includes funding to underwrite the construction of new facilities, especially when it comes to increasing capacity for pre-kindergarten ― that is, for kids in the year or two before kindergarten starts ― on the theory that states will frequently choose to do so through their public school systems."}
{"original": "Indeed, a major theme of the Sanders proposal is to treat child care as an extension of public education."}
{"original": "That means, among other things, focusing on raising qualifications and pay for the adults who care for children. Following a phase-in period, child care providers would have to meet the same training standards they do for the federal Head Start program, in which, for example, all lead preschool teachers must have a bachelor's degree in early childhood education or some related field."}
{"original": "In return, the program envisions paying child care providers more like public school teachers by requiring that they make a living wage. Although the plan does not specify what that means, it's bound to be a lot higher than existing wages, which are about $12 an hour or roughly the median wage for retail cashiers. Those low wages make it difficult to attract or retain the most talented workers."}
{"original": "The other way the Sanders plan treats child care like public education is by making it free at the point of service. It would be open to all families, regardless of income, at no direct cost to them."}
{"original": "This is also the most conspicuous difference between the plan from Sanders and the plans from other Democrats, especially Warren."}
{"original": "Child care has become something of a signature issue for Warren. She emphasizes her plan in campaign appearances, frequently referencing her own experiences as a working mother who struggled to find care for her kids."}
{"original": "But while the Warren and Sanders plans have a lot in common, including the emphasis on quality, hers would guarantee free child care only for families with incomes of up to twice the poverty line, which works out to about $52,000 a year for a family of four."}
{"original": "For families making more than that, child care would require fees, albeit on a sliding scale pegged to income and with a guarantee that no family would have to pay more than 7% of its income on child care."}
{"original": "This is the same basic approach in the Buttigieg plan and on Capitol Hill, in legislation introduced by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.)."}
{"original": "That decision to make child care free for all, rather than free for just lower income families, reflects Sanders' long-standing commitment to full universality ― the idea that programs are most resilient, most equitable and, ultimately, most effective when they are available to all people under the same conditions."}
{"original": "But that decision also means the federal government would have to spend more money on the program. And that money would have to come from somewhere."}
{"original": "The Sanders campaign says that it can finance the entire initiative by using money from its proposed wealth tax that it has not yet allocated for other purposes. It also points out that investments in early childhood can pay off over the long run, because, according to a large body of research, kids who get high quality care tend to be healthier and more successful later in life."}
{"original": "During this very month last year, aluminum smelters across the United States were closing, one after another. It was as if they produced something useless, not a commodity crucial to everything from beverage cans to fighter jets."}
{"original": "In January of 2016, Alcoa closed its Wenatchee Works in Washington State, costing 428 workers their jobs, sending 428 families into panic, slashing tax revenue counted on by the town of Wenatchee and the school district and devastating local businesses that no longer saw customers from the region's highest-paying manufacturer."}
{"original": "That same month, Alcoa announced it would permanently close its Warrick Operations in Evansville, Ind., then the largest smelter in the country, employing 600 workers, within three months."}
{"original": "Worker at Alcoa's Warrick smelter in Evansville, Ind., before it closed in 2016. Photo by Steven Dietz, Sharp Image Studios, Pittsburgh."}
{"original": "Then, Noranda Aluminum fell. It laid off more than half of the 850 workers at its New Madrid, Mo., smelter in January, filed for bankruptcy in February and closed in March. The smelter was a family-supporting employer in a low-income region, and when it stopped operating, the New Madrid County School District didn't get tax payments it was expecting."}
{"original": "This devastation to workers, families, communities and corporations occurred even after Ormet had shuttered a smelter in Ohio in 2013, destroying 700 jobs, and Alcoa announced in 2015 that Massena East, in New York, closed since 2014, would never reopen, costing 332 jobs."}
{"original": "It all happened as demand for aluminum in the United States increased."}
{"original": "That doesn't make sense until China's role in this disaster is explained."}
{"original": "That role is the reason the Obama administration filed a complaint against China with the World Trade Organization (WTO) last week. In this case, the president must ignore the old adage about speaking softly. To preserve a vital American manufacturing capability against predatory conduct by a foreign power, the administration must speak loudly and carry a big aluminum bat."}
{"original": "The bottom line is this: American corporations and American workers can compete with any counterpart in the world and win. But when the contest is with a country itself, defeat is virtually assured."}
{"original": "In the case of aluminum, U.S. companies and workers are up against the entire country of China. That is because China is providing its aluminum industry with cheap loans from state-controlled banks and artificially low prices for critical manufacturing components and materials such as electricity, coal and alumina."}
{"original": "By doing that, China is subsidizing its aluminum industry. And that is fine if China wants to use its revenues to support its aluminum manufacturing or sustain employment – as long as all of the aluminum is sold within China. When state-subsidized products are sold overseas, they distort free market pricing. And that's why they're banned."}
{"original": "China agreed not to subsidize exports in order to get access to the WTO. But it has routinely and unabashedly flouted the rules on products ranging from tires to paper to steel to aluminum that it dumps on the American market, resulting in closed U.S. factories, killed U.S. jobs and bleak U.S. communities."}
{"original": "Worker at Alcoa's Warrick Operations in Evansville, Ind., before the smelter closed in 2016. Photo by Steven Dietz, Sharp Image Studios, Pittsburgh."}
{"original": "In 2000, China produced about 11 percent of the aluminum on the global market. That figure is now 50 percent. A big part of the reason is that China quadrupled its capacity to produce aluminum from 2007 to 2015, and increased its production by 154 percent."}
{"original": "When China threw all of that extra, cheap, state-subsidized aluminum on the global market, it depressed prices. In that eight-year period, the price sank approximately 46 percent."}
{"original": "To compete, American smelters tried cutting costs and getting better deals on electricity. But even as U.S. demand increased, U.S. production declined 37 percent. And capacity decreased 46 percent."}
{"original": "What capacity decrease means is closed plants. The number of smelters dropped from 14 in 2011 to five last year, with only one operating at full volume."}
{"original": "Many of these manufacturing workers, thrown out of their jobs by what is clearly unfair trade, saw President-elect Donald Trump as a champion. Donald Trump said he would hold China to account on trade. He promised he would impose massive tariffs on goods imported from China. He said he would confront Beijing on currency manipulation, a practice that makes Chinese goods artificially cheap."}
{"original": "Many of those manufacturing workers voted for Donald Trump. Monroe County, Ohio, is a good example. That was the home of the Ormet smelter. The workers, who belonged to my union, the United Steelworkers, and the company asked Ohio Gov. John Kasich in 2012 and 2013 to intervene with the utility to get lower rates to help Ormet survive."}
{"original": "Kasich refused. The smelter closed. Monroe County's unemployment rate now is the highest in Ohio at 9 percent, nearly twice the national rate."}
{"original": "Monroe County voters didn't forget. Theirs was among the counties in Ohio that went for Donald Trump in the Republican primary. Though Trump didn't win the Ohio primary, he got 35.9 percent in the crowded GOP field, and he took virtually all of the places in Ohio that, like Monroe, would say Kasich and other politicians turned their backs on them."}
{"original": "President-elect Trump carried 29 of Ohio's Appalachian counties in the primary, those described as geographically isolated and economically depressed. These are counties that, like Monroe, lost family-supporting jobs in steel, manufacturing or mining. For the workers who haven't left, the jobs that remain, in retail and fast food, don't pay much, don't provide benefits and aren't secure."}
{"original": "When Donald Trump came to town talking tough about China, that sounded a hell of a lot better to those workers than their governor telling them he wouldn't help with electrical rates – especially after they watched the governor in New York work a deal to save an Alcoa smelter and 600 jobs for 3 years in Massena."}
{"original": "And, of course, Donald Trump won Ohio in the General Election."}
{"original": "Workers across America, from Sebree, Ky., and Mt. Holly, S.C., where Century smelters are threatened to Wenatchee, Wash., where Alcoa has held out the possibility that the smelter could be restarted, were galvanized to support Donald Trump by his promises to confront China on its predatory trade practices. If he fulfills those pledges, he will have the back of the blue-collar workers who had his."}

{"original": "Democrats aren't done with Donald Trump yet."}
{"original": "Trump escaped his four years in Washington without disclosing his tax returns, as most modern presidents do, and Democrats failed to pry the returns free with a lawsuit."}
{"original": "But the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over taxes, plans to renew its efforts to get the now-ex-president's returns."}
{"original": "Ways and Means will continue to pursue its case for Trump's taxes as part of its effort to oversee the mandatory annual audit of both the president and vice president, committee spokeswoman Erin Hatch told HuffPost in a statement."}
{"original": "Federal law says the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, is supposed to hand over any tax return document that tax policy committees on Capitol Hill request. Congress gave itself this power in a 1924 law designed to expose corruption in the executive branch."}
{"original": "The IRS has audited the president and vice president every year since Richard Nixon got caught underpaying his taxes ― and he got caught partly thanks to IRS disclosures to Congress under the 1924 law."}
{"original": "Trump has long bragged about his ability to avoid taxes. The New York Times, which has obtained copies of his returns, exposed his use of sketchy write-offs and a battle with the IRS over a questionable $72 million refund."}
{"original": "But Trump's Treasury Department, under Steven Mnuchin, simply refused to comply with the disclosure law. The committee followed its request with a subpoena, which was also denied, and then a lawsuit. The lawsuit has been bottled up by U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump campaign donor and 2017 appointee. He has refused to hear the merits of the case until higher courts rule on Trump's other refusals to comply with congressional oversight."}
{"original": "The Ways and Means Committee plans to renew its formal request for Trump's taxes as well as its subpoena, the committee spokesperson said, and does not anticipate any interruption in our case."}
{"original": "Drew Angerer via Getty Images Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.) and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) attend a news conference in September 2020. Congressional Democrats are renewing efforts to obtain copies of former President Donald Trump's tax returns."}
{"original": "It's not clear what happens next, as there is not much precedent for the situation. It's not even clear why the court case would need to continue, since Joe Biden is now president and has nominated a new treasury secretary, former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen."}
{"original": "Theoretically, Democrats could renew their request for Trump's taxes, and Yellen's IRS would simply hand them over."}
{"original": "Trump's personal lawyers have anticipated this possibility, and on Tuesday asked McFadden to hold a hearing on whether the parties involved could hold off on disclosing Trump's taxes before McFadden reaches a decision on the merits of the case, which he has resisted doing. McFadden set a hearing for Friday."}
{"original": "Ways and Means probably has to play along with the judge instead of getting the returns straight from the Biden administration, said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center."}
{"original": "Now that the issue has been raised to McFadden, it may be bad faith for them to sidestep McFadden, Rosenthal said."}
{"original": "But Ways and Means isn't the only committee that can ask the IRS for somebody's tax information. The Senate Finance Committee, which the Democrats now control, has the same power. And the Senate has nothing to do with the case before McFadden."}
{"original": "Incoming finance chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) could make his own request for Trump's taxes under tax code section 6103. In an interview Tuesday, Wyden said he backs the House's approach."}
{"original": "The House has put a lot of time into this, Wyden said. I'm going to work with them."}
{"original": "But Wyden didn't rule out sending his own request to the Treasury Department."}
{"original": "The American people deserve to know what the president and vice president are paying and what they owe, Wyden said. Now that I'm the chairman, we're going to look at all the tools to make sure the public knows that."}
{"original": "Big Brother does just wants to help – in Estonia, at least. In this small nation of 1.3 million people, citizens have overcome fears of an Orwellian dystopia with ubiquitous surveillance to become a highly digital society."}
{"original": "The government took nearly all its services online in 2003 with the e-Estonia State Portal. The country's innovative digital governance was not the result of a carefully crafted master plan, it was a pragmatic and cost-efficient response to budget limitations."}
{"original": "It helped that citizens trusted their politicians after Estonia regained independence in 1991. And, in turn, politicians trusted the country's engineers, who had no commitment to legacy hardware or software systems, to build something new."}
{"original": "This proved to be a winning formula that can now benefit all the European countries."}
{"original": "With its digital governance, Estonia introduced the once-only principle, mandating that the state is not allowed to ask citizens for the same information twice."}
{"original": "In other words, if you give your address or a family member's name to the census bureau, the health insurance provider will not later ask you for it again. No department of any government agency can make citizens repeat information already stored in their database or that of some other agency."}
{"original": "Tech-savvy former prime minister and current Vice President of the European Commission Andrus Ansip oversaw the transformation."}
{"original": "The once-only principle has been such a big success that, based on Estonia's common-sense innovation, the EU enacted a digital Once Only Principle and Initiative early this year. It ensures that citizens and businesses supply certain standard information only once, because public administration offices take action to internally share this data, so that no additional burden falls on citizens and businesses."}
{"original": "In Estonia, citizens and businesses supply certain standard information only once through a digital portal. Priit Koppel, CC BY-SA"}
{"original": "Asking for information only once is an efficient strategy to follow, and several countries have started to implement this principle (including Poland and Austria)."}
{"original": "But this by itself does not address the fact that merely asking for information can still be a bother to citizens and business. The once-only principle does not guarantee that the collected data was necessary to request, nor that it will be used to its full potential."}
{"original": "Governments should always be brainstorming, asking themselves, for example, if one government agency needs this information, who else might benefit from it? And beyond need, what insights could we glean from this data?"}
{"original": "Financier Vernon Hill introduced an interesting One to Say YES, Two to Say NO rule when founding Metro Bank UK: It takes only one person to make a yes decision, but it requires two people to say no. If you're going to turn away business, you need a second check for that."}
{"original": "Imagine how simple and powerful a policy it would be if governments learnt this lesson. What if every bit of information collected from citizens or businesses had to be used for two purposes (at least!) or by two agencies in order to merit requesting it?"}
{"original": "The Estonian Tax and Customs Board is, perhaps unexpectedly given the reputation of tax offices, an example of the potential for such a paradigm shift. In 2014, it launched a new strategy to address tax fraud, requiring every business transaction of over €1,000 to be declared monthly by the entities involved."}
{"original": "To minimise the administrative burden of this, the government introduced an application-programming interface that allows information to be automatically exchanged between the company's accounting software and the state's tax system."}
{"original": "Though there was some negative push back in the media at the beginning by companies and former president Toomas Hendrik Ilves even vetoed the initial version of the act, the system was a spectacular success. Estonia surpassed its original estimate of €30 million in reduced tax fraud by more than twice."}
{"original": "Latvia, Spain, Belgium, Romania, Hungary and several others have taken a similar path for controlling and detecting tax fraud. But analysing this data beyond fraud is where the real potential is hidden."}
{"original": "Big data, analytics and predictive models will play the main role in the next wave of e-government innovation. For example, if single-transaction information puzzle pieces are put together to form a map of the broader national business context, it might be possible to understand the kind of complex interdependencies between companies visualised below."}
{"original": "Example of complex network of business transaction data, collected by Estonian Tax Office from 2014."}
{"original": "But this also raises an interesting question: could a national government use this same digital tracking system to glean insights about the economy's health and general economic trends?"}
{"original": "Visualization of interdependencies between sectors in Estonia."}
{"original": "The Estonian Tax and Customs Board seems to be moving in this direction. Its 2020 Strategic Plan (in Estonian here) demonstrates a shift in mindset, from tasking itself solely with controlling and punishing people to envisioning giving advice to taxpayers."}
{"original": "Might tax offices be transformed into management consultancy-type agencies that advise companies on how to capture growth in related sectors, mitigate risk from peers' bankruptcies or improve profits – all based on analysis of the vast amount of data it has collected?"}
{"original": "Currently, dozens of people collect, analyse and clean such data about the business sector, but it's possible this job could be done automatically using tax data. In this scenario, taxes could be considered a service fee paid in exchange for valuable business insights."}
{"original": "The key problem with Estonia's great idea is privacy. It's easy to imagine that giving industry-specific advice (or advice spanning several industries) based on business-transaction data might break the trust of the companies being monitored."}
{"original": "Indeed, one of the core founding principles of OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy is that data should only be used for the purpose stated and not for any other reasons. So-called purpose limitation has since made its way into most modern data protection acts, including to EU data protection rules."}
{"original": "But as the ask information only once, but use at least twice idea demonstrates, data not only can and should be used for more than its original purpose, it should never be processed solely for a single aim. Some legal experts agree, stipulating that within carefully balanced limits data may be used for purposes beyond its original intent."}
{"original": "An innovative, visionary tax office that serves, rather than controls, society's business sector is a big ask. But if any country can do it, e-Estonia can."}

Previously, he served as a White House liaison at the Department of Housing and Urban Development."}
{"original": "Bacon's new role reportedly comes amid a far-reaching campaign by Trump to purge staffers who are disloyal. Bacon will work under 29-year-old John McEntee, who was recently rehired to replace Sean Doocey as head of the personnel office."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration says individuals and businesses will be allowed to delay paying their 2019 tax bills for 90 days past the usual April 15 deadline. The extension announced Tuesday is an effort to inject up to $300 billion into the economy at a time when the coronavirus appears on the verge of causing a recession."}
{"original": "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said individuals will be able to delay paying up to $1 million in payments. Corporations will be able to defer payment on up to $10 million."}
{"original": "Taxpayers will still have to file their tax returns by the April 15 deadline. But they won't have to pay their tax bill for 90 additional days. During that time, individuals and corporations will not be subject to interest or penalty payments."}
{"original": "All you have to do is file your taxes, Mnuchin said."}
{"original": "The Treasury secretary said President Donald Trump had approved the final details of the program, including its expansion to include the potential of allowing taxpayers to keep $300 billion in the economy for now. Last week, Mnuchin had estimated that deferred payments would amount to $200 billion."}
{"original": "Mnuchin had said the delay would apply to all but the super rich but did not spell out how the payment delay will work. The IRS has yet to release specific guidelines for the program."}
{"original": "The IRS is using authority under Trump's national emergency declaration to take the step of approving the 90-day payment delay. Mnuchin encouraged taxpayers to keep filing their returns because many of them will be receiving refunds that they will be able to use to pay bills during the economic downturn."}
{"original": "As of Feb. 21, the IRS had issued more than 37.4 million refunds averaging $3,125."}
{"original": "Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said that the tax delay program was only a stop-gap program but that it should help cushion the economy during a period of severe stress."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump unveiled a $4.8 trillion election year budget plan on Monday that recycles deep, previously rejected cuts to domestic programs like food stamps, Medicaid, and housing as the recipe for wrestling the federal budget back into balance."}
{"original": "Trump's fiscal 2021 plan promises the government's deficit will crest above $1 trillion only for the current budget year before steadily decreasing to more manageable levels, but only by relying on optimistic economic projections, dramatically scaled-back military operations overseas, and proposed cuts to agency budgets that run directly opposite to two previous budget deals signed by Trump."}
{"original": "The budget sets the course for a future of continued American dominance and prosperity, Trump said in a message accompanying the document."}
{"original": "There is optimism that was not here before 63 million Americans asked me to work for them and drain the swamp, Trump said. For decades, Washington elites told us that Americans had no choice but to accept stagnation, decay, and decline. We proved them wrong. Our economy is strong once more. In a White House appearance, Trump said, "}
{"original": "The plan had no chance even before Trump's impeachment scorched Washington. Its cuts to food stamps, farm subsidies, subsidized housing for the poor, Medicaid and student loans couldn't pass when Republicans controlled Congress, much less now with liberal House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., setting the agenda."}
{"original": "Trump's budget follows a familiar formula that exempts seniors from politically toxic cuts to Medicare and Social Security while targeting benefit safety net programs for the poor, domestic programs like clean energy and student loan subsidies. It again proposes to dramatically slash funding for overseas military operations to save $567 billion over 10 years but adds $1.5 trillion over the same time frame to make his 2017 tax cuts permanent law."}
{"original": "Trump's proposal would cut $465 billion from Medicare providers such as hospitals, which prompted howls from Democrats such as former Vice President Joe Biden, who said it eviscerates Medicare, while top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York said Trump is planning to rip away health care from millions of Americans with cuts to Medicare and the Medicaid health program for the poor."}
{"original": "Trump's GOP allies generally issued only faint praise if commenting at all. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., called it just a list of suggestions while top House Budget Committee Republican Steve Womack of Arkansas took aim at its rosy predictions of economic growth and lower interest rates, both of which help Trump's budget add up."}
{"original": "Trump's budget would also shred last year's hard-won budget deal between the White House and Pelosi by imposing an immediate 5% cut to non-defense agency budgets passed by Congress. Slashing cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and taking about $900 billion out of Medicaid over a decade are also nonstarters on Capitol Hill, but both the White House and Democrats are hopeful of progress this spring on prescription drug prices."}
{"original": "The Trump budget is a blueprint written under Washington rules as if he could enact it without congressional approval. It relies on rosy economic projections of 2.8% economic growth this year and 3% over the long term — in addition to fanciful claims of future cuts to domestic programs — to show that it is possible to bend the deficit curve in the right direction."}
{"original": "The economy grew by 2.1% last year and Congress spent much of the past decade reversing agency spending cuts imposed by a failed 2011 budget pact."}
{"original": "That sleight of hand enables Trump to promise to whittle down a $1.08 trillion budget deficit for the ongoing budget year and a $966 billion deficit gap in the 2021 fiscal year starting Oct. 1 to $261 billion in 2030. Balance would come in 15 years."}
{"original": "The reality is that no one — Trump, the Democratic-controlled House or the GOP-held Senate — has any interest in tackling a chronic budget gap that forces the government to borrow 22 cents of every dollar it spends. The White House plan proposes $4.4 trillion in spending cuts over the coming decade."}
{"original": "Trump's reelection campaign, meanwhile, is focused on the economy and the historically low jobless rate while ignoring the government's red ink."}
{"original": "Ever since his days as a presidential candidate, Trump has been promising a health care plan. The budget repeats that promise but offers few details. It lays out a health reform vision that calls for better care at lower cost and protecting people with preexisting medical conditions."}
{"original": "Trump has also signed two broader budget deals worked out by Democrats and Republicans to get rid of spending cuts left over from a failed 2011 budget accord. The result has been eye-popping spending levels for defense — to about $750 billion this year — and significant gains for domestic programs favored by Democrats. Trump's new budget essentially freezes defense at current levels while proposing a 3% military pay hike."}
{"original": "The White House hasn't done much to draw attention to this year's budget release, though Trump has revealed initiatives of interest to key 2020 battleground states, such as an increase to $250 million to restore Florida's Everglades and a move to finally abandon a multibillion-dollar, never-used nuclear waste dump that's political poison in Nevada."}
{"original": "The Trump budget also promises a $3 billion increase — to $25 billion — for NASA in hopes of returning astronauts to the moon and on to Mars. It touts a beefed-up, 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure proposal, but $800 billion of that comes through existing surface transportation programs. It contains a modest parental leave plan championed by first daughter Ivanka Trump and includes $135 billion in savings over the coming decade as part of an unspecified set-aside to tackle the high cost of prescription drugs this year."}
{"original": "Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall would receive a $2 billion appropriation, more than provided by Congress but less than the $8 billion requested last year. Trump has enough wall money on hand to build 1000 miles (1,600 kilometers) of wall, a senior administration official said, most of it obtained by exploiting his budget transfer powers. The official requested anonymity to discuss the budget before it is made public."}
{"original": "The reduced wall request could ease the way for action on appropriations bills in the GOP-held Senate, where a fight over last year's far larger wall request stalled work on the annual spending bills for months."}
{"original": "Trump has proposed modest adjustments to eligibility for Social Security disability benefits, and he's proposed cuts to Medicare providers such as hospitals, but the real cost driver of Medicare and Social Security is the ongoing retirement surge of the baby boom generation and health care costs that continue to outpace inflation."}
{"original": "With Medicare and Social Security largely off the table, Trump has instead focused on Medicaid, which provides care to more than 70 million poor and disabled people. President Barack Obama successfully expanded Medicaid when passing the Affordable Care Act a decade ago, but Trump has endorsed GOP plans — they failed spectacularly in the Senate two years ago — to dramatically curb the program."}
{"original": "Indeed, Trump's proposed cuts to Medicaid and subsidies for so-called Obamacare health insurance policies total almost $1 trillion over 10 years, according to calculations by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, whose president, Robert Greenstein, called the Trump plan stunningly harsh."}
{"original": "Trump would also revive a plan, rejected by lawmakers in the past, to cut food stamp costs by providing much of the benefit as food shipments instead of cash. He's also proposing work requirements for safety net programs like Medicaid, food stamps, and federally subsidized housing."}
{"original": "Other cuts, outlined in an annual Major Savings and Reforms volume that's ignored every year, include eliminating heating subsidies for the poor and $405 million worth of grants to boost community service work by senior citizens, along with plans to dramatically slash legal aid to the poor, the National Endowment for the Arts, and subsidies to states such as California saddled with high costs for jailing criminal migrants who enter the country illegally."}
{"original": "Three years ago, Matt DeRienzo surveyed America's journalism landscape and issued a dire warning that most reporters didn't want or need to hear."}
{"original": "The last recession was brutal for newspapers and local news, wrote DeRienzo, who at the time was the director for a nonprofit organization that supported local online news outlets. The next one could be an extinction-level event."}
{"original": "The next one is here now, thanks to the economic crunch brought about by the novel coronavirus outbreak. The sudden shock has clobbered an industry that had already lost nearly 30,000 jobs ― roughly a quarter of its reporters ― over the last decade, as its advertising-based revenue model proved anachronistic in the age of the internet. City- and statewide lockdowns have further reduced revenues, even as readership soars, so each day now brings news of another round of layoffs, furloughs or pay cuts from somewhere in the beleaguered industry."}
{"original": "It's even worse than I thought it'd be, DeRienzo said last week, because no one predicted this."}
{"original": "The scale and speed of the economic crisis has inspired journalists to turn to an unlikely source for help: Congress. The News Media Alliance, one of the newspaper industry's top trade groups, and the NewsGuild, journalism's biggest labor union, have each called on Congress for emergency stimulus assistance to prevent layoffs and keep journalists working and news outlets in business amid the crisis. This week, a dozen U.S. senators said a future stimulus package should include support for local news outlets."}
{"original": "Talk of government assistance may seem like a third rail for an industry that prides itself on its independence, but even a one-time infusion of cash isn't likely to alter the media's long-term fortunes. This crisis, University of Pennsylvania media studies professor Victor Pickard argues, is an opportunity to overhaul the entire structure of the news industry, and it requires a much more dramatic response: a massive public investment that creates a permanent source of financial support and ensures the future of local news."}
{"original": "There is no market option here. There's no commercial solution, said Pickard, the author of Democracy Without Journalism? The recently released book calls for wholesale reform of the media industry. We're going to need to think bigger and bolder for the long-term. The government will have to intervene, and I think we'll need something much bigger than what's being discussed thus far."}
{"original": "Jeff Greenberg via Getty Images The newsroom of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which laid off all but 14 reporters in early April."}
{"original": "Pickard has called for the creation of a public journalism trust fund, supported by tax revenue, that permanently bolsters the business and supports the most basic coverage."}
{"original": "The fund, in his eyes, would pay for the sort of local coverage ― of public affairs, politics, communities of color and the increasing swaths of the country that now have no local news ― that the market has proven it won't."}
{"original": "Call it a public option for news ― and while it may sound radical, Pickard argues that neither the industry nor American democracy have much of a choice but to create it."}
{"original": "It's either that, or we're just going to write off entire communities across the states as having absolutely no access to any news or information whatsoever, Pickard said. It's a very stark choice we have to make as a society. And I think our democracy depends on it."}
{"original": "The idea of the sort of news industry bailout the News Alliance and NewsGuild have called for isn't unprecedented. Last year, the Canadian government created a $600 million relief fund meant to revive the country's struggling newspaper industry, and similar ideas have been proposed in various European countries."}
{"original": "The Canadian effort has come under intense criticism. Its biggest skeptics, many of whom are journalists, have blasted the plan as an affront to journalistic independence and a threat to the media's integrity, especially at a time when trust is already falling."}
{"original": "The perception of lack of independence is absolutely crippling, said Jen Gerson, a Canadian freelance journalist who opposed the bailout plan. In a time where we're shoring up our credibility and making sure people have faith that they can trust the information coming from us, taking a media bailout is absolutely fatal to those efforts."}
{"original": "Any bailout plan would likely run into even bigger problems in the U.S., where trust in the media is much lower, and where perceptions of bias are much stronger, in part because of the GOP's multidecade effort to undermine the media. Direct government support would almost certainly be seen, by journalists and non-journalists alike, as an unseemly affair that critics of the media and government would weaponize as a waste of money and a conflict of interest."}
{"original": "Over the last decade, more than 1,400 communities have lost access to local news, and America today is home to a growing number of so-called 'news deserts' where people cannot access reliable information."}
{"original": "A public trust fund, though, would fall more in line with the government's long history of investments into and subsidized support for local and national news — a commitment that goes beyond just the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. The U.S. Postal Service was founded primarily to help disseminate news and information to American citizens, and for most of its history, it has delivered newspapers and periodicals for free or at heavily subsidized rates. Television and radio news are transmitted via public airwaves licensed freely to private companies. The largest source of news and information today ― the internet ― was created, in part, by government researchers."}
{"original": "Media subsidies, Pickard argued, are as American as apple pie."}
{"original": "The idea behind the government's long-standing support for news, as Ben Franklin and George Washington argued three centuries ago, is that the free flow of information is vital to any healthy democracy. Today, despite the rise of the internet and its democratization of information, the collapse of the news industry has once again thrust the United States into a news crisis that this outbreak has only exacerbated."}
{"original": "Over the last decade, more than 1,400 communities have lost access to local news, and America today is home to a growing number of so-called news deserts where people cannot access reliable information."}
{"original": "In 2003, there were more than 500 newspaper reporters covering statehouses; by 2014, the number had dwindled to fewer than 300, according to Pew. The study, the last of its scope, found that less than a third of newspapers and less than 15% of local TV stations had a full-time statehouse reporter. The industry decline has only worsened since, and the coverage of mayors, city councils, state and local budgets and agencies has further evaporated in the last six years."}
{"original": "States and localities without robust local news outlets become more corrupt and more likely to abuse public funding, studies have suggested, so the erosion of local journalism has ruined its ability to hold power to account, threatened its credibility and weakened democracy. More Americans now rely on social media than print newspapers for their news, which has no doubt weakened the quality of the information they're getting while also making them more susceptible to blatant disinformation."}
{"original": "News outlets have traditionally relied on advertising revenue to fund their journalism, but that model has fallen apart over the last three decades, as both news and advertising have shifted to the internet. Digital advertising now outpaces TV and print spending, but the wealth isn't well dispersed: Facebook and Google have become a duopoly that soaks up more than 60% of the $100 billion (and growing) spent on digital advertising each year."}
{"original": "That has further crippled news outlets, and the duopoly's role in hastening the destruction of local news has caught the eye of regulators in Congress."}
{"original": "In 2019, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline (D) introduced legislation that would give local newspapers the ability to collectively negotiate advertising rates with the two companies, in an effort to improve their finances. The bill, which has bipartisan support, was always meant as a temporary step meant to stop the bleeding and give us an opportunity to develop a more long-term, sustainable solution, Cicilline said."}
{"original": "We absolutely have to do more to create the ability of local news to survive, and I think you're seeing the consequences of it in a global pandemic, Cicilline said."}
{"original": "Fifty-seven percent of the nearly 2,500 counties that have reported a COVID-19 case do not have a daily newspaper, according to The Brookings Institution, which also said that 37% of those counties had lost their local newspaper between 2004 and 2019. That is making it harder for many rural and other vulnerable populations to access critical information: More than 500 news outlets that serve American Indian communities have disappeared in the last three decades, Brookings said."}
{"original": "Bigger plans could come out of an antitrust investigation into the tech giants that's taking place in the House, Cicilline said, but he's also wary of a total bailout."}
{"original": "We cannot do anything that would in any way undermine the integrity and independence of the media, and I worry that if there is government assistance, in terms of money, you begin to blur those lines, Cicilline said. I can imagine you can try to construct something, but you'd have to be careful. … If there was a way to do it, I'd certainly be open to it."}
{"original": "AFP Contributor via Getty Images The British Broadcasting Corporation, or BBC, is funded by taxpayers in the United Kingdom. The United States spends considerably less on public media each year than many European democracies do."}
{"original": "In a perfect world, I would like to see that happen, said John Stanton, who co-founded the Save Journalism Project after he was laid off from BuzzFeed in 2019. (Laura Bassett, who co-founded the Save Journalism Project with Stanton, is a former HuffPost reporter who was laid off the same year.)"}
{"original": "But we don't live in that world, Stanton said. I find it difficult to imagine Congress passing any kind of legislation that actually gives money to the news industry that does not somehow come with a lot of weird, terrible strings [attached]."}
{"original": "The Save Journalism Project has urged Congress to break Facebook and Google's death grip on ad revenue, and Stanton reiterated that it would behoove lawmakers to act on that front immediately in order to help local news outlets on the other side of this crisis. (Facebook has committed $100 million in assistance to local news outlets amid the crisis, with $25 million devoted to grants and the rest to advertising. It's a drop in the bucket, Stanton said.)"}
{"original": "Journalists and lawmakers are right to fear that public funding would lead to government interference in the news, and any bailout plan or public journalism fund would need robust safeguards to ensure aid isn't politicized or controlled by political leaders."}
{"original": "But media publishers are already subject to forms of interference and control that they have little ability to counteract. The arbitrary and hardly altruistic whims of Facebook and Google's algorithms have sent news outlets on a goose chase for years, giving them more say in how we produce, shape and package content than actual journalists have. Other funding models have similar pitfalls, be they the impulses of billionaire benefactors, influential advertisers, or the hand of the market, which isn't invisible to anyone who's spent time in a newsroom."}
{"original": "Overt government support, left unchecked, might compromise the industry, but a purely capitalistic approach has already rendered us incapable of producing the coverage necessary for even a basic level of public accountability."}
{"original": "Pickard's vision is that the public journalism fund, armed with money generated through new taxes on Facebook and Google's advertising revenues, would produce or heavily subsidize nuts-and-bolts coverage of state houses and city councils, public agencies and local lawmakers. It could operate like the taxpayer-funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting, overseen by independent actors and accountable to local communities and journalists themselves."}
{"original": "Public funding in order to subsidize vital coverage doesn't have to turn news outlets into state-controlled operations. PBS and NPR, along with its local affiliates, are beacons of accountability journalism, and such funding is common in the Nordic countries ― Norway spends more than 100 times annually per citizen than the U.S. on public media ― that rank among the healthiest democracies on the planet."}
{"original": "Even direct subsidies to already-existing media outlets could increase accountability and trust if structured correctly, with the sort of oversight journalists and the public can demand of a government body but not of the market."}
{"original": "That's a challenge for the legislators, said Rosental Alves, a journalism professor at the University of Texas and the creator of the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas. But you can create a line of subsidies where there are no strings attached in terms of how the media will behave vis-a-vis the government or political factions."}
{"original": "The fatal flaw of the Canadian bailout plan isn't the ethics or perception of it, but its design: The majority of its money, critics have warned, will likely flow to the country's largest media outlets ― the very same companies that we know are dying, and have not been able to convert their model into anything economically viable, Gerson said. The entire structure of the bailout was designed to benefit legacy media at the expense of startups and the types of innovative new organizations that could have benefited from it otherwise."}
{"original": "The United States' legacy giants may be even less worthy of public money."}
{"original": "Over the last two decades, large conglomerates have swallowed up the local news business whole, with little regard for the actual journalism that's supposed to be the core function of the business. Gannett and GateHouse, two such giants, merged in 2019, and took control of one of every six newspapers in the United States. They pitched their partnership as a way to streamline overlapping costs and immediately said they'd be targeting inefficiencies ― the clearest signal that the private equity backers behind the deal were really in charge, and stood to benefit most from the suffering of the journalists they now employ."}
{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Gannett's merger with GateHouse put one of every six U.S. newspapers under the control of a company that has repeatedly cut jobs nationwide amid financial struggles."}
{"original": "Companies like Gannett-GateHouse and Alden Global Capital, a hedge fund that has scooped up newspapers in order to promptly destroy them, aren't the future, and while thousands of quality journalists still work at their papers and need help, bailing out the investors looking to squeeze the last few pennies of profit out of a dying business model while laying off even more reporters won't get us any closer to healthy journalism or a well-functioning society. (DeRienzo, who now works for the Local Media Association, a trade organization for local publications, believes one result of the current crisis will be a hastened move away from corporate consolidation, anyway.)"}
{"original": "Although Pickard envisions a truly public version of local news, the government could also find ways to bolster outlets that are taking innovative approaches to the craft, and trying to fill in the gaps companies like Gannett have already created and that Facebook and Google continue to widen."}
{"original": "The consolidation of the last 20 years, along with improved quality of and access to the internet, has sparked incredible innovation, on the national, regional, local and hyperlocal levels."}
{"original": "Nonprofit journalism has been a particular success story, with outlets like ProPublica and the Texas Tribune serving as shining (and award-winning) examples. Philanthropic efforts like the American Journalism Project and Report for America have sought to build off those models in other locales."}
{"original": "A growing number of hyperlocal and regional outlets have popped up too. In Chicago, the nonprofit City Bureau has provided coverage of the South Side and a largely Black population that more established media outlets have long ignored. Lyndsey Gilpin, a North Carolina-based journalist, started Southerly Magazine three years ago as a newsletter. Today, it's a promising startup that pays freelancers and partners with local news outlets to cover environmental issues across the South."}
{"original": "Inspired by projects like High Country News, which covers the mountain west, and Scalawag, another Southern-focused outlet, Gilpin has funded her project through grants and crowdfunded donations, and has done well enough that in February, she finally took a modest salary for the first time."}
{"original": "I've been throwing more things at the wall and seeing what sticks, Gilpin told HuffPost, offering a condensed version of what the entire media industry has been doing for a long time now."}
{"original": "The coronavirus crisis has proven that there is incredible demand for reliable and informative news, especially of the local variety. The number of people throwing things at the wall, and the amount that's starting to stick, is enough to inspire at least some hope for the future, even if the immediate outlook is dire."}
{"original": "But we need even more of them, on an even bigger scale, if we don't want the dark times to last too long, or for this to end with a news industry captured by cynical publishers using papers to launder their interests to the public."}

{"original": "The DMV has driven one man to do something extraordinary."}
{"original": "On Dec. 11, Nick Stafford pushed five wheelbarrows full of loose coins into Department of Motor Vehicles in Lebanon, Virginia, according to a statement he made on his company's website."}
{"original": "Stafford, who has been fighting with DMV for months, decided to pay $2,987.14 in taxes on his car with 298,745 pennies. The facility's automated coin-counting machine couldn't handle the load, and employees were forced to count the 1,548 pounds of change by hand. Stafford said that he arrived at the DMV at 9 a.m. Wednesday and staff was not done counting the pennies until early Thursday morning, the BBC reports."}
{"original": "The whole thing stemmed from a longstanding grudge against the department."}
{"original": "You may ask, why go though all this trouble? Stafford wrote on his website. In 2016 I paid nearly $300,000 just in state and federal income taxes and I have zero tolerance for any government employee refusing to follow the laws of the Commonwealth, that's why."}
{"original": "In September, Stafford tried to call his local DMV to ask what he calls a 30 second question about where to register his car and pay the sales tax, since he owns multiple houses in the area."}
{"original": "The phone number listed online put him on hold for over an hour. A direct line to the Lebanon DMV wasn't listed online, so he made a Freedom of Information Act request for the number, which he was given."}
{"original": "When Stafford called, the person who answered told him he wasn't allowed to call that number and hung up on him. He called the same number repeatedly until he finally had his question answered. Yet, to prove a point he called the number again and requested the private, unlisted numbers of nine other DMV offices in Virginia."}
{"original": "The Lebanon DMV refused, so Stafford took them to court."}
{"original": "If they were going to inconvenience me then I was going to inconvenience them, he told the Bristol Herald Courier."}
{"original": "Stafford dropped $165 to file three lawsuits in Russell County General District Court. One lawsuit was against the Lebanon DMV itself, and two were against specific employees."}
{"original": "On Dec. 10, a judge dismissed all the lawsuits when Stafford was provided all the phone numbers in court by a representative from the state's attorney general."}
{"original": "Stafford has posted all of these numbers on his website."}
{"original": "I think the backbone to our republic and our democracy is open government and transparency in government and it shocks me that a lot of people don't know the power of FOIA, Stafford told the Herald Courier."}
{"original": "Less than 24 hours later, he collected hundreds of rolls of pennies to pay his taxes at the DMV. He then hired 11 people at $10 an hour to help him break open the rolled coins. It took them four hours to do this, costing Stafford $440. He then bought the five wheelbarrows, which cost him another $400. All in all, Stafford spent $1,005 to get 10 phone numbers and drop off a bunch of pennies at the DMV."}
{"original": "Not to mention the $2,987.14 he had to pay in taxes, which he happily brought to the DMV on Wednesday morning."}
{"original": "The DMV had to accept his form of payment because the US Coinage Act of 1965 says that coins are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes and dues."}
{"original": "According to Stafford, the employees at the DMV did not cause a fuss."}
{"original": "The DMV employees are being very respectful and accommodating considering the situation, he wrote on his website."}
{"original": "The congressional stalemate over another fiscal package aimed at providing relief to those struggling from the coronavirus pandemic dragged into another week as both sides dug in and accused each other of stalling critical aid to millions of Americans."}
{"original": "Top Democrats reiterated that more funding was needed beyond aid to small businesses, including money for hospitals, states and local governments, as well as food assistance to low-income individuals and families."}
{"original": "We have real problems facing this country, and it's time for the Republicans to quit the political posturing by proposing bills they know will not pass either chamber and get serious and work with us towards a solution, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a joint statement on Monday."}

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)"}
{"original": "Republicans, meanwhile, continued to insist over the weekend that Congress should move quickly to approve funding only to the small business Paycheck Protection Program, which they warned would soon run out of money as early as this week. Congress included the program in its $2 trillion stimulus bill it passed two weeks ago as a way to ensure people remain employed."}
{"original": "This crucial program needs funding now. American workers cannot be used as political hostages, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Saturday."}
{"original": "Congress initially allocated $350 billion for the program, making it a bigger part of the coronavirus relief bill than expanded unemployment benefits or direct payments to households. The program essentially pays two months of payroll expenses through loans that are forgiven if a company avoids big layoffs or pay cuts."}
{"original": "The Small Business Administration, which runs that program with Treasury's backing, said Monday morning that more than 880,000 applications had been approved, with loan amounts collectively totaling approximately $217 billion."}
{"original": "Approved loan applications, however, are not the same as actual loans, and many entrepreneurs are waiting anxiously for the money, which is supposed to be distributed by banks."}
{"original": "Jake Braun, owner of a digital marketing firm with seven employees in St. Petersburg, Florida, said he is still waiting for his loan. His company has long had a checking account with Bank of America, but Braun wound up applying through a regional lender because when the program first launched, Bank of America restricted applications to existing customers with multiple accounts. The bank has since changed its policy, but Braun said he went with a smaller bank because he feared big banks would funnel all the money to their bigger customers."}
{"original": "Braun is optimistic about the loan, but he's still waiting."}
{"original": "I'm just nervous that something with the SBA prevents it from going through, Braun said."}
{"original": "This crucial program needs funding now. American workers cannot be used as political hostages. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)"}
{"original": "In their letter, Pelosi and Schumer said the program needs new rules, since many eligible small businesses continue to be excluded from the Paycheck Protection Program by big banks with significant lending capacity."}
{"original": "Another problem is that Congress hasn't said whether payroll expenses covered by the loans are tax-deductible like they normally would be. The law states that the forgivable loans won't count as income, but if the payroll expenses aren't deductible, it would diminish the value of the program."}
{"original": "A big reason why Congress is struggling to reach a deal on additional coronavirus relief is because any quick action requires unanimous consent. Both chambers are technically on recess and are not expected to return to vote until April 20 at the earliest, but lawmakers say that date is optimistic."}
{"original": "Democrats last week blocked McConnell's unanimous consent request to pass additional funding for the small business loan program only, and Republicans blocked a Democratic request to pass additional funding for hospitals and states in addition to small businesses."}
{"original": "Schumer said last week that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had agreed to pursue bipartisan talks on an interim spending package that included aid to small businesses. But Republicans and the White House pushed back on that characterization."}
{"original": "The Senate gaveled in and out of a pro forma session in just seconds on Monday with no business being conducted. The next session is scheduled for Thursday."}
{"original": "The partisan wrangling over what was supposed to be a quick way to boost relief to those struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic does not bode well for prospects of a deal on another so-called phase four congressional aid package. Democrats have said they'd like to see broader measures in the next bill like expanded vote-by-mail to ensure voters can safely participate in the November presidential election. But Republicans are fiercely opposed to mandating voting reforms on all states, setting up a big fight in the coming weeks."}
{"original": "Earlier this month, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced on Twitter that the federal income tax filing deadline for 2020 would be pushed to July 15. That means you have an extra three months to prepare your return for tax year 2019.

{"original": "If you have a complicated tax situation or owe money on last year's taxes, that's great news. But it doesn't necessarily mean you can kick back and forget about it until summer. Though the federal filing deadline was pushed back, not all states have moved their filing deadlines to the same date, and you may still need to pay other taxes ― like property taxes ― at the usual time."}
{"original": "Filing or paying your taxes late could result in penalties and interest, so read on to find out when you need to have your state tax returns done."}
{"original": "Though most states have followed the federal government's lead and extended their deadlines to July 15, not all have. Most notably, New Jersey still has a deadline of April 15. Other states have extended the deadline, but to a date that falls before or after July 15."}
{"original": "Below is a list of states and their tax filing deadlines, which TurboTax continues to update as new information is available."}
{"original": "Virginia: May 1, with interest and penalties waived until June 1"}
{"original": "Have Quarterly Estimated Payments Been Delayed?"}
{"original": "Freelancers, contractors and other self-employed individuals who are required to pay quarterly estimated taxes are in luck ― sort of. The April 15 deadline to pay first-quarter (Jan. 1 to March 31) federal taxes has been extended as well. You now have until July 15 to make that payment. However, the June 15 deadline for second-quarter (April 1 to May 31) estimated taxes is still in place, according to Alan Goldenberg, a principal at the accounting firm Friedman LLP."}
{"original": "And as with yearly tax returns, Goldenberg noted that not all states have extended their deadlines for first-quarter estimated taxes, while others have pushed both first- and second-quarter deadlines. If you normally make estimated quarterly payments, check to see how your state is handling them for tax year 2019."}
{"original": "The deadline to pay property taxes generally doesn't coincide with the deadline for income taxes. And as of now, state property tax deadlines are intact, though some states have said they will waive late fees and interest up to a certain date."}
{"original": "But some counties across the U.S. ― such as Pierce County in Washington and Miami-Dade County in Florida ― have extended due dates for property taxes to be paid by individuals. It's worth checking to see if the usual deadline to pay property taxes in your county has been pushed later, though it's unlikely."}
{"original": "Should You Wait To File Taxes?"}
{"original": "In most cases, you have extra time to file taxes this year. However, Mnuchin advised filing as soon as possible, especially if you qualify for a refund."}
{"original": "I encourage all taxpayers who may have tax refunds to file now to get your money. — Steven Mnuchin (@stevenmnuchin1) March 20, 2020"}
{"original": "Not only will you get your money faster by filing right away, but it's recommended you do so to thwart scammers who file fraudulent tax returns on behalf of taxpayers who haven't filed yet in the hopes of stealing their refunds."}
{"original": "With the holidays over and the leftovers gone, its time to deal with the outcome of all that shopping and gift giving -- the bills. In the midst of the season it's easy to forget how expensive it can be, but when January rolls around, credit card bills are there to remind you. It can be even worse if you've already been racking up expenses and debt. In some instances, you may need to take serious steps to get out of debt. One of the options you might consider is debt settlement."}
{"original": "Simply put, debt settlement is the process of paying your creditors less than what you owe and having the entire debt erased off the books. But as easy as this may sound, accomplishing it can be complicated and difficult, and can have long-lasting implications."}
{"original": "If you're going to have a hard time paying your bills, you should reach out to any debt settlement company you owe funds to before you become six months delinquent on the bill. If you don't contact a debt settlement agent before this time, the company that holds the debt will generally write it off. This can have serious repercussions on your credit score."}
{"original": "A debt settlement company will negotiate with the firm that holds the debt on your behalf and will lower the obligation to an amount you can afford. To do this, the debt settlement company will need to review your complete financial statements. This means they will need to look over your bank statements, credit card balances, asset reports and any other documentation regarding what you might owe. From there, the debt settlement company will negotiate on your behalf to lower the rate."}
{"original": "The debt settlement company makes money by charging you a fee for their services. In general, that fee is a percentage of the amount by which they lower your debt load."}
{"original": "Debt settlement is not without cost. While debt settlement is not as bad as a straight default, the process can do serious damage to your credit score and can impair your ability to borrow money in the future. In addition, some debt settlement companies advise their clients to stop paying their bills during settlement negotiations. This practice can lead to late penalties, debt collection efforts and possibly lawsuits, all of which will increase the expense to you. Finally, any decrease in your debt load is taxable. If you have $1,000 in debt that you settle for $500, you have to report an additional $500 in taxable income on your next tax return."}
{"original": "Debt settlement is a last resort for people facing serious cash problems and it should not be entered into lightly. If not done properly, you could end up with more debt than you had at the beginning of the process. Before beginning any debt settlement process, consider working with a credit counselor. Credit counselors are generally non-profit organizations that can help you manage your finances and can negotiate on your behalf with creditors."}
{"original": "While you don't get the immediate decrease in debt that you might achieve in a debt settlement, credit counseling can help you avoid a lot of the damaging effects that also go along with a settlement. Additionally, credit counselors can ensure that your creditors won't seek to collect on your debts while the counselors are helping to advise you and restructure your finances."}
{"original": "In short, you should really only proceed with debt settlement when credit counseling fails. Before you choose debt settlement as an option, make sure that the associated fees and penalties will be less money than the potential amount of forgiven debt."}
{"original": "If you are looking for a reliable debt settlement service, you should be careful since some services that offer debt settlement can try to rip you off. Here are two of the most trusted debt settlement companies that you can try:"}
{"original": "Price: 20% of whatever you end up saving by using their services. (NOTE: They don't charge a monthly service fee like other debt settlement services.)"}

{"original": "With Scott's signature, Vermont will join eight other legal-weed states, as well as Washington, D.C., in a growing movement away from federal law, which still classifies marijuana as a Schedule I substance, alongside heroin and LSD. Vermont legalized medical marijuana in 2004, and is currently among nearly 30 states, plus the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, with such programs in place."}
{"original": "Although other states have legalized cannabis through ballot initiatives that have left the decision up to voters, Vermont does not allow for such a process. Over the past few years, lawmakers in the state have instead been working to address marijuana reform through legislation. A similar legalization bill made it to Scott's desk in 2017, but the governor vetoed it, citing concerns with weak language on punishment for the sale of marijuana to minors and its establishment of a commission to study how a regulated cannabis market would work in Vermont."}
{"original": "The final version of H. 511 clarified civil penalties for the sale of marijuana to individuals under 21 years old and removed the commission entirely. Scott has instead created his own marijuana task force, which is examining the state's involvement in recreational cannabis sales and focusing on developing comprehensive education, prevention and highway safety strategies."}
{"original": "There must be comprehensive and convincing plans completed in these areas before I will begin to consider the wisdom of implementing a commercial 'tax-and-regulate' system for an adult marijuana market, Scott said on Monday. It is important for the General Assembly to know that – until we have a workable plan to address each of these concerns – I will veto any additional effort along these lines, which manages to reach my desk."}
{"original": "Some state officials say the composition of that commission looks to be biased against marijuana, which means recreational weed faces an uncertain future in Vermont."}
{"original": "There is frustration that the governor's panels appear to be predetermined in opposition [to a tax-and-regulate model for marijuana sales] versus the sentiment of the House and Senate, which was to move forward, said Vermont Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman, a Progressive/Democrat."}
{"original": "The governor's commission is expected to deliver a final report to lawmakers by the end of the year, which would guide them on future legislation to establish a market for cannabis. Under Vermont's two-step process of legalization, it could be a while before the state sees its first legal marijuana sale, said Matt Simon, the New England political director for the Marijuana Policy Project, a non-profit organization that advocates for cannabis reform around the country."}
{"original": "The tone of the commission all along has been, 'Let's figure out how to do this, regardless of whether we think it should happen or not,' he said. They're gonna come up with specific policy recommendations. Now whether the legislature decides to take those recommendations or not is a whole different story."}
{"original": "It's not yet clear if there would be enough support in the state legislature to pass a tax-and-regulate bill without Scott's support. Vermont requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers to override a gubernatorial veto. With statewide elections upcoming in November, these deliberations seem likely to become a key campaign issue in the coming months, though it's not yet clear if lawmakers will be willing to put themselves on the record as strong supporters of legal marijuana sales in Vermont."}
{"original": "Some Republicans feel vulnerable if they support this kind of legislation, even though the support for this is majority across all parties, said Zuckerman. The cultural sentiment is still in some of those districts, and they don't feel the support is there yet."}
{"original": "Recent surveys have shown strong support for relaxing marijuana laws in Vermont and nationwide. A January HuffPost/YouGov poll showed that 55 percent of Americans favor legalizing marijuana both nationally and in their own states. National support for legalization at the federal level hit a record high 64 percent in a Gallup survey from October 2017, including among a majority of Republicans."}
{"original": "Recreational marijuana has already become a substantial revenue source in the states that have legalized it. Legal marijuana sales in the U.S. hit $6 billion in 2016, with tax revenue in Colorado and Washington, the states that have had legal cannabis markets for the longest, now bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, according to an analysis by the Marijuana Policy Project. Another recent study projected that over a nine-year period, legal marijuana nationwide could provide 1 million new jobs and generate more than $132 billion in federal tax revenue, with nearly $52 billion in sales tax alone."}
{"original": "Without a system to tax and regulate cannabis sales in Vermont, all commerce involving marijuana would remain underground."}
{"original": "Marijuana is widely available, widely used throughout Vermont. Vermonters spend an awful lot of money on marijuana and it all goes to the illicit market, said Simon. Why wouldn't we have a regulated system so that money would instead go to taxed and regulated businesses and the state would have some revenue to deal with any costs or issues that do arise?"}
{"original": "Despite the clear economic benefits of legal marijuana, the state-federal divide on cannabis laws has gotten deeper over the past month. Lawmakers in the Vermont House of Representatives passed H. 511 just a day after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions released new Justice Department guidance giving federal prosecutors the go-ahead to crack down on state-legal marijuana operations. Although the announcement led to some anxiety in the fledgling marijuana industry, its practical effect remains to be seen."}
{"original": "That Justice Department action alone shows that the political stigma around marijuana reform still hasn't faded completely, said Zuckerman. But he hopes the Vermont legislature's successful move toward legalization could serve as an invitation for lawmakers in other states to pursue reform."}
{"original": "This is a significant signal to other legislative bodies around the country that legislatures can act in the interest of the general population without some of the fear that there will be electoral retribution, he said. In the world of making laws, that is often one of the things that lawmakers look at, that potential consequence."}
{"original": "For now, lawmakers are discussing how best to incorporate Vermont's progressive principles into any future system of state marijuana sales, Zuckerman said."}
{"original": "The very broad sentiment from right to left is that nobody wants Big Cannabis to own Vermont, and whatever we do end up drafting for a tax-and-regulate bill will be oriented toward smaller production facilities and a more broad distribution of the economic benefit throughout the state, as opposed to large out of state corporate version, he said."}
{"original": "Clarification: A previous version of this story indicated Vermont Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman governor is a Democrat. Zuckerman won both the Democratic and Progressive primaries for the position, and has been affiliated with both parties."}
{"original": "Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt told New York Post columnist and Fox News contributor Michael Goodwin that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) wants to tax his paycheck at 70 percent, when that's not what the congresswoman has proposed at all."}

{"original": "When you hear they're going to tax 70 percent of your paycheck, if Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gets her way, how do they have so much support? she asked Goodwin."}

{"original": "There is so much to unpack there."}
{"original": "For one, Ocasio-Cortez did not propose taking 70 percent of anyone's income. In an interview with 60 Minutes, the 29-year-old suggested applying this marginal rate only to earnings amounting to more than $10 million. This means that those impacted would pay a much lower share of their income overall and the average tax rate for working Americans could potentially go down under her idea."}
{"original": "A report in CNBC explains how Ocasio-Cortez's idea is in line with America's economic history. While the top tax rate stood above 90 percent throughout the 1950s, deductions and tax avoidance led to taxes on the rich being not that much higher, according to a 2017 article by the Tax Foundation."}
{"original": "A top rate of 70 percent was active up until 1981, when President Ronald Reagan took office. The most affluent 1 percent were paying an average rate of 30.5 percent. By 1989, when Reagan left office, the top rate was reduced to 28 percent — but average tax rates for the most affluent had only slightly dropped to 27.9 percent."}
{"original": "Since then, the last three decades have had top rates below 40 percent. Many have tried to change that. Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed a 54.2 percent rate for income above $10 million in his 2016 presidential campaign proposal and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton proposed 43.6 percent for earnings above $5 million."}
{"original": "As for the congresswoman's comments on unemployment, she discussed her understanding of how it's calculated in July 2018 after the press and many members of the GOP ripped her words apart. It's unclear as to why Goodwin is bringing up the remarks again, half a year later."}

{"original": "A poll by the Government of Canada, recently made public, shows Canadians are more inclined to spend their tax dollars on traditional infrastructure, like roads and public transportation, rather than high-tech infrastructure because they believe the former will grow the economy and create jobs."}
{"original": "It's understandable why taxpayers may prioritize investment this way. Ensuring that the Gardiner Expressway is in a good state of repair and public transit is growing are things that are critical to the functioning of Torontonians' daily lives. Physical infrastructure also has the benefit of its economic returns being familiar and immediately visible. And when it doesn't function the way it should, citizens feel the fallout immediately. There's also no doubt that infrastructure spending leads to jobs."}
{"original": "But the question we need to ask ourselves when we think about investment in our country -- and ultimately the lives of Canadians -- is what kind of world will we be living in 50 years from now, and how can we ensure we're ready for it and able to thrive as citizens and a nation?"}
{"original": "This debate isn't a new one. When Sir John A. MacDonald unveiled his National Policy in 1876, he championed a vision for Canadian Pacific Railway's transcontinental line. The idea received a great deal of criticism initially, but the railway is now viewed as a critical building block of Canada. It linked east with west, facilitated communications and the transportation of goods between Canada's previously fractured regions, and helped the country compete internationally. High tech now, like the railway then, is the great connector and a key part of our country's competitive advantage and economic future. We must invest in it or risk getting left behind."}
{"original": "Technology is no longer a tactic in business, it's an imperative to the overarching strategy of any organization, and it's critical to thrive in an era where any business risks getting Uberized. As an employee, digital literacy and skills are tantamount to staying relevant and employable in today's digital world."}
{"original": "At a macro level, technology is one of the fastest growing sectors of the Canadian economy in terms of GDP output. From 2007 to 2014, Information Communications Technology sector revenues grew from $133.4 billion to $169.8 billion, a 27.2% increase. According to The Brookfield Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Ryerson University, the technology sector was responsible for 7.1% of Canada's real economic output in 2015. The study also notes that the sector's growth has been steady over the last few years -- lacking the volatility of other industries -- a good indicator of future growth."}
{"original": "The Global Innovation Index in 2016 ranked Canada as the 15th most innovative country in the world. This is good. However, a central finding of the same report is that investments in research and development and innovation are central for economic growth and the index noted that Canada is lagging when it comes to research and development expenditure."}
{"original": "It's easy to think about new technology and innovation in futuristic terms, but today's high school students will soon live in an economy with jobs anchored in technologies their parents would likely have seen as science fiction - everything from nanotechnology to AI to driverless cars.

A whopping 158 million numbers were exposed, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center ― more than eight times the number exposed in 2016."}
{"original": "Many of these breaches occurred in the health care industry, where medical records enjoy a long shelf life. The industry has a reputation for being something of a leaky sieve for information that should be kept confidential, according to TrendMicro, which calls the health care sector a preferred target for cybercriminals. The health care industry, with hospitals leading the way, reported that 113.2 million health care-related records were stolen in 2015 ― the most ever, according to the Department of Health and Human Services."}
{"original": "Alarmingly, about half of all health care organizations had little or no confidence that they could detect the loss or theft of patient data, and the majority lack the budget to secure their data, according to a 2016 annual study on health care data privacy and security by the Ponemon Institute, a security research and consulting organization. Only a few organizations actually have a legal right to your SSN, including your employer, banks and lenders, investment funds, the IRS and government-funded programs such as workers' compensation."}
{"original": "The more your number is out there, the greater the risk of identity theft. Armed with your Social Security number, someone can file fraudulent tax returns in your name, open credit cards, or get official documents like a passport or driver's license. And it's a nightmarish bit of data to have stolen. If a thief steals your credit card or bank account number, for example, it's useful only until the credit limit is reached or you catch on to the hack and close the account. But you can't close your Social Security number."}
{"original": "And it gets worse: It's an open secret that a person's Medicare number includes their Social Security number. It's printed right out on the front of every Medicare card for the world to see. That is being corrected, however: New cards with randomly assigned Medicare numbers are in the process of being issued to replace the ones that bear Social Security numbers."}
{"original": "Part of the overall problem is that Social Security numbers were never designed to be used as identity authenticators. Decades ago, they began being issued as a way of recording your earnings to determine the amount of benefits you would be paid at retirement or if you claimed a disability. Through the years, they morphed into a popular form of identification ― and, most recently, became coveted by cyber-thieves."}

{"original": "That means it will be a lot tougher to qualify to itemize deductions. Those who do will find many differences in what they can claim. Here's a look at the deductions you won't be able to claim on your 2018 taxes ― and what you can do instead."}
{"original": "9 Tax Write-Offs You Can't Claim Anymore"}
{"original": "A personal exemption is a sum of money you can deduct for yourself and any dependents from your taxable income. The personal exemption was worth $4,050 in 2017. A family of four, for example, would have received $16,200 in exemptions last year."}
{"original": "Now, personal exemptions are no longer in play, said Christina Taylor, head of tax operations at Credit Karma Tax. This could have a substantial impact on refunds for larger families."}
{"original": "Prior to the latest tax bill, victims of fires, earthquakes, floods or similar natural disasters who experienced uninsured losses greater than 10 percent of their adjusted gross income could deduct a portion of those losses from their taxable income."}
{"original": "Now? You'll only be able to claim them if they were a result of a federally declared disaster, Taylor said. Those designations are made on a county basis, which means some areas could be declared official disaster zones, while others could not."}
{"original": "The new tax law reduced the amount taxpayers can claim for taxes paid to agencies that are not the IRS, according to Arthur Rosatti, an attorney with Ashley F. Morgan Law. These are typically called SALT, or state and local taxes."}
{"original": "There is now a $10,000 cap on all state income taxes, personal property taxes, sales tax and local taxes, he said. Prior to 2018, there was no cap. This will hit individuals who are higher income and live in states with income tax the most, Rosatti said."}
{"original": "Homeowners previously were able to write off the interest on mortgages up to $1 million. Under the new tax law, however, the cap has been reduced to $750,000 in qualified residence loans. According to the IRS, that limit applies to the combined amount of loans you use to buy, build or substantially improve your primary or second home."}
{"original": "The good news is this change only applies to new homeowners, according to Josh Zimmelman, owner of Westwood Tax & Consulting. The $1 million cap still applies to homeowners who took out a mortgage before December 15, 2017, he said. New homeowners can take this deduction on mortgages up to $750,000."}
{"original": "5. Unrestricted home equity loan interest deduction"}
{"original": "Before the new tax law, homeowners could deduct interest paid on a home equity loan or line, or credit of up to $100,000, regardless of how the funds were used. For example, if a homeowner used a home equity loan to pay off credit card debt, they'd receive a tax break on the interest paid."}
{"original": "In 2018, unless that taxpayer used the borrowed funds to buy, build or substantially improve either their primary home or a second home, the interest is not deductible, said Shan-Nel D. Simmons, a former IRS revenue agent and owner of Nel's Tax Help."}
{"original": "Taxpayers previously could deduct certain moving expenses related to relocating for a new job, Zimmelman said. This was an above-the-line deduction, meaning it could be claimed even if the taxpayer didn't itemize."}
{"original": "Now the only people who can take this deduction are military service members moving for assignment, Zimmelman said."}
{"original": "In the past, if a taxpayer's job required certain purchases in order for an employee to perform their job and the employer was unable or unwilling to reimburse the employee, those expenses were tax deductible. For example, employees could deduct mileage driven for work purposes (not commuting), uniforms, tools, union dues and more as long as they met the 2 percent rule for miscellaneous deductions."}
{"original": "However, beginning in 2018, employees will not be allowed to deduct out-of-pocket work expenses they pay to do their job, Simmons said. This deduction, along with other miscellaneous deductions, is suspended through 2025."}
{"original": "Prior to 2018, fees related to tax preparation could also be combined with other miscellaneous deductions that exceeded 2 percent of your adjusted gross income. This deduction has been suspended through 2025, according to Taylor."}
{"original": "Many other miscellaneous deductions are off the table for 2018. Also included in this bunch are expenses related to investment fees, legal fees, home office use and alimony for divorces finalized after December 31, 2018. These deductions will be reinstated in 2026 unless Congress votes to extend the current rule."}
{"original": "5 Valuable Deductions And Credits You Can Still Claim"}
{"original": "Though it seems like taxpayers lost many important deductions for the 2018 tax year, the increased standard deduction could help take the sting out of losing those benefits, Flood said."}
{"original": "Plus, there are several valuable tax write-offs, some of which were previously on the tax bill's chopping block, that remain for 2018. Those include:"}
{"original": "Families might be able to offset some of the personal exemption loss with the revised Child Tax Credit, which is now worth up to $2,000 in 2018. Congress also raised the income threshold to $200,000 (for single filers) before the credit starts to phase out, Rosatti said. The new law is also giving a $500 credit for qualifying dependents who are not children."}
{"original": "Taxpayers who do itemize can still deduct qualifying charitable donations. The deduction is limited to 60 percent of adjusted gross income for cash gifts ― up from 50 percent in previous years. Any amount in excess of that can be carried forward up to five years."}
{"original": "Another above-the-line deduction available to student loan borrowers is a deduction on the interest paid. Borrowers can deduct of up to $2,500 in interest per year. The deduction begins to phase out for borrowers with an adjusted gross income over $65,000 and caps at $80,000."}

{"original": "If you contribute to a tax-advantaged savings plan, such as an individual retirement account or health savings account, those contributions are still eligible for the same tax benefits."}
{"original": "With the NFL draft starting this evening, we have been treated to the annual round-the-clock analysis of who will take whom and which players will be the League's next stars. But as I think most of us know, the draft is really overrated. Despite the teams spending God knows how much on scouting players in person, reviewing film, and testing for physical attributes (did someone say NFL combine?), we see time and again high draft picks disappointing and lower picks excelling. Does anyone remember the agony the teams were supposedly facing when they had to choose between Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf? I remember the detailed report in Pro Football Weekly analyzing 10 attributes for quarterbacks and ranking the players from 1 to 10 points for each of the 10 categories. The conclusion was that Manning had a one point advantage over Leaf out of a possible 100 points. Now, of course, we know that Leaf had a briefing career, throwing for a total of about 3600 yards, while Manning retired after a lengthy career and about 72,000 yards of passing offense."}
{"original": "In analyzing the ability of NFL team to successfully pick quarterbacks, we have to look at the 2000 draft. Tom Brady was selected in the sixth round with the overall number 199 pick, with six quarterbacks chosen ahead of him. And how did those six do playing on Sundays? One of them never played a regular-season game, one of them never started a regular-season game, and a third started but three regular-season games. Total career passing yardage for those three: 654. The fourth quarterback was a marginal player at best, having 12 career starts and throwing for about 3200 yards. There were two moderately successful NFL quarterbacks taken ahead of Brady. One had 81 starts and threw for about 17,800 yards in his career, while the other had 95 starts and threw for about 22,800 yards. Brady by contrast, has had 235 starts and has thrown the ball for about 61,000 yards."}
{"original": "Obviously, there are numerous other examples. Joe Montana in the third round and JaMarcus Russell at the overall number 1 pick. But there is something a little different about this discussion when it comes to Brady, for he is in the conversation as to who is the greatest quarterback ever."}
{"original": "Tom Brady led the Patriots to the remarkable (or should we say unbelievable) comeback victory over the Falcons in Super Bowl 51. He won his fifth Super Bowl title as a quarterback and his fourth Super Bowl MVP trophy, both unprecedented. Then the debate started as to whether he or Joe Montana was the greatest of all time (GOAT). Great question to kick around over beers (or wine or scotch if you prefer), but I'm afraid impossible to answer. Way too many variables to consider. How does one compare team sport athletes who played three decades apart? The ability to put up numbers changes, rules are modified, stars have different supporting casts, new offensive and defensive schemes are utilized, and the strength of the opposing teams varies. Changes through collective bargaining affect the ability of franchises to keep successful units together."}
{"original": "Is it right to determine the GOAT just by success in the Super Bowl, or should we give more weight to performance during the regular-season? Would Dan Marino be in the conversation if he was playing for the Patriots today or the 49ers in the 1980s? What if Joe Montana never teamed with Jerry Rice (or Ronnie Lott)? Is Brady better because he won four Super Bowl MVP awards instead of the three which Montana captured? Would our answer to be different if Montana also had four Super Bowl MVP trophies? Maybe he could have won another if the voters had named him instead of Rice MVP of Super Bowl 33. After all, if Rice made all the great catches, who was throwing him the ball?"}
{"original": "If we just use Super Bowl titles to determine the GOAT, what about our old friend: luck? Montana would probably have five titles too if Roger Craig had not fumbled with less than three minutes left in the NFL championship game with the Giants in 1991. The 49ers had only to run out the clock to win. Protect the ball – two hands – and the 49ers win. Or Brady could have won six Super Bowl titles if the Giants' David Tyree had not made the impossible helmet catch after Eli Manning's totally ridiculous scramble and Houdini – like escape from the Patriots' rush. Or maybe Brady would have only four Super Bowl titles if Seattle had just handed the ball to Marshawn Lynch in Super Bowl 49 instead of throwing the most infamous interception in NFL history. Or perhaps the Falcons would have hosted the Super Bowl championship parade in Atlanta this year if Julian Edelman had not somehow managed to catch a pass about 1 inch off the turf when three Falcons defenders were all around him."}
{"original": "If we just use Super Bowl titles to determine the GOAT, what about our old friend: luck?"}
{"original": "But what the Patriots and Brady really should do is send thank you notes to the Falcons' head coach Dan Quinn and then offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan and remind them to file federal gift tax returns for their crazy play – calling and clock management during the fourth quarter. They had the game in hand and gave it away. Does Arthur Blank (the Falcons' owner) appreciate what his high–paid coaching staff did during the last half of the last quarter? Let's take a look, knowing that it's really easy to play Monday morning quarterback. But this is not one of those situations."}
{"original": "We are at 8:26 left in the fourth quarter with the Falcons up 28 – 12; 3rd down and 1 from their own 35. Let's consider possible outcomes if the Falcons run the ball. Devonta Freeman had averaged 4.8 yards per carry during the regular season and 4.2 yards per carry during the playoffs. Maybe they gain at least 1 yard and then have first and ten at their own 36 or better. What next? How about three more running plays? What possibly could be the result of that? Either another first down, or fourth down and time to punt. Okay, but what does the clock look like then? With good clock management (about 45 seconds elapses per play), about 5:30 would be left. Three precious minutes have vanished for the Patriots. Then, at worst from the Falcons' standpoint, they punt out of bounds or to the sideline so the punt returner is hemmed in. The Patriots get the ball at about their own 20-yard line trailing by 16 points with about 5:30 left. Then the Patriots would be faced with the problem of driving 80 yards, successfully converting a two-point conversion, recovering an onside kick, driving the field again, and successfully converting another two-point conversion. And they would have 5:30 to do all this. Good luck with that. Oh, and let's not forget that on those three running plays the Falcons might have made yet another first down and proceeded to run down the clock even more."}
{"original": "Now let's go back to the time the Falcons could have made the decision to run on third down, but this time let's assume the 1-yard run attempt fails. The Patriots get the ball back on approximately their own 20 with about 7:30 left, trailing by 16. Still not a place I would like to be."}
{"original": "But we all know the Falcons decided to throw on third and one, Matt Ryan fumbles, and the Patriots recover on the Falcons 25. Sure it's not likely that Ryan will fumble, and we can certainly chalk that up to bad luck. (Actually, the fumble resulted from Freeman's complete failure to block which gave the pass rusher a clear path to Ryan thereby causing the fumble.) But with a third and one, why risk a fumble, or an interception, or a sack? Also, why risk stopping the clock on an incomplete pass? And, here the pass play fooled no one, and the Falcons did not even bother to fake a run to hold the rush."}
{"original": "The Patriots received the fumble and proceeded to take advantage of the short field. Remarkably they used almost 2 1/2 minutes to advance 25 yards and score. After the two-point conversion, the score was 28 – 20 with 5: 56 left in the game. Now the Falcons have to go back to work and can no longer play conservatively. With that much time left and a  one – score game, they must advance the ball and make first downs while trying to burn as much time as possible. What did the Falcons do? They take possession after the kickoff and acted like they came to play. They rapidly advanced the ball to the Patriots' 22. First and 10, five minutes to play, eight point lead. Before we review what the Falcons actually did, let's examine their options. From the Patriots' 22, they could have run the ball and made a first down. Now more clock would have been eaten up and the Patriots would see their chances go to just about zero. What happens if three running plays don't result in a first down? With no first down the ball is somewhere between the Patriots' 22 and 13, and the clock would then stand at just under three minutes to play. In that case, it's field goal time. Now someone is going to tell me a Matt Bryant field goal is not a sure thing somewhere between 30 and 39 yards."}
{"original": "Just for point of reference, over the past 12 years, this established veteran has missed only 5% of his field-goal attempts under 40 yards. And what has he done recently? In 2016 he hit 28 out of 29 attempts at under 50 yards. In addition, during the last four years, he's made 40 of his 42 attempts at less than 40 yards. So if I were the coach, I'd like those odds."}
{"original": "If Bryant had made the field goal, the Patriots would have trailed by 11 with less than three minutes to play. That looks like a winner for the Falcons. If on the very unlikely chance that Bryant missed that field goal, the Patriots would have taken over on about their own 20 with less than three minutes to go, still trailing by 8. But the Falcons had other ideas. On second down Matt Ryan gets sacked for a loss, stopping the clock. Now it's third down. Needing lots of yards the Falcons must pass. But this time they get called for holding. They are then out of field-goal range so on fourth down they punt to the Patriots who go on offense with 5:56 to go. We all know what happened then. Would the result of been any different if the Patriots had less than three minutes to drive the field instead of six?"}
{"original": "This whole mess gets us back to the question of selecting the GOAT. Is Brady the GOAT because the Atlanta coaching staff needs a refresher course in clock management and probability? Would it be Montana if slight changes in luck had him with a Super bowl edge of 5 to 4 over Brady? When we talk about the GOAT, what about Johnny U, or Otto Graham, or Dan Marino, or John Elway being in conversation with Montana and Brady? (Oh, if the Super Bowl is all that matters, let's not forget Terry Bradshaw). Let the debate commence."}

{"original": "But this isn't about the 29-year-old political wunderkind clapping back. Ocasio-Cortez has done something even more remarkable with this tax thing – she's popularized a wonky tax idea that asks the rich to pay their fair share, ending years of gaslighting from conservatives and the wealthy, who've tried to argue lowering taxes on high-income earners is good for everyone."}
{"original": "Other progressive economic policies – think the $15 an hour minimum wage or Medicare for all – have captured the public's imagination over the past few years. But it's hard to think of a progressive economic idea that has caught fire as quickly as this one, said Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University, who advised Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during his 2016 presidential campaign."}
{"original": "Part of that has to do with Ocasio-Cortez's undeniable star power."}
{"original": "There's something unique about her in this moment where she's captured the attention of so many people on the left and the right, said Kelton. So when she says something like this it just makes a splash."}
{"original": "The idea of raising the marginal rate to 70 percent isn't new. Sen. Sanders talked about raising taxes on the rich during his campaign, though it arguably wasn't his most resonant pitch."}
{"original": "In fact, from 1936 to 1980, the top rate never dipped below 70 percent. That changed with former President Ronald Reagan, who rode a wave of anti-tax backlash that has grown stronger with each year since, culminating when Congress passed Trump's tax cut in 2017."}
{"original": "The fantasy that these cuts would benefit ordinary Americans is largely over, said Kelton."}
{"original": "The policies of the last several decades going back to at least 1981 have largely decimated what was once the American dream, hollowing out communities, the middle class, she said, adding that people are now unable to afford what was once considered the essentials: healthcare and housing."}

(Anti-tax activist Grover Norquist took that rationale to a wildly absurd place earlier this month, with the above tweet.) It is only the first dollar over $10 million that would be taxed at the higher rate."}

{"original": "Still, Ocasio-Cortez hasn't fleshed out the details, so it's not clear if she intends to also raise taxes on unearned income, the money rich people earn from their investments."}
{"original": "Some progressive economists believe that raising the marginal rate would just be part of the way to start getting the wealthy to pay their fair share. Ocasio-Cortez's idea then is a signal of a larger ethos that's taking hold and likely part of a bigger plan to shift economic burdens to the well off."}

{"original": "So, could this simple — but costly — measure work for other cities, using free buses, trams and trains to help cut private car use, reduce emissions and make cities less congested and more livable? The question takes on more urgency in Europe, where the European Commission found in November 2017 that 400,000 citizens die prematurely every year due to poor air quality."}
{"original": "Estonia's capital city, Tallinn, introduced fareless public transport for residents in 2013, although people from outside the city and tourists must still pay. Allan Alaküla, head of the Tallinn EU office and official spokesman for the project, says that five years later, no one seriously thinks it can be reversed. There are 140 million trips a year, the vast majority by Tallinn's 450,000 residents."}
{"original": "Introduced by populist mayor Edgar Savisaar after a referendum, the measure is viable because under the country's fiscal law, Tallinn gets 1,000 euros of each resident's income tax each year. And as a result of the transit program, population numbers have increased."}
{"original": "Tallinn EU Office A tram in Tallinn, where public transport is free for city residents."}
{"original": "The lost ticket revenue from residents is 12 million euros ($15 million), and the gain from additional revenues from the increase in the residential population, at the most conservative estimate, is well above 20 million euros ($25 million), Alaküla explained. So the city budget has gained, service quality has improved constantly and in the surroundings of Tallinn, the demand for public transport has increased."}
{"original": "So much so that on July 1, the whole country will roll out free bus travel thanks to central government subsidies making Estonia, Alaküla says, the first public transport nation."}
{"original": "But while the city center has benefited from reduced congestion, and people who could not afford public transport before have greater access to jobs, shopping and leisure facilities, says Alaküla, there are downsides."}
{"original": "Alaküla said Tallinn's free transportation has resulted in a 10 percent decrease in traffic in the city centre. But at the same time, we have observed a slight increase around the city center, he said."}
{"original": "Contrary to what you might think, people also walk less. Particularly in the city center, where the tram stops frequently, some people are taking the tram out of convenience instead of walking, he said."}
{"original": "Dr. Oded Cats, assistant professor in transport and planning at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, who has studied Tallinn's project, said it has achieved two goals: to increase the mobility of the unemployed and low-income groups and the city's total residents."}
{"original": "However, there is no evidence suggesting there has been a shift from car to public transport usage, he said. We do see an increase in public transport usage, though, from people who would otherwise walk, which is not necessarily desirable."}
{"original": "He is doubtful that free public transport in Germany would do anything to reduce car use or emissions. We know car users are very sensitive to the price of the car trip, not public transport prices, so increasing parking fees or congestion charges would be more efficient, he said."}
{"original": "Environmentally speaking, he adds, cities should invest in a mix of transport options and encourage conscious choices: Walking and cycling are unbeatable, and public transport should take longer distance trips or [transport] groups that cannot walk."}
{"original": "Norman Garrick, visiting professor in transportation at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, believes that to tempt people onto public transport, it must be time-efficient, convenient and comfortable — not just free. It's also to do with how cities are designed, he said. If you widen streets to accept cars, that's what you are going to get. Longer term, you could convert cities to places where you don't need to get a car."}
{"original": "The cost is another potential dealbreaker. No details have emerged about how Germany might fund its free city transport."}
{"original": "The city of Hasselt in Belgium had to reintroduce fares after 16 years of free rides because it became impossible to support financially. Cost was also given as the reason for Seattle's decision to shut down its 40-year-old free downtown bus service in 2012."}
{"original": "But back in Tübingen, the mayor is optimistic. The public discussion has been intense and 70% of people support [the German government's idea], he said. The debate has created a pressure not to do nothing, and my intention is to be on board and convince them."}

{"original": "Newly elected California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Thursday proposed what would be the most generous paid parental leave policy in the nation: six months of partially paid leave so parents or other family members can care for a newborn or newly adopted baby."}
{"original": "Right now, some California parents have access to a combined four months of leave at partial pay. Those who get less include adoptive parents, same-sex couples and single parents."}
{"original": "Two-thirds of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guarantee six months of paid time off to new mothers. Newsom's plan doesn't go that far. Instead, the proposal, unveiled as part of his 2019 budget, would allow two caretakers to split six months off, according to a fact sheet provided by his office. One parent could take three months, and the other parent or partner or another family member could take three more months, or vice versa."}
{"original": "The policy would roll out slowly. At a press conference unveiling the state's $209 billion budget on Thursday, Newsom said that leave would be paid for mainly with existing funds."}
{"original": "It's a developmental necessity, Newsom said of paid leave. We're committed to this."}
{"original": "Newsom's proposal counts as groundbreaking and radical for the U.S., the only developed country in the world that doesn't guarantee paid time off to new mothers; just two of 34 OECD countries do not guarantee paid leave to new fathers. And it comes at a time when Democratic state and local politicians around the country are proposing new liberal social programs ― beefing up Obamacare protections and provisions and passing greater labor protections. These guys are just catching up with others around the world, however."}

{"original": "California's policy would be a big step up from what the state currently offers: six weeks of caregiving leave, plus six to eight weeks for birth mothers through the state's disability fund. The policy covers new parents and those who need time off to care for a sick loved one, offering a percentage of pay up to $1,216 a week."}
{"original": "It's not clear if the extension would include caregiving leave; about 13 percent of Californians who seek paid leave need it to look after sick spouses, partners, children or parents, according to the state's data."}
{"original": "New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island currently offer paid parental and caregiving leave, and Washington state, the District of Columbia and Massachusetts have policies set to start paying out within the next couple of years. These states offer between four and 12 weeks to new parents."}
{"original": "There's a belief in the U.S., promoted mostly by business interests, that paid maternity leave is costly and hurts businesses. That's a myth, said Milkman."}
{"original": "California's existing program, started more than a decade ago, is relatively cheap. Workers in the state pay a 1 percent payroll tax on wages of up $115,000 to fund the program. And the fund is currently running a surplus, Newsom said Thursday. One way to pay for an expansion would be to tap into that surplus. He also mentioned raising the payroll tax as an option or raising the income limit so those earning more than the current taxable ceiling would contribute more."}
{"original": "It's a small price to pay for the peace of mind in knowing that if they need time off for a health crisis or new child, they can take it, said Milkman."}
{"original": "The money is not a lot, and it is so worth it, she said."}
{"original": "And businesses have been largely unaffected by the paid leave program, according to a widely cited survey Milkman co-authored a few years ago. For those employers already offering leave, the policy means they spend less on the benefit."}
{"original": "There are some issues with California's existing law: Job protections are limited. Many employers still have leeway to fire workers who take leave ― a limitation that activists hope Newsom will address."}
{"original": "Worryingly, even after more than a decade, many Californians don't know they have access to paid leave. Take-up rates for leave have been low."}
{"original": "Newsom's announcement could help raise awareness. It can fuel the momentum we need to make this happen the way it needs to happen, said Jenya Cassidy, an activist who helped pass the state's first law. The director of the California Work & Family Coalition, she said the group hopes to work with the governor's office to sharpen and improve the proposal."}
{"original": "The budget Newsom unveiled Thursday offered up a bunch of goodies for young children and their parents, including a plan for statewide universal pre-K and all-day kindergarten, as well as more money for subsidized child care. He also announced an increase in benefits to undocumented immigrants. It was an astonishing contrast to the policy priorities of the Trump administration."}
{"original": "This comes at a time when Democratic leaders in blue states are pushing progressive agendas that go far beyond what the divided federal government is capable of these days."}
{"original": "Just this week, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed giving workers in the city two weeks of paid time off each year ― the nation's first guaranteed vacation policy."}
{"original": "The egalitarian nature of Newsom's scheme could avoid one of the pitfalls of paid leave: putting women at a disadvantage in the workplace. Mothers wind up taking long workforce leaves, and fathers don't. Under his plan, if parents want their child to have six months of care provided by a family member, fathers would theoretically have to step up. Mothers still take the majority of leave in the state."}
{"original": "The effect of a paid leave policy on improving public health and the economy is hard to overstate."}
{"original": "Studies have shown that paid maternity leave reduces infant mortality rates, increases the amount of time women spend breastfeeding and makes it more likely that infants will be immunized."}
{"original": "Paid leave for women also helps keep them in the workforce. And the U.S. lags other nations when it comes to the percentage of women who work outside the home."}
{"original": "LONDON (AP) — Britain on Friday became the latest country to abolish the so-called tampon tax, eliminating sales taxes on women's sanitary products."}
{"original": "The move was widely praised by women's rights advocates as well as proponents of the country's departure from the European Union."}
{"original": "Treasury chief Rishi Sunak had committed to ending the widely unpopular tax on tampons and sanitary pads in his budget in March but the change could only take effect Friday after Britain had finally left the economic orbit of the European Union."}
{"original": "Under EU law, nations cannot reduce the rate of value-added tax on menstrual products below 5% as they are deemed to be luxury items and not essentials. Ireland is the only EU country that does not charge a levy on sanitary products as its zero tax rate was in place before the EU set its floor."}
{"original": "Sanitary products are essential, so it's right that we do not charge VAT, said Sunak. We have already rolled out free sanitary products in schools, colleges and hospitals and this commitment takes us another step closer to making them available and affordable for all women."}
{"original": "Britain officially left the bloc's vast single market for people, goods and services at 11 p.m. London time on Thursday, giving it greater scope to set its own laws. A new U.K.-EU trade deal will bring new restrictions and red tape, but for British Brexit supporters, it means reclaiming national independence from the EU and its rules. They pointed to the abolition of the tampon tax as an early positive change from Brexit."}
{"original": "Britain's treasury has previously estimated the move will save the average woman nearly 40 pounds ($55) over her lifetime."}
{"original": "It's been a long road to reach this point, but at last, the sexist tax that saw sanitary products classed as nonessential, luxury items can be consigned to the history books, said Felicia Willow, chief of the Fawcett Society, a women's rights charity."}
{"original": "Many other countries have also eliminated the tampon tax, including Australia, Canada and India. In the United States, several states including New York and Florida have also nixed the tax."}

{"original": "But he's simultaneously warning that Ottawa will have to show some flexibility if it wants him to continue playing the role of bridge-builder to the other two Prairie provinces, where talk of western alienation and outright separation has escalated since Justin Trudeau's Liberals won re-election on Oct. 21."}
{"original": "The prime minister has said and numerous of his colleagues have said that they are seeking to build a stronger country. To do that, Manitoba is the bridge, Pallister said Monday after a 30-minute meeting with Trudeau, who is in Winnipeg for a federal cabinet retreat."}

{"original": "Watch: Environment minister says new emissions targets are coming"}
{"original": "Pallister's government initially came up with a green plan that included a carbon tax that was below the national standard set by the Trudeau government. He scrapped the plan when it was rejected by Ottawa and joined his fellow conservative premiers in challenging the federal carbon tax backstop in court."}
{"original": "Ottawa is imposing its tax on provinces that have refused to meet the national standard for pricing carbon emissions: Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. The national tax was initially imposed in New Brunswick as well but that province came up with its own tax after the election, which has since been approved by the feds."}
{"original": "Pallister said he'll unveil a new green plan and discuss it with the federal government in the not too distant future. That dialogue, he added, will include a carbon price of some kind."}
{"original": "Whereas the national carbon tax is structured to escalate over time, Pallister indicated that he believes any tax should be flat and low like the Prairie horizon."}
{"original": "Moreover, he said Ottawa must give Manitoba credit for steps it's already taken to reduce carbon emissions, such as investing in clean hydro electricity."}
{"original": "We've put billions of dollars at risk to green up the environment and we deserve respect for that, Pallister said."}
{"original": "We deserve to be respected for our green record. We do not deserve to be called climate-change deniers by anybody ... We want acceptance of our made-in-Manitoba green strategies."}
{"original": "Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who has been travelling the country meeting with premiers and others in a bid to mend some of the deep divisions exposed by the election, said she and the prime minister already have lots of respect for Manitoba."}

{"original": "Manitoba occupies an important and valued geographic position in the country. It's fair to describe Manitoba as being in the heart of the country and co-operating with the premier is really valuable to us."}
{"original": "But whether that co-operation extends to watering down the federal carbon pricing regime for Manitoba seems unlikely."}
{"original": "Federal Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson was not enthusiastic Monday about crediting the province for past measures to reduce emissions."}
{"original": "We have to be forward-looking with climate change, he said after making an announcement elsewhere in Winnipeg."}

{"original": "Pallister has signalled his willingness to work with Ottawa, in stark contrast to the other openly hostile Prairie premiers, Alberta's Jason Kenney and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe."}

{"original": "POLITIQUE - Pendant la campagne, Emmanuel Macron avait fait la promesse à Jean-Jacques Bourdin et Edwy Plenel de venir faire le bilan de sa première année de mandat chez eux. Alors, quand BFMTV a fait une demande il y a plusieurs semaines au chef de l'Etat, son entourage a fait une contre-proposition pour intégrer Mediapart. Celle-ci a reçu l'aval des deux rédactions et voilà comment le président de la République tient deux engagements pour le prix d'un. Mais pas question de faire cet entretien à l'Elysée ni sur le plateau de la chaîne d'info en continu. A la recherche d'un lieu culturel, les intervieweurs ont finalement opté pour le Théâtre national de Chaillot, face à la Tour Eiffel; un palais qui avait servi de cadre à la signature de la Déclaration universelle des Droits de l'homme qui tranche avec la salle de classe de Berd'Huis, dans l'Orne, où Emmanuel Macron a répondu jeudi aux questions de Jean-Pierre Pernaut. De cet entretien beaucoup plus long -il a excédé 2h30- on retiendra essentiellement la forme (et l'affrontement avec les journalistes) qui a pris le pas sur le fond. Le chef de l'Etat qui a longuement justifié son action en Syrie -qui n'est pas une guerre- n'a rien concédé ni ouvert la porte sur les réformes en cours; il a d'ailleurs rejeté toute idée de coagulation des mécontentements. Sur la SNCF, tout juste a-t-il confirmé que l'Etat reprendra la dette à partir de 2020."}
{"original": "Le président de la République a confirmé qu'aucun nouvel impôt ne sera créé durant le quinquennat mais il a ouvert la porte à la création d'une nouvelle journée de solidarité pour financer la dépendance. Avant de conclure par la promesse de revenir au printemps 2019 faire le bilan de sa deuxième année de mandat. Ce qu'il faut retenir de cette interview Frappes en Syrie: un raid (efficace), pas une guerre Interrogé sur l'efficacité des frappes menées dans la nuit de vendredi à samedi, Emmanuel Macron a affirmé que l'opération a été parfaitement conduite comme peu d'armées au monde peuvent le faire. Trois sites ont été visés, nous avons réussi l'opération sur le plan militaire, assure le chef de l'Etat qui précise que sur le principe, ces frappes ont été décidées dimanche dernier. Il se félicite qu'aucune victime ne soit à déplorer car seules les capacités de fabrication des armes chimiques étaient, visiblement, visées. Mais il n'apporte pas, comme les journalistes lui ont demandé, les preuves de l'utilisation d'armes chimiques par Damas."}

{"original": "Emmanuel Macron confirme qu'il se rendra fin mai en Russie pour poursuivre le dialogue avec Vladimir Poutine qu'il juge coupable de complicité dans les attaques chimiques menées par Bachar el-Assad. Il assure aussi avoir obtenu de Donald Trump qu'il reste investi sur le dossier syrien. La séquence se conclut sur une pique adressée par Emmanuel Macron à Edwy Plenel qui lui fait remarquer que le chef de l'Etat est le seul à décider des frappes militaires. Il n'y a pas de pouvoir solitaire mais une responsabilité de la Constitution. De par l'élection présidentielle, il y a ce mandat de chef des armées. Si vous voulez changer la Constitution, présentez vous devant le peuple, balaye-t-il. Une nouvelle journée de solidarité? Emmanuel Macron confirme que sa majorité réfléchit à la possibilité de mettre en place une deuxième journée de solidarité pour financer la dépendance, qui serait alors considéré comme le cinquième risque (aux côtés des branches maladies, accidents du travail, retraite et famille). Agnès Buzyn a évoqué cette piste vendredi. En 2004, Jean-Pierre Raffarin avait décidé de faire travailler gratuitement les salariés le lundi de Pentecôte, pour répondre à la terrible canicule de 2003. En parallèle, il a promis qu'il n'y aura pas d'économie sur l'hôpital durant le quinquennat. Reprise de la dette de la SNCF Emmanuel Macron annonce qu'à partir de 2020, l'Etat reprendra une partie de la dette de la SNCF mais ne précise pas si ce sera l'intégralité de celle-ci; elle atteint 47 milliards d'euros."}
{"original": "Cette réforme est indispensable, confirme le président de la République qui n'ouvre pas de porte sur des aménagements de la réforme à proprement parler."}

L'ordre républicain doit prévaloir, assure-t-il, justifiant aussi l'intervention de CRS dans les universités quand c'est nécessaire. Seulement à Tolbiac, le fait que la faculté soit dans une tour complique l'opération. Le délit de solidarité ne sera pas supprimé Sur la loi asile et immigration qui arrive ce lundi à l'Assemblée, Emmanuel Macron a défendu la logique de son texte qui fait des remous dans sa majorité. Il confirme que le délit de solidarité ne sera pas supprimé mais adapté pour que ceux qui font un geste d'humanité ne soient pas condamnés mais les passeurs oui. Le chef de l'Etat confirme aussi que des enfants avec leur famille pourront toujours être placés en centre de rétention, mais pas d'enfants seuls. Au passage, il ne désavoue pas Gérard Collomb, son ministre de l'Intérieur qui a évoqué la submersion migratoire pour parler de l'immigration."}

Il assume des gestes pour garder les talents, les attirer et réinvestir dans notre économie. Le chef de l'Etat laisse entendre cependant que la mesure sera évaluée dans deux ans.

{"original": "Would imposing tariffs bring manufacturing jobs back to the US? originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.."}
{"original": "Answer by David Autor, Ford Professor of Economics and Associate Head at MIT, on Quora:"}
{"original": "Would imposing tariffs bring manufacturing jobs back to the US? No, it's very unlikely to do that. Manufacturing value chains are global. Many U.S. made goods have foreign components. Slapping on tariffs will raise prices and slow imports but it will make us poorer and impede growth."}
{"original": "We can have smarter trade policy (e.g., the tax reforms discuss here), and we can aggressively enforce our current policies to protect intellectual property, enforce rule of law, and require equal treatment from our trading partners. Tariffs are not the way to about that though."}
{"original": "Backing out of TPP was a very poor decision. The country that cheered loudest when we did that was China because TPP was setup as a bulwark against Chinese economic dominance in Asia. We harmed our own interests and those of our closest Asian allies (especially Japan) by reneging on that in-process agreement after many countries had invested substantial political capital in making it feasible. The biggest beneficiary of our withdrawal: China. The biggest loser: Japan. The second biggest: the U.S."}
{"original": "One additional note: I hope that more manufacturing returns to the U.S., and it may do so with appropriate tax policies (and even temporarily if we make imports very expensive -- though it's a bad idea). But new manufacturing production will be capital/robot intensive and skill intensive. It's not going to create mass employment. Manufacturing is not labor intensive any longer. And what labor intensive manufacturing exists cannot be done competitively in the U.S. There's a reason why India will be assembling iPhones and the U.S. likely will not: those are mundane low skill jobs that could not pay a decent wage in the U.S."}

{"original": "ATLANTA (AP) — Usually it's a president's first midterm election that reorders a White House's political approach and priorities. For President-elect Joe Biden, his most defining congressional election is coming before he takes office."}
{"original": "Two runoffs Tuesday in Georgia will decide which party controls the Senate and, thus, how far the new president can reach legislatively on issues such as the pandemic, health care, taxation, energy, and the environment. For a politician who sold himself to Americans as an uniter and a seasoned legislative broker, the Georgia elections will help determine whether he's able to live up to his billing."}
{"original": "It's not that you can't get anything done in the minority or get everything done in the majority, but having the gavel, having that leadership control can be the difference in success or failure for an administration, said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid, who held his post opposite current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell."}
{"original": "Both Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock must win Tuesday to split the Senate 50-50. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, as president of the Senate, would provide the tiebreaker needed to determine control."}
{"original": "To be sure, even a closely divided Democratic Senate wouldn't give Biden everything he wants. Senate rules still require 60 votes to advance most major legislation; for now, there aren't enough Democrats willing to change that requirement. So, regardless of Georgia's results, Biden will have to win over Republicans in a Senate where a bipartisan group of more centrist senators stands to see their stock rise."}
{"original": "A Democratic Senate still would clear an easier path for Biden's nominees to key posts, especially on the federal judiciary, and give Democrats control of committees and much of the floor action. Conversely, a Senate led by McConnell almost certainly would deny Biden major legislative victories, as it did late in President Barack Obama's tenure, by keeping his agenda from even getting up-or-down votes."}
{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS President-elect Joe Biden speaks at a drive-in rally for Georgia Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2020, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)"}
{"original": "Biden's team is keenly aware of the stakes. The president-elect will travel to Atlanta on Monday, the eve of the runoffs, to campaign with Ossoff and Warnock for the second time in three weeks. Biden's campaign aides have helped raise millions to boost the party infrastructure that helped Biden become the first Democratic presidential nominee since 1992 to carry the state. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will campaign Sunday in Savannah."}
{"original": "In his last visit, Biden called Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler roadblocks and urged Georgians to vote for two United States senators who know how to say the word 'yes' and not just 'no.'"}
{"original": "Congressional makeup shapes any administration, but perhaps even more so for Biden, who spent 36 years in the Senate, plus eight as Obama's vice president and top congressional liaison. Biden leaned on that resume to pitch himself to the country as a consensus builder; he also criticized presidents' increased use of executive action to go around Congress and insisted it would be different in his presidency."}
{"original": "Even some Republicans are hopeful. Michael Steel, once a top adviser to Republican House Speaker John Boehner, a chief Obama foil along with McConnell, blamed Obama's Capitol Hill troubles on his personal approach to his fellow politicians. Conversely, Steel said, President-elect Biden is a legislator by avocation, by training, by instinct, by experience in a way that former President Obama was not."}
{"original": "Steel predicted Biden and McConnell, two former colleagues, can find common ground on infrastructure and immigration — policy areas that have stumped multiple administrations. Steel noted a handful of Republican senators, including Marco Rubio of Florida and Rob Portman of Ohio, could face tough reelection fights in 2022, potentially making them eager to cut deals they could tout in campaigns."}
{"original": "Still, there's no indication McConnell would allow consideration of other top Biden priorities, most notably a public option expansion of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which passed without a single Republican vote when Democrats controlled both chambers on Capitol Hill. Biden's proposed tax hikes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans also are likely dead in a GOP Senate."}
{"original": "Biden will need his negotiating skills to navigate the left flank of his own party as well. While progressives say they've lowered their expectations of what's possible — even under a Democratic Senate — they still intend to push Biden."}
{"original": "Larry Cohen, chairman of Our Revolution, the offshoot of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential bid, said progressives will press Democrats in Congress to use the budget reconciliation process to work around the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold. Cohen argued that tactic might be used to accomplish long-sought goals like ending tax subsidies to fossil fuel companies and enabling the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to negotiate as a single customer with pharmaceutical companies."}
{"original": "Those moves, Cohen noted, could generate considerable savings, creating new revenue even if Republicans won't agree to any tax increases."}
{"original": "He also said progressives will push Biden to use executive authority. He named two initiatives Biden has called for publicly: ending new drilling on federal lands and raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, even if Congress won't set that floor across the economy. Another progressive priority, canceling student debt under federal loan programs, is something Biden has not said whether he'd be willing to attempt unilaterally."}
{"original": "Democrats' limited expectations about their own power, even with a potential majority, belie the exaggerated claims Republicans have used in the Georgia races."}
{"original": "In Perdue's and Loeffler's telling, a Democratic Senate would rubber stamp a socialist agenda, from ending private insurance and expanding the Supreme Court to adopting wholesale a Green New Deal that would spend trillions and raise taxes on every U.S. household by thousands of dollars each year. Besides misrepresenting Biden's and most Democratic senators' policy preferences, that characterization ignores the reality of the Senate's roster."}
{"original": "At one campaign stop this week, Ossoff said Perdue's ridiculous attacks blow my mind. He scoffed at the claim that his policy ideas, which align closely with Biden, amount to a leftist lunge. But the challenger agreed with the incumbent on how much the Georgia runoffs matter."}
{"original": "We have too much good work to do, Ossoff said, to be mired in gridlock and obstruction for the next few years."}

{"original": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had also announced that, as part of the House GOP plan for a next round of economic stimulus, he wanted to delay on tax day. McConnell's bill also included provisions to allow individuals making payments to postpone them even further, until October 15th."}
{"original": "On March 10, Democratic lawmakers on the Ways and Means Committee had sent a letter to the IRS to try find out more about any changes for the filing season. We request your continued evaluation of whether there is any need to extend the tax filing season beyond the April 15 deadline, they wrote at the time."}
{"original": "As recently as Tuesday, the White House had detailed on how taxpayers would be able to defer tax payments but had said that tax day itself would stay the same. All you have to do is file your taxes; you'll automatically not get charged interest in penalties, Mnuchin said during that coronavirus briefing."}
{"original": "Taxpayer may be able to get a further extension with a form 4868, which in normal years gives taxpayers until October 15 to file a return. It was not immediately clear how the delay in tax day would change the extension process."}
{"original": "What remains unchanged after Friday's announcement is that taxpayers who expect a refund can file right now and get their payments once the return is processed."}
{"original": "In a follow up tweet, the Treasury Secretary encouraged taxpayers to do just that."}
{"original": "IRS data through March 6 shows that almost 68 million Americans — roughly half of all filers based on previous years – have taken that advice. Nearly 53 million Americans (at least) have already gotten their refunds."}

{"original": "MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images Independent contractors and tipped workers will be some of the hardest hit by the coronavirus downturn."}
{"original": "The economic slowdown that the coronavirus pandemic has unleashed is likely to hurt millions of workers around the country as schools and restaurants close and businesses go dark. Many of the first to suffer have been workers in unconventional arrangements: independent contractors, part-time workers and others whose income varies from one week to the next."}
{"original": "Those workers tend to be clustered in the service industries that will be particularly hard hit, like food, transportation, travel and leisure. For many of them, their work status means it will be difficult to qualify for employer or government benefits intended to help weather the slump."}
{"original": "Some employers are ramping up their paid leave policies under public pressure, and the House of Representatives has put together an emergency plan to extend paid sick days and family leave to a larger share of the workforce. But many employers only offer paid time off to full-time employees, and more than 10 million working Americans are classified as self-employed."}
{"original": "Mardella Sue Rowland is one of them. The 67-year-old widow runs an exercise class at an assisted living home in Washington state, an epicenter of the outbreak. The facility is now on lockdown and Rowland's class has been canceled indefinitely. She is technically an independent contractor and calls herself a 1099er, a reference to the tax form used to report contractor wages to the IRS."}
{"original": "Rowland survives on Social Security payments and the $250 to $300 she earns from teaching exercise classes each week. She now finds herself at the mercy of the company that holds her contract."}
{"original": "Knowing how these places function, unless a state or federal program comes through to pay people like me, then we're screwed, Rowland said. A lot of us 1099ers just don't qualify for a lot of whatever [safety net measures] they're trying to push through in their slow, bureaucratic way."}
{"original": "This is getting to be just bone-crushing and disheartening, she said. And it's not just me."}
{"original": "Lots of people use the term gig workers as shorthand for Uber drivers and others who pick up work via online platforms, but there is a much larger universe of contractors like Rowland who don't enjoy the benefits of a traditional employer-employee relationship. A major 2017 study from Harvard and Princeton economists found that workers in alternative work arrangements ― including independent contractors, freelancers and on-call workers ― rose from 10.7% of the workforce to 15.8% between 2005 and 2015."}
{"original": "This is getting to be just bone-crushing and disheartening. And it's not just me. Mardella Sue Rowland, independent contractor"}
{"original": "In most cases, these workers won't qualify for unemployment benefits because there is no employer paying into the insurance system on their behalf. They don't have sick leave or paid vacation, and workers' compensation would not cover them if they got sick due to their work during the pandemic."}
{"original": "I feel like this coronavirus has really shown the heightened risk for gig workers and the gaps in our social safety net, said Laura Padin, a staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. Gig workers really are excluded from nearly all workplace protections and the benefits of [traditional] employees."}
{"original": "The coronavirus lockdown has been especially hard on the original gig workers: musicians. Concerts and shows around the country have been called off to limit transmission of the virus, leaving artists, stagehands and other workers in the industry with empty calendars. Some will be able to replace their wages through benefit programs, but many will not."}

They are eligible for unemployment through the opera house and ballet they work for, but much of their income comes through private music lessons that are now being canceled."}
{"original": "We will get through this and figure it out, but we potentially lost nearly all of our income in the last three days, Holley said."}
{"original": "Many teachers and other educators will have much of their income covered as schools shutter, either because their districts will continue to pay them or because they're eligible for unemployment benefits. But the closings could seriously squeeze school workers who are employed via outside contractors."}
{"original": "Natalie Galiotto works for a private after-school program that services a public school district in Georgia. She said she does not receive benefits because her position is part-time. She also earns money teaching through a home-schooling cooperative, but those classes have been canceled for at least a month. She plans to apply for unemployment benefits but isn't sure what she might qualify to receive."}
{"original": "She would normally get by with the money she receives from renting out her house on Airbnb, but her bookings have already canceled through May. Frantically applying to jobs in recent days has not been fruitful: One potential employer, the Children's Museum of Atlanta, has been forced to close its doors. Galiotto has already postponed a dental surgery she needs. But as a single mother with a 10-year-old son and bills coming due, she feels she has very few places to turn."}

And while signing the papers on your first home can feel like putting down roots in your perfect pad, the reality is that most millennial homeowners end up moving multiple times, due to changing family and career factors. That's why your home's resale value should be a primary focus right from the get-go."}
{"original": "Selling a first home can seem even more stressful than purchasing one, but these simple tips on boosting your home's resale value can go a long way in removing the stress from the equation. That's why we've partnered with H&R Block to bring homeowners a guide to home improvement projects with the best return on investment. Whether you're looking to sell now or in the distant future, knowing how to boost your property value is a great investment in your future."}
{"original": "Like a good haircut, a yard should frame the face of your house in the most flattering way possible. After all, your yard is wholly responsible for your property's first impressions. While it's pretty obvious advice to keep your lawn mowed and weed-free, certain outdoor renovation projects are more likely to add value than others."}
{"original": "Forget about add-ons like a pool or hot tub, which can signal to potential buyers more maintenance than enjoyment. Instead, focus on the classics. Making sure your yard has a couple of healthy, thriving trees is a trusty way to boost your home's resale value more than you may think. Check out the National Tree Benefit Calculator to see how trees in your zipcode affects property values, stormwater runoff, and other homeowner considerations. You'll also want to landscape with native plant species, which will boost your home's value without adding significant maintenance costs. When considering whether to tackle a yard renovation project, think about whether it will appeal to most people. A deck? Yes. A hedge maze? Not so much."}
{"original": "If you've wowed house hunters with your stellar landscaping, the next place their eye will travel to is the front door. And it plays a big factor in your home's resale value. In fact, according to a Cost vs. Value report conducted by Remodel, replacing an outdated entryway can have one of the biggest returns of any home improvement you could do yourself. Update the appearance of your whole home with a door that uses modern materials and a new color scheme."}
{"original": "Floors are another make or break factor for most buyers. Gone are the days of wall-to-wall carpeting signaling luxury; instead they just signal lots of dust mites and vacuuming. Wood is always a classic choice, with varieties like oak being safe bets amongst house hunters. Replacing floors that have signs of wood rot or termites is another great way to add value to your home. To show your floors some less costly TLC, repair broken tiles or add a well-placed nail to conceal a pesky squeak."}

{"original": "According to an annual survey done by the National Association of Realtors, millennials comprise 35 percent of all first-time homebuyers. This tech-savvy generation is looking for properties with smart home technology upgrades that will offer enhanced security, energy efficiency, and savings. Smart thermostats, lighting, and door locks can be a big draw for millennials, who value the ease of controlling their home by a smartphone app, even when they're away from home. And smart thermostats can save up to 10 percent annually in home heating costs, proving that connected home apps aren't just a passing trend."}
{"original": "Energy efficient upgrades can also bring tax credits to homeowners, so be sure to check out which updated homeowner credits are available through the U.S. Department of Energy. A 30 percent tax credit for installing solar energy systems has been extended through 2019, and credits are also available for several other energy efficient home improvement projects."}
{"original": "The average cost of a kitchen remodel is $20,000, according to Home Advisor. This is no small renovation cost, but when you consider that updated and modern kitchens are a main selling point, the cost of remodeling can significantly boost your resale value. And you may not need to go all-in on a renovation when a facelift can go a long way. Consider adding some combination of new stainless steel appliances, cabinets, flooring and a modern countertop to refresh your kitchen on a smaller budget, depending on which aspect of your current setup could most use a facelift."}
{"original": "While a kitchen remodel can get pricey pretty quickly, there's a lot of mileage you can get from a bathroom upgrade in the $500 range.

{"original": "LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - It's bombs away at the multiplexes."}
{"original": "Family film Monster Trucks tanked when it debuted over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, while Ben Affleck's Live by Night and Martin Scorsese's Silence suffered moribund national expansions. Their failures will lead to tens of millions of dollars in red ink for the studios that backed them. Sleepless, an action-thriller with Jamie Foxx, also suffered an underwhelming opening, getting lost in the onslaught of new releases."}
{"original": "There's almost an unprecedented number of films out there, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at comScore. It's got to be somewhat daunting and overwhelming for moviegoers."}
{"original": "Amidst the carnage, Fox and Chernin Entertainment's Hidden Figures retained its box office crown in its second weekend of wide release, earning $20.5 million for the weekend and a projected $25.3 million for the long weekend. That will push its total to $59.7 million. The historical drama about African-American NASA workers during the early days of the space program has been one of the biggest breakouts of awards season."}
{"original": "Hidden Figures faced stiff competition from Lionsgate's La La Land, riding high after sweeping the Golden Globe Awards, and STX's The Bye Bye Man, which earned $14.5 million and $13.4 million, respectively. La La Land is widely expected to dominate the Oscar nominations. The musical about lovestruck Angelenos should finish the four-day weekend with another $17.5 million in domestic receipts, which would bring its stateside total to more than $77 million."}
{"original": "The Bye Bye Man's strong reception is welcome news for STX, which had expected the film to open to roughly $10 million. The horror movie about college students grappling with a deadly supernatural figure cost less than $8 million to produce. It should make $15 million over the four-day holiday. Studio executives said they weren't afraid of the crush of new releases heading into the weekend, because they felt they were the only film targeted to younger females. STX also wanted to release the picture on Friday the 13th, a marketing hook for scary movies."}
{"original": "We knew we were going to be able to get that core audience of females, said Kevin Grayson, STX's domestic distribution president. Not only did they go on Friday, they continued to go all weekend."}
{"original": "Heading into the weekend, most analysts expected CBS Films and Lionsgate's Patriots Day to put up more of a fight. The drama about the Boston Marathon Bombing earned $12 million after moving from seven theaters to 3,120 locations. It could make $14.3 million over the four-day stretch. That's below projections ― analysts expected the film to earn as much as $18 million. However, the studios believe that Patriots Day could benefit from enthusiastic word-of-mouth. Audiences gave the film a rare A+ CinemaScore."}
{"original": "Monster Trucks' failure seemed preordained. Last year, Paramount took a $115 million write-down on the film. Monster Trucks' reception justified that fiscal white-flag waving. It opened to a pallid $10.5 million and a projected $14.1 million over the holiday, a disastrous result given its $125 million budget."}
{"original": "The movie works for the audience it's intended to work for, said Megan Colligan, Paramount's marketing and distribution head. It did really well in the midwest and south. It was over 50 percent kids. The balance was good between boys and girls...without a whole lot of competition, it will keep plugging along."}
{"original": "Paramount has hit a rough patch. The studio was embroiled in a corporate power struggle that pitted the controlling Redstone family against Philippe Dauman, the former chairman of Paramount's parent company Viacom. The Redstones ultimately prevailed, but the pressure is now on Paramount chief Brad Grey to prove he can deliver more hits. The studio scored with Fences and Arrival, but lost millions on the likes of Allied, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, and Ben-Hur."}
{"original": "Live by Night's troubles will hit Affleck hard. He directed, produced, and wrote the Dennis LeHane adaptation, and took a starring role as a charismatic rum runner. Warner Bros. is releasing the $65 million production. It earned a sallow $5.4 million and should end the four-day holiday with just over $6 million, which more or less leaves the gangster picture on the slab. Affleck should be on firmer commercial ground reprising his Dark Knight role in Justice League later this year."}
{"original": "Open Road's Sleepless didn't fare too well either, although it cost significantly less than Live by Night and Monster Trucks. The $30 million production stars Foxx as a morally compromised cop whose extracurricular activities endanger his son. It kicked off with a meager $8.5 million and should end the long weekend with $10.1 million in the till. The studio says that Sleepless will make its way into the black because Open Road covered its financial exposure by selling foreign distribution rights and through tax rebates."}
{"original": "Given our economics, this $10 million opening on 'Sleepless' will certainly become profitable for Open Road, said a spokeswoman."}
{"original": "Then there's Silence, a decades-in-the-making religious drama. Scorsese struggled for years to cobble together the financing for this story about Jesuit priests who risk torture and death to spread the gospel in feudal Japan, but audiences seemed to have little appetite for his rumination on faith. Silence expanded from 51 theaters to 747 locations, earning just over $2 million for the long weekend. The $50 million film was financed independently. Paramount is distributing the picture."}
{"original": "Marty Scorsese is one of the greatest living filmmakers, said Colligan. He's earned the right to independently finance a movie and make the movie he wants to make. This is a complicated, beautiful film, one that movie critics have named the best of the year and one that will be taught in film schools for years. It needs to be judged on its merits."}
{"original": "Holdovers Sing and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story continued to show strength, with both films earning roughly $13.8 million. Sing, the latest collaboration between the Despicable Me team of Universal and Illumination, has earned $237.2 million stateside. Rogue One is now the top-grossing 2016 release with more than $500 million in receipts. It will cross the $1 billion mark at the global box office this week."}

Taking the next step (opening a business to teach English as a foreign language) seemed natural, expected even. So, I did, with my sister. In 2014 when bills and tax just kept piling up and the number of students remained the same and too low, we closed the business. It was not an easy decision.

The orders are part of a blitz of early executive actions unraveling former President Donald Trump's legacy, from his botched response to the coronavirus pandemic to his ban on transgender Americans serving in the military."}
{"original": "Today is climate day at the White House, which means that today is jobs day at the White House, Biden said, kicking off a signing ceremony Wednesday afternoon at the White House. In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We can't wait any longer."}

{"original": "Put A Freeze On New Federal Oil And Gas Leases"}
{"original": "The order directs the secretary of the Interior Department to pause to the extent possible new oil and gas leasing activity on federal lands and offshore waters. It also kicks off a rigorous review of all existing leasing and permitting practices related to fossil fuel development on public lands and waters, according to the administration."}
{"original": "The action does not impact existing federal leases or drilling activity on state, private and tribal lands."}
{"original": "Experts say the move is unlikely to severely impact the oil and gas sector, which maintains drilling rights on more than 20 million federal acres not yet in production and stockpiled hundreds of federal leases and permits in the waning days of Trump's tenure."}
{"original": "The licenses that currently are operating are not going to be disrupted, Jennifer Granholm, Biden's nominee to lead the Department of Energy, said during her confirmation hearing Wednesday. They will continue to operate. The oil and gas industry in particular, they have 10,000 licenses. They can continue to permit and deploy."}
{"original": "Andrew Cullen / Reuters An oil pumpjack is seen near Aneth, Utah. More than half of the 26 million federal acres leased to the oil and gas industry are not being used for production, according to the Interior Department."}
{"original": "Still, the industry and its allies have slammed Biden's order as an attack on American energy and jobs."}
{"original": "Halting production on federal lands and waters will not halt the demand for energy or the products we depend on, Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Energy Institute, said in a call with reporters. It will simply shift it away from states with federal lands to those without, or even to foreign sources, and in the process cause a great deal of economic harm to those states."}

{"original": "This could be easier said than done. The federal government funnels nearly $15 billion a year to oil, gas and coal companies in the form of tax breaks and subsidies, according to research from the climate advocacy group Oil Change International. That's on top of the roughly $5 billion states give out each year. But some policymakers have taken a broader view of what constitutes a subsidy, leading to outlandishly high estimates of the federal benefits fossil fuel companies enjoy. Debates over what to cut, and what the effect may be on consumers, could slow or even derail the process of paring down federal support for fossil fuels, and the order's vague language doesn't offer much guidance."}

{"original": "Approximately one-quarter of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuel extraction on federal lands, according to federal data."}

{"original": "It would be a modern take on the Civilian Conservation Corps, a Great Depression-era federal program that put hundreds of thousands of young, unmarried men to work building bridges and dams and planting trees."}
{"original": "... And A Lot Of Other Potentially Well-Paying Jobs."}
{"original": "One of the biggest problems for the clean-energy industry is that fossil fuel jobs are significantly more unionized and pay higher wages. Workers in many states have tried to organize at wind and solar jobs. But the loosening of labor laws over the past four decades made that process challenging, meaning long-standing jobs on coal trains, in oil fields, and at refineries are more likely to have union representation and the hard-fought wages and protections that come with it."}
{"original": "Biden's order on federal spending seeks to change that dynamic. The order directs federal agencies to decarbonize by buying carbon-free electricity and zero-emissions vehicles. But it goes a step further, requiring those purchases be Made in America and directing agencies to apply and strictly enforce prevailing wages and benefits for that work and to ensure that any jobs created with funds to address the climate crisis are good jobs with a choice to join a union."}
{"original": "Under Trump, the White House gutted the Office of Science and Technology Policy, downsizing its workforce from 135 to 45 officials.

{"original": "LOS ANGELES ― California is now the largest state in the nation to have legal and regulated recreational marijuana. And while that alone is a blow to the prohibitionist policies of the failed war on drugs, a lesser-known provision in the state's new law, along with efforts in a few local jurisdictions, aims to repair some of the damage that the criminalization of marijuana has done to so many communities."}
{"original": "California's Proposition 64 ballot measure was not only about marijuana legalization, it was one of the most progressive sentencing and criminal justice reforms in the entire country, said Eunisses Hernandez, a policy coordinator at Drug Policy Alliance, a leading drug policy reform group."}
{"original": "A year ago, voters approved Proposition 64 to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes and reduce criminal penalties for various marijuana-related offenses for adults and juveniles. It also authorized a new process for individuals in the state to get previous marijuana-related convictions retroactively reduced, reclassified as lesser offenses or dismissed altogether."}
{"original": "The process could end up helping hundreds of thousands of people whose lives have been disrupted or derailed over activities that became legal as of Jan. 1. Criminal convictions can have devastating consequences long after the offense was committed, making it difficult to obtain employment, bank loans and housing."}
{"original": "In many ways, Proposition 64 has already been a success because we've ended the unnecessary and arbitrary criminalization of Californians around this issue, and helped tens of thousands of people who were unjustly unable to seek career and education opportunities due to prior non-violent marijuana offenses, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom told HuffPost."}
{"original": "But relief is not automatic under the new law. Individuals who want their marijuana convictions reclassified or cleared must submit an application to a court. They may also need to hire an attorney to help them through the process. About 5,000 people have so far applied to have marijuana sentences reviewed for possible relief, according to data compiled by the Judicial Council of California. And while it's encouraging that some are taking advantage of the new process, it's an extremely small fraction of the number of people who have been arrested for marijuana offenses in the state."}
{"original": "California produces vast amounts of marijuana and has done so for years. In 1996, it became the first state to legalize medical marijuana. And despite the passage of more permissive laws, there were still thousands of marijuana-related arrests annually. From 2006 to 2015, there were nearly 500,000 people arrested for marijuana offenses, a recent DPA report found. And Rodney Holcombe, a legal fellow at DPA, said that there may be close to 1 million people in the state who have convictions that could now be eligible for relief."}
{"original": "Creating a safe, legal and tightly regulated system for adult-use marijuana is, at its core, about criminal justice reform and fixing a broken system that has disproportionately harmed low-income Californians and communities of color, said Newsom, a proponent of Prop. 64."}
{"original": "Beyond sentencing, some local governments are making efforts to further repair damage from criminalization by enacting equity programs that allow for victims of the war on drugs to have application priority during the marijuana business licensing process."}
{"original": "As we know, communities of color have been most negatively impacted by marijuana prohibition throughout the years ― folks have been incarcerated for activity that is now completely legal ― and you have a new demographic now coming in taking over these spaces making millions of dollars through this industry, Holcombe said. These programs can provide a tremendous opportunity for low-income folks, folks of color, folks who have lived in neighborhoods that have been over-policed, especially during the height of the war on drugs."}
{"original": "To that end, Oakland launched the nation's first equity permit program earlier this year. It sets aside half of all medical and recreational marijuana business licenses for applications by individuals hit hardest by marijuana criminalization. In their research during the development of the program, Oakland City Council found that over the past two decades, the black community has been extraordinarily over-represented in marijuana-related arrests in the region. In 1998, up to 90 percent of marijuana arrests involved a black suspect. By comparison, just 3.9 percent of those arrested were white."}
{"original": "To qualify as an equity applicant, individuals must be an Oakland resident whose annual income is less than 80 percent of the average in the region and either have a previous marijuana conviction or have lived in over-policed areas of the city for 10 of the last 20 years. For those who qualify, the application fee is also waived."}
{"original": "City councils in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento are also considering equity programs."}
{"original": "Holcombe hopes that local jurisdictions ― and other states that may legalize one day ― give a leg up in the industry to even more people, especially those who don't have the funds to start a business and who may have a marijuana conviction that makes getting a bank loan difficult. Holcombe said cities could address this through allocating a portion of marijuana sales tax to fund these equity applicants' start-up businesses while also prioritizing women and minority business applicants."}
{"original": "The state's marijuana industry already has a projected value of $7 billion, and, as more marijuana retailers obtain permits, state and local governments are expected to collect $1 billion annually in tax revenue. With such an enormous marketplace, California should prioritize access for those who had been targeted by anti-marijuana laws, Erik Altieri, executive director of marijuana policy reform group NORML, told HuffPost."}
{"original": "As states start dialing back their war on marijuana consumers, Altieri said, it is important that those who were most negatively impacted by our oppressive prohibition are able to see previous harms remedied as best as possible and be given the opportunity to participate in the benefits that come along with legalization and regulation."}
{"original": "As Americans across the nation scramble to file their tax returns next week, one Oregon man is fighting that requirement in court, claiming his Christian beliefs about abortion bar him from paying his taxes."}
{"original": "Michael Bowman has refused to file a tax return or pay income tax since at least 1999 because he doesn't want his tax dollars to go toward abortions, The Oregonian reports."}
{"original": "I'm not a tax protester. I love my country. I have a duty to my country. I have a duty to my conscience, Bowman told The Oregonian."}
{"original": "Federal law already prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest or to save a woman's life. And courts have previously ruled that the government's right to collect taxes supersedes individuals' religious or anti-war objections to paying them."}
{"original": "Still, Bowman has notched one victory. On Wednesday, a federal judge dismissed a tax evasion charge against him, saying that the government had failed to prove that he tried to conceal or mislead officials about his income. Prosecutors claimed the 53-year-old contract engineer from Columbia City had been cashing his work checks and keeping his bank balance low specifically so that tax collectors couldn't garnish his account."}
{"original": "U.S. District Judge Michael W. Mosman ruled that Bowman's actions didn't amount to tax evasion. The charge was dismissed without prejudice, meaning that prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office for Oregon can seek a new indictment, The Associated Press reports."}
{"original": "Bowman still faces four counts of willful failure to file tax returns, which are misdemeanors."}
{"original": "A federal grand jury indicted Bowman in February 2017. Between 2002 and 2014, prosecutors said, the Internal Revenue Service had sent him multiple notices that his federal taxes were due. The indictment alleges that Bowman owes the government at least $356,857, including penalties."}
{"original": "Bowman laid out his reasons for not paying income taxes in this video:"}
{"original": "In a court document filed this February, he wrote that he is a Christian who has forged his spiritual identity based on the Holy Bible. He explained that his refusal to pay taxes stems from his religious beliefs and a desire to keep a clean conscience, by not funding the death of the innocent."}
{"original": "A woman has the right to choose, but apparently, the prosecutor feels I do not have a right to choose, Bowman wrote."}
{"original": "Our Nation supports LGBTs, Transgenders & illegal immigrants, but Christians values are ignored; even frowned upon, and destroyed via laws that force us to be party to bad things, he added."}

{"original": "In Ontario's Greater Golden Horseshoe (the GTA, Hamilton-Burlington, Oakville-Milton, Guelph, Kitchener-Waterloo, Cambridge, Brantford, the Niagara Region, Barrie and nearby cottage country), the balance between supply and demand has become increasingly tight. This is expected to lead to continued double-digit price growth, resulting in further erosion in affordability and sales activity in the absence of a significant and sustained rise in new supply, CREA says."}
{"original": "Against this backdrop, add the delicate and often confusing issue of policy. In Ontario, for example, the provincial government is facing hard lobbying from multiple sources -- chief among them the Ontario Home Builders' Association, Ontario Real Estate Association, and the Building Industry and Land Development Association -- to, in short, make more land available on which to build lowrise homes. And to speed up the approvals process."}
{"original": "The Canadian Home Builders' Association (CHBA) is also growing more vocal. In early March, it released an in-depth analysis of key factors underlying housing market conditions. The Housing Supply Deficit - Not Enough Homes for Families with Young Children, points to a significant and growing mismatch between housing demand and what the residential construction industry is able to supply, given planning and zoning patterns and lack of available serviced land. The report notes that if current trends continue, Canada will see a shortfall of 300,000 family-oriented homes over the next decade."}
{"original": "There has been a lot of commentary around what's driving house prices in markets like Vancouver and the GTA, says CHBA CEO Kevin Lee. Much of this overlooks the fundamental factors of supply and demand, and the increasing number of young families trying to achieve homeownership."}

{"original": "This week's Torah portion, Ki Tissa, suggests two poles of leadership, a useful model for election season or any time. The reading begins with a call to order for the entire Israelite enterprise. Everyone is asked to make a contribution of one half-shekel as enrollment in the community, a kind of head tax to fund core services represented by the Tent of Meeting. The Tent of Meeting will eventually become the Tabernacle, the hub of Israelite life during their wanderings in the desert; the Tabernacle, in turn, becomes the Temple when the Israelites settle in the Promised Land."}
{"original": "While this act of civic allegiance--death and taxes were just as sure in ancient days as now, it seems--may not have been greeted with enthusiasm, it is necessary for this newly established people to marshal the resources to fund the center of communal life. In the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., I like to pay taxes. With them, I buy civilization. The same was true for the Israelites, but the structure of this taxation also already hints at something uniquely leveling for this emergent nation: Everyone who is entered in the records, from the age of twenty years up, shall give the Lord's offering: the rich shall not pay more and the poor shall not pay less than half a shekel when giving the Lord's offering as expiation of your persons (Exodus 30:14-15)."}
{"original": "A flat tax, applied to all at the same rate, represents a communal trust. Then, later, when these funds are meant to be put to use, the approach changes radically: The Lord spoke to Moses: See, I have singled out Betzalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. I have endowed him with a divine spirit of skill, ability, and knowledge in every kind of craft (Exodus 31: 1-3). Here, a single leader with unique skills is endowed by the Divine to serve a purpose that everyone needs--namely, the construction of the very Tent of Meeting that everyone had contributed to equally just verses before."}
{"original": "So what kind of society is this? Do all give equally of themselves to support the communal institution from which all will benefit? Or are certain individuals set apart with unique skills that they and only they can manifest in order to ensure that the needs of society are met?"}
{"original": "An answer to this question is revealed in a scene following soon after, one of the most infamous conflicts of the Hebrew Bible: the Golden Calf. Moses has ascended Mount Sinai to confer directly with the Divine about the laws and statutes that the Israelites will be required to follow in order to fulfill their covenant with God. But while Moses, like Betzalel, has been selected as a unique individual to serve a purpose for the whole people, the Israelites grow restless: When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, the people gathered against Aaron and said to him, 'Come make us a god who shall go before us, for that man Moses, who brought us from the land of Egypt--we do not know what has happened to him (Exodus 32: 1)."}
{"original": "A people without a leader to provide them a sense of security in their collective purpose can turn quickly to easy answers, pooling resources towards the exact opposite of the generative mission. At the beginning of Ki Tissa, with Moses' guidance (and Betzalel operationalizing the effort), each had given equally and methodically in support of a central hub of worship and law. When Moses' absence creates a vacuum, the people are easily drawn in another direction, which results in a schism. Moses returns from Mount Sinai, sees the Golden Calf, and shatters the tablets of the Ten Commandments on the ground. Punishments follow, not the least of which is a lack of trust between the people, their leader, and the Divine."}
{"original": "Neither this Torah portion nor the ones that follow offer a definitive answer about how best to lead and be lead, in the balance between unique individuals and the masses. We do learn, however, that the forever unfolding story of leadership requires the constant pursuit of balance."}
{"original": "Indeed, the same God who turns divine wrath against the Israelites, following their embrace of the Golden Calf and the destruction of the first set of tablets of the Ten Commandments, accompanies the second set of tablets with a litany of the thirteen attributes of divine mercy that will become a staple of Jewish liturgy. Here, broken trust is redefined. People and leaders and divine callings continually test and try each other--pushing, correcting, realigning, reframing."}
{"original": "Perhaps there is no permanent balance between the charismatic leader with a unique purpose and a people that must shape its destiny by its own hands. Wrestling with responsibility, in times of both challenge and success, belongs to everyone. When a small class of leaders takes control, the wheel must inevitably recalibrate in the direction of democratic involvement, as painful as those twists and turns may be. Charismatic, skilled leaders will continue to emerge, their power and vision balanced by the civic engagement of the masses. In this sense, the two visions of leadership in Ki Tissa are not poles, but oars of a boat working together, balancing movement forward during a long journey even in stormy waters."}

{"original": "PA Archive/PA Images Rachel Reeves says laws must be tightened to prevent exploitation of workers."}
{"original": "MPs have called for a change in the law to prevent companies exploiting workers. The work and pensions and business, energy and industrial strategy select committees have published a joint report and draft Parliamentary bill aimed at closing loopholes which members say allow companies - including Uber and Deliveroo - to use bogus self-employment status as a route to cheap labour and tax avoidance. They want laws to be tightened to reflect problems within the gig economy and say willingness by companies to take advantage of workers must not be allowed to become a competitive advantage. DWP committee chair Frank Field said: The two committees are today presenting the prime minister with an opportunity to fulfil the promise she made on the steps of Downing Street on her first day in office, with a draft bill that would end the mass exploitation of ordinary, hard-working people in the gig economy. The bill would put good business on a level playing field, not being undercut by bad business. It is time to close the loopholes that allow irresponsible companies to underpay workers, avoid taxes and free ride on our welfare system."}
{"original": "PA Wire/PA Images Frank Field wants to end 'mass exploitation of workers'."}
{"original": "The committees want the government to rule out any changes to legislation that would undermine the national minimum and living wage, as well as end loopholes which allow agency workers to be paid less than permanent staff. They also want companies to either guarantee workers a set number of hours each week, or compensate them for uncertainty. Rachel Reeves, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said: Uber, Deliveroo and others like to bang the drum for the benefits of flexibility for their workforce but currently all the burden of this flexibility is picked up by taxpayers and workers. This must change. We say that companies should pay higher wages when they are asking people to work extra hours or on zero-hours contracts. Recent cases demonstrate a need for greater clarity in the law to protect workers. Responsible businesses deserve a level-playing field to compete, not a system which rewards unscrupulous businesses. We need new laws but also much tougher enforcement, to weed out those businesses seeking to exploit complex labour laws, and workers, for their competitive advantage."}

{"original": "Digital nomads are truly a new breed of worker. Often known as laptop entrepreneurs, these fully-digital, tech-savvy workers can work from just about anywhere as long as they have an internet connection and a power outlet."}
{"original": "This is advantageous for many reasons - if you work location-independently, you get much more opportunities to travel, and to stay in different, exotic locales for extended periods of time, experiencing everything that a different area and culture has to offer."}
{"original": "It's not all sunshine and roses, though. When you work as a digital nomad, you have your own fair share of problems that are unique to your lifestyle."}
{"original": "Whether you're a digital nomad looking to up your quality-of-life, or just curious about the challenges that are faced by these unique, 21st-century workers, read on - we'll talk about the three biggest challenges digital nomads face, and how to solve them."}
{"original": "When you don't make time to have alone time, body time, and eat healthy, eventually you will break down and start feeling like you are dragging. Your quickie cheap massages in Southeast Asia just don't cut it. - Brook Woolf, Founder of Indigo Warrior"}
{"original": "Brook is an American who has been a digital nomad for three years, and a nomad for the past eight years. Currently based in Chiang Mai, Thailand, she is an empowerment coach who helps others adopt the travel lifestyle."}
{"original": "This is one of the biggest challenges that digital nomads face. The fact that you're able to travel freely, work at your own pace, and do your work from anywhere in the world with an internet connection means that you're free from a consistent, 9-5 schedule."}
{"original": "Add this to the fact that you've probably got clients in every time zone in the world - and are always moving through your own time zones - and you can have some real issues. Many people need the rigorous schedule of a typical workday to perform efficiently, and the lifestyle of a digital nomad can often preclude a standard, daily schedule."}
{"original": "Many digital nomads solve this issue by simply having long work days - up to 12 hours or more - and taking longer, intermittent breaks throughout the day."}
{"original": "By mixing work and play throughout the day, you can maintain a schedule - without maintaining a schedule. If you're up and connected to the internet, you should be ready to work at a moment's notice."}
{"original": "And once you've finished your work for the day, unplug immediately - this will allow you to have a clear delineation between work and play, and help you maintain a more consistent schedule."}
{"original": "A solution that works really well, as I recently found out, is traveling and partying hard for a month, fracture a leg, and then, while recovering for three months, you can focus on your work like you never did before."}
{"original": "Another good but less innovative solution is to just self-impose and actually follow a balanced schedule, in which you allocated plenty time for work, but also for traveling & doing stuff. - Sergiu Valentin Vlad, Founder of The Nomadic Year"}
{"original": "Sergiu is a Web Developer from Romania, currently residing in Penang, Malaysia."}
{"original": "If you're a digital nomad, you likely don't have a permanent address. You probably haven't rented an apartment in more than a year, and spend your time traveling around, staying in hostels or other inexpensive accommodations, and working in coffee shops and internet cafes."}
{"original": "As freeing as this is, the 20th-century world still hasn't caught up to this paperless, mailbox-free lifestyle. Americans will need an address for tax purposes, and digital nomads of every nationality will probably need a permanent home base to which important mail and bills can be sent."}
{"original": "The Solution? Build A Home Base or Get a PO Box"}
{"original": "One option for this is simply changing your address to that of a close loved one, or somebody who you visit often. You'll be able to get updates on the mail you get directly from them and check your mail whenever you come back home."}

{"original": "Travelers know the pain of location-locked internet services. In extreme situations - such as the Great Firewall of China - entire websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and others can be totally blocked by internet service providers in other countries."}
{"original": "And no matter what country you're in, you may be unable to access the version of Netflix, Youtube, and other websites that are available in your home country, which can lead to some issues when you're trying to relax and entertain yourself."}
{"original": "The Solution? Change Your IP Address - Or Buy A VPN Subscription"}
{"original": "One easy solution to this is simply to change IP address to that of your home country so as to access the media services of your country of origin."}
{"original": "However, according to Harsha Reddy, who has lived in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Madagascar and other countries along with other digital nomadic colleagues, says,"}
{"original": "Some firewalls and location-based trackers are harder to fool, and won't be defeated by a simple IP change. These can be beaten, however, by a VPN - A Virtual Protected Network."}
{"original": "Originally from India, Harsha is currently based in Prague, Czech Republic, and runs Skilled.co among other startups."}
{"original": "These encrypted services route all of your web traffic through a virtual computer of sorts located in the geographic location of your choice, essentially functioning to make it appear as if you are accessing the internet from that country."}
{"original": "There are both free and paid versions of most VPNS - paid VPNS usually offer more security, higher bandwidth, and a more reliable service."}
{"original": "If you are a digital nomad in a country that blocks access to many of your preferred sites, a VPN is certainly a worthy investment."}
{"original": "Though being a digital nomad is appealing, it's not for everyone. These three examples are just a few of the difficulties faced by digital nomads, and there are certainly plenty of other problems that these laptop entrepreneurs have to deal with."}
{"original": "However, if you ask any digital nomad, they wouldn't trade it for the world - the unreliable internet, difficult clients, and tough work schedules are all worth it, because they get to live, work, and travel on their own terms."}
{"original": "People typically don't want to pay more taxes than they need to, but a tax refund implies just that. Withholding more money than necessary each paycheck means that an individual forgoes the opportunity to earn interest on that money elsewhere. Approximately 77 percent of taxpayers receive a tax refund, according to the IRS."}
{"original": "Furthermore, some of the most popular ways to spend tax refund money can easily turn into some of the biggest tax refund mistakes. A recent GOBankingRates survey revealed several popular uses for tax refunds that can boost your financial well being, or work against it. Click through for 13 of the worst ways to spend your hard-earned tax refund check."}
{"original": "1. Pay Down Credit Card Debt"}
{"original": "Using a tax refund check to pay off debt is the most popular way to spend a tax refund, as 27 percent of respondents plan to do so, according to the GOBankingRates survey. The goal in spending a tax refund should be long-term financial security, said Tim Gagnon, a professor of accounting at Northeastern University's D'Amore-McKim School of Business."}
{"original": "Just reducing [a credit] card balance to run it back up does no good, he said. Eliminating a credit card completely, paying off a high-interest loan and avoiding another similar debt is, however, evidence that your spending habits are under control."}
{"original": "If you're incurring credit card debt throughout the year and then paying it off with a big tax refund, you should consider moderating your spending and adjusting your tax withholding, said Benjamin Sullivan, a certified financial planner with Palisades Hudson Financial Group."}
{"original": "2. Put It in a Savings Account"}
{"original": "Putting your funds into a savings account was the second most popular way to spend a tax refund, according to the GOBankingRates survey. Twenty-five percent of respondents chose this option, despite the low interest rates currently offered on most savings accounts."}
{"original": "This option may make sense if you don't have a sufficient emergency fund, but otherwise that money could do better elsewhere while interest rates remain so low, said Sullivan. Especially for younger taxpayers, consider contributing your refund to your retirement savings or other long-term investment accounts, where your long-time horizon can result in more robust growth."}
{"original": "This is a good strategy, said Jessie Seaman, a managing licensed tax professional at Tax Defense Network. Seaman suggested taxpayers consider a high-interest bond, or consulting with a financial advisor to identify smart, long-term investments."}
{"original": "3. Deposit It in a Checking Account"}
{"original": "Perhaps worse than putting the check into a low-interest savings account is placing it in your checking account and watching it dwindle. With a nice chunk of cash now lining your coffers, it might be tempting to take off your budgeting hat and splurge on steak or quality wine. You're also probably not earning much, if any, interest on that money."}
{"original": "Refunds are made of your hard-earned money, and they should be spent like a normal paycheck, said Michael Eckstein, a tax accountant with Eckstein Tax Services. That means avoiding the urge to splurge, and paying down debt or saving for the future."}
{"original": "Putting the money toward a vacation was how 9 percent of respondents said they would spend their refund check, according to the GOBankingRates survey. However, an expensive vacation, though not a money pit, is a means of instant gratification that is not tangible ... you do not gain anything subsequent to this expenditure, said Ravi Ramnarain, a CPA and an accounting and tax expert."}
{"original": "Seaman, however, said that a vacation is not such a bad thing, but added that you shouldn't plan so far ahead that you spend the money before you have it. The government may take longer than you're expecting to process your refund, Seaman explained. You might get lucky, but there are a number of reasons why there might be a legitimate delay in getting your payment from Uncle Sam."}
{"original": "5. Buy a Car or Home"}
{"original": "Putting a tax refund toward a major purchase, like a car or a home, was the fourth most popular way to spend a tax refund check, with 5 percent of the respondents planning to do so, according to the GOBankingRates survey. However, Ramnarain said that a purchase that disregards the long term is tantamount to throwing money away."}
{"original": "When deciding whether to purchase a car or a home, it's important to make sure you can afford any monthly payments and upkeep. Calculate the significant interest payments and maintenance required, and those two elements could empty out your bank account in no time, he said."}
{"original": "Ramnarain said that individuals should make money work for them, rather than the other way around. Depending on the actual amount received, good choices would be government securities, or possibly a down payment on an inexpensive piece of real estate that has long-term cash-generating potential, he said. Subsequent tax refunds can be used to pay off any mortgage balance that is still outstanding."}
{"original": "6. Splurge on a Luxury Purchase"}
{"original": "Using a refund check to splurge on a purchase, such as a TV or shoes, was also a popular choice for 4 percent of respondents to the GOBankingRates survey. However, Sullivan recommended taking some time to plan the most effective way to use tax refund money. If you opt for a big-ticket purchase, it should be something that works within your overall budget, he said."}
{"original": "While it may feel like free money, a tax refund is actually the government repaying you for an interest-free loan, said Sullivan. It's money you earned, and should be used as responsibly as any other funds. Don't consider your refund a separate bucket for free spending."}
{"original": "When it comes to splurging on luxury purchases, it's important to develop good fiscal habits rather than bad, said Pauline Paquin, founder of Reachfinancialindependence.com. Blowing the money on stuff you don't really need -- nights out, shoes -- will condition yourself to thinking that when a windfall happens, the money should disappear as soon as possible, she said. That is a terrible idea."}
{"original": "Three-quarters of taxpayers get a tax refund check, and the IRS reported that the average refund is slightly less than $3,000. However, think of it this way: Your tax dollars have already functioned as an interest-free loan to the government. If you use it to finance new debt, you essentially lose money again by paying on interest."}
{"original": "If you have cash, consider a purchase outright that does not involve financing or interest payments. Don't use your tax refund as a down payment on a car that is financed, said Yvette D. Best of accounting and tax preparation service Best Services Unlimited. It would be a better choice to buy a car in full. Then all you have to worry about is upkeep and insurance."}
{"original": "For those who do choose to go on vacation, if gambling is on the itinerary they might want to first consider their odds. Unfortunately, the odds of making money from gambling are extremely low. Your chance of winning at craps is 13.9 percent, for three-card poker it's 30 percent and slot machines it's 6.6 percent, according to the latest figures from the Nevada Gaming Control Board."}
{"original": "I have seen clients take their refunds to Foxwoods [Casino] for the excitement (a bad idea), or buy that playoff ticket which is very overpriced, which gives no future financial reward, said Gagnon. Refunds should be put toward a future benefit, like funding an IRA, 401k, a child's educational fund -- a goal for the future."}
{"original": "A sudden influx of cash can whet the appetite and lead to irresponsible and rash decisions -- such as investing in a get-rich-quick scheme. It might be tempting to place the cash somewhere where you are convinced that it will grow quickly, but many such schemes are just scams, according to the Federal Trade Commission."}
{"original": "Sometimes when people receive a lump sum of money, they think of ways on how to make more of it, said Best. Investing in get-rich-quick schemes is the fastest way to blow it all. Despite the fact that your tax refund money may seem like a sudden bonus, this is your money. Before investing it in any venture, check it out thoroughly and, when in doubt, don't invest at all."}
{"original": "10. Spend the Money Before You Have It"}
{"original": "The expectation of a sizable tax refund can encourage people to overspend. For example, if a couple thinks they will be getting a large refund check from the IRS, they might extend their home renovations. However, this can be a dangerous strategy -- especially if your tax refund is delayed."}
{"original": "The IRS is increasing strategies to fight fraud and, therefore, increasing processing time, which is expected to lead to long waits for refunds this year, according to CBS News. Experts recommended filing early for a quicker refund. It's also a good idea to not spend it before you have it."}
{"original": "It is easy to start spending when you know a tax refund is on its way, said Best. But don't do it. You don't want to find yourself overextended if your tax refund doesn't arrive as scheduled."}
{"original": "11. Apply the Refund to Next Year's Taxes"}
{"original": "When you submit your documents, the IRS asks whether you want to apply the refund to next year's taxes. This option might be a good idea if you find that you often owe taxes and are not withholding a sufficient amount from your paycheck. However, if you typically receive a refund, there's no need to pay more at the outset."}
{"original": "One of the worst things you can do with a tax refund is apply it towards next year's taxes, Scott Alan Turner, a personal finance podcaster and expert. You're essentially letting the government borrow your money for free for a year and not pay you any interest on it."}
{"original": "12. Use It to Buy Stock"}
{"original": "If you decide to buy stock, make sure you devote time to research and understand the market first. Additionally, investing in one type of stock will not give you a balanced portfolio, which is required for a steady, long-term return."}
{"original": "A better option is to diversify -- for example, by adding funds to a 401k, or buying bonds, according to US News. Exchange-traded funds are also an option if you like to invest in certain industry sectors. Those close to retirement might consider choosing bond funds that appeal to them."}
{"original": "13. Lend It to a Friend"}
{"original": "It can be hard to say no if someone close to you is in need. In fact, trying to help a friend by giving them money could merely exacerbate their questionable fiscal habits and not help them at all, according to wealth psychologist Kathleen Burns Kingsbury in MoneyTalksNews."}
{"original": "A better option, according to Kingsbury, might be to help them set up a budget or encourage them to find help for their financial difficulties. If you must lend money, realize that you might not get it back. You can obtain a promissory note that you could have notarized, but consider whether you really would take that person to court if they failed to repay you."}
{"original": "Ideally, your goal in spending a tax refund would be to consider a long-term strategy, and not waste the cash on unnecessary items. It might also be wise to consider withholding less during the year so that you can invest more and benefit from the interest, rather than allowing the IRS to assume your interest."}

The government is hoping these packages, which include subsidising the wages of 120,000 apprentices and giving payments of up to $100,000 for small businesses, will boost the economy in the same way the 2009 stimulus package, issued by the Rudd government, did. One Or Two Payments? More than six million welfare recipients will get a one-off cash payment from March 31, with most people expected to have it in their bank account between March 30 and April 17.

Scott Morrison announced on Sunday that the government will temporarily add an extra $550 a fortnight to the Jobseeker Payment (previously known as Newstart).

{"original": "On Tuesday, Senate Democrats voted to advance a resolution that would allow for $1.9 trillion in new spending through a special process called budget reconciliation. Legislation passed through budget reconciliation only needs a simple majority to pass.

Senate rules dictate that any legislation passed through this budgetary maneuver must have a direct effect on spending or revenue, and, based on how Democrats wrote the resolution, it cannot increase the deficit by more than $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years."}
{"original": "That may make it difficult to pass some of President Joe Biden's proposals, like increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 or making more permanent changes to unemployment insurance."}
{"original": "Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) threw another wrench in the push to lift the minimum wage to $15 on Wednesday, telling reporters he supported a level that was responsible and reasonable. He said in his state that might be an $11 minimum wage when adjusted for inflation."}
{"original": "Despite moving ahead with reconciliation, Biden and Senate Democrats are still rhetorically signaling an openness to working with Republicans on a relief package. A group of 10 Republican senators, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah), made a $618 billion counterproposal earlier this week, and met with the president on Monday."}
{"original": "Collins said the meeting with Biden was productive, but the administration seems more concerned about the prospect of passing too little aid, rather than going too big. The GOP plan is far less than what the Biden administration and economists say is necessary to adequately address the economic and public health crises."}
{"original": "I don't think anybody changed anybody's mind on anything at this point, but at least he knows the door is open for discussion, Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), another senator who spoke with Biden, said Wednesday."}
{"original": "But Democrats know the clock is ticking and that trying to get GOP support could take up too much time. More than 18.2 million Americans were claiming jobless benefits as of last week, and federal unemployment insurance programs are set to expire in early March. States and localities are also staring down major budget holes as they attempt to implement mass vaccination programs."}
{"original": "I have no patience for dithering or drastic cuts. Republicans are welcome in the room ― there's no price of admission ― even as we go forward with reconciliation, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told HuffPost."}
{"original": "There are fewer and fewer political incentives to working with Republicans as well. Recent polling showed two-thirds of Americans support the president's relief proposal — a data point that prompted Biden's White House chief of staff Ron Klain to declare the plan bipartisan on its merits, regardless of how Republicans actually vote."}
{"original": "This week, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, also went on television urging lawmakers to go big on relief."}
{"original": "We need to understand that trying to be, per se, fiscally responsible at this point in time, with what we've got going on in this country — if we actually throw away some money right now, so what? Justice told CNN."}
{"original": "What happens when we are so focused on what is wrong with our love-life that we stop even considering that it can be different? Two women came into my office almost 10 years ago, one week apart, with almost the same situation, and left knowing the three things YOU will want to know about love before Valentine's Day."}
{"original": "I am a Change Agent, and I coach people who want to make a difference in the world. This time of year, I'm also an Enrolled Agent who prepares over a thousand income tax returns each tax season. Yes, believe it or not, the two often intersect. Money, therapists will tell you, is a presenting issue. My work has most meaning when I can combine what I do, and help clients in ways they could not imagine when they walked in the door. I joke that clients come in to have their taxes prepared, and leave feeling better about their moms. It happens frequently."}
{"original": "The first of the two women was strikingly beautiful, and in a very unhappy marriage. Her husband was depressed and not working, and she was taking care of him. She felt it was more of a mother/son relationship than husband/wife. She felt that she was the man of the house, and she wanted him to be the man. She made all of the money, etc. She wanted to be taken care of, and he was not doing so. Yet, she is a very strong woman, and she was modeling her mom, who also was a strong woman who took care of her family (though not to this degree)."}
{"original": "She told me that she took her husband out for her own birthday recently, because he didn't have any money. This was very upsetting to her, and she gave him an ultimatum: he has two months to find a job."}
{"original": "Yet, she somehow felt responsible for him, and felt badly when she thought about how he would feel if she left. I told her that this was a hallucination: She was hallucinating -- guessing, really, no more than that -- about how someone else was going to feel as a result of something she did."}
{"original": "I pointed out that I truly could not change her, and she could not change him, and he could not change me. We can only change ourselves. And if that change in ourselves compels someone else to want to change to keep up, all the better. Then I set out to help her change herself."}
{"original": "The issue here, as I understood it, was not really about money (though she came to me to prepare her tax return!). It was really about how she was feeling, how she could feel better more of the time, and about love."}
{"original": "There are, really, only three things that determine how we feel: how we hold ourselves physically, what we focus on, and what we say to ourselves, or our thoughts. She was focusing so much on what was wrong that she wasn't focusing on what she wanted. I had her put both hands out to either side, palms up. In one hand, I had her imagine that in it was everything she wants. In the other hand, I had her imagine everything that she didn't want. And when she looked at what she didn't want and focused on it intently, everything in the hand that had what she did want disappeared. We get what we focus on."}
{"original": "So I had her close her eyes, and focus on what she does want: love. I had her feel the love that was already inside her. I had her make it stronger, and stronger, with a big smile, and I had her anchor it, so she could feel that deep love within her whenever she wants (reminding her that if she really was serious about it she would practice this a few hundred times!)."}
{"original": "Here is where I added what I believe is my own take on the subject: Since all the love she needs is within her, she doesn't need anyone else to be able to feel all the love she needs. Relationships are for sharing love, not for providing love. And she got this."}
{"original": "This, though, led to another question: She believes that men shrink away from strong women, even strong beautiful ones. She has learned to repress her strength while engaging in relationships, for fear that her strength will repel men from her. As a result, she has found men that are not strong enough for her, and then feels resentful of what she brought upon herself!"}
{"original": "She asked, Are there really men out there like that? I replied that I am one, but I'm taken. She laughed. I assured her that I'm not the only one, either."}
{"original": "I reminded her that she is in New York. There are eight million people in New York. Even if what she is looking for is one in a million, that means that there are seven more just like him!"}
{"original": "The point that I was getting at, that she finally understood is that there were 3 things she had to realize:"}
{"original": "All the love she needed was within her. Therefore, she didn't need a man in her life, though it would be wonderful to share her love with someone who could be the man of her dreams, who was strong enough to let her feel her feminine side and be feminine, without feeling threatened by her strength. Since she didn't need a man, she didn't have to compromise herself by hiding her strength in order to settle for someone she didn't want, just to have a man in her life."}
{"original": "So I recommended that she present herself the way she is, not the way she hallucinates that someone else would like her to be. She asked me what she should do when she realizes that the person she is with is not strong enough. Does she hide away her strength just to be with that man? I replied that she should use one word:"}
{"original": "She laughed. But that word made all the difference to her. By understanding that, she understood her own power. That one word triggered within her the concept of abundance versus scarcity. If this guy isn't the right one, then the next one might be. If not, it will be someone else. But she maintains her strength, her dignity, and her integrity in the process, knowing that she never had to compromise herself to get what she wants or needs."}
{"original": "I had her close her eyes again and ran through a few processes to anchor all of this in. She took her completed tax returns, and left. When she came back two years later, she introduced me to her new husband, a Harvard educated banker. As they sat together in my office, she was glowing. She found someone strong enough for her. She did not settle. She told me that when she tried to be the man in the relationship, he reminded her that he was, not her. He was strong enough for her! She was in exactly the right place. It was clear that they were both deeply in love. She found the man of her dreams."}
{"original": "The following week, yet another unhappy woman walked into my office, telling me that her life was miserable, that her husband didn't love her, rarely worked, was never home, was taking advantage of her, and she was coming to the conclusion that he was only using her to get a Green Card."}
{"original": "I had heard this story before - not from the woman who was in a week earlier, but from this same client - last year, and the year before that. So I decided that maybe she was trying to tell me something."}
{"original": "There is an interesting thing about problems. People have them, and certain significant problems can be self-serving and self-perpetuating. Sometimes, people define themselves by the problem they have, and are actually reluctant to solve it because somehow the problem has become part of who they are. It becomes part of their identity. It is something they are certain about, that allows them to connect with other people who will commiserate, and gives them a sense of significance. If it does all of that, how can they let it go?"}
{"original": "The answer is to understand that if it continues, year after year, it will cause much more pain than any pleasure that might come from it."}
{"original": "With this woman, as well as the previous one, I made sure that she understood the consequences of maintaining the status quo. I asked her to imagine what her life would be like in a year, if nothing changed. What would she look like in the mirror? Would she have more energy, or less? What would her children think of her? How about in five years? Or ten years? When she realized that this had to change, and had to change now, I saw that she needed a slightly different resource from the woman a week earlier. The earlier one was strong, and needed to feel the love inside her. This woman needed strength."}
{"original": "I had her access the strength that was inside her, by remembering times in the past when she was really powerful, and to be able to connect to that feeling at a moment's notice, so that she would be strong enough to deal with her husband."}
{"original": "All the love you need is within you, as you read this. In fact, it is always there, all the time. Since all the love you need is within you, all the time, therefore, you don't need a man in your life (or a woman, depending), to provide you with love -- though it would be wonderful to share your love with someone who could be the person of your dreams. Since you don't need a man or woman in your life to provide you with love, then like her, you don't need to compromise yourself by hiding your strength - or intelligence, or any other attributes -- in order to settle for someone you didn't want, just to have a man or woman in your life."}
{"original": "I shared with her the same three points that I shared earlier, and I share them with you, the reader, now:"}
{"original": "When I was done, she told me that her son is in therapy, and I'm a better therapist than the one he has. I blushed. I'm not a therapist. But change occurs, nonetheless."}
{"original": "This same woman came back again two months later to have her son's return prepared, and she was a different person. She told me that she feels terrific and strong and wonderful, and she told me this with a smile."}
{"original": "She told me that she filed for divorce. When she did, he came running, crying, telling her how much he loves her, etc. Now, she says, he's a model husband! Before I could express my delight in her situation, she added: And I DON'T CARE. I can't get hurt anymore!"}
{"original": "It takes a long time to rebuild trust, and she does not really trust him - how can she? But I can't get hurt anymore. The divorce papers are filed. If he is out of line, he is out of here. Before, I did everything possible to make the marriage work. Now, it doesn't matter."}
{"original": "As I told the first woman in my earlier post: I can't change her, she can't change him, he can't change me, but we can change ourselves enough to get the other person to want to change himself. He used to work sporadically as a cab driver -- and since she was the bread winner of the house, he would work only when he felt like it, living off of her work. He would sleep in, miss rush hour, and then say that it wasn't worth it to work since he missed the busy time. Now, she tells me, He is out the door at the crack of dawn!"}
{"original": "She doesn't know if he really and truly loves her, as he says he does, or if he is as attached to the concept of scarcity as she once was. But she DOESN'T CARE. She is not emotionally invested in him, or the relationship. It is no longer a barometer of who she is. You can see how much lighter she holds herself, how much happier she is, how much stronger she is, when she is no longer dependent on what someone else is feeling for her own strength."}
{"original": "Before, she told me, I couldn't talk to anyone. I was hiding my feelings from my family, pretending everything is okay. I needed a push. So I pushed."}
{"original": "She said, It's a miracle! I blushed."}
{"original": "It's not a miracle -- it's magic. It's the magic of abundance. It's the magic of NEXT! It's the magic of knowing that if this doesn't work, there is always something else, or someone else. He needs her, now, much more than she needs him."}
{"original": "Did her story end where everyone lives happily ever after? No. Sadly, she is not Cinderella. Once her husband got the green card, he left, as she expected him to do. Since then she has had challenges in her life that would stress the best of us, yet she can smile every year when she comes back, as she tells me her situation. She can smile because she knows that she is more than enough, and has more than enough resourcefulness insider her to handle everything with strength, and without shame. Because she knows, still, that all the love she needs is within her, and all the strength she needs is within her, and she thanks me every year that she comes in, for one talk I had with her almost 10 years ago that made all the difference."}

{"original": "Buying a house requires months of endless decision-making. Where do you want to live for the next several years? Whom will you hire as an agent? Which bank will get your business?"}
{"original": "But once you finally reach the finish line and are presented the mortgage contract, you'll have one more decision to make: Should you buy down the rate?"}
{"original": "Also known as paying points, this choice can be a confusing one. But no worries ― we have the lowdown on how mortgage points work and when it makes sense to pay them."}
{"original": "When it comes to mortgage points, there are a few different kinds. Usually, though, we're talking about discount points, which are used to lower your mortgage interest rate."}
{"original": "Lenders offer this option because they know mortgage borrowers don't always stay in their homes for the full duration of the loan."}
{"original": "For example, say a young couple wants to take out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Well, the lender knows that the couple is pretty unlikely to stay in that house for 30-plus years while they pay down the loan. Instead, they'll probably stay for maybe three to five years, and then when they decide to start a family or relocate for work, they'll sell the house and move on."}
{"original": "In this case, the lender gets paid a lot less interest over the life of the loan than if the loan had fully amortized. So, to hedge its bets, the bank offers that couple the opportunity to pay a fee upfront in exchange for a lower-than-market interest rate."}
{"original": "Essentially, mortgage points are prepayment of interest, said Yves-Marc Courtines, a certified financial planner and former mortgage banker who now runs Boundless Advice LLC in Manhattan Beach, California. Paying interest in the form of an upfront fee can accomplish two things, he said: Provide a more palatable interest rate to the borrower, as well as help the mortgage lender absorb some of its costs right away."}
{"original": "So even though the couple has to pay more money upfront, it can be psychologically rewarding to get a deal on the interest rate. Meanwhile, the lender gets to have more cash on hand right away, rather than waiting for those monthly payments to trickle in and hoping the couple holds onto the loan long enough for it to be a lucrative deal."}
{"original": "But don't assume that mortgage points are a big scam ― they can actually work out in the favor of the borrower. It all comes down to the math."}
{"original": "How much are mortgage points worth?"}
{"original": "Discount points cost 1 percent of your total loan amount. So, for example, 1 point on a $100,000 loan would cost $1,000."}
{"original": "But when it comes to how much each one is worth, it all depends on the lender. Generally, though, 1 point will reduce your rate by an eighth to a quarter of a percent."}
{"original": "Whether paying points turns out to be a good deal for the lender or for you depends on how long you end up staying in the home. Let's look at an example:"}
{"original": "You walk into a bank and apply for a 30-year fixed-rate loan of $100,000. The bank says you qualify for a rate of 4.5 percent. However, it offers you the option to buy 4 discount points and, in exchange, you'll receive a rate of 3.5 percent instead."}
{"original": "If you take the deal, you will owe an extra $4,000. However, at that lower interest rate, your monthly payments would be $467 instead of $507, assuming you roll the cost of the points into your loan balance."}
{"original": "That means you would save $40 a month and break even after 10 years. Every year you remain in your home after that is another $480 in your pocket instead of the bank's. That's an awesome return on investment, said Courtines."}
{"original": "But if you end up moving in just a few years, he said, you've made a bad decision."}
{"original": "If you're not a math whiz, don't worry. This easy-to-use mortgage points calculator can help you run the numbers on your own."}
{"original": "Pros and cons of paying for points"}
{"original": "One of the biggest advantages of mortgage points: They help to make the monthly payment more affordable, said Courtines. A lower monthly payment means you'll not only have more cash flow to put toward bills or investments, but you might also have a better chance of qualifying for a loan in the first place."}
{"original": "The bank might say, 'You don't make enough money from your salary to pay $3,000 a month, but you do make enough money to pay $2,800 a month,' Courtines explained. So you can make the loan smaller by paying points."}
{"original": "Of course, there are also the long-term savings. If you plan to stay in your home past the break-even point, you stand to save thousands of dollars in interest."}
{"original": "And there are tax benefits. Because mortgage discount points are considered prepaid interest, you can deduct the cost on your taxes as long as you meet the IRS requirements."}
{"original": "On the other hand, one of the drawbacks to paying points is you'll need to have more cash at closing. If not, you have to roll that cost into the loan balance, which increases the ultimate price of the points because you end up paying interest on them."}
{"original": "The other big risk? You may not be in the loan long enough to earn back the value of the reduced interest rates, said Courtines."}
{"original": "Finally, you could get ripped off. You may think you're getting a great interest rate, said Courtines, but may have overcompensated the lender or mortgage broker by paying more points upfront than the amount they're giving you back in lower rates."}
{"original": "That's why it's so important to calculate the upfront cost versus long-term savings. The rate can't just look good on paper ― it has to be mathematically better than the no-point rate, according to Courtines."}
{"original": "The opposite of a discount point is a negative point. This is when the lender essentially pays you, usually by reducing your closing costs, in exchange for a higher interest rate. For instance, taking our same $100,000 loan as an example, a lender might credit you 1 negative point ― $1,000 ― and increase your interest rate by 0.25 percentage points."}
{"original": "Why would you want to do this? There are a couple reasons it might make sense."}
{"original": "One is if you're taking out a large loan that requires a major upfront closing fee ― more money than you have on hand. This situation is typical in high-cost housing markets such as San Francisco and New York City. Sometimes, taking the negative point can get you into a home you could not otherwise afford."}
{"original": "The other situation when you would want to take a negative point is when you don't plan to stay in the home for very long. If you're only planning to hold the mortgage for a couple of years, saving immediately on closing costs could make up for the slightly higher rate."}
{"original": "Bottom line: Are mortgage points worth it?"}
{"original": "In the end, lenders charge mortgage points because they hope to come out ahead on the deal. But that doesn't mean it can't be a win for you too."}
{"original": "One of President Trump's key priorities is updating and improving our nation's infrastructure. On the campaign trail he promised to push through a $1 trillion infrastructure package and in recent weeks he has reiterated his commitment to this pledge."}
{"original": "Unlike previous infrastructure bills that have focused on funding for roads, bridges and ports, this package is more likely to include regulatory relief, loan guarantees and tax incentives for public-private partnerships."}
{"original": "Furthermore, the scope of the package may be broader than traditional infrastructure. Some lawmakers want to include transmission lines, pipelines, even power plants. Others want to add federal assistance with cyber security provisions that would help protect the critical infrastructure of our grid. Interestingly enough, some energy stakeholders would prefer not to get federal funding because these projects have traditionally been private investments. Instead, they would prefer to get help in the form of streamlined regulations and reduced administrative burdens."}
{"original": "Already the administration has signaled its willingness to help specific energy projects - like the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline. Notably, the boost from the administration has been regulatory, not financial."}
{"original": "While the question remains whether a large infrastructure initiative would provide the same kind of relief for other projects, the administration is likely to take this approach because it limits the cost to the federal treasury but still provides incentives for investments."}
{"original": "Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is running for his state's open U.S. Senate seat in 2022, becoming the first major entrant in what could be a crowded field in one of the nation's quintessential swing states."}
{"original": "In a video announcing his run, Fetterman – a progressive who served as mayor of the small industrial community of Braddock outside of Pittsburgh before ascending to the lieutenant governor's office in 2018 – promises to bridge the growing political divide between the urban and rural portions of Pennsylvania, arguing communities across Pennsylvania feel left behind by national politicians."}
{"original": "Talk is cheap, but for the past 20 years, I have been working to represent, rebuild, and to advance these places, Fetterman says in the video, which features pundits discussing his ability to appeal to Pennsylvanians who backed former President Donald Trump. I'm going to fight not for one part of Pennsylvania, not for one party of Pennsylvania, but for one Pennsylvania."}
{"original": "Fetterman has already raised $1.3 million for his bid to claim the seat held by retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. He's also set to announce endorsements from the United Steelworkers local in Pennsylvania, as well as UFCW Local 1776, which covers food workers in Philadelphia and its suburbs."}
{"original": "The 6-foot-8-inch Fetterman has an atypical look for a politician, to say the least. Heavily tattooed and famously resistant to wearing a tie, he's led an effort to legalize and tax marijuana in the state, and been profiled by national media outlets far more often than your typical lieutenant governor. He made regular appearances on MSNBC and CNN to defend the integrity of the 2020 election in Pennsylvania, attention that could give him a leg up in a Democratic primary."}
{"original": "The 2022 Senate battle in the Keystone State is certain to be crucial to who will control the Senate for the latter two years of President Joe Biden's term in office. Toomey's retirement means the state is Democrats' most enticing pick-up opportunity, and Fetterman is unlikely to be the only Democrat running."}
{"original": "U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, who represents the vote-rich Philadelphia suburbs, is considering a run. Another congressman, Rep. Conor Lamb, who shares Fetterman's geographic base in the Pittsburgh area but represents a more moderate ideology, could also make a bid. State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, an early backer of Biden, is the most prominent Black politician considering a run."}
{"original": "The Republican side of the race is likely to yield a candidate more closely aligned with Trump than Toomey, a staunch fiscal conservative and ally of the banking industry who nonetheless adopted moderate stances on gun control and other issues."}
{"original": "Former Rep. Ryan Costello is publicly considering a run, but his criticisms of Trump could make it difficult for him to survive in a GOP primary where loyalty to the former president is likely to be the dominant issue. Two Trump-aligned Republicans, Reps. Mike Kelly and Guy Reschenthaler, are seen as possible candidates. Jeff Bartos, the GOP candidate for lieutenant governor in 2018, is also moving toward a bid."}
{"original": "Fetterman has previously run for Senate in 2016, when he lost to environmental official Katie McGinty, who had the backing of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and EMILY's List, in the Democratic primary. In that race, Fetterman endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for president and openly requested for Sanders to back him in return, though no endorsement ever came. McGinty went on to narrowly lose to Toomey as Trump won the state."}
{"original": "Parts of Donald Trump's 2005 federal tax returns were made public on Tuesday night, revealing that the president made $150 million that year and paid $38 million in taxes."}

The Daily Beast could not independently verify these documents. The documents show Trump and his wife Melania paying $5.3 million in regular federal income tax—a rate of less than 4%. However, the Trumps paid an additional $31 million in the so-called alternative minimum tax, or AMT. Trump has previously called for the elimination of this tax."}
{"original": "The White House released a statement saying Trump had a responsibility to pay no more tax than legally required."}

Democrats, some fellow Republicans and more than a million petitioners demanded to see the documents, which presidents from the previous four decades had released during their campaigns."}
{"original": "Trump eluded them all, and just two days after his inauguration, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said the president was not going to release his tax returns because people didn't care."}
{"original": "Such an abrupt refusal followed months of Trump dancing around the issue, saying he couldn't share his tax returns because they were under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (although the IRS said there was nothing prohibiting their release) and later pledging to do so if his rival, Hillary Clinton, released emails related to her private email account."}
{"original": "In October 2016, the New York Times reported that it had obtained three pages from then-candidate Trump's 1995 personal tax return. That partial return showed that Trump took a $916 million loss that year, a move that experts who reviewed the filing for the Times said may have allowed him to avoid paying personal income taxes for almost two decades."}
{"original": "Trump admitted that he had taken the massive deduction in a debate with Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton a week after the Times report. The write-off is a wonderful thing, Trump said, but not before insisting, I pay taxes."}
{"original": "After that debate, Trump's son Eric said his dad pays a tremendous amount of tax. However, he went on to cite instances of the Trump Organization paying taxes as a business, not personal income taxes."}
{"original": "At the first presidential debate, Clinton accused Trump of not releasing his tax returns because they would show how little taxes he paid. That makes me smart, Trump replied."}
{"original": "Christina Fialho GEO Group and other private immigration detention facilities are subject to the CA Public Records Act as of January 1, 2018."}
{"original": "On January 1, private prisons that detain immigrants became subject to the California Public Records Act."}
{"original": "The new legal provision is part of the Dignity Not Detention Act, which was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown in October 2017. With this law, California became the first state in the country to apply open records laws to private immigration detention facilities. The law also effectively freezes the expansion of for-profit immigration detention facilities in the state."}
{"original": "Until now, private companies that operate immigration detention facilities have been exempt from public scrutiny. Advocates have been unable to obtain documents that should be open to the public, such as civil and human rights complaints filed with the private facilities."}
{"original": "This week, Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement (CIVIC), a co-sponsor of the Dignity Not Detention Act, filed a Public Records Act request with the Adelanto Detention Facility, a California immigration detention facility run by GEO Group. In the request, CIVIC asked for records of abuse as well as surveillance footage from an alleged June 2017 incident where guards pepper-sprayed and beat men on hunger strike. Previously, GEO Group told KPIX that the video was GEO Group's property."}
{"original": "But now, under the Dignity Not Detention Act, the Adelanto Detention Facility is required by law to release this footage to the public. While the Dignity Not Detention Act in California is a substantial step forward, private immigration detention facilities remain exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as well as other state public records laws. Over the years, there have been multiple legislative attempts to change this at the federal level. In fact, in August, Sen. Benjamin Cardin (D-MD) introduced Senate Bill 1728 to make private prisons subject to FOIA."}
{"original": "It is time that the public has access to what is happening behind these closed doors with our tax dollars."}

{"original": "A federal judge sentenced former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh on Thursday to three years in prison and three years of probation for a children's book scam she used to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars into her personal bank account and to her campaign."}
{"original": "Pugh released a 13-minute video on Wednesday in which she apologized for the fraud, acknowledging she'd used a series of children's books she wrote and self-published to solicit funds from government partners and private contractors."}
{"original": "I just want to apologize to the citizens, to young people, to partners, my friends ― everyone I've offended, everyone I've hurt — and city's image — by pleading guilty and being a part of all of this that had led me here today, Pugh said. I accept responsibility, I accept total responsibility."}
{"original": "Prosecutors said Pugh's scam brought in more than $850,000, which she used to run for mayor and to purchase and renovate a house. As part of the sentence, U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow also ordered Pugh to pay nearly $412,000 in restitution and to forfeit $669,688 in property, which includes the house."}
{"original": "Pugh pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the government and tax evasion last November."}
{"original": "Baltimore Sun via Getty Images Former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh leaves the federal courthouse after pleading guilty to conspiracy and tax evasion related to her Healthy Holly books."}
{"original": "Chasanow called the breadth of Pugh's crime astounding in her sentencing remarks Thursday."}
{"original": "I have yet frankly to hear any explanation that makes sense, the judge added. This was not a tiny mistake, lapse of judgment. This became a very large fraud. The nature and circumstances of this offense, clearly, I think are extremely, extremely serious."}
{"original": "The mayor sold upwards of 140,000 copies of the Healthy Holly books between 2011 and 2018 to institutions like the University of Maryland Medical System and Baltimore City Public Schools."}
{"original": "From 2015 through 2018, health care provider Kaiser Permanente also purchased 20,000 of the books for $114,000. Kaiser's payments to Pugh overlapped with a $48 million contract the company signed with the city of Baltimore in September 2017 ― a contract approved by a board Pugh controlled at the time."}
{"original": "In an earlier statement to HuffPost, Kaiser denied any wrongdoing and said it purchased copies of Healthy Holly as part of a broader program to distribute health-centered literature that's been ongoing since 2013."}
{"original": "Pugh resigned as mayor last year as evidence of her misconduct continued to grow, after initially dismissing an investigation by The Baltimore Sun as a witch hunt."}
{"original": "Jonathan Ernst/Reuters With the elections of Jon Ossoff, Raphael Warnock and Joe Biden, progressives are thinking they might actually be able to pass some real reform."}
{"original": "When the 2020 election finally ended 64 days after Election Day, Democrats pulled out two additional victories, setting up a 50-50 balance in the Senate where Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will cast tie-breaking votes."}
{"original": "The wins for Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff unlock much more hope that the Biden administration might not just undo some of the worst actions taken in the Trump era, but actually push progressive reforms over the finish line."}
{"original": "Democrats in the Senate and the House, where their majority is also razor-thin, will still have to contend with more conservative members of their party who are resistant to progressive reforms."}
{"original": "And Democrats will have to deal with the filibuster, which allows a minority of senators to block legislation by stalling unless and until 60 members vote to end debate. That would mean getting 10 Republicans to join them, something hard to imagine in most circumstances these days."}
{"original": "There are a few exceptions to the filibuster, including bills that go through the budget reconciliation process ― a special procedure that makes it possible to pass bills with a simple majority. But there are rules about what can and can't be in a reconciliation bill and Democrats over the next two years will be limited to three such bills, at most."}
{"original": "The only other way forward would be to end the filibuster, which is a parliamentary rule that the Senate adopted and can easily end. Reforming the filibuster is something Biden signaled last year he could be open to, after historically defending the procedure, but several Democratic senators have said they would oppose that."}
{"original": "Still, progressive reforms in these areas now look a whole lot more possible than they did last week:"}
{"original": "A Democratic majority in the Senate could put in play the first minimum wage hike in more than a decade. The federal wage floor of $7.25 per hour has not budged since 2009. With Democrats holding the House, the Senate and the White House, they would have a much stronger hand to pursue an increase as high as $15, though only if they prove willing to nuke the filibuster."}
{"original": "Democratic control of the Senate also makes sweeping labor reform possible through the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act). The legislation, which the Democratic-controlled House had passed last year, would ramp up penalties for employers who try to break unions, ban anti-union right to work laws, and expand workers' rights to strike and boycott. The measure would be a huge prize for organized labor, but it has drawn fierce opposition from business groups and could struggle to draw the necessary votes from moderate Senate Democrats."}
{"original": "At the very least, a Democratic Senate should allow Biden to more easily reverse many of the labor policies of the Trump era ― not just legislatively through the Congressional Review Act, but by reshaping the National Labor Relations Board, which referees disputes between employers and unions. The Trump picks for that board have made it more difficult for many workers to bargain collectively. If Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is deposed as the Senate's leader, Biden would have a much easier time installing union-friendly nominees who could undo the previous board's decisions."}
{"original": "Reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and a suite of voting rights and campaign finance and ethics reforms were already at the top of congressional Democrats' priority list before they won control of the Senate on Tuesday."}
{"original": "Paramount among these is the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would reform and reauthorize the 1965 voting rights law. The proposed legislation, named after the civil rights hero and former Democratic congressman who died in 2019, would update the VRA in compliance with the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted key parts of the historic law. That decision freed state-level Republicans to enact a raft of voter suppression measures aimed at lowering minority voter turnout. Former President Barack Obama called on the Senate to waive the filibuster in order to pass the revised law in his eulogy for Lewis."}
{"original": "House Democrats also plan to pass the For The People Act, a collection of voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms, as they did in 2019. The bill would create a system of publicly financed congressional elections, expand campaign finance disclosure provisions, enhance executive branch ethics laws, end partisan gerrymandering, and require states to implement a host of election reforms to make it easier to vote. Other bills like the Protect Our Democracy Act, which aims to prevent future presidents from abusing their power as Donald Trump did, will also get a Senate hearing now."}
{"original": "Biden will have a much, much easier time getting his judicial nominees confirmed with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) leading the Senate Judiciary Committee than he would have with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) at the helm. Since Trump and McConnell filled almost every open judicial seat that Republicans had prevented Obama from filling, Biden will have to rely on older judges to retire quickly if he is to put his stamp on the federal judiciary."}
{"original": "Trump transformed the Supreme Court with three new justices, the most named by any president since Ronald Reagan. Progressive judicial activist groups wasted no time in calling for liberal Stephen Breyer, the oldest Supreme Court justice at 82, to retire as soon as Biden is inaugurated and make way for a younger progressive justice. Democrats do not want another elderly justice dying at an inopportune time, as happened with the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If Breyer does step down, Biden is expected to nominate the first Black female justice, as he promised to do during his presidential campaign."}
{"original": "Outside of their demands for bigger unemployment benefits in coronavirus relief legislation, Democrats have not said much lately about expanding or improving programs for poor people. They've mostly played defense against Trump and congressional Republicans' attempts to cut food and disability benefits, policies that will be relatively easy for them to reverse."}
{"original": "But there have been some big proposals in recent years, like making the child tax credit fully refundable and paid in advance, so low-income parents receive monthly checks instead of having to wait for a refund. Democratic leaders included this proposal in their COVID-19 relief demands late last year."}
{"original": "As for expanding Social Security retirement benefits, party leaders previously declined to give a hearing to such a proposal, though they said nice things about it."}
{"original": "Biden has said he supports a higher corporate tax rate and higher income and payroll taxes on people earning more than $400,000 ― proposals that would partially reverse the tax cuts that Republicans enacted at the end of 2017."}
{"original": "Congressional Democrats also want to reverse some of Trump's tax cuts, but they've muddied the message by mainly insisting they would undo the only major tax hike that Republicans included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Among its various changes, that law capped the federal deductions people can take for what they pay in state and local taxes, which Democrats decried as a tax hike on the middle class even though it mostly affected high-income households."}
{"original": "Climate And A Green New Deal"}
{"original": "Zeroing out planet-heating pollution from the world's second-largest emitter by the middle of the century will require unprecedented changes to the U.S. economy, and Biden will need new legislation to do that."}
{"original": "During their campaigns, neither Warnock nor Ossoff endorsed the Green New Deal slogan that progressives use to frame calls for a World War II-style industrial strategy to rapidly decarbonize. But both Georgia Democrats vowed to make climate legislation a top priority, and Warnock, a Baptist reverend, draws on a long history of Black clergy fighting racist policies on pollution."}
{"original": "There will still be pushback from conservative Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a staunch fossil fuel ally who in 2010 ran an ad in which he fired bullets into a copy of the last major climate bill that Congress considered. Manchin, Sen. Krysten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) voted against a resolution in March 2019 outlining the core tenets of a Green New Deal. Newly elected Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), a longtime oil and gas booster, could also be a hurdle."}
{"original": "But lawmakers can also embed climate provisions in broader spending packages. Last month, Congress passed a stimulus bill that included billions for clean energy research, extended tax credits for solar and wind power, and ratified a global deal to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a superheating refrigerant gas. The federal government's annual budget offers a similar opportunity, as the budget reconciliation process allows lawmakers pushing polarizing provisions to circumvent the filibuster."}
{"original": "The Affordable Care Act ― Biden's famous B.F.D. ― is 11 years old and, for all its success making health care coverage available and more affordable to millions of Americans, it needs work. Biden campaigned on beefing up the law rather than replacing it wholesale with a single-payer Medicare for All system. A fully Democratic Congress would provide the new president with an opportunity to fulfill some of his promises."}
{"original": "Even with Republicans out of legislative power, Biden faces a potential crisis in the Supreme Court, which is due to rule later this year on a lawsuit challenging the ACA's constitutionality. The Republican officials who brought the suit base their argument on the fact that Congress repealed the fines associated with the law's individual mandate in 2017 without repealing the mandate itself. Biden and a Democratic Congress could fix that problem in multiple, simple ways by amending the ACA and rendering the lawsuit moot."}
{"original": "Protecting the ACA is but a preliminary step. Biden's health care plan would direct additional financial assistance to those who purchase private health insurance on exchanges like HealthCare.gov, and make that coverage and that assistance available to more people. Biden has also proposed establishing a government-run public option insurance program that would be available to everyone as an alternative to private coverage, including to low-income adults who live in 12 states that haven't expanded their Medicaid programs under the ACA. And he has called for lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and allowing the federal government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers, among other policies a Democratic majority makes possible."}
{"original": "Biden has promised to take a number of executive actions to reverse Trump's immigration policies, but Democratic control of Congress could allow him to resurrect broader immigration reform."}
{"original": "The incoming president supports a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants ― including Dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as kids. He's also pledged to increase the refugee cap and ease restrictions on asylum-seekers."}
{"original": "A number of measures now have a chance of passing the Senate, including the National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act (or NO BAN Act), which passed the House last July. It would immediately terminate Trump's travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and prohibit future presidents from implementing a similar ban."}
{"original": "Biden promised to renew temporary protected status for people from Venezuela, Guatemala and Hong Kong, among others. The House passed a bill to do that last month, but Republicans in the Senate blocked it. The president-elect has also pledged to work with Congress on other reforms including amending visa programs for permanent workers and expanding protections for domestic violence survivors and undocumented immigrants who report labor violations."}
{"original": "It's hard to imagine a better moment for Democrats to pass paid family and sick leave, and to do something to improve the state of childcare. The coronavirus pandemic has added a level of urgency to these issues, as paid sick leave would help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and a lack of paid family leave has pushed hundreds of thousands of parents, mainly women, out of the workforce."}
{"original": "Lawmakers like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) have raised the issue's profile in the last few years, and polling shows actual bipartisan support. Biden's campaign agenda favors 12 weeks of paid family leave and seven days of paid sick leave."}
{"original": "The quickest path forward would be to extend and expand the emergency sick leave and childcare leave provisions passed last year to deal with the pandemic. Republican senators blocked extension of those provisions in December, and they expired on Jan. 1."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, the long-suffering childcare industry has taken a massive hit. But it's now possible for Congress to pass something visionary like increased childcare funding to ensure, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposed, that families don't have to spend more than 7% of their income on that necessary expense. Biden's robust caregiving proposals also raise the prospect of higher pay and benefits for childcare workers."}
{"original": "On the higher education front, Biden's agenda focuses on hiking funding for historically Black colleges and universities, and doubling the value of Pell grants, which help low-income students attend college. Both goals are possible with a simple Senate majority."}
{"original": "Another goal, to expand opportunities for free college, would involve more complex legislation and votes from Republicans, making it less likely. How much action Biden can take on student loan forgiveness is also up for debate, including whether he could do so through executive action. Expanding access to preschool is another area where advocates are hopeful for new, ambitious legislation resembling what Biden proposed as a candidate."}
{"original": "There's new hope of passing COVID-19 relief measures to send much-needed injections of dollars to state and local governments, K-12 schools and universities. Biden has promised to reopen most schools within his first 100 days in office, an undertaking that would require massive funding. There's also hope that any stimulus package could include resources to help alleviate students' learning loss over the last year."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg will sell his massive media and data company, Bloomberg LP, if he's elected president, his campaign said on Tuesday."}
{"original": "Tim O'Brien, one of the former New York mayor's advisers, said on CNN that Bloomberg would offload the company that made him a multibillionaire, contrasting the plan with the actions of President Donald Trump, who has continued to benefit from his own swath of business holdings throughout his administration."}
{"original": "There will be no confusion about any of his financial holdings, blurring the line between public service and personal profiteering, O'Brien told host Christiane Amanpour. He later added that Bloomberg will be 180 degrees away from where Donald Trump is on these issues because Donald Trump is a walking financial conflict of interest."}
{"original": "His Democratic campaign detailed how such a sale would happen, noting Bloomberg would place his company into a blind trust that would then handle the sale. The Associated Press reported any proceeds from the sale would go to the candidate's charitable arm, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and the company would not be sold to a foreign buyer or private equity fund."}
{"original": "The Wall Street Journal noted it could sell for as much as $60 billion, adding Bloomberg owns about 90% of the company, which he founded in 1981."}
{"original": "O'Brien said that should Bloomberg be elected in November, he would also release his tax returns, reestablishing a tradition that's gone back to every president dating to Gerald Ford until Trump broke the protocol."}
{"original": "Bloomberg has used the massive wealth he built through Bloomberg LP to self-fund his campaign thus far. His campaign has purchased about $400 million in advertising over the last three months, which has helped propel Bloomberg in the polls."}
{"original": "He qualified for the next Democratic debate this week, which will be his first appearance on stage after many other candidates have already been through, and lost, that gantlet. His vast wealth is almost guaranteed to come up when he faces off against his fellow candidates in Las Vegas."}
{"original": "It's a shame Mike Bloomberg can buy his way into the debate. But at least now primary voters curious about how each candidate will take on Donald Trump can get a live demonstration of how we each take on an egomaniac billionaire. https://t.co/H02radEZcv — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) February 18, 2020"}
{"original": "Bloomberg's stature, particularly his ownership of a gargantuan media company, has prompted questions about how news organizations he owns would cover his bid for the White House. The company announced that its 2,700 journalists would not undertake any in-depth investigations of Bloomberg or any of his Democratic challengers."}
{"original": "We will write about virtually all aspects of this presidential contest in much the same way as we have done so far, John Micklethwait, the news arm's editor in chief, said in a memo to staff after Bloomberg entered the race."}
{"original": "The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (DHS) and now the Pennsylvania Auditor General (AG) are attempting to audit expenses related to Real Alternatives' non-government, private contracts expenses using private funds. DHS and the AG have no legal authority over these privately funded contracts."}
{"original": "Several times over the last year and half, Real Alternatives has requested to discuss this legal issue with Commonwealth attorneys. They refused to meet with us."}
{"original": "Real Alternatives is amazed that this matter is even an issue since it was legally researched as well as discussed and approved by the then Department of Public Welfare prior to implementation. In addition, the same private contracts were in place during four different audits over the last 20 years, conducted by four different audit teams, and yet they had no issue whatsoever with those contracts. There must be some other reason why this is now an issue."}
{"original": "Although we regret we had to file the action, our request for a Declaratory Judgment by the court is necessary to save both parties time and expenses, and to finally resolve this simple legal issue."}
{"original": "As part of his sweep of executive orders on climate change Wednesday, President Joe Biden directed his federal agencies to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies as consistent with applicable law."}
{"original": "The mandate made good on a campaign promise to cut off the bountiful federal benefits oil, gas and coal companies have received for generations, topping $15 billion a year alone in direct subsidies and tax incentives to fossil fuel producers."}
{"original": "Or, at least, it started to make good on that promise. If Biden wants to seriously halt the flow of taxpayer money to fossil fuel company coffers, he could take more aggressive steps to stop aiding producers and lobby Congress for new laws consistent with his administration's climate goals."}
{"original": "Such steps are laid out in a new proposal from Evergreen Action, the climate policy shop founded last year by alumni from Washington Gov. Jay Inslee's ill-fated but influential bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. The memo is likely to find an audience with the new administration. The group's former political director, Maggie Thomas, was just named chief of staff to Biden's newly formed Office of Domestic Climate Policy."}
{"original": "The United States should definitely eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, said Daniel Bresette, executive director of the nonprofit Environmental and Energy Study Institute, which was not involved in the report but called it a welcome listing of steps that could be taken. As with most of our choices when it comes to climate change, we should look at this as a trade-up, not a trade-off."}
{"original": "What Biden Would Need Congress To Do"}
{"original": "The 11-page Evergreen Action memo highlights the limits of what the Biden administration can do unilaterally. At least a dozen ideas proposed in the document require Congress to act, including nearly all steps to cut off financial benefits to fossil fuel producers."}
{"original": "There's the intangible drilling deduction, which lets oil companies deduct the cost of drilling new wells from their year-end tax bills, valued at $1.59 billion annually or $13 billion over the next 10 years. There are roughly $530 million in deductions for royalty payments to foreign governments for drilling overseas, and as much as $8.8 billion over the next 10 years in incentives for using captured carbon emissions to extract the dregs from oil wells. Then there's the first out, last in accounting trick that allows companies to reduce their tax bills by selling off the most expensive fossil fuel reserves first, artificially reducing the inventory on which they pay taxes by an estimated $1.7 billion per year. All that would require lawmakers to enact new statutes."}
{"original": "NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images View of the Lusk fracking facility in Scenery Hill, Pennsylvania."}
{"original": "So, too, would blocking oil and gas companies from using a tax structure known as Master Limited Partnership, or MLPs, which are exempt from corporate income tax. Nearly three-quarters of MLPs were fossil fuel companies as of 2016, according to data from the nonprofit Oil Change International, representing some $1.6 billion in lost annual tax revenue."}
{"original": "Congress would also need to give Biden the authority to yank existing drilling leases on federal lands, though the president's advisers ― either recognizing their limitations or tempering activists' expectations ― showed little appetite for that on Wednesday."}
{"original": "The opportunity for states to continue to accrue royalties from coal and natural gas that's properly done on federal lands can continue, Gina McCarthy, Biden's national climate adviser, said during a White House press briefing."}
{"original": "That doesn't mean there's no hope for legislation. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) proposed a bill last year to strip fossil fuel companies of subsidies. The Evergreen Action memo calls on Biden to champion some version of that proposal."}
{"original": "At a time when millions of Americans are out of work and many are struggling to put food on the table, there is no reason we should continue to dole out giveaways to some of the wealthiest corporations in the world, Omar said in an email to HuffPost. This is not a radical idea. It is the bare minimum necessary to confront the existential threat of the climate crisis."}
{"original": "With Democrats in control of both chambers of Congress, Biden could also press allies to pass the bill Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Rep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) introduced last spring to permanently block the federal government from aiding fossil fuel companies during a crisis like the coronavirus pandemic by taking steps such as slashing royalty rates owed for drilling on public lands."}
{"original": "Some of the steps in the memo that the White House could take by itself are ones Biden has already done in some form. Among the executive orders Wednesday was a directive to agency heads to identify steps to promote ending international financing of carbon-intensive fossil fuel-based energy through the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the federal government's main overseas financing arm. That language seems to leave open the door to natural gas projects and other lower-carbon fossil fuel infrastructure."}
{"original": "Evergreen Action's proposal goes further, calling for an end to all fossil fuel financing."}
{"original": "The group urges Biden to examine appropriate repayment from oil corporations for the costs to the U.S. Treasury for protecting their shipping lanes ― and thus their profits, pointing to the $81 billion per year the nonprofit Securing America's Future Energy estimates the military spends defending global oil supplies."}
{"original": "DAVID MCNEW via Getty Images Pump jacks draw crude oil from the Long Beach Oil Field under Discovery Well Park in Signal Hill, California, last March."}
{"original": "Another seldom-discussed benefit oil companies receive are federal icebreaking ships and other Arctic equipment the federal government lends to drilling operations, according to a Cambridge University paper by subsidy researcher Doug Koplow."}
{"original": "The memo's broad definition of subsidies frustrated some policy wonks who see precision as key to ending direct loans and tax credits. Groups like the International Monetary Fund have produced estimates of annual U.S. fossil fuel subsidies exceeding $649 billion."}
{"original": "But roughly 30% of that eye-popping figure represents consumption-side subsidies for driving that would remain in effect even if all vehicles on the road were electric, said Ronald Steenblik, the former special counselor for fossil fuel subsidy reform at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the 37-nation club of rich capitalist democracies."}
{"original": "It confuses the narrative to call the numbers 'subsidies,' to divorce the term from popular understanding of the term and their connection with public policy, Steenblik said. Externalities from combustion are a major problem, but they are neither subsidies to producers nor addressed through what the majority of economists and politicians mean when they speak of 'subsidy reform.'"}
{"original": "But Becca Ellison, the new policy manager at Evergreen Action, pushed back."}
{"original": "Any expenditure of public resources should be considered a subsidy because, at the end of the day, that's money that a fossil fuel corporation did not have to spend, she said. The federal government should not be participating in poisoning its people, especially when the costs of that are extremely high."}
{"original": "I'm often intrigued and sometimes inspired by stories of people traveling the world using points and miles. There's a well-known (within certain circles, at least) man who earned over a million airline miles by purchasing more than $3,000 worth of pudding during a special promotion in 1999. Or, you might have heard about people using coupons during a grocery store's membership-only sale to get food and household products for free."}
{"original": "While I might not be as enthusiastic as some world travelers, or as extreme as some couponers, I do see the benefit in a program that's free to join and offers you potentially money-saving perks. However, I also know it's important not to get so caught up that I wind up spending more money than I would otherwise."}
{"original": "The perks of membership. There are a variety of loyalty or rewards programs available including ones at grocery stores, big box retailers, airlines, hotels, rental car agencies, restaurants and e-commerce stores. However, the benefits and rules of each program can vary."}
{"original": "Joining a grocer's program might make you eligible for in-store savings, exclusive coupons and rewards that could save you money at a partnered gas stations later. Online and brick-and-mortar retailers sometimes offer free gifts, like sample-size products on your birthday. Members might also be able to earn points and redeem them for store credit later."}
{"original": "Many travel companies let members earn points or miles when they travel, and members can redeem them for free trips or upgrades later. Travel rewards programs also often have tiers, different levels of membership depending on how often you travel or how much you spend during the year. However, even the basic tier could offer perks."}
{"original": "For example, some hotel loyalty programs offer discounted rates and free Wi-Fi to anyone who joins the program. Higher tiers can offer more exclusive benefits, such as free room upgrades (including to coveted suites), bonus points during your stay and guaranteed early check-in and late check-out."}
{"original": "Recognize why companies might have rewards programs. Whether you're signed up for the buy-nine-get-one-free program at a local sandwich shop or part of an international organization's intricate multi-tiered program, the company's goal is often the same -- create repeat customers who will shop more often, and perhaps spend more money, at the business."}
{"original": "When you're a big fan of a company or product, getting rewarded for your loyalty can be great. After all, it's a free perk if you were going to make the purchase anyway. But try not to get too attached to a particular company or product based solely on the rewards program."}
{"original": "Buying something simply because you get a discount as a member, or making a purchase for the points, might be a waste. You could find yourself with a pantry full of products that are slowly going bad, or paying more for a trip because you didn't comparison shop the offerings from other airlines or hotel chains."}
{"original": "Joining a rewards program could lead to overspending if you're not careful. Recognizing that the programs could be designed to get you to spend more, and more often, can help you refrain from overspending. Here are a few additional ways to make sure you maximize the benefits of the programs."}
{"original": "• Don't double-count your savings. You're tricking yourself if you consider the rewards points from a retailer's program as savings when making a purchase and then consider the same points as savings (again) when you redeem them for store credit. Instead, decide when you'll count the rewards and stay consistent. Or, don't make the rewards part of your buying decision at all."}
{"original": "• Keep your programs organized. The points in some programs expire if you don't use them within a specified period. But keeping track of every program you've joined can be difficult. You could use a website, app or spreadsheet to help track your accounts, how many points or miles you've earned and when they expire. There are also apps where you can add your loyalty number and quickly pull it up on your phone later instead of digging for a card or keyring."}
{"original": "Another way to avoid overspending is to consider your net cost when comparison shopping. To do this, you'll need to calculate how much value you receive from different rewards programs. However, some rewards programs can be difficult to compare. For example, you might find that it takes several thousand points to book a hotel room with one program and tens of thousands for an equivalent room from a different chain."}
{"original": "Avoid potential confusion, and the resulting overvaluing or undervaluing of the rewards you're accruing, by creating a list of the dollar value of each programs' rewards points. You could take a shortcut and copy the values that bloggers and online groups of rewards program enthusiasts place on each program's points based on previous redemptions. Or, you could make estimates of your own based on trips or purchases you regularly make."}
{"original": "Now you'll know when 1,000 points are worth $1 or $10 and can plan your purchases accordingly. In the end, you want to be able to make as close to an apples-to-apples comparison as possible, inclusive of the value you place on the rewards."}
{"original": "Bottom line: Consumer rewards programs offer a wide variety of benefits, including exclusive savings and complimentary perks. While it's often free to join the programs, and you could get rewarded for doing so, keep the big picture in mind and be careful about letting your membership lead to unnecessary purchases."}

{"original": "House Democrats passed a major health care bill last December, one that promises substantial, much-needed relief to Americans struggling with cost of prescription drugs."}
{"original": "Yet somehow, almost no one outside of Washington seems to be paying attention."}
{"original": "The most important provision of the bill would allow the federal government to negotiate directly with manufacturers over drug prices, as authorities in other countries do. That could slash the price of everything from insulin to cutting-edge, breakthrough treatments for cancer for the vast majority of Americans."}
{"original": "Steve Knievel, an advocate at Public Citizen's Access to Medicines program says the bill is the most impactful piece of drug legislation to get through a house of Congress since the creation of the Medicare drug benefit in 2003."}
{"original": "Rachel Sachs, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and a widely published researcher on the drug industry, told HuffPost that the bill is an enormous deal … a sweeping reform that would be highly beneficial to patients."}
{"original": "The proposal has its gaps, as all legislation does. It also comes with trade-offs, mainly in the form of lower revenue for drugmakers ― which sounds great to industry critics angry over what they say are obscene pharmaceutical profits, just as it sounds lousy to industry defenders who say those profits underwrite the development of miracle cures."}
{"original": "But whatever its shortcomings and whatever its consequences, the legislation would represent a major, transformational shift in the relationship between government and one of health care's most important and powerful industries."}
{"original": "The bill probably would have dominated the news cycle, and have more of a profile today, if the vote hadn't taken place right when the country was focusing on impeachment ― and if the proposal's natural champions in the progressive community, who fought with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Ca.) over its reach and eventually won some key concessions, had touted it more."}
{"original": "MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images The prescription drug bill that passed the House in December has gotten surprisingly little notice since, although it's not for lack of trying by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)."}
{"original": "The bill would also have generated more buzz if it stood a decent chance of becoming law this year. It doesn't. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has flatly refused to consider it and President Donald Trump has said he opposes it too."}
{"original": "But any time a policy initiative of this magnitude crosses a key legislative threshold, it's closer to becoming law. And this bill passed with votes from virtually every Democrat, including vulnerable members in more conservative districts, many of whom are now touting it back home."}
{"original": "These members obviously saw a political upside in supporting the bill, even at the risk of incurring the wrath of drugmakers. If the industry isn't nervous about that, it should be."}
{"original": "H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, is named for the Baltimore congressman who died last year and who had long championed efforts to help people pay for their medications. It has three main components."}
{"original": "The first is a set of provisions that would limit out-of-pocket drug spending, like copays at the pharmacy, for seniors in Medicare Part D, the program's drug benefit. This is the least controversial part of the proposal because, in reality, it's just throwing government money at the problem."}
{"original": "Although Republicans in the modern era have generally been looking to reduce, rather than increase, spending on anything other than defense, drug coverage for senior citizens has been a conspicuous exception ― in part, perhaps, because seniors are such an increasingly vital part of the GOP's political coalition."}
{"original": "H.R. 3's second component would limit the ability of drug companies to raise prices year after year, by tying price increases to inflation. These limits would apply both to drugs in Part D (which is for drugs people buy directly themselves) and Part B (which includes drugs that physicians and clinics buy, then administer directly to patients). The bill also calls for studying ways of applying these limits to drugs available to other buyers."}
{"original": "An impetus for this change are the widespread examples of drug companies raising prices of products like EpiPens, which are used to stop potentially deadly allergic reactions, even when the product itself hasn't gotten better in any meaningful way."}
{"original": "The inflation caps have generated a lot more pushback from the drug industry, which opposes any federal intervention into what it can charge. But it's not nearly as controversial or toxic to drugmakers as the third provision, which would give the federal government authority to negotiate prices directly with manufacturers."}
{"original": "Barcroft Media via Getty Images Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said the House drug pricing bill sounds like socialism and there's no way Republicans will take it up."}
{"original": "Each year, following a short phase-in period, the secretary of Health and Human Services would pick at least 50 drugs that would be subject to negotiated prices. The 50 would come from a larger list of 250 single-source drugs (that is, drugs with no generic competition) on which the U.S. spends the most annually, taking into account both what government programs and private insurers buy."}
{"original": "The law also requires negotiation for one specific drug, insulin, as a response to widespread reports of diabetes patients rationing their own treatment ― occasionally, with tragic consequences."}
{"original": "H.R. 3 doesn't simply call for a negotiation. It sets financial boundaries for the discussions by requiring that the negotiated prices not exceed 120% of the average of what six other countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the U.K.) pay. For newer drugs not yet available in other countries, the law has a separate set of guidelines."}
{"original": "The hard part of any proposal like this isn't so much giving the government the right to negotiate. It's giving drug companies reason to go along. There are a number of ways to do this, including threatening to exclude high-priced drugs from formularies and breaking patent rights (or having government manufacture drugs directly) when the drugmakers refuse to negotiate."}
{"original": "H.R. 3's solution is slap drugmakers with a tax that would quickly rise to 95% of sales revenue any time manufacturers block a product from negotiation. The tax would not be deductible as a business expense ― which means, according to an assessment by the Congressional Budget Office, manufacturers could conceivably lose money outright in such instances, depending on the details and circumstances."}
{"original": "That threat would be enough to compel the drug industry to negotiate, the CBO predicted, and it would produce huge savings for the government: $456 billion over 10 years. An analysis by the independent firm Avalere found that the savings could be even bigger."}
{"original": "Under H.R. 3, the majority of that money would go right back into Medicare, in order to underwrite dental, vision and hearing coverage that the program lacks ― and to further subsidize some of the low-income seniors on the program. But a key provision of the law, one Pelosi prioritized, allows private insurers to use the negotiated prices, so that their beneficiaries can save money too."}
{"original": "Of course, drug companies could (and almost certainly would) find ways to game the system, perhaps by manipulating the way prices work abroad. And because the bill applies only to drugs that generate the most sales revenues, drugs that are expensive but serve small numbers of patients could fall outside its purview."}
{"original": "Those are among the reasons progressives weren't more enthusiastic about the final product, even after Pelosi had adopted some of their ideas, although ultimately Reps. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) ― three progressive leaders who had sparred with leadership over the bill ― all voted yes."}
{"original": "For conservatives on and off Capitol Hill, the issue with the bill is its potential effects on innovation, although the magnitude of those effects, if any, are the subject of long-standing debate in the health policy community."}
{"original": "Any proposal to reduce what the government pays for drugs prompts the industry to say that innovation will suffer, even though there have been whole books written on the way drugmakers and their allies exaggerate those claims. At the same time, plenty of well-respected scholars think the claims have some merit ― that, without those high profits, pharmaceutical companies would innovate less because they would draw less investment capital."}
{"original": "The CBO in its assessment concluded that if H.R. 3 becomes law, the drug industry would probably develop 8 to 15 fewer drugs over a 10-year period. That's a small fraction of the more than 300 drugs the CBO expects the industry to develop during that same span, although obviously the significance of that reduction would depend ultimately on what those 8 to 15 drugs might have been ― another unimpressive knockoff drug for reflux, or a breakthrough for hemophilia? ― and whether the CBO's estimate, which necessarily involved a lot of guesswork, was on the mark."}
{"original": "Pool via Getty Images Progressive leaders like Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) voted yes on the bill after Pelosi incorporated some of their proposals into the legislation."}
{"original": "What's less ambiguous is that lots of people are suffering and in some cases dying right now because the status quo leaves so many unable to pay for their prescriptions. That is why drug pricing is getting so much attention, including from Trump, although he has sent characteristically inconsistent messages about what exactly he wants or how badly he wants it."}
{"original": "For more than a year, his administration has been preparing a regulation that would tie the price of Medicare Part B drugs (the ones doctors administer directly) to international prices ― which, conceptually, is similar to the way the House bill would use a global price index. But the administration has not yet proposed the regulation formally, despite constantly recirculating rumors that release is imminent, and it is under enormous pressure from industry and sympathetic Republicans on Capitol Hill to keep the proposal from going forward."}
{"original": "Trump has also praised a bipartisan bill from Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). That bill includes the first two parts of the House bill, the extra financial assistance in Medicare and the limits on year-after-year price increases, but not the provision for price negotiation, which is a nonstarter with conservatives. Even without that provision, McConnell has so far resisted bringing a bill to the floor and, so far, Trump hasn't prodded him to do so."}
{"original": "At one point, Trump also expressed interest in working with Pelosi. This fueled tensions inside the Democratic caucus, as progressives accused the speaker of scaling back her proposal in order to win White House support. The administration eventually turned on H.R. 3, releasing a report suggesting it would have dramatic, devastating effects on innovation ― and dispatching officials to call the House proposal unworkable."}
{"original": "Trump has also taken to attacking the Do Nothing Democrats on drug prices, which is a strange choice given that the House actually took action by passing its bill, when Trump has repeatedly whiffed on chances to make policy unilaterally or with Congress. At last month's State of the Union address, House Democrats tried to make that point by standing when Trump mentioned drug pricing and holding three fingers in the air, for H.R. 3. The protest drew little notice."}
{"original": "But their December vote makes it more likely that the House could approve something similar a year or two from now, or whenever leadership in the White House and Senate changes. That is no small thing, no matter how much attention it gets."}
{"original": "Brian Kelly / EyeEm via Getty Images Don't have a 401(k) plan through work? Don't worry. Here are six 401(k) options and alternatives."}
{"original": "When it comes to saving for retirement, putting your money in a low-interest savings account is akin to shoving your money under a mattress. Ideally, you'd invest your money for bigger gains over time while reaping a few tax benefits instead. In other words, you'd contribute to your employer's 401(k) plan."}
{"original": "So, what if you don't have one?"}
{"original": "More than a third of all private-sector workers over the age of 22 don't work for a company that offers a retirement plan, according to data analyzed by The Pew Charitable Trusts. That number jumps to 41 percent for millennials."}
{"original": "Fortunately, if you don't have access to a 401(k) or another employer-sponsored retirement plan, you're not out of luck. Whether you work for a company or for yourself, here are six types of accounts that can help you reach your retirement savings goals."}
{"original": "How it works: An individual retirement account, or IRA, is a type of tax-advantaged retirement savings account. It's similar to a 401(k) except you don't have to open one through your employer. It's common for people to change employers frequently, and the great thing about an IRA is that it's employer-independent, said Lyn Alden, the founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy. You can keep the same account open and keep contributing to it year after year, regardless of who you work for."}
{"original": "An IRA lets you contribute pre-tax dollars, which grow tax-deferred. You only pay taxes on the investment gains when you make withdrawals in retirement. One of the biggest benefits to contributing to a traditional IRA is that it's easier to make larger contributions since you don't have to pay taxes on the money. That lets you take full advantage of compounding returns while you're young. Plus, if you don't contribute to a retirement plan through work, you can deduct your IRA contributions on your taxes."}
{"original": "The downside is that the contribution limits for IRAs are much lower than for 401(k)s. For 2019, you can contribute a total of $6,000 across all your IRA accounts ($7,000 if you're age 50 or older) or your taxable income for the year, whichever is smaller. You're allowed to begin making penalty-free withdrawals when you turn 59½. Once you reach 70½, you can no longer contribute and must start making required minimum distributions instead."}
{"original": "Best for: Lower-earning employees who expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement."}
{"original": "How it works: A Roth IRA is similar to a traditional IRA with a few exceptions. The first is the way your money is taxed: Rather than contributing pre-tax money, you contribute funds after taxes have already been taken out. That money is never subject to capital gains taxes or dividend taxes from that point on, Alden said. In other words, your withdrawals in retirement are made tax-free."}
{"original": "This can be a major benefit to workers who don't earn a lot now but expect to increase their income significantly in the future. For example, maybe you just graduated from medical school and are in your first year of residency. Eventually, you plan to open your own private practice. In this case, you will likely save money on taxes by paying them now while your income is relatively low instead of at retirement. Tax-deferred compounded growth over decades can really make a big impact to one's retirement nest egg, in addition to being able to have tax-free income later on during retirement, said Celeste Hernandez Revelli, a certified financial planner and director of financial planning at eMoney Advisor."}
{"original": "Another major benefit? You can also withdraw your principal at any time without penalty if you need to, so it's one of the more flexible types of accounts for retirement and general investing, Alden said. Keep in mind this applies to principal only and not investment earnings."}
{"original": "The downside is there is a cap on how much you can earn in order to be eligible for a Roth IRA. The income limit for single filers in 2019 is $122,000–$137,000, depending on the contribution amount. Roth IRA contribution limits are the same as traditional IRAs. And despite the benefits, there are a few other reasons why you might want to think twice about contributing to a Roth IRA."}
{"original": "Best for: People who are self-employed."}
{"original": "How it works: The SEP in SEP-IRA stands for simplified employee pension. Contributions to this type of retirement plan are made by the employer on the employee's behalf. The good news is that any employer with one or more employees can create a SEP plan. So if you're self-employed ― for instance, you own a small business or are a freelancer ― you are both the employer and employee. Contributions are also tax-deductible for the business, and the money isn't taxed until it's withdrawn in retirement."}
{"original": "Contributions made in 2019 to an employee's SEP-IRA can't exceed 25 percent of compensation or $56,000, whichever is less. The nice thing about the SEP-IRA is that your contributions to any personal IRAs don't affect the limits for the SEP employer contributions. That means you could max out both plans if you wanted. However, participating in a SEP plan could affect your ability to deduct traditional or Roth IRA contributions, since the IRS doesn't allow you to deduct as both employer and employee."}
{"original": "Best for: Self-employed individuals who want higher contribution limits."}
{"original": "How it works: Another option for freelancers, small business owners and other self-employed individuals is the one-participant 401(k) plan, also known as a solo 401(k). This account has the same rules and requirements as a traditional 401(k) you'd contribute to through an employer except that it's designed for the self-employed."}
{"original": "According to IRS rules, you must be a business owner to contribute to a solo 401(k), but you can't have employees. The good news is that the plan can cover both you and a spouse."}
{"original": "So why would you choose a solo 401(k) over a SEP-IRA? The contribution limits, namely. It's possible to make contributions to a solo 401(k) as both an employer and an employee. In 2019, the contribution limit for employees is $19,000, or $25,000 for those 50 and older. As an employer, you can contribute up to an additional 25 percent of compensation, or up to $56,000 in total contributions. You can choose to make traditional or Roth contributions."}
{"original": "Best for: Individuals with high-deductible health insurance plans."}
{"original": "How it works: If you have a high-deductible health plan, you might qualify to contribute to a health savings account."}
{"original": "Though an HSA is technically not a retirement savings account, it's as good ― if not better ― than a 401(k) because the contributions are triple tax-exempt, according to Megan Gorman, a managing partner at Chequers Financial Management."}
{"original": "What that means is you fund the account and get an above-the-line deduction on your tax return. The money grows tax-deferred, and if you take it out for qualified medical expenses, it is a tax-free distribution, Gorman said. In 2019, an individual with family coverage under an HDHP can contribute up to $7,000 for the year, which can be used to cover certain medical expense."}
{"original": "After age 65, you can withdraw the funds tax-free to cover health insurance premiums in addition to other qualified medical expenses. You can also use the money for non-medical expenses without paying a penalty; you just have to pay taxes on the withdrawals."}
{"original": "About 35 percent of employer-sponsored health plans offer HSAs. However, you can open your own HSA through most financial institutions even if your employer doesn't offer one, as long as you meet all eligibility requirements."}
{"original": "Best for: Investors who want flexibility and the ability to invest beyond their annual contribution limits."}
{"original": "How it works: If you want more flexibility beyond what the above tax-advantaged accounts offer, consider opening an investment account through a brick-and-mortar or online brokerage, such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Etrade or Ally."}
{"original": "While you won't receive tax benefits, you can contribute to this investment account with your retirement goal in mind, explained Alissa Todd, wealth adviser at The Wealth Consulting Group. For example, you can contribute more than the annual limits on other retirement savings vehicles, making it possible to reach your goals faster."}
{"original": "In fact, you might find that your best strategy is to contribute to a variety of account types in order to maximize your earning and tax savings opportunities."}
{"original": "Even if you have access to a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored plan, it is best to consider saving into other types of investment accounts because each has their own unique benefits and characteristics, Revelli said. There are many other savings options out there that give you full control of your assets, have more flexibility in distributions and have more investment choices."}
{"original": "To the Company Secretary, Pearson PLC: We the undersigned, being 100 members holding shares in the Company on which there has been paid up an average sum, per member, of not less than £100 per member,"}
{"original": "Hereby require you, in accordance with section 314 of the Companies Act 2006, to give to members of the Company entitled to receive notice of the next Annual General Meeting notice of the following resolution, being a resolution that may properly be moved and is intended to be moved at that meeting, and to circulate to members receiving that notice a copy of the annexed statement with respect to the matters referred to in that resolution:"}
{"original": "The Resolution: THAT the Board of Directors of Pearson PLC immediately conduct a thorough business strategy review of Pearson PLC including education commericalization and its support of high stakes testing and low-fee private schools and to report to shareholders within six months."}
{"original": "Supporting Statement: We believe that Pearson PLC (Pearson or the Company) is suffering a crisis of confidence precipitated by a confused business strategy. The evidence is presented by our reaction to the share price, which at the last Annual General Membership Meeting (AGM) held on 24 April 2015, was trading at approximately $20.68. On 15 December 2015, Pearson stock sold for roughly $10.70. This represents a drop in price of over 40% in only seven months. This significant drop in share price calls into question the board's efforts to address the lack of confidence in the Company. We believe that the current strategic business plan has failed to produce the profits or the potential for profits that investors need. Therefore, it is time that Pearson conducts a business strategy review. We urge you to vote FOR this resolution."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) ― The Trump administration's $1.5 trillion cut tax package appeared to have no major impact on businesses' capital investment or hiring plans, according to a survey released a year after the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years."}
{"original": "The National Association of Business Economics' (NABE) quarterly business conditions poll published on Monday found that while some companies reported accelerating investments because of lower corporate taxes, 84 percent of respondents said they had not changed plans. That compares to 81 percent in the previous survey published in October."}

{"original": "The NABE survey also suggested a further slowdown in business spending after moderating sharply in the third quarter of 2018.

Notably, his initial appointees to run the EPA and Interior — Scott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke, respectively — combined environmental despoliation with personal corruption. Their mission is politically cynical and morally bankrupt: dismantle environmental protection, suppress scientific reality and portray environmentalists and scientists as ultraliberal hysterics indifferent to American jobs."}
{"original": "Asked about his own government's comprehensive National Climate Assessment, Trump said, I don't believe it. Ignoring its prediction of dire effects from climate change on our economy, public health, coastlines and infrastructure, he directed the EPA to radically weaken our major efforts to date against man-made global warming: rules restricting greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and power plants."}

{"original": "On Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) laid out Democrats' priorities in the Phase 4 legislation Congress is expected to take up once it returns from recess by April 20. During a conference call with reporters, the speaker said her party would be fighting for added assistance to hospitals and nursing homes, more direct payments to individuals suffering amid the crisis, requirements that hospitals cover the cost of treatment in addition to testing of those diagnosed with COVID-19, bigger paid family and medical leave benefits, and help for state pension funds at risk because of the economic crisis."}
{"original": "Our first bills were about addressing the emergency, Pelosi said on the call, referring to smaller bills Congress passed earlier this month. Our third was about mitigation to the economy. This fourth bill will be about recovery."}
{"original": "Pelosi said the bill ought to specifically address the country's aging infrastructure because making the Internet more widely available would help Americans teleworking from home, those who are remote-learning and those who are using telemedicine to communicate with a doctor. She said more funding was also needed to overhaul the nation's water systems to ensure access to clean sources of drinking water."}

D.C. is due to receive significantly less money, however, than any state in the relief bill moving through Congress last week."}

{"original": "I wouldn't say we came together on a package tonight. No one expected that, but what we did agree to do is to follow up and talk further, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said afterward, calling the nearly two-hour discussion with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris very productive."}
{"original": "We're very appreciative, as his first official meeting in the Oval Office, that the president chose to spend so much time with us in a frank and very useful discussion, Collins added."}
{"original": "Collins and 9 other GOP senators over the weekend proposed a COVID-19 relief package totaling $618 billion, far less than the $1.9 trillion plan that the Biden administration and economists say is needed to adequately confront the historic health and economic crisis. The group includes Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, and Rob Portman of Ohio."}
{"original": "For months, Republicans have bristled at the idea of injecting too much money into the economy, despite consistently high unemployment numbers and high numbers of COVID-19 cases that continue to reach new records in some parts of the country."}
{"original": "The GOP plan dramatically scales down every part of Biden's relief proposal and nixes some parts altogether, including the expanded child tax credit and aid to state and local governments. Republican senators suggested extending federal unemployment insurance through the end of June at the current $300 per week rate instead of the $400 a week Biden proposed through September."}
{"original": "The GOP proposal does include some direct payments, but at a smaller amount of $1,000 and to fewer Americans. Republicans have proposed targeting the checks to individuals making $40,000 a year or less instead of Biden's $1,400 payments, which would go to all individuals making $75,000."}
{"original": "The President expressed his hope that the group could continue to discuss ways to strengthen the American Rescue Plan as it moves forward, and find areas of common ground — including work on small business support and nutrition programs, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement after the meeting on Monday. He reiterated, however, that he will not slow down work on this urgent crisis response, and will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment."}
{"original": "Democrats are prepared to use special budget rules to pass their plan with a simple majority vote in the Senate even if it doesn't gain GOP support. The process is the same one Republicans used to enact broad tax cuts in 2017. They also tried to use it to repeal the Affordable Care Act."}
{"original": "But Republicans now say the president should forego that process and accept a smaller relief package in order to overcome the Senate filibuster."}
{"original": "It will set President Biden down a path of partisanship that I think will poison the well for other bipartisanship we will need on so many issues, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said Sunday in an interview on CNN."}
{"original": "The White House has indicated that it wants Congress to pass a relief bill by March, when federal unemployment benefits will expire for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs during the pandemic."}
{"original": "The package outlined by 10 Senate Republicans is far too small to provide the relief the American people need, incoming Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement. In particular, a three-month extension of jobless benefits is a non-starter. ...We can't keep jumping from cliff to cliff every few months."}
{"original": "Biden's team has repeatedly expressed publicly that its biggest political concerns is passing a new COVID-19 relief package that's too small to address the breadth of the crisis."}
{"original": "Over the weekend, Biden's chief economic counsel, Brian Deese, said on CNN that the White House was open to ideas but questioned whether less money would be sufficient, and implied that negotiations with Republican may take too much time."}
{"original": "The president is uncompromising when it comes to the speed that we need to act at to address this crisis, Deese said."}

It's admirable that people will challenge themselves time and time again."}

But if you complete your workouts for the week, you collect a portion of the amount paid out by everyone else."}
{"original": "Some people make an arrangement with a friend where you each agree to work out X times a week and to pay the other person $5 or $10 for each workout missed. Or, you could opt to make a donation to a charity of your friend's choice rather than pay each other. The goal is to provide accountability to each other, and the financial aspect can add a sense of urgency and be a great motivational tool."}
{"original": "Connect an activity tracker to rewards programs. Several services give you points each time you work out. Once you accrue enough, you can redeem the points for cash, gift cards or other prizes. The real trick is to use multiple programs and earn a few points in each one whenever you exercise. Some employers also provide bonus points to employees that use these programs or have similar rewards programs of their own."}
{"original": "Make working out your work. If you're looking to make a serious lifestyle change, and potentially some serious money, consider an investment in your skills and body. For example, you could look into becoming a personal trainer or fitness instructor. While the certification process can be expensive and time-consuming, afterward you'll be able to charge clients for classes or one-on-one training."}
{"original": "Or, you could try to find flexible and active work that suits your interests and experience. Gardener, referee or dog walker could be good fits to supplement your income."}
{"original": "Keep exercise-related expenses down. It can be tempting to buy new workout equipment or sign up for a gym when you're excited about a New Year's resolution. However, getting out of a gym contract can be difficult if you change your mind later and there are many ways to get fit without expensive equipment."}
{"original": "For example, you can find videos of free instructor-led workouts or yoga sequences online or try an app that creates and leads you through workouts. If you want to take up swimming, tennis or another activity that requires facilities, look for inexpensive options at local community centers."}
{"original": "Raise money for a charity with every step. You may not have a strong desire to earn money but are still looking for a little extra motivation to work out. Similar to the programs that reward you with points, there are apps like Charity Miles that you can use to raise money for your favorite charities while exercising."}
{"original": "You could also sign up for a charity walk, run or ride and raise money from friends and family. Take your training seriously and know that when you cross the finish line you'll be helping out a good cause."}
{"original": "Use the extra money to help achieve your other goals for the year. By keeping costs down and making your physical activity a potential source of extra income you can make your budget (and body) more flexible. Consider your other goals for the year and how the money can help you achieve them."}
{"original": "Perhaps you're trying to save up for a down payment or vacation, focused on building your retirement savings or looking to make a significant impact in your community by donating to non-profit organizations. Every extra dollar you earn can bring you one step closer to achieving that goal."}
{"original": "Bottom line: The start of a new year is often a time of introspection, and for many people that means reexamining their physical health and personal finances. Rather than viewing those as completely separate, look for new ways to make money while staying active. This approach could help you stay motivated for longer, and reach your goals sooner."}

{"original": "But change may be in the cards for Dodson and for the rest of her neighborhood. Orcem, an American subsidiary of Irish cement manufacturer Ecocem, has been eyeing the old Sperry Flour Mill site on the mouth of the Napa River to build a cement grinding facility, just blocks from Dodson's home."}
{"original": "To support the factory's operations, the Vallejo Marine Terminal – which owns the majority of the project site and would lease a portion to Orcem – is proposing to revamp a defunct commercial rail line and open an international shipping terminal."}
{"original": "While some residents and city officials are in favor of the cement project, opponents say the pollution from the factory, and from heavy truck traffic it would generate, would pose severe risks to the health of residents, especially the predominantly black community close to the facility."}
{"original": "TJ Walkup Apache Dodson (left) with local environmental justice activist LaDonna Williams."}
{"original": "A city of 121,000 people, Vallejo was once home to the Mare Island Navy Shipyard, which built tankers, destroyers, and nuclear submarines. After the shipyard was decommissioned in 1996, Vallejo became a bedroom community as its residents sought work elsewhere."}
{"original": "Orcem's promise of employment, tax revenue, and a $1 million investment into local nonprofits is understandably attractive to some in a city that declared bankruptcy in 2008. The company says its facility would provide up to 40 full-time jobs and an additional 100 during the 15-month construction period."}
{"original": "Prominent Vallejo business owner Buck Kamphausen wrote in the Vallejo Times-Herald in May that Orcem would be the ideal business to replace the decaying and dangerous former flour mill. Who is going to pay for a rotting old industrial building?, he asked. The state and federal governments are way out of money for this kind of project."}
{"original": "But others are wary. Vallejo suffers from low self-esteem, says Diana Lang, a real estate agent and Vallejo resident of more than 17 years. There's some people who look back on the glory days of industry and see that this could replicate that. Lang says the environmental consequences of the facility would outweigh the benefit of its few jobs."}
{"original": "According to the official project description, the cement facility would operate around the clock, with 189 trucks making trips to and from the site once it's working at full capacity. The site is within 300 feet of residential zones, and about a quarter mile from Grace Patterson Elementary School."}

{"original": "LaDonna Williams, a veteran of environmental justice campaigning in the Bay Area who has lived in Vallejo for 30 years, says of corporations: They always come in on the south side or the black side of town and think it's OK to put these kinds of polluting companies in."}
{"original": "A recent study by Environmental Protection Agency researchers gives weight to Williams' assertion. It found that refineries and factories emitting dangerous air pollutants disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color. Black people in particular bear the biggest environmental burden of any group, the study says."}
{"original": "Local activists are keen to stress this point to the Vallejo community in response to Orcem's promises. Do we really put that kind of job over people's lives? asks Williams. No. I don't even think that's an option."}
{"original": "Orcem, which didn't respond to multiple requests for comment, touts the site's location as positive. On its website, it mentions the deep-water berth, railroad, and proximity to the highway as an opportunity to help establish Vallejo as a center of international trade and commerce."}
{"original": "But to others, the project is an inappropriate use of prime waterfront property. Lang, who has worked in real estate for 13 years, says the fact that homes are located downwind from the site should disqualify it from being used for heavy industry. Besides that, it would be a really unattractive thing to have on the waterfront as people come in and out via ferry, she says."}
{"original": "Peter Brooks, president of Fresh Air Vallejo, a grassroots group formed in opposition to the cement facility, says Vallejo is no longer as desperate for jobs, and should look for economic opportunities outside of heavy industry. He points to Factory OS, a company that manufactures modular homes, which recently opened a factory in Vallejo's Mare Island neighborhood, providing hundreds of jobs."}

{"original": "Orcem's website says it would produce what it calls green cement. It would ship iron slag — a byproduct of steel production — from Asia, grind it into a powder, and mix it with other materials to make cement. This type of cement requires less energy and emits far fewer greenhouse gases during production than traditional Portland cement, which is manufactured by heating limestone at high temperatures."}
{"original": "Jeremy Gregory, executive director of MIT's Concrete Sustainability Hub, says pollutants created by a cement facility are undoubtedly cause for concern, but California has strong regulations to help keep those risks in check."}
{"original": "One thing that's certain, Gregory says, is that demand for cement ― a key ingredient of concrete for buildings, pavements, and bridges ― isn't going away. If you don't have this facility there, you'll still have to do this somewhere, he says."}
{"original": "But environmentalists look to other communities that have housed cement production as warnings. In 2001, residents of Camden, New Jersey, unsuccessfully sued to block the opening of a slag grinding cement facility, similar to the one proposed by Orcem. A 2009 study for the state Department of Environmental Protection found that the facility contributed air pollution to the neighborhood in its vicinity."}
{"original": "And about 100 miles south of Vallejo, the town of Davenport in Santa Cruz County is trying to figure out life post-cement factory. For over 100 years, the plant there produced Portland cement. In 2008, cancer-causing chromium 6 was discovered on the factory property, and it closed in 2010. Cemex, the most recent owner of the plant, is looking for a buyer for the property who would work with the county to reuse the site for something else."}
{"original": "It provided good jobs and tax revenue, but it had significant environmental impacts in terms of dust and pollution, says Ryan Coonerty, the Santa Cruz County supervisor who represents the area. It was, without a question, a mixed blessing for the community."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― Then-President Donald Trump raised $76 million for a political slush fund by citing the need to challenge his Nov. 3 reelection loss and for Republicans to win two Senate runoffs in Georgia, but through the end of 2020 he did not spend a dime of it on either."}
{"original": "He put nothing back. He didn't care, said one top Republican familiar with the fundraising operation who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding that Trump intends to use the money to pay his personal, non-election-related, legal bills. He put all this money in the bank for his own legal fights. He never cared about Georgia's races."}
{"original": "Trump faces a series of legal problems, both civil and criminal, for issues ranging from sexual misconduct allegations to potential tax fraud inquiries. And his second Senate impeachment trial starts next week; this time he is charged with inciting the violent mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6."}
{"original": "Jason Miller, one of a handful of former campaign and White House aides who continue to work for Trump in his post-presidency, did not respond to HuffPost queries."}
{"original": "Many Republicans say that, far from helping his party win the Jan. 5 Georgia races, Trump's repeated lies about the election having been stolen from him ― particularly in the Peach State, where he narrowly lost to Democrat Joe Biden ― depressed turnout among GOP voters and cost them both seats and control of the Senate."}
{"original": "Trump's Save America leadership committee, which he can use for just about any purpose he wants, including paying himself a salary, reported ending the year with $31.2 million in the bank. And it's entitled to another $45 million sitting in the account of a joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee."}
{"original": "That joint operation, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, sent out hundreds of fundraising emails and texts on Save America's behalf starting from Nov. 11 right through Jan. 6, just minutes before the mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol after being instructed by him to stop Congress from officially certifying Biden's victory. Five people died during the riot, including one police officer killed by the mob, and 140 were injured."}
{"original": "TODAY will be a historic day in our Nation's history. Congress will either certify, or object to, the Election results, a 1:23 p.m. email on Jan. 6 read. Every single Patriot from across the Country must step up RIGHT NOW if we're going to successfully DEFEND the integrity of this Election. President Trump is calling on YOU to bolster our Official Defend America Fund."}
{"original": "In reality, though, the only money Save America spent through the end of December were payments totaling $343,000 to WinRed, a GOP campaign payment processing company, according to a HuffPost review of year-end Federal Election Commission reports filed late Sunday."}
{"original": "Nor was any of Save America's money spent to help the Georgia Republican senators, despite 39 emails and 9 text messages that specifically cited those Senate races."}
{"original": "Dem Elites are funneling MILLIONS into Georgia to RIP AWAY the Senate. Pres Trump needs YOU to step up, read a text sent on Dec. 1."}

{"original": "So-called leadership PACs are loosely regulated committees often used by politicians to build support among their peers by donating to their campaigns. However, unlike formal campaign committees, those controlling leadership PACs can use the money to pick up their own personal expenses or even pay themselves a salary."}

{"original": "Though it looks like the market is beginning to turn around somewhat, we're still living in an incredibly low-yield environment. When you're buying your first home, this is great. When you're trying to make your retirement savings last, it's challenging."}
{"original": "Many of today's retirees are having trouble maintaining their savings in this low-yield environment. Times like these call for creativity and extra planning, as traditional retirement investments simply aren't cutting it. If you need to increase your yield to further stretch your retirement funds, here are six options for doing it:"}
{"original": "1. Online banks and credit unions. While you're not going to make a lot of money on any savings account these days, increasing your savings yield by moving your liquid savings can be helpful. Credit unions and online banks both tend to offer better savings and checking account yields than traditional larger banks. Taking advantage of special savings and checking account offers can really increase your liquid savings yield. Watch for offers from credit unions and high-yield, low-fee online savings accounts."}
{"original": "2. I bonds. I bonds can be an excellent low-risk investment that protects your money from inflation. They earn interest based on a fixed rate combined with a variable rate indexed for inflation."}
{"original": "Even though I bonds get very little by way of interest - 1.18 percent between May and October, 2013 - the fact that they're indexed for inflation keeps you from losing money every year. Sure, other investments may earn more like 2 or 3 percent, but without that extra inflation rate, you'll actually lose money over time. There are some restrictions in terms of getting access to your money in the first year, and you'll pay a small penalty if you withdraw your money in the first five years, so be sure you understand how I bonds work before making the investment."}
{"original": "3. Dividend-paying stocks. While even the best dividend-paying stocks don't pay out as much as they did 50 years ago, they can still be a good option for increasing your yield. As with all other stocks, it's important to do your research here. It's also smart to avoid too-good-to-be-true dividend-paying stocks. Some companies set their dividends too high, leading them to financial ruin in the future. But financially sound, high growth companies offering dividend-paying stocks can be a great investment."}
{"original": "4. Short-term bond funds. Long-term bond funds are susceptible to what is called interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, the value of long-term bond funds fall. While that may seem odd, the reason is simple. Long-term bonds lock in the interest rate for as many as 30 years or more. If the rate is low, and then interest rates begin to rise, these long-term bonds lose their appeal as investors prefer current offerings with high rates."}
{"original": "Short-term bond funds, however, don't have the same risk. Because these bonds mature in a relatively short time period, a rise in interest rates does not affect the value of short-term bonds in the same way. While rates are typically lower on bonds with shorter durations, they can be ideal for income investors."}
{"original": "5. Junk bonds. While you certainly don't want to invest a large part of your portfolio in high-risk securities like junk bonds, allocating a small portion can increase your yields. Junk bonds typically have a rating of BB or lower by Standard and Poor's, making them riskier investments. However, these bonds could have a place in even a conservative investor's retirement portfolio. Personally, I invest a small percentage of my portfolio in junk bonds and other high-yield, higher-risk bonds."}
{"original": "6. REITs. Real estate investment trusts offer an excellent way to increase income. A REIT trades like a stock and invests directly in real estate. REITs typically invest in properties and collect rents (called an equity REIT) or invest in mortgages (called a mortgage REIT). Because of special tax considerations, REITs pay dividends of at least 90 percent of their taxable income, which can make them ideal for retirees. Of course, REITs also expose investors to the ups and downs of the real estate market, which should be considered before making an investment."}
{"original": "The above options show that to get a higher yield, investors must take on more risk. However, a combination of the above options in conjunction with a well-diversified portfolio may be able to help you boost your yield without taking on an unacceptable level of volatility."}
{"original": "Janie Osborne via Getty Images A resident of Butte, Montana. The share of middle-class households grew more in Montana than in any other state between 2013 and 2016."}

{"original": "However, there's still a lot of catching up to do: In 2016 there were 30 states where at least half of households were middle class, up from 28 in 2013 but still down from 43 states in 2000."}
{"original": "I think the main thing you are seeing is that the middle class is still struggling in most places, said David Madland, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress and author of Hollowed Out: Why the Economy Doesn't Work without a Strong Middle Class."}
{"original": "A booming economy and a tight labor market may have raised wages for those on the bottom rung of the economic ladder, Madland said, but middle-class wages have not gotten a significant boost."}
{"original": "Tight labor markets help, but in today's economy they aren't enough, Madland said. Workers don't have enough bargaining power to get much of a raise."}
{"original": "Chris Edwards, an economist at the conservative Cato Institute, said the middle class has continued to do well this year because of rising wages and tax cuts for some workers, but at the expense of higher government spending that will come back to haunt it."}
{"original": "My message to the middle class is, 'Enjoy it while you can,' because Washington is building up a pile of debt that's going to eventually land on the middle class by pushing taxes up, Edwards said."}
{"original": "Only Alaska and Hawaii had a larger share of middle-class households in 2016 than in 2000 — and in both cases, the increase was just two-tenths of a percentage point, to about 55 percent. Alaska and Hawaii are the two states with the lowest concentration of wealth in the top 1 percent, according to a 2015 study by economist Mark Frank at Sam Houston State University in Texas."}
{"original": "The recent increase in the share of middle-class households is likely due to the rapid pace of economic recovery in recent years, Frank said."}
{"original": "After the Great Recession, things popped back pretty fast, Frank said."}
{"original": "Most states did see an expanding middle class between 2013 and 2016, though in all but three — Montana, Connecticut and Georgia — the increase was smaller than 2 percentage points. In Montana, the share of middle-class households grew by nearly 3 percentage points, from 51 percent in 2013 to 54 percent in 2016. In 2000, 55 percent of Montana households were middle class."}
{"original": "The share of middle-class households in Connecticut and Georgia grew by 2 percentage points between 2013 and 2016, to 51 percent in Connecticut and 49 percent in Georgia. In both states, the share of middle-class households declined by more than 4 points between 2000 and 2013."}
{"original": "Idaho was the only state where the erosion of the middle class accelerated between 2013 and 2016. After declining by less than 1 percentage point between 2000 and 2013, Idaho's share of middle-class households dropped by more than 2 percentage points between 2013 and 2016, to 53 percent."}
{"original": "Even if the size of the middle class in a particular state grows, the households in that category may be less prosperous if their incomes are stagnant or declining."}
{"original": "In most states, however, middle-class households benefited from rising incomes between 2013 and 2016: In 35 states where inflation-adjusted median income declined between 2000 and 2013, it rose between 2013 and 2016."}
{"original": "Wyoming was the only state to see an income decline, of about 2 percent, between 2013 and 2016."}

{"original": "Our last six major candidates for President of the United States are all graduates of prosperous and prestigious private preparatory schools - Obama (Punahou School'79, HI), Romney (Cranbrook Schools '65, MI), McCain (Episcopal High School '54, VA), Bush (Phillips Andover Academy '64, MA), Kerry (St. Paul's School '62, NH), and Gore (St. Alban's School '65, DC). The schools reported endowments averaging over $300 million on their IRS Forms 990 in SY (school year) 2012. So much for the old log cabin image presidential candidates once liked to project."}
{"original": "While both were worth millions, Obama and Romney reportedly paid personal income tax in 2011 at effective rates (tax paid as a percentage of AGI, adjusted gross income) lower than Warren Buffett's personal assistant's - 14.1% for Romney and 20.5% for Obama. How could that be possible, indeed legal, in a so-called progressive tax system, with a top marginal rate - tax on the last dollar earned - of 35%? (The top rate increased to 39.6% in 2013.)"}
{"original": "The Occupy Wall Street movement began the same year, embarrassing a few of the 1%, the super-rich, by calling public attention to such inequities in our tax system. In 2014, Thomas Piketty mapped the widening income gap between rich and poor over time in his best-seller, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and extended the study to include the wealth gap as well. Robert Putnam's more recent Our Kids goes a step further, showing how mightily both gaps contribute to the immorality of the opportunity gap poor kids in the United States face today."}
{"original": "The final 38 years of my 44-year career in secondary education were spent at Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania, a private boarding school whose endowment now resembles the ones cited above. In the sixties, wanting a more egalitarian image, private schools shed the word private and replaced it with independent. Independent of what? Well, of government, of course - both the funding and the regulation government applies to public schools."}
{"original": "Yet nearly thirty years as Mercersburg's chief development officer taught me that, while private schools may receive no direct funding from government, they do receive significant indirect support from Washington and from their states and municipalities in the form of tax loopholes, deductions, and exemptions - tax expenditures in the nomenclature of the IRS."}
{"original": "The low effective tax rates of Romney and Obama, so far beneath the top marginal rate, arise from tax policies that favor those with high income and high net worth. Realizing how much they favor the rich caused me to wonder if the same policies might also explain the widening income and wealth gaps between our richest and poorest private schools."}
{"original": "To explore that possibility I set out to quantify the total tax expenditure (indirect support from governments at all levels) Mercersburg received in SY2012. While well aware of each type of tax expenditure, their individual and collective scales surprised me. In fact, the wealthier independent schools might legitimately be called dependent."}
{"original": "Taxpayers are most familiar with this tax expenditure. Mercersburg's IRS Forms 990 show it received gifts averaging $11.7 million per year for the five years ended June 30, 2012. If the distribution of incomes among its donors was the same as in the general public, the average annual tax savings for Mercersburg donors would have been at least $2.5 million (Appendix A.)"}
{"original": "The incomes of private school donors are skewed more highly, of course, than those of the general public. An old axiom of fundraising is that the top 10% of donors do 90% of the giving. Let's assume the 90% rule holds, and that the top 10% of Mercersburg donors were all actually in the top 5% of incomes - about $167,000 or more in 2012. The tax expenditure could then have been as much as $3.3 million per year (Appendix A.)"}
{"original": "Splitting the difference, the average tax savings the IRS passed along to Mercersburg donors would be $2.9 million per year for SY2008 through SY2012. The charitable deduction is typically the largest of many government subsidies wealthy non-profits receive."}
{"original": "At 40% - even higher than the top marginal rate - the new federal estate tax rate sounds formidable. But it is not applied until the size of the estate is reduced by certain charitable provisions ... and reduced, yet again, by a further $5.25 million. As a result, most estates - over 99.8% of them in 2013 - paid no federal tax at all. Federal estate tax revenue, which averaged $22.5 billion for the years 2001 to 2009, plummeted to $5.0 billion in 2013."}
{"original": "America's most prosperous baby-boomers have long sat atop the largest rich to poor income gap since the Census Bureau began tracking such data. Those whose parents died before the virtual elimination of the estate tax in 2010, had already received part of the biggest intergenerational transfer of wealth in U.S. history. The others did or eventually will do even better under the new estate tax. And all of them now have free rein to enshrine in their progeny, at their deaths, the American plutocracy - rule of the rich - the estate tax was originally designed to curb. Score another one for inherited (not merited) wealth!"}

{"original": "A growing bipartisan backlash is emerging against the possibility that Congress would lower the income eligibility for proposed $1,400 relief checks, reducing or eliminating benefits for many middle-class households."}
{"original": "Like previous relief payments, President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan would begin phasing out cash payments for individuals earning more than $75,000 a year and married couples earning $150,000 a year."}
{"original": "But the White House and several Democratic lawmakers have expressed openness to lowering the income threshold for the drawdown of benefits to $50,000 a year for individuals and $100,000 a year for a married couple."}
{"original": "Now a number of lawmakers from both parties have begun pushing back on the suggestion. Reps. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) and David McKinley (R-W.Va.) introduced legislation on Friday that would deliver the cash payments to families and phase them out at the original income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples."}
{"original": "Today's weak jobs report highlights how American families are struggling and need immediate relief, McKinley said in a statement. By providing a third round of individual relief, millions of American families would receive the help they need."}
{"original": "I'm proud to, once again, join with Representative McKinley to make clear that providing direct relief to the American people shouldn't be a partisan issue, Blunt Rochester said in her own statement accompanying the bill."}
{"original": "Both McKinley and Blunt Rochester enjoy unique influence because of the states they represent. Blunt Rochester, Delaware's sole representative in the House, is a close ally of Biden, a fellow Delawarean."}
{"original": "And McKinley's perch in West Virginia means he shares a constituency with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), whose support Democrats need to pass a bill of any kind. Manchin, the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, has expressed more skepticism of the relief bill's price tag and benefits for so-called higher earners than either McKinley or Republican West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice."}
{"original": "Pool/Getty Images President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the national economy and the need for his administration's proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief legislation on Friday."}
{"original": "When it comes to relief payments, the political stakes are especially high for Democrats, who flipped two Georgia Senate seats in January based on a promise of delivering cash aid to families that then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had held up. Democrats vowed to bring the total aid to these households up to $2,000 a person by supplementing a payment of $600 that Congress approved in December with another $1,400 check."}
{"original": "Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) warned Biden against tinkering with the income thresholds in an interview with The Intercept that came out on Friday. I would advise [Biden], if he were to ask me, that is not the place to compromise, that if you want to see us lose a Senate race in Georgia in two years, then modify the promise made — break the promise made during the Georgia runoff, Merkley said."}
{"original": "Sen. Jon Ossoff, one of two Georgia Democrats whose victory in January flipped control of the Senate, also indicated his preference for keeping income thresholds as they are."}
{"original": "I want this package to be as ambitious as possible. I was sent here to fight for major COVID relief, Ossoff told HuffPost. I was sent here to fight for stimulus checks for Georgia families. And I don't want to see any reductions in the help that we're sending to people."}
{"original": "Likewise, Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Cory Booker (N.J.) and Chris Murphy (Conn.) all told HuffPost they prefer a phase-out that begins at individuals earning $75,000 a year and married couples earning $150,000 a year."}
{"original": "I'm a state where $100,000 doesn't go as far as a state like Louisiana, Murphy told HuffPost. So I'd rather keep the threshold where it is."}

{"original": "Millions are on the brink of eviction. Give too little and they're devastated, she told her 12 million followers in a Twitter thread panning the lower income thresholds. Give 'too much' and a single mom might save for a rainy day. This isn't hard."}
{"original": "The complexities of the congressional debate over cash payments reflect the peculiar nature of the drawdown formula. Currently, the cash payments are set to decline 5% for every dollar above the income threshold that a person earns ― reducing payments by $50 for every $1,000 above the cutoff."}
{"original": "As a result, larger checks end up going to a bigger group of earners than smaller ones. For example, the $600 check sent to families in December reached fewer families than the $1,200 checks Congress sent out in March, because it phased out faster above the income threshold."}
{"original": "Barring any changes then, checks of $1,400 would, by default, go to a slice of higher earners than the first two rounds of cash relief. The new bill also provides $1,400 for every dependent in a household, potentially enabling even some upper-middle-class households with numerous children to receive benefits for which they were previously ineligible."}
{"original": "To address concerns about sending benefits to families on the higher end of the earnings spectrum, Biden, Manchin and even some progressive stalwarts like Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are openly entertaining the idea of lowering the income threshold for the phaseout to $50,000. Even if Congress set the phaseout threshold at $40,000 a year for individuals, a small percentage of households with annual incomes of $390,000 a year would get cash payments, according to an analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation."}
{"original": "But some economists, activists and now lawmakers worry that the price of excluding more middle-class families ― some 10 million of them, per the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center ― far outweigh the dangers of sending money to high-earning households."}
{"original": "There is a large chunk of the income distribution that got $2,000 from Trump, $600 from Trump, and then will get $0 from Biden, University of Utah economist Marshall Steinbaum warned on Twitter."}
{"original": "Critics have also noted that unless Americans file their tax returns for 2020 prior to the bill's passage, the federal government will assess their cash payments based on their income in 2019. Many Americans have experienced sudden declines in their earnings since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March."}

{"original": "The partial government shutdown has now gone on for 22 days, making it the longest such closure in U.S. history."}
{"original": "Many of the affected federal employees had missed at least one paycheck as of Saturday, when the shutdown hit record length. The financial stress is leading some workers to look for other jobs, ask relatives for money, apply for unemployment or even go without essentials like medication. Meanwhile, other Americans are facing a host of inconveniences and hardships, from shuttered museums to delayed farm loans."}
{"original": "We've dipped into our savings account already. If it keeps going, my husband said he'll call his parents and see if they'll lend us some money, said DeCarann Speaks, a mother of two and the wife of a Border Patrol agent in Vermont who is working without a paycheck. Some days I just want to sit and cry. But I have to stay positive for my children."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump is insisting that Congress give him $5.7 billion to build a wall on the border with Mexico, a proposition Democrats describe as a costly and immoral boondoggle. With talks at a standstill in Washington, the president headed to the border on Thursday to make his case for the wall. He said he is considering declaring a national emergency to get the funding Democrats have denied him, a maneuver all but certain to be challenged in court."}
{"original": "The impasse has meant that roughly a quarter of federal government functions are no longer funded, with agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, the Interior Department and the Internal Revenue Service largely shut down. Approximately 380,000 federal employees have been furloughed and are out of work, while another 420,000 are still working as essential personnel but are not being paid."}
{"original": "It's just ridiculous that people have to suffer and go through hardship and be stressed out. Larry Howard, worker at the National Zoo"}
{"original": "The shutdown, which began Dec. 22, was technically the third to take place in 2018, although the first lasted a mere three days, and the second lasted just a few hours and did not result in any furloughs. There have been 21 similar funding lapses since 1976, but only a handful of major shutdowns in which workers went without pay. Until now, the longest one had been a 21-day shutdown starting in December 1995, amid a deadlock between then-President Bill Clinton and congressional Republicans."}
{"original": "The current closure had only marginal impact on the general public at first, when many people were on vacation for the holidays and government offices were closed anyway. But as the shutdown drags on with no obvious end in sight, Americans are growing more aware and more annoyed by the disruption. More than four in 10 Americans now consider the partial shutdown a very serious problem, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted Jan. 4 to 7."}
{"original": "The Trump administration has tried to mitigate some of the most noticeable effects of the shutdown to avoid public backlash. For instance, the National Park Service kept many parks open but with reduced staff, leading to piled-up trash and damaged vegetation in parks like Joshua Tree."}
{"original": "With the shutdown bleeding into tax season, the Internal Revenue Service is calling some employees back from furlough in order to process refunds after a change in policy from the White House. And the Agriculture Department announced a complicated plan to continue food assistance for the poor into February, to keep people fed and avoid further economic damage."}
{"original": "Government shutdowns are costly affairs. Federal agencies must spend time and energy developing contingency plans in the runup to a closure, then have to make up missed work once the government finally reopens. As the messy situation in national parks has demonstrated, the government's work does not stop just because funds haven't been appropriated for that work. Agencies will face a backlog of responsibilities to handle once they are fully operational again."}
{"original": "Shutdowns can also hurt the broader economy, as workers tighten their budgets due to missed paychecks and consumer confidence dampens. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that the 2013 shutdown of 16 days reduced GDP for the fourth quarter of that year by 0.3 percentage points."}
{"original": "Congress has already appropriated funding for roughly three-quarters of the federal government, leaving many agencies unaffected by the shutdown. House Democrats, who assumed the majority last week, passed bills that would reopen shuttered agencies other than DHS, which is at the center of the funding dispute. But Republican leaders in the Senate have refused to take up those bills and stood alongside the president, who threatened to veto any legislation without full wall funding."}
{"original": "The House and Senate approved a bill to pay all federal employees who have been missing paychecks, including those who were furloughed. But Trump still has to sign the bill. If he does, the workers would not receive any pay until the government reopens and payroll is processed."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, workers must still figure out how to pay their bills without a regular paycheck. Many are turning to interest-free loans or applying for unemployment benefits, which workers must return if they eventually receive backpay."}
{"original": "Trump's threat that the shutdown could go on for years rattled many workers unsure of how they'll cover their mortgage and car payments. The shutdown is a particularly raw deal for employees working under federal contracts, as they are not directly employed by the government and typically don't get backpay."}

{"original": "One such worker is Larry Howard, a 62-year-old guest services associate at the National Zoo in Washington. The zoo is part of the sprawling Smithsonian network, which closed on Jan. 2 as a result of the shutdown. Howard said he is employed by a non-profit contractor, the Friends of the National Zoo, earning $13.50 per hour in his part-time position. His last payday was Jan. 4, and he doesn't expect to receive a check next week as he normally would."}
{"original": "Howard had to ask his landlord for leniency on his January rent, paying only $400 of the $800. He also asked for more time to pay his electric bill ― an indignity he says he shouldn't have to suffer."}
{"original": "The way this situation is, there's no other choice but try to persuade them that they'll get that money ... when I can get it to them, said Howard, who is an activist with Good Jobs Nation, a union-backed group pushing for higher pay for federal contractors. It's just ridiculous that people have to suffer and go through hardship and be stressed out."}
{"original": "Some Democrats are supporting a bill that would provide backpay for people like Howard who work under federal contracts and lost wages because of the shutdown. Such a bill has not made it into law in the past. I hope that Congress will step up to the plate and pass some kind of bill for the contractors who aren't getting anything, Howard said."}
{"original": "Speaks, whose husband works for the Border Patrol along the U.S.-Canadian border, said both she and her husband have student loans to repay. She recently earned a degree in medical assisting and her loan repayments began just before the new year, right around the time her husband received his last paycheck."}
{"original": "For now, they are getting by on Speaks' salary at her hospital. Although their two children are just 8 and 9 years old, They understand that we have to budget really well right now, Speaks said. The family halted their Netflix and Hulu subscriptions and put other non-necessities on hiatus, including a 10-year anniversary trip planned for this year."}
{"original": "Speaks said she found it particularly galling that members of Congress continue to get paid as federal employees work with their paychecks on hold."}
{"original": "I just really wish they would focus on the people they're affecting, Speaks said. Workers like her husband and his colleagues are out there risking their lives, she added, and they're not getting paid. It's not fair."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate late Wednesday passed an unparalleled $2.2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic."}
{"original": "The unanimous vote came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough and capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike it has ever faced."}
{"original": "The 880-page measure is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared somber and exhausted as he announced the vote — and he released senators from Washington until April 20, though he promised to recall them if needed."}
{"original": "Pray for one another, for all of our families, and for our country, said McConnell, R-Ky."}
{"original": "The legislation now before us now is historic because it is meant to match a historic crisis,said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Our health care system is not prepared to care for the sick. Our workers are without work. Our businesses cannot do business. Our factories lie idle. The gears of the American economy have ground to a halt."}
{"original": "The package is intended as relief for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed more than 21,000 people worldwide. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, asked how long the aid would keep the economy afloat, said: We've anticipated three months. Hopefully, we won't need this for three months."}
{"original": "Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House's best guess."}
{"original": "Insistently optimistic, President Donald Trump said of the greatest public-health emergency in anyone's lifetime, I don't think its going to end up being such a rough patch and anticipated the economy soaring like a rocket ship when it's over."}
{"original": "The government has temporarily shut down the economy because of this disease, and the government must help those who are hurt by it, said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn."}
{"original": "The drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators from states who economies are dominated by low-wage jobs demanded changes, saying the legislation as written might give workers like store clerks incentives to stay on unemployment instead of returning return to their jobs since they may earn more money if they're laid off than if they're working. They settled for a failed vote to modify the provision."}
{"original": "Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said, I'm telling you, these numbers don't work."}
{"original": "Ardent liberals like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were restless as well, but top Washington Democrats assured them that a additional coronavirus legislation will follow this spring and signaled that delaying the pending measure would be foolish."}
{"original": "The sprawling measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid."}
{"original": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., swung behind the bipartisan agreement, saying it takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people."}
{"original": "Senate passage delivered the legislation to the Democratic-controlled House, which is expected to pass it Friday. House members are scattered around the country. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said the measure would pass by voice vote without lawmakers having to return to Washington."}
{"original": "The package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home."}
{"original": "It includes a controversial, heavily negotiated $500 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well."}
{"original": "Six days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was not an option — nor was starting over — which permitted both sides to include their priorities."}
{"original": "This is a proud moment for the United States Senate and the country and we're going to win this battle, McConnell told reporters afterward. We've pivoted from impeachment to 100 to nothing on this rescue package ... this is about as flawless as you could possibly be. The vote actually was 96-0 because several members missed the vote out of concerns they have been exposed to the virus."}
{"original": "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has tested positive for it, while GOP Whip John Thune returned to South Dakota on Wednesday after feeling ill."}
{"original": "The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child."}
{"original": "A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks to an estimated $130 billion. Another $45 billion would fund additional relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for local response efforts and community services."}
{"original": "Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time."}
{"original": "Businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance."}
{"original": "Schumer boasted of negotiating wins for transit systems, hospitals and cash-hungry state governments that were cemented after Democrats blocked the measure in votes held Sunday and Monday."}
{"original": "But Cuomo said the Senate package would send less than $4 billion to New York, far short of his estimate that the crisis will cost his state up to $15 billion over the next year. More than 280 New Yorkers have died from the virus, a death toll more than double that of any other state."}
{"original": "Still, Pelosi said the need for more money for New York is no reason to stop the step we are taking."}
{"original": "Pelosi was a force behind $400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics called political opportunism. The package also contains $15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps as part of a massive $330 billion title for agency operations."}
{"original": "State and local authorities would receive up to $150 billion in grants to fight the virus, care for their residents and provide basic services."}
{"original": "Republicans won inclusion of an employee retention tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paycheck up to $10,000. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax."}
{"original": "A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to $330 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined."}
{"original": "Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support."}

{"original": "TORONTO — No aspect of Canadian life has been left untouched by the COVID-19 pandemic, including politics, and pundits agree the premier of Ontario is one of those most transformed by the outbreak."}
{"original": "Doug Ford, a divisive player on the regional stage long before becoming an equally polarizing national figure, has been turning heads since it became clear that Canada would not be spared the spread of the novel coronavirus. But many of those heads, once likely to be thrown back in dismay, are now bestowing nods of approval."}
{"original": "Gone is the pugnacious partisanship and populist rhetoric that opponents once used to compare Ford to U.S. President Donald Trump. The premier's regular briefings have instead drawn widespread plaudits for their calm, collegial tone as well as their comparatively progressive content."}
{"original": "Such an approach, political observers say, differs not only from that demonstrated by like-minded politicians south of the border but from his own past conduct."}
{"original": "Chris Young/ The Canadian Press Ontario Premier Doug Ford holds a bottle of hand sanitizer at the Ontario Legislature, in Toronto on March 28, 2020."}
{"original": "I'm a Liberal, but I'll give Doug Ford a lot of credit — he's handling this really well, said Dan Moulton, vice-president at Crestview Strategy and former senior staff member in the previous Liberal government. He's being transparent, responsive, engaging. Ontarians are really seeing him in action."}
{"original": "Praise from the centre or left of the spectrum has been rare through Ford's unorthodox and colourful political career."}
{"original": "During his time as Toronto city councillor, Ford drew heavily on his experience running the family label-making business and his well-honed populist instincts to carve out a reputation for staunch conservatism and straight talk."}
{"original": "Those traits remained on full display when he became premier in June 2018 and throughout a tumultuous first year in office that saw his Progressive Conservative government reverse course on a host of core policies and promises."}
{"original": "Ford was rarely conciliatory, whether discussing hydro rates, environmental policy or labour negotiations with Ontario teachers."}
{"original": "Chris Young/ The Canadian Press Ontario Premier Doug Ford is pictured during a press briefing in Toronto, on March 28, 2020."}
{"original": "He arbitrarily slashed the size of Toronto city council half-way through a municipal election campaign, then threatened to invoke the rarely used notwithstanding clause to overturn a court decision that found his actions unconstitutional. The case will now be heard by the Supreme Court of Canada."}
{"original": "He led a coalition of provincial premiers who took the federal government to court over its carbon tax and rarely missed an opportunity to level partisan broadsides at real or perceived political foes."}
{"original": "All that changed earlier this month, and Ford's near-daily public appearances during the COVID-19 crisis have been free from political attacks."}
{"original": "In an interview with The Canadian Press, Ford said unprecedented times called for a fresh approach."}
{"original": "We put differences aside and we moved together because people expect that, Ford said of his current, friendly relationship with federal and municipal officials."}
{"original": "Ford's reference to the will of the people is more familiar to political analysts, as is the clear communication style that's characterized most of his speeches since the pandemic took hold and prompted him to be among the first provincial leaders to declare a state of emergency."}
{"original": "Chris Young/ The Canadian Press Ontario Premier Doug Ford talks about small business suppliers in Toronto on March 28, 2020."}
{"original": "Political communications consultant Tim Abray said clear messaging has long been one of Ford's political strengths, noting that aspect of his performance to date has not come as a surprise."}
{"original": "More striking, he said, has been Ford's willingness to give equal prominence to credible scientists and public health officials, ensuring reliable information is readily available in one of the provinces hardest hit by the outbreak."}
{"original": "Moulton agreed, crediting Ford for showcasing some of his strongest cabinet performers during a slew of multibillion-dollar spending announcements made to safeguard the province during the pandemic."}
{"original": "Some trademark measures remain, such as significant corporate tax breaks, and Ford's populist appeal was on full display during a recent, impassioned rant against a high-end store selling disinfectant wipes for $30."}
{"original": "But the new announcements have also included measures that depart radically from his government's usual agenda, such as boosting income for some poor residents and jettisoning the party's oft-stated goal of balancing the province's books."}
{"original": "The approach has not gone unnoticed, even drawing praise from traditional political adversaries well outside of Ontario."}
{"original": "While I can't say I have historically been a fan of [Ford,] I have to say he is doing an incredible job on the COVID-19 file, wrote B.C. Green party Leader Andrew Weaver on Twitter. He has shown strong, decisive and compassionate leadership at a critical moment in Ontario's history."}
{"original": "Such praise marks a reversal for Ford, whose popularity had plummeted to new lows in the months preceding the outbreak."}
{"original": "The main thing that has been driving the animosity around this government is an apparent lack, during normal times, of the ability to listen to non-aligned voices, Abray said, noting Ford has previously demonstrated an ability to adjust his position in the face of new information. What I think he's done is he's stepped up and is behaving more like Doug Ford the person rather than Doug Ford the partisan Tory."}
{"original": "Ford, for his part, said the experience of steering Ontario through the pandemic has produced lessons that will be applied once the crisis passes."}
{"original": "There are so many things that we can agree on, he said There's so much opportunity for governments to get a lot more done if we all work together."}
{"original": "Colleges have a lot to lose if China's economy keeps declining and with its wealth. This is because China's wealth is the source of much college tuition both directly and indirectly. And one key source of wealth--China's official foreign reserves, has fallen more than 20% from $4 trillion in Aug 2014 to $3.2 trillion in January 2016. And it is still falling. In fact, China is in the middle of the biggest currency run in history. They're losing $100 billion a month."}
{"original": "Colleges may end up feeling like the panhandler who upon learning that his best tipper has gone bankrupt shouts out, just because you're in trouble, I have to suffer!?!"}
{"original": "Unlike in the US, there are capital controls in China. Any Chinese who need dollars must go to a bank and exchange enough local currency to receive the amount of dollars to purchase something in the States from a home to the college tuition of their children. But with the fall in reserves, banks are only allowed to exchange a restricted amount each month, usually less than what their customers want."}
{"original": "The direct effect of this fall might be a reversal in the surge of Chinese international students coming to study in United States. The number of Chinese students increased fivefold in the last ten years: currently 31% of all international students are from China (304,040 students). They represent the largest group of international students. As foreigners, they must pay full tuitions without discount. Thus, if the headline tuition is $60,000, they must pay it, which helps subsidize the rest of the class. Obviously colleges have developed a love affair with Chinese students. It is estimated that tuition revenue from Chinese students amounts to about $8.3 billion. This is a large sum that won't go unnoticed."}
{"original": "There is, however, an indirect but potentially much more serious effect from the fall in Chinese reserves most of which are held in US treasury notes. The US has student debt outstanding of close to $1.3 trillion. In order to lend such large sums to students, the government mainly borrows from China through issuing treasury notes. But this works only if China keeps holding these notes and doesn't ask for its money back."}
{"original": "Were they to do so the US would have to find another lender, no doubt at higher interest rates. This threatens to further raise attention on student debt and even awaken the tax payer to the increasing risks of this debt. Currently, only 37% of borrowers are actually paying down their student debt. A sharp decline in Chinese purchase of US treasury bonds would threaten not only the rollover of current student loans (there is a mismatch between twenty year student loans and shorter dated US treasuries held by the Chinese requiring constant rollovers) but also the growth of the student loan program as resources dry up. It is of course true that bond holders risk is tied directly to the US government and not to the students. But risk policy requires that bond holders have a second source of repayment. Certainly students with their high default rates would not meet the standards of being a reliable second source of repayment."}
{"original": "Colleges are left praying for an improvement in the Chinese economy and no one has control over their prayers being answered."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― It should be obvious by now that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall ― if a wall is actually built at all."}
{"original": "Significant parts of the government are shut down right now over a dispute about how much money Congress ― and therefore taxpayers, not Mexico ― will dole out for new barrier construction along the U.S.-Mexico border."}
{"original": "But don't tell that to Republicans. For the most part this week, Republicans refused to contradict President Donald Trump's contortionist explanations for why, technically, sort of, in a roundabout way, Mexico is footing the bill."}
{"original": "I certainly understand the president's logic, and I've always got it, Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) told HuffPost Friday, that if we have more jobs in America, because of an improved [North American Free Trade] Agreement, that it'll be more economic tax base for the United States."}
{"original": "The new trade agreement negotiated last year has not yet been approved by Congress and does not mention the wall. If that explanation wasn't confusing or tenuous enough, Marshall also said the wall was an investment."}
{"original": "This is the best $5.7 billion of American taxpayer money that we can use, he said. It'll come back in multiples for decades to come if it keeps out drugs, if it keeps out terrorists, if it keeps out criminals."}
{"original": "Over the course of more than two dozen conversations this week, Republicans tried their best to evade questions about who's paying for the wall, though some members acknowledged it was not Mexico. But plenty of GOP lawmakers were happy to accept Trump's arguments that Mexico would eventually pay, that new trade deals would offset the cost, or that, hey, doesn't a wall pay for itself anyway?"}
{"original": "We are paying as taxpayers for not having border security, Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) said. I can tell you that. We are already."}
{"original": "Roe added that the wall will pay for itself, absolutely, but he acknowledged that Mexico wasn't actually footing the bill. The taxpayers are gonna pay for it, but we're paying for it already, Roe said. Whether we don't protect our border or we do ― we're paying the bill."}
{"original": "That was essentially the argument that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) offered as well. He said if America built the wall, by virtue of the reduced illegal immigration that it will cause, it'll be a great savings."}
{"original": "Republicans also said that the tax cuts they passed at the end of 2017 would pay for themselves. The theory ― which most experts considered ridiculous ― was that lower taxes would boost economic growth, lead to higher corporate profits, and then more tax revenues from those profits. The theory proved wrong: despite solid growth in 2018, corporate tax revenue for the year fell 15 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office."}
{"original": "Of the Republicans who took the president's side that Mexico would pay for the wall, the explanation was overwhelmingly that, because of the new trade agreement, Mexico was technically paying for it."}
{"original": "The president's point is that, indirectly, we will be receiving more revenue from them as a result of the new fair trade law, and I think he's got a good point there, Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) said."}
{"original": "In an indirect sense, he's right. In a direct sense, no, they're not writing us a check, he conceded."}
{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Trump has advocated for the current government shutdown in an effort to secure taxpayer funding for a wall."}
{"original": "Trump used to say Mexico would make a direct payment of $5 to $10 billion, an idea so absurd that Trump himself begged the president of Mexico in 2017 not to contradict him publicly, saying it was the least important thing that we are talking about anyway. But Trump has shifted to claiming that Mexico would pay indirectly thanks to the new trade deal, which would not be true even if Congress approves the latest version of the deal."}
{"original": "The idea that trade pays for the wall is confusing ― which may be why Republicans have latched on to it."}
{"original": "The president says the Mexicans will be paying for the wall through NAFTA, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said."}
{"original": "HuffPost asked Thune if that made any sense, given that the new agreement doesn't even mention the wall."}
{"original": "Well look, however the wall gets paid for, I think everybody agrees that border security's a pretty important issue, especially now, Thune said."}
{"original": "Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) sort of acknowledged that the trade talking point made no sense, but still plowed through it anyway."}
{"original": "I think what the president's talking about is this is a term of reference that under NAFTA that we're going to save a lot of money, Shelby said, adding that even though NAFTA and the wall are entirely separate things, It's still all part of the government. That's what he's talking about."}
{"original": "Rep. Bob Gibbs (R-Ohio) said he was saying it even before Trump was saying it: The trade agreement will indirectly pay for the wall."}
{"original": "Because we got a better deal, Gibbs answered, going on to explain that stopping a bunch of illegals from coming to America would also pay for the wall. That's probably a bigger savings, he said."}
{"original": "The only way the new trade deal could pay for the wall, according to Lori Wallach of Public Citizen, would be if it added a 20 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico. It doesn't."}
{"original": "Many Republicans offered agnostic arguments about whether Mexico would pay for the wall."}
{"original": "Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) repeatedly said he has no idea. Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) said we would have to wait and see on that. And Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) said he's struggled with the mechanics of 'Hey, it's going to be because of incongruous trade, it's going to be because of this and that.'"}
{"original": "It'll be fascinating to see how that math actually works, he said."}
{"original": "Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) said the president has his arguments on Mexico funding wall construction, and he would leave those to him. Asked if he bought those arguments, Thornberry said it wasn't for him to buy or sell the argument."}
{"original": "I focus on the things that I think are important for national security, and I will continue to do that, he said. And when we commented that he was looking at us like we're crazy for even asking the question, Thornberry agreed. You are crazy, he said."}
{"original": "Many other Republicans ducked the question entirely. Rep. Trey Hollingsworth (R-Ind.) remained completely silent and kept walking while we trailed behind him asking about Mexico paying for the wall, as well as his thoughts on Trump declaring a national emergency to circumvent Congress to build his barrier."}
{"original": "Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) said he wasn't going to comment on that at the moment, though, with some prodding, he said, from an accounting standard, not directly, but indirectly, there's a lot of transactions between our two countries."}
{"original": "Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.) repeatedly said his concern was border security, not who was paying for a wall. You can ask me that question as many times as you want, Mitchell said. You're not going to trap me into a conversation about whether Mexico is paying because it's not my problem, nor my concern."}
{"original": "You're not going to trap me into a conversation about whether Mexico is paying because it's not my problem, nor my concern. Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.)"}
{"original": "And Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.) was a wall of talking points."}
{"original": "No one wins in a shutdown, no one wins if the border's not secure, he said, repeating the phrase like a mantra in response to further questions, before going silent."}
{"original": "There were some Republicans who broke with Trump. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), and Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) all said it's been clear that Mexico is not paying for the construction of a 2,000-mile barrier."}
{"original": "Asked what he thought of arguments like the trade deal paying for the wall, or that the wall would somehow pay for itself, Amash said those rationales were silly."}
{"original": "That's not money going to the wall from Mexico. It doesn't go to the Treasury that way and then go to the wall, he said."}
{"original": "Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) also told HuffPost this week that he never thought Mexico was gonna pay for the wall."}
{"original": "But those were the exceptions. By and large, Republicans were willing to accept Trump's trade deal argument, even though if it were true, there would be no need to shut down the government to try to force Democrats to support a $5 billion in wall appropriation funding."}
{"original": "This week, some 800,000 federal employees are missing their first paychecks since funding lapsed in December. And if the shutdown continues for several more weeks, it will imperil housing vouchers and food assistance for millions."}
{"original": "If you expected Republicans to break with Trump over the shutdown anytime soon ― like perhaps Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) choosing to hold a vote on a clean funding bill and then Republicans in both chambers voting to override the president's veto ― just remember those GOP members who refuse to break with Trump in favor of reality."}
{"original": "February is full of so many fun events like Valentine's Day, the Super Bowl and the start of tax season. OK, maybe not that last one, but the good news is that now's the time to save big on all of the above — and then some. Here, eight items that will be heavily discounted this month."}
{"original": "All hail Presidents' Day weekend sales. Rumor has it the discounts are tied to the fact that our founding fathers — specifically, George and Abe — were actually lousy sleepers. It doesn't hurt that it's a three-day weekend and stores are looking to clear room for new spring merch. (Two reasons that are more plausible if you ask us.) Regardless, you can expect to see major markdowns to the tune of 25 to 30 percent."}
{"original": "Cue the Valentine's Day promotions. Sure, you'll probably see price cuts leading up to the Hallmark romance-inspired holiday, but if you can hold out until after February 14 to buy a piece of bling, you'll probably see even bigger savings. (Sometimes as much as 60 percent off.)"}
{"original": "Financial planners will remind you: Do not — we repeat — do not wait until the last minute (ahem, April) to start organizing your receipts. An incentive for getting an early start? Tax software like that offered by TurboTax and H&R Block typically gets marked down 10 to 15 percent for early birds. (Just be sure to price compare online retailers for savings.)"}
{"original": "You can thank the Super Bowl for this one. Retailers know that the beginning of February is the perfect time to drop the price of HDTVs. You could see savings of as much as 40 to 50 percent leading up to February 5. And if you can hold out until after the big game, the discounts will probably increase to 60 percent. (Hey, all the new models were just revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show in January — stores have to make room.)"}
{"original": "Wool? Cashmere? Nah, retailers know that at this point in the season, your thoughts are on spring. That's why you can expect to see heavy discounts — as much as 40 to 50 percent off — on cold-weather attire as stores try to clear away winter merch."}
{"original": "Same deal as the sweaters. Who cares about a dowdy puffer jacket at this point when you could invest in a cute — and spring-ready — trench? Cue the sales."}
{"original": "When it's below zero, no one is thinking about whether or not they're prepared for a summer heat wave. Simultaneously, your local appliance store needs to make room for cold-weather equipment like snow blowers and shovels. Browse stores (or search online) to see what discounts and deals you can find. Even 10 to 15 percent off can add up."}

{"original": "OTTAWA — A Senate committee passed 40 amendments Monday to the federal government's cannabis legalization bill, including one that would allow provinces and territories to ban home-grown marijuana."}
{"original": "But the social affairs committee refused to accept a Conservative amendment that would have prohibited home cultivation outright."}
{"original": "And it defeated another that would have indefinitely delayed implementation of the legislation until the government reports to both houses of Parliament on the measures it's taking to deal with the concerns of Indigenous communities."}
{"original": "The vast majority of the amendments approved were largely technical in nature and would have little affect on the substance of Bill C-45. Indeed, 29 of them were proposed by the sponsor of the bill in the Senate, independent Sen. Tony Dean, which suggests they have the blessing of the government."}
{"original": "Also on HuffPost: Here's why passing Canadian weed laws can take so long"}

{"original": "The Senate committee, which conducted a clause-by-clause examination of the bill Monday, unanimously supported an amendment specifying that provincial and territorial governments have the authority to prohibit home-grown pot if they so choose.

{"original": "None of the independent or independent Liberal senators on the committee supported either of those two Conservative amendments, which could bode well for the government in ensuring the bill is ultimately passed by the Senate. The 32 Conservative senators have voted as a block against the bill at every opportunity so far but they'd need at least 15 other senators to join them on the final vote to defeat or delay it."}
{"original": "Patterson made an impassioned plea for delaying implementation, arguing that the government's consultation with Indigenous people thus far has been abysmal. Moreover, First Nations governments will bear the impact of legalization on health, social and policing services, but he noted they have not so far been offered a share of the federal excise tax on cannabis to cover those costs."}
{"original": "This is a terribly vulnerable population, he told the committee, noting that Indigenous communities are already struggling with severe alcohol and drug abuse problems, mental health issues and a suicide epidemic — all of which he suggested will get worse if cannabis is readily and legally available."}
{"original": "Patterson's amendment did not go quite as far as the Senate's aboriginal people's committee, which had recommended a delay of up to a year to enable more consultation with Indigenous communities. He put no timeline on his proposal for a government report on how it's addressing Aboriginal concerns and argued that the government could pull one together within a month if it wanted."}
{"original": "Independent Sen. Marc Gold said no one disagrees with the challenges facing Indigenous communities, but said he's encouraged that the government is already taking steps to address them. Indigenous people are over-represented in the criminal justice systems and delaying implementation of a legalized cannabis regime will only exacerbate the problem, he argued."}
{"original": "Liberal MP Bill Blair, the government's point man on cannabis legalization, told the committee just prior to its clause-by-clause examination of the bill that some Indigenous communities want to get involved in the lucrative business of producing legal marijuana and the government has developed a guide to help them navigate the licensing process."}

{"original": "Blair also told committee members that Bill C-45 is comprehensive, thoughtfully designed legislation that strikes a careful balance among diverse perspectives."}
{"original": "But Conservative Sen. Carolyn Stewart Olsen questioned that assertion, given the number of amendments proposed by Dean to correct flaws in the drafting of the bill."}
{"original": "I don't see that that is thoughtful or well designed, she said."}

{"original": "Employers in the U.S. shed 140,000 jobs in December — the first monthly job loss since April thanks to a pandemic that is worse than ever."}
{"original": "The economy is about to get a shot in the arm due to a COVID-19 relief bill Congress passed late last month. Businesses will soon be eligible for another round of forgivable loans from the Paycheck Protection Program, most households will get direct payments worth $600 per person, and unemployed workers get an extra $300 per week."}
{"original": "However, Congress set federal unemployment benefits to start expiring in March — and it's unlikely the situation will have improved enough, or that enough Americans will have been vaccinated, for all workers to return to their jobs."}
{"original": "The December jobs decline shows the economy is struggling to avoid a double-dip recession, and the only reason it likely won't is the recently passed $900 billion fiscal relief package and the additional relief that is coming with the new Biden administration, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in an email."}

{"original": "But Democrats also want to prioritize continuing extra federal unemployment benefits, which is a proposal Republicans will likely oppose."}
{"original": "Democrats believe they may be able to push through the unemployment benefits with the $2,000 checks by using a process called budget reconciliation, a wonky procedure that allows Senate Democrats to pass some legislation with only 51 votes."}
{"original": "But it's not clear whether Biden supports using reconciliation, which technically can be used only once per year. He supports extra unemployment benefits, but after Democrats won control of the Senate with their victories in Georgia, the president-elect issued a statement calling for the next relief bill to be bipartisan. Budget reconciliation and bipartisanship generally don't mix. Biden's team did not respond to a request for comment."}
{"original": "The December jobs decline shows the economy is struggling to avoid a double-dip recession. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics"}
{"original": "Republican senators have made it very clear that they are done extending the jobless benefits. So much so that in the last relief package they insisted the current unemployment insurance be phased out slowly over the course of a month, instead of all at once. The extra $300 stops on March 14, but workers already receiving benefits from federal programs for gig workers and the long-term jobless can continue until the week of April 5."}
{"original": "Without a harsh cutoff to worry about, Republicans were hoping there would be less pressure to act so December's extension would be the last round of funding for unemployment insurance."}
{"original": "Democrats have a different idea, however. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who was key in negotiating the first round of unemployment benefits passed in March — which gave $600 per week to the jobless for four months — wants to tie the program to the economy."}
{"original": "My starting point here is going to be my legislation that would reinstate the full $600 weekly and tie additional weeks of benefits and the program for gig workers to economic conditions, Wyden said in a statement to HuffPost. There's so much work to do, and the Senate can't be revisiting economic relief every two or three months. Robust jobless benefits paired with additional relief payments will help millions of struggling families survive until the end of this crisis."}
{"original": "Wyden has a proposal with Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Michael Bennet (Colo.), Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and Jack Reed (R.I.) that would retroactively extend benefits of $600 per week through October 2021, and ensure Americans can continue to receive benefits as long as the three-month unemployment figures are above 5.5%."}
{"original": "Democrats — who have only 50 votes in the Senate and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote — could avoid having to whittle down their proposal in order to win over nine Republicans by going through the budget reconciliation process."}
{"original": "Photo By Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Sen. Ron Wyden, (D-Ore.) was one of the key architects of the first round of unemployment insurance benefits that expired in July."}
{"original": "There are some Republicans more open to COVID-19 relief, including Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who worked with Democrats on an early version of the aid package that just passed. But there's very little appetite among Republican leadership and the broader caucus. Failing to pass additional relief could leave millions of unemployed Americans in the lurch come March."}
{"original": "The coronavirus crisis reached its worst levels this week. States and localities struggle to handle a serious surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations and are seeing record-high death tolls. Hopes of widespread vaccination also seems unlikely by March, making it highly unlikely that the economy will be back to how it was before the pandemic."}
{"original": "Zandi said the economy will probably need more help. More supplemental unemployment insurance, another round of stimulus checks and more PPP funds for small businesses will almost surely be needed to ensure there is enough aid until mid-year when the pandemic will likely hopefully be fading as more Americans are vaccinated, he said."}
{"original": "The situation is particularly challenging for workers whose jobs involve face-to-face interactions with customers. December's net job loss was driven by nearly 500,000 layoffs in the hospitality industry, and many of those jobs can't come back until the weather is warm and the pandemic is contained."}
{"original": "Marc Goldwein, an economist and budget expert with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said winter will be difficult regardless of what Congress does, but that the recent spending bill will help a lot later this year."}
{"original": "If its macro effect coincides with weather starting to warm and the virus spread declining, we could see a big burst in economic activity starting in March and getting especially strong into the summer, Goldwein said in an email."}
{"original": "Wyden has said he wants a more significant reform of the state-federal unemployment system. If Congress doesn't take action, states will ― and the recession could have long-term consequences for unemployed workers."}
{"original": "State unemployment benefits are backed by trust funds that have been depleted by pandemic job losses, prompting states to borrow from the federal government, and the need to pay that money back can trigger automatic payroll tax increases on businesses. After the Great Recession ended in 2009, several states partially alleviated the business tax burden by permanently cutting benefits. The unemployment system has for decades gotten increasingly less generous."}
{"original": "It's very likely there will be lots of benefit reductions, said Wayne Vroman, an associate at the nonprofit Urban Institute. They quite often have a financing law that cuts benefits as well as raising taxes. That's been the pattern in past recessions."}
{"original": "A dramatic proposal to split California into three separate states has gathered enough signatures to appear on the ballot during the upcoming midterm elections in November."}
{"original": "Tim Draper, the main proponent of the initiative and its prime bankroller, gathered at least 402,000 signatures to divide California into three parts: a state called Northern California sprawling from Oregon down to San Francisco, another called California that would primarily include Los Angeles and a band of land up the coast, and another dubbed Southern California that would include Fresno, Bakersfield and San Diego."}
{"original": "The plan would create three differently sized regions, but all would have roughly the same population. And while California currently has two U.S. senators, the new bloc of three Californias would have six under the new proposal."}
{"original": "Three states will get us better infrastructure, better education and lower taxes, Draper told The Los Angeles Times last summer after his proposal for the measure was submitted. States will be more accountable to us and can cooperate and compete for citizens."}
{"original": "While voters will get to decide on the measure, it faces an uphill battle regardless of the outcome. If passed, the state constitution mandates both houses of the California legislature approve the proposal before it's submitted to Congress, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. It's also likely to be challenged in court."}
{"original": "The Times notes that, if the unlikely event were to take place, it would be the first state to divide itself since West Virginia became an official entity in 1863."}
{"original": "Stephen Lam / Reuters This is the third time Tim Draper, above, has tried to split up California."}
{"original": "This is the third time Draper has attempted to split up the state. He bankrolled efforts in 2012 and 2014 to divide the region into six different Californias, spending around $5 million in his most recent endeavor."}
{"original": "California government has rotted, Draper told The Mercury News last month. We need to empower our population to improve their government."}
{"original": "A separate coalition, dubbed NoCaBreakup, has already begun organizing to fight Draper's proposal. Opponents are worried how the state's vast resources would be divided were the state to break apart and say the proposal would harm poor regions while demarcating rich areas that generate most of California's current tax revenue."}
{"original": "This measure would cost taxpayers billions of dollars to pay for the massive transactional costs of breaking up the state, whether it be universities, parks, or retirement systems, Steven Maviglio, a political consultant who helped fight Draper's past proposals, said on Twitter. California government can do a better job addressing the real issues facing the state, but this measure is a massive distraction that will cause political chaos and greater inequality."}
{"original": "The new initiative will be certified by the California Secretary of State, Alex Padilla, on June 28 and will appear on the ballot in November."}
{"original": "Anton Petrus via Getty Images The world is headed for up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 F) of global warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100, which would lead to devastating consequences for billions of people."}
{"original": "Governments and businesses habitually set out emergency response plans to protect their economies, jobs, cities and other crucial assets from potential disaster. Yet when it comes to climate change ― the biggest, most urgent threat the world faces ― there is no emergency plan."}
{"original": "On the issue of our lifetime, countries can agree very little. The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2019 published last Tuesday found that increasing divisions between the world's major powers is the most urgent global risk we face because it stymies vital collective action on climate change."}
{"original": "Instead of action, we see delays, rejections and avoidance, as December's United Nations climate summit in Katowice, Poland, so acutely reminded us. The event, which brought together world leaders, scientists, campaigners and the private sector, settled most of the rules needed to ensure countries follow the climate pledges they have made to date. What it failed to do is push countries to step up their targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions ― currently the only viable way to prevent climate breakdown. The Middle East, the U.S. and Russia refused to even welcome landmark scientific predictions on climate change, signaling their intention to continue blocking progress."}
{"original": "A huge barrier to solving this problem is the failure of conventional economics to acknowledge the severity of climate change. Take William Nordhaus, one of 2018's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences winners. While Nordhaus agrees that climate change is a serious problem, he weighs up the costs of mitigation against the predicted damages that will be inflicted by a warming planet and concludes that our objective should be to limit temperature rises to 3.5 C (6.3 F) because to be more ambitious would be too expensive."}
{"original": "But a decision based on this kind of cost calculation is highly questionable. How do you put a cost on the destruction of coral reefs? Or on millions of people being pushed out of their homes, or killed by rising sea levels? And how do you account for the consequences of possible tipping points ― such as the melting of the permafrost?"}
{"original": "Alessandro Rota via Getty Images Coral inside the Egadi Islands Marine Reserve in Italy. How do you put a cost on the destruction of coral reefs?"}
{"original": "Our economy is based on a concept of continual growth. And for advocates of this principle, any questioning of it is simply a leftist plot to stop growth at all costs."}
{"original": "That was the criticism leveled at The Limits to Growth, a report commissioned back in 1972 by the Club of Rome, in which we both are actively engaged. The essence of this report was that the quest for unlimited growth in population, material goods and resources on a finite planet would eventually lead to economic, social and environmental collapse. It's already starting to happen. Since 1970, the world has lost an average of 60 percent of its populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians."}
{"original": "Our message is not to stop development but to shrink the human footprint. For that to happen, growth policies and indicators of economic success must be re-evaluated. We need an overhaul of our economy and society. It's startling that business and policy leaders seem firmly convinced that a future technological fix will eliminate climate threats, while overlooking the simple pragmatism of planning for the worst in the short term."}
{"original": "The first step is to assess the risks and identify potential emergencies. Here, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has already done the work for us. In its report last year on the impacts of a temperature rise of 1.5 C and 2 C (2.7 F and 3.6 F, respectively), the scientists made clear that global emissions must be halved by 2030 and slashed to zero by 2050 in order to avoid the worst effects. That is an unprecedented task ― reducing emissions by at least 7 percent a year, when annual reductions in most countries so far have been many times lower."}
{"original": "We then need a thorough climate emergency plan to address the biggest challenges to limiting global warming to 1.5 C (2.7 F). To start with, new investments in coal, oil and gas exploration and development must end by 2020, with the existing fossil fuel industry phased out by midcentury. Meanwhile, annual investment in renewable energy and efficiency must be at least tripled. Specific priority should be given to low-income countries to support a transition to renewables and avoid a situation where these countries are left with outdated fossil fuel infrastructure that is ever more expensive to run."}
{"original": "It's vital to recognize that this must be a socially equitable transformation. A carbon tax, for example, would help shake out the true cost of fossil fuel use and could be used to generate tax revenues for research, development and innovation of low-carbon solutions. Or it could be put into the pockets of the general population."}
{"original": "Beyond the transformation of energy systems that still rely heavily on fossil fuels, we need to stop excessive waste by promoting reuse, recycling and reconditioning of products and materials, and scale up ways to use land to absorb rather than emit carbon dioxide. Annual investment in large-scale reforestation in developing countries should be tripled and farmers around the world should be given incentives to build up carbon in their soils."}
{"original": "An emergency plan will need to lay out quick priority actions and broad-based collaborations between industrial sectors, local and national government departments, and investors. We also need an international task force to explore how to promote disruptive technologies for sectors where emissions are most difficult to eliminate, such as agriculture, aviation, shipping, aluminum, steel and cement."}
{"original": "All of this must come with broader social and economic changes. Progress should be indicated using new measures of welfare and well-being, rather than production growth, while education and health services should promote reproductive health and rights for girls and women. Workers and communities affected by the shift to clean energy and lower emissions ― such as coal mining regions ― should be retrained and supported so they are not left behind by the transition."}
{"original": "The worst disasters can still be avoided but only if leaders move swiftly on new emergency action plans. Only a few brave leaders have begun down this path. In December, London Mayor Sadiq Khan unveiled a plan to protect people from floods, fires and the political upheaval caused by climate change. He agreed to bring forward his carbon neutrality goal from 2050 to 2030 by focusing on a comprehensive investment program that will help retrofit hundreds of thousands of homes and offices to make them more energy efficient, decarbonize the national grid, install low-carbon heating systems, and electrify private and public transport."}
{"original": "Planning for a climate emergency in this way is not a doomsday scenario. It's simply a pragmatic response to a known risk and humanity's insurance plan for survival and a positive future."}

{"original": "After reading through Killer Mike's tweets in support of reparations for slavery the other day, I was reminded of my own observations on the subject from activists and scholars in and around the Black community. This happened in New York City around the early to mid 2000's, where I lived and worked in Harlem for several years while attending the School of Visual Arts (SVA)."}
{"original": "As the only non-Black employee -- and non-Black person there 99% of the time -- in the then Kev's Copy Center on Lenox Ave., I did graphic design and typing services with themes often reflecting elements of the local/Black American culture. This ranged from hip hop, jazz, local salons, Sylvia's Soul Food across the street, or just formatting in type what a customer wrote out on looseleaf paper."}
{"original": "One such order was from someone who, according to customer service, went by the name of Chief Red Deer. I never saw him but believe he was working on a book. So I was handed a stack of papers with his handwriting in red ink entitled Mentalnomics."}
{"original": "Reading the first page as I typed, I initially dismissed it as visceral and poorly written. My reaction likely came from a childhood attending mostly White, affluent suburban schools (though barely keeping up with the Joneses), having just stepped foot in the big city. This was the case with many of the typing jobs, given the rough quality of education in a low-income demographic. It soon became clear that Mentalnomics was Red Deer's take on reparations, and the effects of slavery."}
{"original": "After making it through a few pages though, the message started to speak louder than the delivery. Red Deer emphasized how the psychological effects of slavery should be taken into account. He stressed how the social and emotional complexities are passed down in Black families, apart from any real world compensation. This was back in 2002 so I don't remember much more than that, but that I am writing about it today is evident of how it managed to reach me."}
{"original": "Another customer who looked at least in his 40's, with a newsboy cap and the unassuming eyes of a child, was Henry Mitch Mitchell. He would always say hello when he walked in, take a seat and casually talk to me despite my awkwardness as an outsider there. He was an activist for the organization Reparations Now, which pushed for reparations in the form of financial aid for qualifying African Americans' education, among other things."}
{"original": "One day Mitch asked me to do a side gig, because he wanted me to treat it as more than just work. He needed a flyer to present at an upcoming RN meeting, and leant me a book of an artist depicting slavery in pencil drawings (I wish I had remembered the artist's name). Mitch's friendly nature was enough for me to say yes, despite my crazy full-time student/work schedule."}
{"original": "What I particularly remember from this book is the depiction of slaves shelved in ships like cargo, for the long trip across the Atlantic. If they weren't laying down and packed like sardines, they were chained by ankle, wrist, and neck, in a crouched position on their feet. I couldn't not convey this intensity in the flyer, so I felt compelled to put as much as I could into it."}
{"original": "The flyer I designed for Mitch with his writing, from the early 2000's. Note: My career and the quality of my work have come a long way since."}
{"original": "After handing it off to Mitch, he asked how much he owed me. He was right about it being more than just work, so I offered it to him for free as a token of support. His eyes lit up in disbelief: Really?!!"}
{"original": "It wasn't until weeks later, when I asked how RN liked the flyer that I got the real payoff. Mitch informed me about their meeting where he presented the flyer. He announced how a half White, half Asiatic man (my mom is a Japanese immigrant) volunteered to create it for free, to which the whole room went silent. This could be interpreted in different ways, but I'd like to think it gave them a little hope that other people beyond their community cared."}
{"original": "Native Africans in the area would also stop by the shop every now and then. You could tell because from head wrap to sandals, they were adorned with the colorful, prestigious attire of their culture. They also had lovely accents. It was here that I was informed of a tension between native African and Black Americans in Harlem, from both groups. I imagine it may have reflected apparent clashes in how they came off to each other, given the nurturing of their minority/majority statuses and histories in contrasting societies."}
{"original": "Meanwhile at SVA, I took a Postcolonial Africa class for the reputable professor. Indeed she showed a well-versed knowledge of the subject. She mostly sat and talked to us conversationally through different African countries' conflicts and timelines."}
{"original": "Though we did not cover the topic of slavery, toward the end of class one day I asked this African American professor about her opinion on reparations. She immediately batted her hand and with a sour face, responded with something like, People should let that go already."}
{"original": "While anyone can come up with logical reasons for or against reparations, what Mentalnomics sparked for me was considering how the psychological effects linger to this day. Could reparations change that? Can it make a difference for the people whose forefathers built the Capitol Building? Whereas I did not think much of it before, I believe if approached in a way as Reparations Now proposed, through education benefits for example, then yes I would gladly contribute my tax dollars to it."}
{"original": "Though mostly by circumstance, my understanding of society's spectrum was stretched by being the minority in the carved out Black American demographic of Harlem. By listening to their stories and glimpsing their various histories as a people, not only did it make a case for reparations I can get behind, but also informed me how little I know what it is like to carry that history with me."}

{"original": "One thing that won't vary is the training program and certification test that all VITA program volunteers must go through. Even volunteers who aren't handling returns but serving in the capacity of greeters and receptionists must pass a test on ethics and confidentiality."}

{"original": "Social media, if you can make it work for your business, will be one of your greatest tools for success. The catch is that using social media as a business is more complicated than using it as a private individual. You need to carefully consider:"}
{"original": "• What do you want from your social media accounts (to build awareness of your business, communicate with customers, make sales, build thought leadership for your brand)?"}
{"original": "• What platforms do your customers currently use (Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter)? It's vastly easier to approach your customer on the platform they use than it is to try and convince them to migrate to something new."}

{"original": "Protect your investments with loss relief"}
{"original": "Whenever you're considering a large investment, loss relief is something that should be on the table. It's worth noting that different countries approach this in different ways; in the United States, often losses are reported through the tax code. Basically, know that if your investments go south, there might be ways to recover some of that money, but look into the process early and often."}
{"original": "How developed is your marketing plan?"}
{"original": "In the beginning of your business, your absolute top priority is to build your first 100 customers, which you can only do through marketing. Word of mouth, advertisements, trade organizations, business expositions, and social media are all ways to get your name out there and start building the loyal customer base that will see you both through both good times and bad."}
{"original": "It is possible to track too many metrics that aren't meaningful, but in the early months, as you experiment, you should keep a close eye on what you're doing, and what seems to help bring in new customers. Discounts? Word of mouth? Referral bonuses? When you find the things that work for your business, you can build and develop from that. If you don't keep honest numbers of sales, statistics, and referrals, you won't know what you're measuring."}
{"original": "Whenever possible, add value instead of discounts"}
{"original": "When you regularly discount your products, you teach your customers to wait for sales and discounts before they buy. Instead, add value to your sales. That can come as great customer services, add-on products, or exclusive samples. It seems like a small difference, but in terms of how customers view your business, you want to be the company that sends something extra, not the company that offers deep discounts. Race to the top, not the bottom."}
{"original": "Sometimes it seems like everyone around you is starting a business, and you may wonder why all the extra work is necessary. After all, isn't entrepreneurship just about making a quick investment or selling an idea, and then watching the cash flow in?"}
{"original": "Of course it isn't. While there are a few rare cases of folks who are that lucky, entrepreneurship is work, just like any other job. Its rewards come in the way it encourages people to use the full spectrum of their talents, build creativity, and influence the outcome of their industry."}

{"original": "St. Kitts, 51, known as Mistress Lori on a website that boasts of bringing your tax liability to its knees, literally wrote the book on the subject seven years ago with The Tax Domme's Guide for Sex Workers and All Other Business People."}
{"original": "The term sex worker covers a swath of racy occupations, including stripper, porn performer, phone sex operator, dominatrix and escort. Or, as St. Kitts puts it, anyone at all who is doing something that makes somebody potentially orgasm."}
{"original": "There are no reliable estimates on what Americans spend for all those sexual services. But Havocscope, which provides information on black market activities, estimates the U.S. prostitution business alone at $14.6 billion."}
{"original": "If St. Kitts shares a certain intimacy with sex workers, itis because she is one, too. After following her mother into tax prep work, she heeded another piece of maternal career advice in2005 when she quit her job because of a long commute."}
{"original": "You have a beautiful voice for phone sex, she remembered hearing. My mother said that!"}
{"original": "And so, St. Kitts became a voice on the phone for men who wanted to talk to a college girl, a housewife or a nanny."}
{"original": "You can't really practice for it, she said. You're either adept or you're not. You're just talking about sex."}
{"original": "Phone sex operators, a solitary lot who usually work from home as independent contractors, often use message boards to connect with others in the business. And that was where St.Kitts spotted tax questions that needed answering."}
{"original": "Soon, she was getting requests for tax help from other phone sex operators, because they're in Iowa and they can't go to their H&R Block next door because their friends and family are there."}
{"original": "Sex workers, who tend to be women serving heterosexual men, can be challenging for tax preparers."}
{"original": "For one thing, said attorney Christopher Kirk, who started his Portland, Oregon-based Safeword Tax Service six years ago, some sex workers are reluctant to even file returns."}
{"original": "The penalty for tax evasion is much greater than for sex work, Kirk, 49, said he tells his sex-worker clients."}
{"original": "Since many are forced to deal in cash, there are also the challenges of getting them to keep records of their income and to set aside enough money pay their taxes, he said."}
{"original": "St. Kitts, who handles clients throughout the country, said the most challenging sex-worker returns to prepare are for escorts and dominatrixes because they typically have a mix of legal and illegal income. A money-for-sex transaction is typically illegal if there is physical contact."}
{"original": "While all income needs to be declared, she said independent business people can deduct legitimate business expenses ― an ankle restraint in a dominatrix's dungeon, for example ― only from legal income."}
{"original": "The tax code is unclear about when sex workers can safely deduct expenses and when they cannot, she said, But you're pretty safe as long as it doesn't touch the genitalia."}
{"original": "The Internal Revenue Service did not respond to requests for comment on whether illicit income should be declared, whether expenses can be deducted from it and whether the agency reports suspected illegal activity to local authorities."}
{"original": "St. Kitts has since quit the phone sex business, but she now works as a part-time chastity dominatrix, Domina Lori, having men wear chastity belts and making them do tasks to get her to give them the keys."}
{"original": "It's very cerebral, actually, she said, adding that the keys are deductible."}

{"original": "Sherry Mendowegan has accomplished a lot in the past six months. The mother of two bought her first car and graduated with her high school diploma in March."}
{"original": "Next is my college, post-secondary, and then hopefully I get some work, she says. Going to college would have been out of reach for the 41-year-old just last year. But as a participant in the basic income pilot program launched by the Canadian province of Ontario, she and her husband, Dan, can now afford the tuition fees. She'll be studying office administration at Confederation College in the city of Thunder Bay this September."}
{"original": "Our life has changed, Mendowegan says. We're not struggling."}
{"original": "Sherry Mendowegan Sherry Mendowegan graduated with her high school diploma in March."}
{"original": "Ontario's basic income program, launched in April 2017, is currently operating in three towns ― Thunder Bay, Lindsay and Hamilton. The scheme has enrolled more than 4,000 low-income people living on less than CA$34,000 ($29,500) individually, or CA$48,000 as a couple. This includes those who are working, in school or living on financial assistance."}
{"original": "For three years, single participants will receive up to CA$17,000 a year and couples will receive up to CA$24,000. Those earning any money will see their basic income amounts reduced by 50 cents for every dollar they make. Participants with disabilities are eligible for another CA$6,000 annually ― although they do need to wave goodbye to state disability support, which can work out to more money."}
{"original": "A third-party research team will evaluate the effects on people's physical and mental health, food security, stress and anxiety, housing stability, education and employment. Their responses will be compared against a control group — low-income participants who won't receive the basic income but will fill out surveys about their life and well-being."}
{"original": "Universal basic income, or the idea of giving people money without any conditions, is not new. But it is gaining fresh momentum globally as inequality worsens and swaths of jobs are at risk from automation and other factors. Ontario joins a handful of other places in the world to test out some sort of guaranteed basic income, including the Dutch city of Utrecht, a village in Kenya, the city of Stockton, California, and Finland, although Finland doesn't currently have plans to extend its pilot program past its scheduled end in December."}
{"original": "Sherry Mendowegan Sherry Mendowegan and her husband, Dan, have two children. They've been receiving basic income since November under Ontario's pilot project."}
{"original": "Growing up in a northern indigenous community, Mendowegan says she wasn't encouraged to stay in school. She dropped out when she was 15."}
{"original": "I just didn't want to go to school, I guess, she says. But after having children, she realized the benefits of an education and returned. I'm very glad I went back to get it. I want my kids to look up to me, she says."}
{"original": "Before being accepted onto the basic income program, Mendowegan and her husband were living on money from Ontario Works, the province's welfare program. Because she's indigenous, she could have received funding for college from her community, but that would have been seen as income by the government, reducing her welfare payments."}
{"original": "I wouldn't ever have been able to afford it, she says."}
{"original": "There are hefty requirements to be eligible for Ontario Works. Even though Mendowegan was completing high school and her husband was a stay-at-home parent raising their infant daughter and 12-year-old son, both had to look for work constantly and report proof of that ongoing search to the government."}
{"original": "You have to hand in everything that comes to you. If my mom were to give me $40 if I was running short, I had to report that, Mendowegan says. I feel that I'm more in control [on basic income]. I don't have to look up and say, 'OK, we got this. We have to show it to somebody.' There's more privacy."}
{"original": "For backers of the basic income, that's one of the key advantages of the idea ― it's a no-strings-attached benefit, making it a less intrusive and less judgmental way of delivering financial assistance."}
{"original": "Current welfare programs are means-tested, meaning government officials have to pry into the details of your life to determine whether you qualify, says Hugh Segal, the retired conservative Canadian politician who essentially designed Ontario's basic income pilot project."}
{"original": "That is stigmatizing and unproductive, whereas if there was an automatic process where people [had their incomes] topped up, and did not isolate them, that would be better, he says."}
{"original": "Under Ontario's version of the basic income, if it were implemented throughout the province, the government would use tax returns to determine who gets sent a basic income check."}
{"original": "Segal, a longtime advocate of the basic income, also argues the scheme will eliminate a key disincentive for low-income people to join the workforce. With traditional welfare, any money you earn is clawed back from your benefits. But under the basic income pilot program, the government lets you keep part of what you earned in the workforce, giving those on the benefit more reason to take work."}
{"original": "The majority of people participating in Ontario's pilot project — about 70 percent — have jobs of some sort, according to the provincial government."}
{"original": "Luis Segura Luis and Leanna Segura opened their own business in Lindsay, Ontario, two years ago."}
{"original": "Luis and Leanna Segura, a couple living in the town of Lindsay, don't fit the stereotype of basic income recipients. They own and run Fresh Fuell, a restaurant on the town's main street that serves healthy food, and say the basic income scheme is already making an impact on the town."}
{"original": "It's been a big boost, even in the energy of people. It's nice to see, says Luis, who got his first basic income payment just before Christmas."}
{"original": "Two years ago, the couple sold their house and quit their jobs to take a chance on entrepreneurship. Like any new business, it's a struggle and a gamble, Luis says. It's going great. We have great community support."}
{"original": "But money was still tight. The Seguras decided to apply for basic income right before she gave birth to their youngest child. As tight as it was, we knew it was going to get tighter, says Luis."}
{"original": "Basic income has been a huge help while raising their now six-month-old baby and three older children, he says. They're able to afford kids' activities that would have been luxuries before. Their daughter is a competitive gymnast and their son is now learning jiujitsu."}
{"original": "Luis says he thinks the program has been a boon for local businesses. Since the program launched, Fresh Fuell's customers have been spending more, he says."}
{"original": "Business has been great. I wonder if it has that ripple effect here now because other people are on basic income in the community and have that little extra. … That's a plus for everyone — for the person spending, for the person receiving."}
{"original": "Basic income schemes are happening because of a recent, fundamental shift in thinking about work and inequality, says Segal, who adds: Our economy has been creating vast wealth for people at the top and not doing the same for others."}
{"original": "A lot of thoughtful governments are beginning to ask themselves, are we dealing with the gap between rich and poor as effectively as we might, and what are the political costs of not doing so? Segal says."}
{"original": "The rapid rise of automation in the workforce has created the specter of machines taking many of our existing jobs. A 2013 study from Oxford University estimated that 47 per cent of jobs in the U.S. are at risk from automation. We are facing the growing prospect that new industries and jobs will not appear quickly enough to employ all those who have become obsolete in the digital economy."}
{"original": "That's certainly the concern among many of the prominent tech executives who have come out in favor of a basic income scheme — among them Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk."}
{"original": "AP Mark Zuckerberg, left, and Elon Musk, right, have both come out in favor of universal basic income."}
{"original": "It's also among the reasons Ontario's Liberal Party premier, Kathleen Wynne, gives for launching the province's basic income project."}
{"original": "The realities of our uncertain economy, the technological change going on right now, the uncertainty of what work is going to look like … all of that points to the fact we need to look at everything, Wynne tells HuffPost."}
{"original": "When she grew up in the 1960s and '70s, she says, there was a lot of talk about people working less. The three-day workweek hasn't come to fruition; instead, we see people piecing together different jobs, she says. The disruption of technology that we might have expected then is actually on us now."}
{"original": "But if the basic income has any chance of widespread adoption in Canada, it will have to overcome bipartisan political opposition. The right's argument is obvious: that giving away money for nothing is morally objectionable."}
{"original": "But there is resistance from the left as well. A number of socialist thinkers have come out against it, arguing that a basic income means less incentive to pay workers a living wage."}
{"original": "The biggest issue with a universal basic income is cost. Ontario's government is nowhere near estimating what a provincewide scheme would cost, but in April the Canadian Parliament's budget watchdog estimated that if Ontario's scheme went nationwide, it would cost CA$43 billion a year."}
{"original": "Proponents of the basic income say that what these studies fail to take into account are the savings government would see in other areas from a reduction in poverty."}
{"original": "Poverty is the greatest predictor of hospitalization and health problems, Segal says. He points to research by University of Manitoba professor Evelyn Forget, who is credited with rediscovering a long-forgotten basic income experiment in Dauphin, Manitoba, in the 1970s. When the town's residents were given a mincome for three years, use of the publicly funded health insurance system dropped 8 percent, Forget's research showed."}
{"original": "Given that Canada spent an estimated CA$242 billion on health care costs in 2017, a decrease of 8 percent nationally would amount to a savings of more than CA$19 billion on health care costs nationally, offsetting nearly half of the estimated cost of a basic income."}
{"original": "But many wonder whether Ontario's basic income project can withstand the winds of political change. The province is heading toward a provincial election in June, and there is a lot of risk that the project could be shelved by a future government, Wynne says."}
{"original": "Mendowegan hopes it isn't just seen to completion but extended beyond three years."}
{"original": "I've got no bad reviews of it. Nothing, she says. It's a huge difference in our lifestyle right now. It's more positive, the way that we're raising our kids now."}
{"original": "When I was on Ontario Works, I did feel stressed, living month to month. With the pilot program, it's just a little bit more, but it helps us. We can do more with our families."}

{"original": "There's no shortage of agenda items for the new Congress that's just been seated in Washington. But lost among the anguished cries to reopen the government and enact ethics reform will be a lesser-advertised but crucial item: addressing major problems in the 2017 tax bill that President Donald Trump signed into law a year ago."}
{"original": "That the law needs fixing is not in dispute. Why it needs fixing is most vividly illuminated by contrasting it with another massive piece of tax legislation, the Reagan-era Tax Reform Act of 1986."}
{"original": "The Reagan-era bill was crafted with lengthy deliberation through its entire process. The 2017 tax act was drafted in such haste that there was no substantive deliberation on its contents, resulting in confusing language and numerous errors that need to be fixed. But newly-empowered Democrats are unlikely to help Republicans repair their faulty bill, with the result that it may generate even more than the $1.5 trillion ten-year deficit it was designed to create."}
{"original": "In the months leading up to passage of the 2017 tax act, Trump administration officials and Republican leaders in Congress giddily compared the scope of their bill to Reagan-era law. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) called their new bill, The first action in 31 years since President Reagan's reforms in 1986. Then-National Economic Director Gary Cohn said the legislation represented the most significant tax reform legislation since 1986."}
{"original": "Measured by the magnitude of changes to the tax code, that is true. But in terms of how the bills were developed, deliberated and drafted by Congress — not to mention their substance — the bills could not be less alike. And therein lies an illuminating — some would say frightening — story."}
{"original": "To wit, the 1986 bill took two years to create, with lawmakers holding dozens and dozens of hearings and taking testimony from thousands of witnesses. The process was a classic reminder, almost like those How a bill becomes law charts in school textbooks, of how Congress, with fits, starts and seemingly endless deliberation, inches its way toward final legislation."}
{"original": "Contrast that with the Trump tax bill, which, driven by threats from big GOP donors, was rushed from introduction to passage in just 51 days, leaving no time for substantive deliberation or negotiation — nor even a full understanding of how much debt it would create. Even some Republican tax experts are dismayed by the speed at which the legislation galloped through Capitol Hill — people like Dana Trier, a highly-respected tax tactician from the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations whom the Trump administration recruited in spring 2017 to work on the bill."}
{"original": "Pratheek Rebala (Center for Public Integrity)"}
{"original": "If you are like me and experienced the 1986 act, you really realize nobody can get tax legislation close to right anyway, Trier said. But this [2017 tax bill] is worse — there is no question about it in my view — than the 1986 act."}
{"original": "The Trump bill was created in secret, and many legislators never saw some of its provisions, much less debated them, until it was introduced. The measure contained multiple provisions that don't do what was intended and may take years to fix — if they can be fixed at all, experts say."}
{"original": "Because the measure was passed on a purely partisan basis (not one Democrat voted for the bill), it is unlikely that Democrats will be inclined to repair it, policy experts say. And, because of its errors, the tax legislation likely will add far more to the U.S. deficit over ten years than the $1.5 trillion the bill was designed to cost, jeopardizing the nation's credit rating and fueling fears of cuts in Social Security and Medicare. Indeed, after spending more than a year insisting that the law must not run up the nation's debt, Republicans added more to the debt with this legislation than any single tax bill in the past three decades, records show."}
{"original": "We know the more quickly Congress tries to move on something, the more prone they are to making mistakes and to writing a bill that has unintended consequences, said Molly Reynolds, an authority on congressional procedure at the Brookings Institution."}
{"original": "(AP Photo/Bob Daugherty) Lawmakers watch closely as Pres. Ronald Reagan signs into law a landmark tax overhaul on the White House South Lawn, Oct. 22, 1986, Washington, D.C. From left, are: Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, Rep. Raymond McGrath, R-N.Y.; Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., Rep. Frank Guerini, D-N.J.; Sen. Russell Long, D-La.; Rep. William Coyne, D-Pa., and Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn."}
{"original": "The 1986 and 2017 tax acts also differ in more substantive ways. The main thrust of the 1986 legislation was to end the tax breaks that had tilted the playing field toward corporations and the rich, while cutting tax rates for all. And the 1986 bill did all this in a way that did not create more federal debt."}
{"original": "The 2017 law does modestly cut taxes for the lower and middle classes, but its main beneficiaries were the rich and corporations. And the law actually created more loopholes and tax breaks, experts say, favoring those who can afford pricey accounting help. Ed Kleinbard, former chief of Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses tax legislation Congress proposes, called the law a Christmas present to the donor class and an abomination."}
{"original": "Many academics fear what the tax law will create. Many of the new changes fundamentally undermine the integrity of the tax code and allow well-advised taxpayers to game the new rules, wrote 13 professors of tax law in a December 2017 critique as the law sped toward approval. We must aim to learn from this recent historical episode, wherein a rushed and secretive process resulted in deeply flawed legislation."}
{"original": "Democratic lawmakers howled their protests. I must say that with the passage of [the bill], we have hit rock bottom. No hearings. No witnesses. No amendments accepted by majority party or the minority offering. No regular order. No bipartisanship, said then-Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) during a House Ways and Means Committee markup of a follow-up bill in 2018. The 2017 tax bill, he said, was rammed through this committee and rammed through the House of Representatives."}
{"original": "No hearings. No witnesses. No amendments accepted by majority party or the minority offering. No regular order. No bipartisanship. Former Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y."}
{"original": "To counter accusations that their bill was passed on speed-dial and was strictly partisan, Republicans say the bill was six years in the making. They relied on bipartisan research and hearings, they say, conducted from 2011 to 2014 by Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of Montana and Republican Rep. Dave Camp from Michigan. Back then, Baucus chaired the Senate Finance Committee and Camp headed the House Ways and Means panel, yet they could not persuade a divided Congress to take up their tax reform ideas."}
{"original": "Brady, who by then chaired Ways and Means, told CNBC in April 2016 that Camp made tax reform inevitable, in the sense that he showed you could broaden the base and lower the rates and simplify the code and be competitive around the world. When an interviewer pointed out that Camp's own party killed his legislation, Brady replied, I don't think it got the oxygen it deserved at the time."}
{"original": "One proponent of the six-year-in-the-making argument is Mark Prater, who was chief tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee until he left in May 2018 to join professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. In a recording of a tax seminar last summer obtained by CPI, Prater said his committee had relied on dozens of hearings, lots of reports, lots of joint committee activity, lots of production there over that six years."}
{"original": "But others claim the Republicans just cherry-picked a few GOP-backed ideas from the Baucus-Camp work. Baucus said in an interview with the Center that the 2017 tax law has some elements of the legislation he and Camp proposed, such as cutting the corporate tax rate, only taxing domestic corporate profits, and reworking taxes on the profits of multinationals to get them to return their money to the United States."}
{"original": "But that was as far as the similarities went, Baucus said."}
{"original": "Their claim is accurate as far as the beginning, Baucus said, but then [the legislation] went off the tracks."}
{"original": "Baucus said he has four overriding concerns with the 2017 bill: It was written in private, no hearings were held on its substance, it gave too much of the tax cuts to the wealthy, and it adds more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years."}
{"original": "When contacted by phone, Camp, now a senior policy advisor with PricewaterhouseCoopers, said he wanted to be interviewed for this article, but days later the company's public relations firm said in an email that Camp would have to decline because he couldn't make the time."}
{"original": "In an interview with The Washington Post in early 2017, when tax reform talk was heating up in Congress, Camp rejected the idea that his 2014 bill, numbered H.R. 1 just as the 2017 legislation was, should have been necessarily relied on."}
{"original": "I think there's a number of alternatives and decision points throughout a process like this, and it doesn't have to be all like H.R. 1 or all like other proposals that have been discussed in the past, Camp said. Obviously, the kinds of assumptions I made in putting together H.R. 1 aren't necessarily the same assumptions you might make today."}
{"original": "Prater declined a request for an interview. Dozens of lawmakers and party leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, as well as lobbyists, declined requests for interviews or didn't respond to requests to comment."}
{"original": "Thousands of witnesses, scores of reports"}
{"original": "To be sure, the political climate was different in the mid-1980s. Tax reform had been percolating in Congress for years, and in 1982 Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri sponsored a bill that proposed to close loopholes for the rich and cut marginal tax rates for all income brackets. Though that measure never made it to a vote, President Ronald Reagan, in his state of the Union address in January 1984, pledged to reform the tax code. The following year, Reagan reiterated his pledge and Democrats thought it wise to join in."}
{"original": "Soon, Congress — where the GOP controlled the Senate and the Democrats owned the House — was abuzz with hearings on taxation. Seventy-one hearings were held in 1985, by 13 different committees, including House Banking, Small Business, Public Works, and Senate Energy, and Labor. Some went on for three, four or five days, and some were held far from the Capitol — in Oklahoma City, Cincinnati, or South Bend, Indiana, for example. The witness lists were exhaustive: two or three dozen witnesses per hearing were not unusual."}
{"original": "Subjects ran from the general (Fundamental Tax Reform) to the arcane (Carryover of Net Operating Losses). Politicians delved into sensitive social issues, holding hearings on how tax reform would affect low-wage workers and the poor."}
{"original": "Drafting the tax reform bill was messy. Bills were introduced and rejected, deals were cut, and leaders tried again and again to find something that would pass. Finally, on Dec. 3, 1985, 11 months into the 99th Congress, H.R. 3838 was introduced in the House. After several setbacks, it passed the House on Dec. 17 on a voice vote. Off it went to the Senate, which scheduled 12 more hearings to work up its own bill."}
{"original": "The Finance Committee kicked off a series of five get-togethers specifically on the bill's provisions. In one marathon session, held April 21, 1986, titled Proposals Related to Excise Taxes, 27 witnesses —limited to five minutes each—testified in one day. A House Ways and Means subcommittee, not satisfied even though that chamber had already passed its bill, held a hearing on miscellaneous tax provisions. Ninety-two witnesses were called."}
{"original": "The final scorecard? Over two years, the 99th Congress held 89 hearings on tax reform and heard from nearly 2,600 witnesses, according to the Center's review of hearing records."}
{"original": "Other groups weighed in — massively. The Joint Committee on Taxation — a nonpartisan congressional team of experts that assesses tax topics for Congress — supplied politicians with 62 reports over 21 months. The Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service wrote 10 more. One report was titled Blacks and Tax Reform: Possible Impacts on Blacks of Selected Proposals of HR 3838."}
{"original": "On June 24, 1986 — 189 days after the House passed its bill — the Senate approved its version. It took three more months of work in conference to create a bill the two houses could agree on. Reagan signed the bill on October 22, 1986 – 11 months after the bill was first introduced."}
{"original": "(AP Photo/Bob Daugherty) Lawmakers watch President Ronald Reagan sign into law the 1986 Tax Reform Act on the White House South Lawn on Oct. 22, 1986.

William Coyne, D-Pa., and Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn."}
{"original": "The new law — 878 pages long — was designed to simplify the tax code, make it fairer, and incentivize growth. But its main thrust was true reform – cleaning out many of the special loopholes and breaks that had crept into the code over the years. It raised the tax on capital gains, but also cut the top individual rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. It pulled in $24 billion from corporations by adjusting tax shelters, while cutting corporate taxes from 46 percent to 34 percent. (The rate later crept up to 35 percent). And it shrank the number of individual tax brackets from 15 to five."}
{"original": "In short, said Gene Steuerle, coordinator of Treasury's reform effort from 1984 to 1986 and now a fellow at the non-partisan Tax Policy Center in Washington, individuals got a modest tax cut and corporations got a modest tax increase. Perhaps most important, the measure did not increase the national debt."}
{"original": "Republicans chose a different approach for their 2017 bill. That year congressional Republicans were under tremendous pressure from Trump, his base, and their wealthiest donors to do two big things: repeal Obamacare and enact tax cuts by the end of the year. Their first legislative effort failed. On July 28, the effort to repeal Obamacare died with a no vote by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz."}
{"original": "U.S. Congress The late Sen. John McCain's defining 'no' vote on the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare on July 28, 2017. (U.S. Congress)"}
{"original": "That left the tax bill, whose passage was dubious at best. One senior Republican senator lamented it would make repealing Obamacare look like a piece of cake. Republicans were panicking. They believed they had to notch a big legislative win if they were going to survive the coming midterm elections — and even future ones."}
{"original": "You have to understand the pressure these staffs were under, said one lobbyist close to the process. The fate of the Republican party rested with them. Indeed, they faced the seemingly impossible: research, write, debate, and pass tax legislation that would satisfy donors, corporate supporters, and the party's conservative ideologues — all in five months."}
{"original": "Republicans didn't have time for the normal legislative process — Democrats say it was hard to call it a process at all. The House Ways and Means Committee held only four hearings — two in May and two in July. But because the bill had not yet been drafted, the hearings were limited to the broadest subjects. How Tax Reform Will Grow our Economy and Create Jobs was one. How Tax Reform Will Simplify our Broken Tax Code was another."}
{"original": "The subjects of the Senate Finance Committee's hearings were just as vague: Comprehensive Tax Reform, Individual Tax Reform and International Tax Reform. The hearings totaled 11 in the House and Senate. Forty-five witnesses were called, never more than five per hearing. Nearly half came from inside the Beltway. None dealt with specifics because the tax bill was still being drafted — in secret."}
{"original": "That was it for hearings. After the House bill was introduced Nov. 2, 2017, that chamber scheduled no hearings. In 1986, even after its tax reform bill was passed, the House scheduled two more hearings with 131 witnesses. In 2017 the Senate didn't hold one hearing on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act after it was introduced. In 1986, after the Tax Reform Act went to the Senate, that chamber held 12 hearings with 197 witnesses."}
{"original": "Hearings play a vital role in the passage of laws, experts say. If done well, they elicit reactions to legislative proposals from the people who would be affected — but also from people who have no skin in the game. If you don't have hearings, if you don't bring the experts in, if you don't hear many sides to the issues, if you don't allow for that input, then you don't really have legislation, Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, told The Hill last week."}
{"original": "Hearings also increase responsibility, said Brookings' Reynolds. You're getting views clearly on the record, from outside groups and from experts, she said. If we've brought these witnesses to testify, you're saying, 'Congress, you made this choice having heard these witnesses.'"}
{"original": "Normally, Congress also relies on the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to assess how much money its tax proposals will either add to or take away from the treasury. In 2017 the JCT issued 27 reports, but Republicans eschewed the panel's advice on the big question of whether the proposed tax cuts would generate any economic growth to partially offset the trillions of dollars in lost revenue."}
{"original": "It's not that the JCT couldn't do the work, known as a macroeconomic analysis. But the House bill was moving so fast that the JCT couldn't get an analysis out in time for the vote. (JCT finished its report on the House bill 25 days after that chamber voted on it.) So, the JCT focused on assessing the Senate version, which came later. That report made it to senators Dec. 1, 2017 — just one day before they voted on their bill. The report concluded that even with the economic growth the tax cuts would generate, the Senate bill would still cost the nation more than $1 trillion over 10 years."}
{"original": "The JCT crashed a final report on the conference bill, concluding the final version would add nearly $1.1 trillion to the national debt. But, the report was finished the day Trump signed the bill into law, on Dec. 22, 2017, so lawmakers never got to use it."}
{"original": "Still Republicans did have at their fingertips other research on the cost of their bill. One report in particular was released Dec. 18, 2017, by the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington. It published a rosier estimate that found the tax bill would add only $448 billion to the national debt over 10 years, less than half what the JCT would report four days later. Indeed, the Tax Foundation had issued numerous reports on Republicans' proposed tax policies and bill ideas throughout 2017, many of which carried weight among Republicans on the Hill, Washington tax experts and lobbyists said."}
{"original": "The House majority did not wait for a JCT staff macroeconomic analysis and instead relied on any private estimate that suited its fancy, wrote the former JCT chief Kleinbard. The Senate essentially did the same."}
{"original": "Some believe that if Congress had held hearings on the bill, wiser minds could have sounded alarm bells about the debt it would create. The hearings, they say, might have steered the bill more toward helping low- and middle-income families, and minorities. Hearing witnesses also might have warned that the increase in the debt threatens Social Security and Medicare, and even national security."}
{"original": "But others argue Republicans were going to do what they were going to do, no matter what official studies showed. I think, generally, the interest of the members of Congress pushing for the bill was a tax cut that was fairly regressive, said Lily Batchelder, a former Senate Finance Committee chief tax counsel and now a tax law professor at New York University. That's what they put forth, and I think that aligned with their views of what's best for the economy."}
{"original": "One thing is certain, tax researchers say. The bill will need major repairs so that taxpayers can understand it, tax preparers can interpret it, and the legislation can have its intended effects. Many of the needed fixes will require new legislation, of the sort House Republicans unveiled in a 297-page bill on Nov. 26. House Democrats immediately signaled their unwillingness to cooperate without concessions, and the bill was unable to pass the Senate where it needed 60 votes."}
{"original": "Now, with Democrats in charge of the House, it will be even harder for Republicans to make needed fixes in their bill. And because Republicans control the Senate, Democrats will find their way blocked to changing or repealing parts of the law. Instead, they promise to hold hearings on the parts of the tax bill they say are confusing – or they just don't like."}
{"original": "That leaves grizzled tax policy veterans like Trier pessimistic about the future of changes in this Congress, or for many to come. This legislation, in significant parts, it could be fixed; it would not be that hard, he said. The problem is that with all the partisanship, it won't occur."}
{"original": "This week's Torah portion, Vayekhel, contains one of the most colorful depictions of community-building in the Torah. Rephrased and repeated throughout the parasha is the following message: Everyone whose heart so moves them shall bring gifts for the Lord; gold, silver, and copper; blue, purple and crimson yarns . . .(Exodus 35:5-6). While some find a bit dull this detailed and repeated description of the pieces of the mishkan (the tabernacle in the desert) and the piles of materials donated to build it, I am invigorated by that list and what it says to us about the power of a diverse and inclusive community. When this colorful litany is read in the context of two earlier episodes in the Torah, the rainbow of Vayekhel shines even more colorfully."}
{"original": "If we step back just one week, to Parshat Ki Tissa, we find a more monochromatic communal endeavor:"}
{"original": "The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: When you take a census of the Israelite people according to their enrollment . . . everyone in the records shall pay a half-shekel . . . Everyone who is entered in the records, from the age of twenty years up, shall give the Lord's offering: the rich shall not pay more and the poor shall not pay less than half a shekel (Exodus 30:12-15)."}
{"original": "Here we have an egalitarianism of sorts: no matter one's wealth or status, God compels everyone to contribute the same amount--one silverhalf-shekel. Though one is compulsory and the other free will, both the Vayakhel and Ki Tissa campaigns raise funds for the mishkan, which belongs to every Israelite. But upon closer inspection, we note that everyone called to contribute is limited to adult males over 20 years old (only they were counted in the census). The biblical text assumes that this compulsory census tax was generally heeded--a successful, standardized fundraiser, if not inclusive of the full community."}
{"original": "Also in last week's parasha, we have a chronologically jarring flashback to the molding of the golden calf, another monochromatic endeavor, this time in gold. Contemporary Torah scholar Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg suggests that the reference to this episode helps set the context for the people's need for the mishkan, a physical, concrete place in which to focus on the Divine presence. In one well-known midrash on the golden calf (Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer 45), however, despite grassroots demand for such a god who shall go before us (Exodus 32:2), the Israelite women refuse to contribute their gold rings and earrings."}
{"original": "The compulsory silver campaign, which includes only a part of the community, achieves modest financial goals, but does not touch the hearts of its people. The women reject participation in the misguided campaign for the golden calf, a project that threatens the Israelites' emerging covenantal relationship. But when every member of the community is both called upon and motivated to bring their heart, possessions, talents, skills, and love to the creation of the mishkan, this is what happens:"}
{"original": "Men and women, all whose hearts moved them, all who would make an elevation offering of gold to the Lord, came bringing brooches, earrings, rings, and pendants - gold objects of all kinds. And everyone who had in his possession blue, purple and crimson yarns . . . brought them . . . (Exodus 35:22-23)."}
{"original": "In fact, the overwhelming and colorful contributions grew to be too much. Moses proclaimed, 'Let no man or woman make further effort toward gifts for the sanctuary!' So the people stopped bringing; their efforts had been more than enough for all the tasks to be done (Exodus 36:6)."}
{"original": "The preceding one-dimensional campaigns--in which both color and gender are circumscribed--serve to emphasize the expansive ways in which individuals can be moved to give for the sake of community; every one of them is encouraged and motivated to contribute in a meaningful way according to his or her passions and talents. The Israelites are so moved by this sacred work that Moses has to ask them to stop giving. By the end, the Israelites' inclusive endeavor yields incredible riches, both in resources and in passion. They have built not only an elaborate and deeply colorful mishkan -- a dwelling for the Divine -- but also a powerfully collaborative and generous community that is truly fit for God's presence."}

{"original": "New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo recently pledged to make undergraduate education at the the City University of New York (CUNY) and the State University of New York (SUNY) system free for families making less than US$120,000 annually."}
{"original": "If this happens, it wouldn't be the first time that undergraduate education has been free in New York. For most of its history, up until the 1970s when New York City was in dire financial straits and the state had to step in to bail out the City University of New York, CUNY was free to many of the city's residents."}
{"original": "And this is not just the case in New York. College has been tuition-free in other states as well. In 2014, Tennessee governor Bill Haslam promised to provide free community college to all residents in his state. He has delivered on the promise, making Tennessee a model state in this area."}
{"original": "In a country where student debt and the rising cost of the college degree grab national headlines on a weekly basis, efforts to make college free can also get attention. In truth, however, a large part of tuition costs are already subsidized in the U.S. through a combination of grants, tax breaks and loans. What causes waves is the ever-increasing sticker price, rather than what students actually pay."}
{"original": "My interest, as a scholar of global education policy, is understanding how college costs in the U.S. compare to those of the rest of the world. The fact is that nowhere is college truly free. The critical difference is whether the bulk of the costs are born by the student or by the government."}
{"original": "So, what are some of the changes taking place globally as countries try to manage college costs?"}
{"original": "Some countries follow a model similar to the U.S. by charging high tuition rates but then defraying the costs for certain students with grants, loans or tax incentives."}
{"original": "As to which country charges students the most, that depends on how one does the calculations."}
{"original": "Let's look at the 2015 Education at a Glance report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The report shows that public colleges in England charged the highest fees, when factoring in public aid, to domestic students (approximately ($9,000), followed by the U.S. ($8,200), Japan ($5,100), South Korea ($4,700) and Canada ($4,700)."}
{"original": "But the numbers alone do not tell the full story."}
{"original": "A simple comparison between the total cost of tuition fees and the median self-reported income of the country reveals a very different picture: Hungary becomes the most expensive country, with 92 percent of median income going toward the cost of education, followed closely by Romania and Estonia. The U.S. ranks sixth on this listing. (This calculation does not factor in loans and grants.)"}
{"original": "Some countries take a very different approach, charging no or low tuition fees. According to the International Higher Education Finance, a project sponsored by the Rockefeller Institute of Government, more than 40 countries offer free or nearly free post-secondary education to domestic students. These include Argentina, Denmark, Greece, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt, Uruguay, Scotland and Turkey."}
{"original": "A variety of approaches are used to fund higher education in these countries, such as imposing high taxes or making use of their significant natural resources (e.g., oil and natural gas reserves) to provide the financial resources for extensive social investment."}
{"original": "In other places, such as Germany, an egalitarian philosophy and deeply held beliefs about the value of a public education preclude the government from shifting costs to the students. In Germany, for example, there was a short-lived effort from 2005-2014 to charge minimal tuition, which was rolled back after a major public outcry. Germans strongly believe that higher education is a public good to be totally subsidized the government."}
{"original": "The point being in these countries students pay very little for post-secondary education - a policy shift going on in the U.S."}
{"original": "There have been attempts in other countries to shift some of the cost of higher education to students."}
{"original": "Following the great recession in 2012, England, for example, tripled tuition in one year to approximately $11,000 (9000 pounds). The intent was to offset steep declines in government funding. Despite a significant outcry by students and other critics, these high tuition costs have stayed."}
{"original": "In fact, England recently surpassed the U.S. in terms of having the highest tuition fees of the 34 countries in the industrialized world. While the sticker price for many U.S. institutions is higher, financial aid helps bring down the total cost."}
{"original": "However, England's sister country Scotland continues to provide more substantial subsidies for higher education, providing domestic students with free access to college while at the same time charging significant fees to students from elsewhere in the U.K."}
{"original": "The free tuition debate typically is domestically focused, but it can spill over into affecting international students. There are now more than one million international students in the US - comprising about 5.2 percent of the total number of college students."}
{"original": "The question now facing policymakers globally is whether to extend the concept of free college to international students or to let them be a source of additional revenues to offset costs of domestic students."}
{"original": "The no-tuition and low-cost tuition models have emerged as competitive advantages for attracting international students in many countries."}
{"original": "For example, a growing number of U.S. students are pursuing their degree outside of the U.S. in countries such as Germany and Scotland as they look for ways to escape the rising cost of college at home. Even though some U.S. students can receive subsidies to offset their education, those in the middle- and upper-income levels tend to receive minimal support and are also most likely to see studying abroad as a possibility."}
{"original": "New Zealand saw the number of international students quadruple from 2005 to 2014, soon after it made the decision to subsidize international doctoral students at the same level as domestic students."}
{"original": "In contrast, nations that have significantly increased their tuition costs for international students have found mixed results."}
{"original": "Denmark, for example, saw attendance from outside the EU drop by 20 percent in one year, after it introduced tuition fees for international students in 2006. Sweden too saw a massive drop in international students after it introduced fees in 2011-12 - the number of international students plummeted by 80 percent. (Some modest recovery has happened in recent years.)"}
{"original": "The issue in the U.S. is that it already has the largest share of the international student market - approximately 15 percent - and a steady stream of international students looking to study in the U.S."}
{"original": "In fact, state universities often seek to make up resource declines by increasing the number of full-fee paying international students. A recent report from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that a 10 percent reduction in state funding resulted in an 12 percent increase in the number of international undergraduate students at public research universities."}
{"original": "A number of questions therefore arise when considering the implications for the free college policies in the U.S.: Could free college policies reverse the trend of more U.S. students studying outside of the U.S. to escape high fees? Could improved state funding in support of making college more financially accessible to domestic students stop colleges from actively seeking international students? Or, could it push these students into the private sector which will likely have more room as students take advantage of free public education?"}
{"original": "There are far too many variables still in play to answer any of these questions. But while the push for free college in the U.S. may be a sexy political move, we need to think through intended and unintended consequences."}

{"original": "The tax filing season has officially begun -– as of Jan. 28, the IRS started accepting returns for the 2018 tax year. Thanks to the major changes that rolled out with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, taxpayers are bracing for a chaotic season."}
{"original": "Here's a list of some of the changes you can expect as you file this year."}
{"original": "1. In an effort to simplify the tax filing process and match the changes to the tax code, a new 1040 form was released last year. The new version is about the size of a large postcard, which doesn't really matter for most Americans filing electronically."}
{"original": "What does matter for most individual filers is that there is now only one version of the 1040 – up until now there were three versions, the 1040, 1040A and 1040Z, that you could use based on your financial situation. Now we're all filing this one standard form, with six new add-on forms the IRS likes to call schedules used for certain deductions that may apply."}
{"original": "2. On the new 1040, you'll see there are no more personal exemptions, meaning you can no longer claim and deduct money for every person in your household - which was $4,050 per person up until 2017. But since you can't do that anymore, two things were done to make up for it:"}
{"original": "The standard deduction went up: For single filers: it used to be $6,350, now it's $12,000. For married couples filing jointly it used to be $12,700, now it's $24,000. For heads of household, it used to be $9,350, and now it's $18,000."}
{"original": "The IRS tweaked the tax brackets and lowered income tax rates. The average American household with a median income of $62,175 would've been taxed at the 25 percent rate in 2017. For 2018, they'll be taxed at a 22 percent rate."}
{"original": "3. Among the most controversial tax law changes is the elimination of state and local tax deductions (SALT). Prior to 2018, taxpayers were able itemize state and local property, income and sales taxes. Today the total deduction for all of these taxes is capped at $10,000. Taxpayers who live in high-tax states like New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, California, and Massachusetts will be affected the most because filers in these states typically took the biggest SALT deductions."}
{"original": "4. Last but not least, your taxes are due on April 15 this year, a couple of days sooner than last year's filing deadline. If you don't think you'll get to your taxes in time, make sure you file an extension for both federal and state. Remember, you're only given an extension to file – not to pay – that's still due by the deadline, otherwise you can expect to pay interest and penalties on top of what you owe."}

{"original": "Major conservative groups backed by some of the Republican Party's wealthiest donors appear to be helping fuel a massive GOP state legislative push to limit the emergency executive powers governors across the country have wielded in an effort to combat the nation's COVID-19 crisis."}
{"original": "For months, Republican legislators in several states have pushed bills to limit such powers, which have been used to implement restrictions on businesses, restaurants and public gatherings, as well as measures meant to slow the spread of the virus that has killed more than 450,000 Americans."}
{"original": "The legislative efforts have intensified over the first few weeks of 2021 as lawmakers in many states ― particularly those with part-time legislatures that ended their sessions in the earliest stages of the pandemic last year ― have returned to state capitals vowing to rein in governors they believe have overstepped their bounds. Lawmakers in more than two dozen states have now introduced bills to curb executive powers to declare or extend states of emergencies, which all 50 states have done during the public health crisis."}
{"original": "Many of the bills proceeding in those states and others appear to be based at least partially on model legislation proposed by the American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization of thousands of state legislators and deep-pocketed corporate interests that has for years helped push conservative policy priorities on the state level, a HuffPost analysis of the bills found."}
{"original": "Republicans in states including Kentucky and Pennsylvania, both of which have already passed legislation to curb the executive powers of their Democratic governors, have insisted that they have pursued such measures to help constituents who are angry over business closures and other mandates. But the similarities in the bills going forward in various states and ALEC's own proposal are the latest suggestion that supposedly fervent opposition to COVID-19 restrictions and the governors who have implemented them is an organized effort to create the guise of grassroots anger and help justify the passage of conservative legislative proposals nationwide."}
{"original": "STEPHEN ZENNER/AFP via Getty Images Governors around the country, including Ohio's Mike DeWine (R), have faced legislative efforts to limit the emergency executive powers they have used to close bars and restaurants and implement other restrictions in an attempt to control the COVID-19 pandemic."}
{"original": "For much of the coronavirus pandemic, a majority of Americans have supported restrictions like mask mandates and business closures, and especially in its early months, governors who took more aggressive approaches to the virus and the measures implemented to stop it earned higher marks from the public than lawmakers who were more lax. Lawmakers from both parties benefited: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, both saw their approval ratings jump because of their handling of the outbreak."}
{"original": "But ALEC, as the organization is known, nevertheless began targeting governors' pandemic powers as early as last summer, when it first drafted its model bill as then-President Donald Trump and other GOP lawmakers were fuming over pandemic-related restrictions."}
{"original": "Since then, Republican lawmakers in at least nine states ― Arizona, Idaho, Kentucky, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and Washington ― have introduced legislation that appears to be modeled on ALEC's proposal. In some cases, the legislation uses language that is almost verbatim to ALEC's model bill."}
{"original": "Fights between governors and legislatures have touched off political power struggles across the nation at a time when a holiday surge in infections and deaths appears to be waning and the availability of multiple vaccines has provided the first real glint of hope that the end of the pandemic may be in sight. Despite improving signs, public health experts still warn that the recent progress is fragile and that the death toll could grow substantially in the coming months if restrictions are eased too soon."}
{"original": "It appears that we're just getting ahead of the disease for the first time, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. The biggest mistake policymakers can make is changing the policy before we've won the war. Pulling up and retreating when you have the enemy on the run would be a bad, bad strategy. At the end of the day, what they're doing is setting up a situation where more people will die."}
{"original": "Disaster declarations were the first major weapon governors deployed against the pandemic, and April marked the first time in American history that all 50 states had simultaneously declared a state of emergency. That status gave governors broader powers to implement restrictions, and in most states, they have been maintained or repeatedly extended throughout the pandemic. As a result, governors' ability to maintain that status has become the main focus of conservative lawmakers nationwide."}
{"original": "In all nine states HuffPost analyzed, bills have adopted a major proposal from ALEC's draft legislation: A specific time limit on states of emergency declared by governors alone. ALEC's model suggests that limit should be 30 days, after which governors would have to seek legislative approval to extend an emergency declaration."}
{"original": "The bills Kentucky Republicans passed last month adopt that timeline, as do legislative proposals in Arizona, Idaho and Utah. Bills introduced in Washington and Virginia, where they are unlikely to proceed in Democratic legislatures, seek to limit emergency declarations to 30 days as well. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, blocked two bills Republican passed to limit his powers in January, but the GOP legislature overrode his vetoes this week, drawing a lawsuit from Beshear in response."}
{"original": "Ryan C. Hermens/Lexington Herald-Leader via Associated Press Kentucky Republicans have passed multiple bills limiting Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear's executive emergency powers and then overrode his veto of that legislation this week. Beshear has filed a lawsuit to block the bills from becoming law."}
{"original": "Pennsylvania's bill is even more restrictive, limiting emergency declarations to 21 days, while proposals in Montana and North Dakota place 60-day limitations on executive authority to declare an emergency."}
{"original": "The bills almost universally adopt another ALEC proposal meant to keep governors from working their way around the new restrictions: a provision that prevents governors from issuing new orders that are substantially similar to the one that expired unless legislatures approve them. The bills that have advanced in Kentucky and Pennsylvania adopt that language almost exactly, as do proposed bills in Montana, Arizona and Washington."}
{"original": "The Governor shall not declare a new emergency or continue to implement any of the powers enumerated in this chapter based upon the same or substantially similar facts and circumstances as the original declaration or implementation without the prior approval of the General Assembly, Kentucky Senate Bill 1 reads."}
{"original": "Pennsylvania's Senate Bill 2, which could pass the state legislature this month, says that the Governor may not issue a new disaster emergency declaration based upon the same or substantially similar facts and circumstances without the passage of a concurrent resolution of the General Assembly expressly approving the new disaster emergency declaration."}
{"original": "Legislative proposals in Idaho, North Dakota and Utah include similar provisions written in slightly different language."}
{"original": "An ALEC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment or answer questions about whether it had worked with legislators to develop and implement legislation targeting executive powers."}
{"original": "ALEC has not shied away from its longstanding efforts to advance conservative legislative proposals through similar processes during the pandemic: Last May, it began circulating model legislation that would protect businesses from any liabilities related to the pandemic, mirroring the effort by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on the federal level."}
{"original": "By then, ALEC had joined FreedomWorks, Tea Party Patriots and other conservative groups in forming the Save Our Country Coalition, which aimed to educate and inform elected officials and policymakers at all levels of government in an effort to bring about a quick, safe and responsible reopening of US society. Led by Arthur Laffer, an archconservative economist, and former Club for Growth leader Stephen Moore, the group was among the loudest champions of lifting COVID-19 restrictions to immediately reopen the economy."}
{"original": "The coalition, however, signaled its primary intent in the announcement of its founding: It wanted to weaponize concerns about the national debt, limited government and fiscal responsibility to push an agenda that would ultimately incentivize the rapid rebuilding of our economy through proven formulas: tax cuts, deregulation, and lawsuit reform. It would do it by pushing Americans across the country to get in touch with elected officials at all levels of government, FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon said in a statement at the time."}
{"original": "The coalition also helped foment protests against such restrictions outside state capitols across the country, The New York Times reported in April, and the staff at FreedomWorks, in particular, focused almost entirely on pushing the effort. The demonstrations did not reflect public opinion, but they helped provide cover for Republican lawmakers who were seeking to challenge and roll back pandemic measures."}
{"original": "Peter Zay/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Conservative groups like FreedomWorks helped stoke protests against COVID-19 measures throughout the spring and summer, even as public opinion favored more aggressive responses to the public health crisis."}
{"original": "Save Our Country was, in essence, Tea Party 2.0: Pandemic Edition ― a push to advance business-friendly conservative priorities by pretending they reflected the major concerns of the crisis-stricken masses. Early in the pandemic, Laffer and Moore revived conservative tropes about government assistance making people lazy to argue against Congress's initial economic assistance package."}
{"original": "GOP legislatures in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas began pushing to limit executive emergency powers almost as soon as the pandemic began. And over the summer, ALEC appears to have begun pushing the effort to other states. In a July draft statement of principles, it declared that open-ended declarations of emergency had undercut legislative authority and led to gubernatorial overreach that has exacted a significant economic cost to individuals and commerce, arguments that quickly became talking points for Republicans across the states."}
{"original": "That month, ALEC also hosted a panel discussion on outdated emergency management, the Center for Media and Democracy reported. Mississippi House Speaker Phillip Gunn, ALEC's national chairman at the time, led a talk that included legislative leaders from Wisconsin, Utah, Arizona and South Dakota."}
{"original": "Whether ALEC led the effort or drew inspiration from ongoing fights isn't clear: The same week it posted its draft legislation, Pennsylvania's Republican legislature passed its first bill to limit Gov. Tom Wolf's (D) pandemic powers. (In order to protect from Wolf's eventual veto, the GOP proposed the legislation as an amendment to the state constitution, which would require that it pass in two consecutive legislative sessions and then win a ballot referendum.)"}
{"original": "The earliest attempts to limit gubernatorial powers felt distinctly partisan, especially to the governors involved: Most were Democrats in states where the GOP held majority control of the state legislature. When Kentucky Republicans finally launched their legislative effort to strip Beshear's powers in January, the chairman of the state's Democratic Party blasted them for engaging in petty partisan attacks and objecting to lifesaving recommendations and actions because they have no other agenda than to fight this governor."}
{"original": "But not long after ALEC drafted its model bill, GOP lawmakers began hinting that they'd go after governors from their own party, too."}
{"original": "Utah Senate President Stuart Adams, who participated in the July ALEC panel and is now the group's chairman, suggested in October that his legislature would consider limiting Republican Gov. Gary Herbert's powers, and Utah Republicans are currently considering such legislation. (Herbert's term ended last month.)"}
{"original": "Republican governors in Arizona, Ohio, North Dakota, Idaho, Montana and other states have also found themselves facing challenges to their executive powers. In Gunn's Mississippi, Republicans voted to strip GOP Gov. Tate Reeves of his authority to spend nearly $2 billion in pandemic aid from Congress."}
{"original": "Ross D. Franklin, Pool photo via Associated Press Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey is among the Republicans who is facing challenges from within his own party to emergency executive powers, even though Ducey has been comparably hesitant to use his authority during the COVID-19 pandemic."}
{"original": "Republican governors who've refused to fully buy into conservative conspiracies around the 2020 election and the pandemic may even face primary challenges the next time they run, suggesting that ALEC and other conservative groups have once again helped spark an intra-party race to the right, all while they potentially exacerbate a public health crisis."}
{"original": "Republican divisions go beyond wild conspiracy theories and primary politics, said David Turner, a spokesperson for the Democratic Governors Association, which has pushed back against GOP efforts to target its elected executives. Now, it's affecting the ability of governors to protect the lives of their constituents. If you wanted evidence the GOP base is living on an entirely different planet, it couldn't be clearer than this."}
{"original": "Republicans, however, continue to insist that this is a fight to protect the power of the legislatures they control: Emergency powers, GOP lawmakers in Pennsylvania and Kentucky have told HuffPost, were never intended to be wielded for crises that last this long. They have argued that no single lawmaker should have this much power and that they are trying to ensure legislatures maintain a voice in the process."}
{"original": "Governors from both parties are using their executive powers to levels that have never been done before, said Pennsylvania state Senate President Pro Tem Jake Corman (R). Obviously this pandemic has taught us a lot, and it really isn't about the pandemic itself. It's about separation of powers and should the executive have this much authority and power for this extended period of time."}
{"original": "Like his party mates in Kentucky, Corman argued that the GOP's efforts to limit executive powers in Pennsylvania were meant to foster more communication with legislators."}
{"original": "But health experts like Benjamin are skeptical that most governors have wielded their authority improperly and are fearful that hasty attempts to limit emergency powers now will worsen both this crisis and the next one. Instead, he suggested that legislatures and governors wait until after the pandemic is fully over to reassess how those powers were used and whether they should be altered."}
{"original": "It is their right to review this, Benjamin said. But they ought not do it without a real thoughtful review of the pros and cons, and not do it because... they're mad at a particular governor or mayor because they shut down the economy."}
{"original": "This is not the last disease outbreak we're going to have, he said. The more you weaken the authority of public health officials to do this kind of stuff, the more they weaken the ability to govern, and to protect the public."}

{"original": "We're going to be reasonable. We're not going to have a knee-jerk reaction, Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), a top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, told HuffPost. We got enough experts to testify. We want have hearings and put more pressure on."}
{"original": "The chairman of Ways and Means has the legal authority to request copies of anyone's tax records from the IRS, which the committee can then vote to make public. But the incoming Democratic chairman, Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), has indicated he might wait more than a month to do so, drawing criticism from some tax and policy experts."}
{"original": "A spokesperson for Neal did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. The congressman previously said he would seek Trump's tax returns if Democrats won the House in November."}
{"original": "One problem with the idea that Democrats need to put more pressure on Trump is that Trump has already been under pressure to release his tax returns for two and a half years. In 2016, he flouted decades of precedent by keeping secret the kind of tax information that presidential candidates traditionally disclose, to reveal personal details such as their sources of income, how much tax they pay and how much they give to charity."}
{"original": "The New York Times reported in October that in the past, Trump has dodged taxes through outright fraud. There's also the question of whether Trump, who hasn't divested from his business, is receiving income from individuals or organizations trying to influence the government."}
{"original": "Still, just because the Ways and Means chairman can ask the IRS for a person's tax returns ― and the law says the Treasury Department is required to hand them over ― doesn't mean the Trump administration will obey the law. A spokesperson for the department previously said any such request would be reviewed for legality, meaning Democrats could be in for a court battle if they make their request. The possibility of a long legal fight may be another reason not to waste time now."}
{"original": "Ways and Means and other committees have not even named their new members since Democrats assumed control of the House this week, said Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), one of the main authors of the bill Democrats introduced Friday. Sarbanes said Neal and other committee leaders would want to meet with their new members to set priorities for oversight and legislation."}
{"original": "I don't regard that as foot-dragging, Sarbanes said. The public is worn out. They're fatigued with this kind of shoot-from-the-hip way of governing up here in Washington."}

{"original": "The majority of financial planning applies to all individuals, but there are some specific considerations for women:"}
{"original": "1. Be involved - Being involved in the goal setting, budgeting, saving, and investing is most important. You should never assume someone else is planning for you. Your goals can't be reached if they aren't considered. If you are married you may have to make some compromises, but at least you will have a say. Both the husband and wife are involved and take ownership in the ideal financial situations I witness."}
{"original": "2. Have a plan - Having a financial plan in place will give you the best chance of reaching your goals. You should build a plan based on your short term and long term goals and make sure it is updated as your situation changes. Figure out what your future expenses may be and make sure you are saving enough to meet those expenses. You should maximize employer benefits and retirement plans to receive tax deferrals and employer matches, profit sharing contributions, and insurances. Make sure your investment strategy is tied to the investment return used in your projections. Having a plan without implementation, or without a regular update, will not be effective. Financial planning is an ongoing process that requires your participation."}
{"original": "3. Have insurance - The worst case scenario can happen, and you're rarely expecting it. If your spouse is the primary earner make sure there is enough life insurance and disability insurance to be prepared for the worst. It can be very difficult to reenter the work force and replace income in times of hardship. You should make sure there is enough to pay off big bills, such as your mortgage and college educations, and enough to produce income that will replace lost wages."}
{"original": "4. Maximize Social Security - Make sure your social security benefits are maximized. The age you take social security can have a major impact on your benefits. Women's life expectancy is longer than men's. You want to ensure your benefits will be maximized if you outlive your spouse."}
{"original": "5. Monitor your risk - Make sure your investments are tied to your goals, not a random stock pick or a whim. Make decisions based on education and fact, not short term market fluctuations or fears. Your portfolio may go up and down over time, but having an allocation that is tied to your goals will keep you from making short term or reactive decisions."}
{"original": "6. Have an estate plan - You never know what life will bring. Do not leave circumstances to chance. Having an estate plan will allow you to choose guardians for your children, decide where your money goes when you die, and be proactive about making sure what's left behind is not a financial burden on those you love."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― The Treasury Department has given congressional Republicans sensitive financial information related to Hunter Biden after having refused to give Democrats President Donald Trump's tax returns."}
{"original": "Yahoo News first reported Thursday that the Treasury Department handed over highly confidential information in response to a November request from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) for suspicious activity reports filed with the department by financial institutions."}
{"original": "Last year, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin blocked a Democratic request for the president's tax filings, saying Democrats had no legitimate legislative purpose for seeking the documents."}
{"original": "The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power, Mnuchin said in an April 2019 letter."}
{"original": "Apparently, that same standard did not apply when it came to non-tax financial information that may pertain to the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Trump political rival."}
{"original": "The administration told House Democrats to go pound sand when their oversight authority was mandatory while voluntarily cooperating with the Senate Republicans' sideshow at lightning speed, Ashley Schapitl, a spokeswoman for Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said in a statement."}
{"original": "Senate Republicans are investigating Hunter Biden as part of an inquiry designed to bolster Trump's unfounded claim that Joe Biden used the vice presidency to benefit his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was involved in setting U.S. foreign policy in Eastern Europe."}
{"original": "For [Treasury] to go willy-nilly handing out financial information of private citizens … is simply outrageous. Steve Rosenthal, Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center"}
{"original": "The inquiry, which includes at least a half dozen records requests to various organizations and executive branch agencies, has proceeded since fall with relatively little notice. It picks up where Trump left off last summer when he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate whether Biden had improperly recommended the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor."}
{"original": "Zelensky never followed through because Democrats learned of the scheme from a whistleblower report, which launched their impeachment inquiry and prompted the White House to release a secret hold on military assistance to Ukraine. The House impeached Trump on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges in December."}
{"original": "In the Senate trial last month, the president's lawyers said Hunter Biden's board membership created the appearance of a conflict of interest, but they stopped short of alleging any actual illegality. As the Senate Republicans' records requests show, the quest for corroboration continues."}
{"original": "In their letter seeking suspicious activity reports related to Hunter Biden and various associates, Republicans cited an internal Senate rule authorizing the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to investigate the effectiveness of all agencies and departments of the federal government. Financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports with the Treasury Department if they reasonably suspect customer transactions may be connected to money laundering."}
{"original": "Democrats based their request for Trump's tax records on a federal tax disclosure law granting congressional committees access to private tax information by request. Mnuchin and the Justice Department claimed that Democrats only wanted to embarrass the president, so they refused to comply. Now the request is tied up in court."}
{"original": "It's hypocritical for the Treasury Department to stonewall Democrats' request while granting Republicans access to material on Hunter Biden, said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. He said it's hard to see what legislative purpose Republicans are after with regard to Hunter Biden."}
{"original": "For [Treasury] to go willy-nilly handing out financial information of private citizens… is simply outrageous, Rosenthal said."}
{"original": "Alex Wong via Getty Images Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is one of the Senate leaders who has requested information about Hunter Biden from the Treasury Department."}
{"original": "A spokesman for Grassley wouldn't say if the Finance Committee is also seeking Biden's tax returns. The committee generally doesn't disclose whether it has sought someone's private tax information; Grassley has used the tax disclosure law to obtain the returns of tax-exempt organizations, such as nonprofit hospitals, and to investigate ACORN, an organization that registered low-income voters, who tend to be Democrats."}
{"original": "The Treasury Department declined to comment."}
{"original": "CORRECTION: This article previously misidentified Wyden's party affiliation."}
{"original": "In 2018, the Trump administration estimated opening Alaska's pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development would generate $1.8 billion in federal revenue over a decade. Independent analysts dismissed that economic outlook as, among other things, a pipe dream."}
{"original": "On Wednesday afternoon, as pro-Trump extremists violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in a naked attempt to subvert American democracy, the Trump administration held its long-anticipated, highly controversial Arctic refuge lease sale."}
{"original": "Just three entities — two small oil companies and an Alaska state-owned economic development corporation ― bid on roughly half of the 1.09 million acres up for grabs. The sale generated a measly $14.4 million, less than 1% of the administration's total revenue estimates. That's an average of $27 per acre, only slightly above the $25 minimum bid price."}
{"original": "The state agency, the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, placed the top bid on all but two of the 11 tracts that received bids. The revenues from the leases, if ultimately approved, will be split 50/50 between the federal government and the state of Alaska."}
{"original": "Much as the rioting in D.C. on Wednesday capped Trump's long record of inciting political violence, the lease sale is a fitting finale for the administration's anti-conservation legacy. Trump and his team have spent four years bending over backward for fossil fuel and other extractive industries, with little concern for how its energy dominance agenda will impact the climate and wildlife."}
{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS An airplane flies over caribou from the Porcupine Caribou Herd on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Alaska."}
{"original": "Trump and his team have made greenlighting oil drilling in the Arctic refuge a top priority, despite worsening climate and biodiversity crises and warnings from scientists, environmentalists and a bipartisan group of former Interior Department officials that doing so would forever spoil one of the nation's last true wilderness areas."}
{"original": "The refuge, often described as America's Serengeti, covers more than 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska. It is home to polar bears, caribou, moose and hundreds of species of migratory birds. For decades, Republicans and energy companies have been trying to gain access to the oil beneath the refuge's coastal plain, known as the 1002 Area."}
{"original": "The GOP tax law passed by Congress in late 2017 included a provision, introduced by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), requiring the Interior Department to approve at least two lease sales for drilling — each covering no less than 400,000 acres. Since then, the Trump administration has been in a race to approve leases, at times ignoring and altering career scientists' work in an effort to downplay the potential environmental impacts, as Politico reported in 2019."}
{"original": "Jenny Rowland-Shea, a senior public lands policy analyst at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said Wednesday's auction is the logical conclusion to this completely flawed effort: a massive failure."}
{"original": "The process of getting to this lease sale has been nothing short of a sham and all eyes should be on a robust antitrust review, she said in a statement. Either the courts, President-elect Biden, or the new Congress should have no problem rejecting these bids."}
{"original": "Autumn Hanna, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, called it a bust for taxpayers."}
{"original": "Holding this lease sale at the 11th hour of this Administration, during the pandemic when oil demand is low and prices in flux, all but doomed this already questionable sale from the start, she said. Now taxpayers will have to deal with the fallout."}
{"original": "The eleventh-hour lease sale comes less than two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden assumes office. Biden has repeatedly vowed to block oil drilling in the refuge, although active leases are likely to prove difficult to revoke."}

He made more than $5 million in 2015, once his bonus was taken into account, according to tax documents cited by the Washington Post.)"}
{"original": "The elites don't care not one whit about America's school system and school children, he said. If they truly cared, what they would do is they would protect them.

{"original": "The political outlook for President-elect Joseph Biden's first term changed dramatically this week when victory in two Georgia special elections gave Democrats 50 senators. With Vice President-elect Kamala Harris available to decide tie votes, the result means that Democrats will have control of the chamber."}
{"original": "For the first time in a decade, a Democratic Congress will be able to pass laws that a Democratic president can sign. And although Senate Republicans can still wield the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to overcome, Democrats can approve bills through reconciliation, under which legislation can pass the Senate with a simple majority vote."}
{"original": "In principle, Democrats can enact a significant portion of their agenda that way. One reason is that reconciliation is tied to the budget process, and Congress never actually passed a budget last year. The new Congress could take advantage of that by quickly passing a reconciliation bill for the current fiscal year, still leaving opportunities to pass reconciliation bills for fiscal 2022 and 2023."}
{"original": "That's not even the full extent of legislation Democrats could possibly pass, thanks to an obscure provision of the budget process that seems to allow for revisions to previous reconciliation bills within the same fiscal year."}
{"original": "And it could all happen before the next midterms, when the Republicans will have their first chance to recapture one or both houses of Congress."}
{"original": "But reconciliation is a notoriously cumbersome and complex process, because of interlocking rules on what legislation can and cannot include. And although it's possible to alter those rules or challenge interpretations of them, doing so usually requires a series of votes from the full Senate ― and, in the best of scenarios, the assent of at least 50 senators."}
{"original": "In a practical sense, then, the ultimate limit on what Democrats can do through reconciliation isn't so much process as it is politics ― specifically, the ability of Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and incoming Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (N.Y.) to keep their caucuses united."}
{"original": "How Reconciliation Works And How It Has Evolved"}
{"original": "Reconciliation dates back to the 1970s, a time when Congress worked a lot differently than it does now. There were two budget resolutions a year, not one, and the original purpose of reconciliation was to adjust revenue or spending bills in order to reconcile them with the overall budget plan."}
{"original": "Part of why the procedures are expedited … is because the reconciliation bill was originally imagined to come between the adoption of the second budget resolution, on Sept. 15 and the start of the new fiscal year, on Oct. 1, Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, explained to HuffPost."}
{"original": "Not long afterward, Congress shifted to one budget resolution a year. But it kept reconciliation as a way to keep revenue and spending in line with the overall budget ― and to do so quickly, without the risk of delaying tactics like the filibuster."}
{"original": "That opportunity has become a lot more valuable in the past two decades, because of broader changes in American politics and the way they have distorted the lawmaking process. Use of the filibuster has soared; the two parties have grown more internally homogeneous, geographically and ideologically, making compromise more difficult."}
{"original": "Jonathan Ernst / Reuters The best known, most restrictive rules for budget reconciliation date back to the 1980s and come from the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.)."}
{"original": "In this highly polarized environment, reconciliation is the only way to pass many pieces of legislation."}
{"original": "But for legislation to pass through reconciliation, every provision must satisfy certain conditions, including several put in place by the late Robert Byrd, a Democratic senator from West Virginia who was concerned lawmakers were using reconciliation for uses too far removed from its original purpose of putting government finances in order."}
{"original": "Under the Byrd Rule, every provision of a reconciliation bill must have a direct, nonincidental impact on government finances. And the bill as a whole may not result in higher deficits once the congressional budgeting window is over. (These days, Congress uses a 10-year window, so that rule means a reconciliation bill can't lead to higher deficits at any point after 10 years.)"}
{"original": "Reconciliation bills must comply with some other rules Congress has set for itself, including pay-go requirements that require offsetting new spending with cuts or revenue, and they are subject to narrower rules like a prohibition on changes to Social Security. Historically, reconciliation has only changed mandatory spending, which refers to entitlements like Medicare and other programs that don't depend on time-limited appropriations."}
{"original": "The details and implications of these interactions are so complex that even veteran Capitol Hill aides will concede they don't understand them fully, deferring to experts and scholars who focus on congressional procedure and the budget process. And virtually every rule has its exceptions and caveats. One example: Reconciliation guidelines don't explicitly prohibit changes to nonmandatory spending, several experts told HuffPost, and in principle Congress could make such changes if it wishes."}
{"original": "Two famous uses of reconciliation in modern American history were at the hands of Republicans, which used the process to pass tax cuts in 2001 under President George W. Bush and again in 2017 under President Donald Trump. In each case, Republicans had to use accounting gimmicks and to make key policy concessions ― in particular, having tax cuts end automatically after 10 years ― in order to satisfy the requirement that bills not raise deficits outside the budget window."}
{"original": "The other high-profile use of reconciliation in recent history came in 2010, when Democrats used it to finish up their work on the Affordable Care Act. The main legislation passed the Senate through regular order, with 60 votes. But the House agreed to pass the bill, as written, only on the condition that the Senate pass an extra set of changes. That supplementary bill, which also nationalized the student loan industry, passed through reconciliation."}
{"original": "How Democrats Might Use Reconciliation Now"}
{"original": "The 2010 reconciliation vote came after a year in which President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in the Senate undertook exhaustive negotiations with Republicans, over not just health care but also an economic stimulus package and climate legislation. In fact, Democrats had deliberately kept reconciliation as a last resort for their health care bill, in the hopes they could get GOP buy-in."}
{"original": "It never happened, on health care or virtually any other bills. Republican leaders like Kentucky's Mitch McConnell, then (and about to be again) the Senate minority leader, and Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor, then the House minority whip, admitted openly that their goal was to deny Obama and his allies the veneer of bipartisanship."}
{"original": "That remained the dominant Republican posture throughout Obama's two terms, and when Republicans in 2017 seized full control of both the presidency and Congress, they didn't even bother trying bipartisanship. They went right to passing legislation through reconciliation, using it for their tax cut and their ultimately failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act."}
{"original": "Democrats seem to have learned a thing or two from that experience. They spent much of the 2020 campaign discussing how to pass legislation now that the filibuster has become a de facto supermajority requirement. Although a handful have said they would oppose ending the filibuster outright, nobody is squawking about the perils of reconciliation like many Democrats did in 2009 and 2010."}
{"original": "The questions are what parts of the Biden-Democratic agenda would make sense to push through reconciliation ― and then, when it makes sense to push them through."}
{"original": "Some parts of that agenda clearly wouldn't fit under any close reading of the rules. The most obvious example would be a voting rights bill that, however worthy, would have only the most tenuous connection to government finances. Proposals that would fit more clearly under reconciliation guidelines include large swaths of Biden's climate and health care agendas. Key elements of proposed COVID-19 relief measures, including the $2,000 relief checks, aid to state and local government and new vaccine funding, would likely fit easily into reconciliation as well."}
{"original": "The word likely is important because initial judgments on what violates the rules are left to the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan appointee who rules on the permissibility of individual elements as a judge might ― by looking at precedent and considering the nature of individual proposals. (That process is frequently called a Byrd bath, because it's connected to the Byrd rules.)"}
{"original": "And even the parliamentarian's word is not final. In practice, the way reconciliation debates work is that senators can raise objections to specific provisions, requiring rulings from the presiding officer, who typically follows the parliamentarian's counsel. Rulings of the presiding officer are, in turn, subject to votes from the full Senate."}
{"original": "Even veteran congressional aides disagree a bit over what can and can't happen during challenges, because that involves so many different rules about how budgeting works ― and, potentially, breaking traditional understandings of how Congress operates. But it's at least possible that a simple majority could get its way on what ends up in a reconciliation bill, regardless of the parliamentarian's judgment, if the will to do so exists."}
{"original": "With 50-plus-one votes in the Senate, you can shape reconciliation in any way you want, a former leadership aide now consulting with Democratic lawmakers told HuffPost."}
{"original": "Why It All Comes Down To Political Will"}
{"original": "But that really just brings the whole debate back to where it started ― that in order to pass something through reconciliation, Democrats have to keep their caucuses together. That will be a difficult task, in the House as well as the Senate, because 2020 election losses left Democrats with a majority of roughly a dozen."}
{"original": "Friday produced a preview of the tricky politics, when The Washington Post reported that the most conservative member of the Democratic Senate caucus, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, was opposed to a new COVID-19 relief measure with $2,000 checks."}
{"original": "It's more conservative Democrats like Manchin who are most likely to balk at ambitious reconciliation bills, because they typically involve spending a lot of money, increasing the size of government or, as in the case of COVID-19 checks, giving people money with no strings attached ― things that will run against the lawmakers' own policy instincts, raise suspicions in the eyes of more conservative constituents, or both."}
{"original": "Tasos Katopodis via Getty Images Getting the 50 votes necessary to pass reconciliation will not be easy, since that's how many senators belong to the Democratic caucus as of now. A big focus will be West Virginia's Joe Manchin, whose voting record is the most conservative among Democrats."}
{"original": "But after that report appeared, Manchin called back the Post to say that he was talking more about making vaccine funding a bigger priority and that he was not absolutely opposed to $2,000 checks. That could mean that even more conservative Democrats like Manchin recognize that the best way to win over voters is to show progress and enact policies that help struggling people in material ways, like speedily and simply making up for lost income during a pandemic."}
{"original": "If Manchin and similarly thinking senators can keep that in mind ― and if Democratic leaders, starting with Biden, can figure out the right way to package major legislation ― then there is real hope for major legislation in the next two years, and certainly more than seemed possible just a few days ago."}
{"original": "Ask a Democrat what Senate races worries them this year, and Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia and North Dakota will likely be near the top. All are states that Donald Trump won in 2016, and the Democratic senators seeking re-election in them have staked out moderate paths to appeal to some of their less liberal constituents."}
{"original": "But increasingly, Democrats point to another race as one they're worried about: Wisconsin. That's where Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin already has been targeted by an onslaught of outside spending from conservative groups. Party leaders say the odds remain in her favor, but they're sure not going to take the race for granted."}
{"original": "Conservative groups have so far spent at least $3.1 million against Baldwin, which is more than what all the other Democratic Senate incumbents on the ballot this year have faced combined (under $550,000), according to the Center for Responsive Politics."}
{"original": "Those figures reflect what these groups have publicly reported to the Federal Election Commission. But the Baldwin campaign has tracked the spending on ads and found there's even more money flowing into the state that aims to undercut her political fortunes. So-called dark money groups don't have to necessarily report this spending to the FEC because their efforts don't specifically call for Baldwin's defeat."}
{"original": "Nine groups have spent more than $4.7 million on ads that attack Baldwin and/or boost one of the Republicans vying to oppose her, according to her campaign's tracking (shown in the chart below)."}
{"original": "One of the groups, Freedom Partners, said it has actually spent $1.6 million on its TV and digital campaign in Wisconsin, although the Baldwin campaign has tracked only $600,000. Solutions for Wisconsin confirmed that it's spent about $100,000. The other groups either didn't return a request for comment or declined to confirm how much they've spent."}
{"original": "Aside from the outside spending, Democrats have other reasons to closely watch Wisconsin."}
{"original": "First, Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican machine he's built in the state are formidable, as Democrats have seen from past elections and legislative fights. Baldwin is one of the last standing Democrats serving statewide in Wisconsin, and the GOP desperately wants to topple her."}
{"original": "Walker is up for re-election in 2018, meaning he'll help bring out Republican voters to the polls. A slew of Democrats seek their party's nomination to defeat him, but there's still no clear frontrunner and no one doubts that Walker is formidable."}
{"original": "Scott Walker's got a great operation, a GOP campaign aide said, predicting that the Senate race will be tight. The governor has a fully formed, aggressive, well-funded effort already underway in every major voting population center in the state, and the nominee (to oppose Baldwin) will benefit from it."}
{"original": "GOP Billionaire Backers Jump In Early"}
{"original": "Democrats are still stinging from what happened in Wisconsin's 2016 Senate race. Nearly everyone ― including most Republicans ― expected Democrat Russ Feingold to retake his old seat from incumbent Republican Ron Johnson."}
{"original": "Republicans were so convinced that Johnson would be gone that the National Republican Senate Committee cancelled its plans to spend $800,000 on TV ads in the final weeks before Election Day."}
{"original": "But Johnson beat Feingold by nearly four percentage points, surpassing Trump's victory margin in the state (which was less than one point)."}
{"original": "And a big reason for Johnson's win, according to Patrick Guarasci, a Democratic political consultant based in Wisconsin, was the outside money that poured in on his behalf. Super PACs dumped millions of dollars into the race to defeat Feingold, known for the signature 2002 law restricting campaign spending that he co-sponsored with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). The Wisconsin State Journal called these contributions Johnson's secret weapon."}
{"original": "The (Republican National Committee), the Republican Senate campaign ― a lot of folks started to decrease their support for Johnson, Guarasci said. But these billionaires got together over the summer in 2016 and dumped millions of dollars into the election. No matter what, they were not going to leave Ron Johnson."}
{"original": "A big source of the money this year is coming from Dick Uihlein, a billionaire businessman who lives in Illinois but often invests heavily in Wisconsin politics. With his wife, he donated $23 million to Republicans in the 2016 cycle. This cycle, Uihlein has given at least $3.5 million to Solutions for Wisconsin, a super PAC backing Kevin Nicholson, one of the two major Republican Senate candidates. Uihlein also has donated to several other groups helping out Nicholson. Here are a couple of the pro-Nicholson ads:"}
{"original": "What's significant about Uihlein's support is that a hefty portion of his donations came before Nicholson even officially entered the race as an enticement for him to do so."}
{"original": "It's so bizarre, Guarasci said, adding, It's shocking to me that in 2017, more than a year before the election, they were already on television going after Tammy here. So that cannot be discounted, the amount of early money that is being spent to try to define Tammy in these contentious times. That is something that is almost unprecedented, in my view ― and potentially could be the new normal in some of these hot states like Wisconsin."}
{"original": "Nicholson is an untraditional GOP candidate, to say the least. Sure, he's a clean-cut veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars with degrees from Ivy League universities who expounds on conservative ideas. But he's also the former president of the national College Democrats who spoke at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. Supporters say he's a fresh face who came around to the power of conservative ideas, while detractors say he's an opportunist who can't be trusted."}
{"original": "In addition to Uihlein, Nicholson has attracted support from the Club for Growth, a group that promotes fiscal conservative policies, and Steve Bannon, the former Trump aide and current Breitbart News executive who loves to back outsiders willing to upend the establishment."}
{"original": "Tammy Baldwin has failed the people of Wisconsin on so many levels and will most certainly be defeated in November, Nicholson spokesman Brandon Moody said. Kevin Nicholson is a Marine whose commitment to public service is at his core. We're thrilled with the growing momentum, and the many conservative endorsements Kevin has received as he earns the support of voters in every corner of this great state."}
{"original": "Challenging Nicholson for the Republican nomination is Leah Vukmir, a conservative member of the state Senate who has won endorsements from powerful Wisconsin GOP politicians and praise from talk radio hosts. Vukmir is backed by Wisconsin billionaire Diane Hendricks, who also pledged her support for the state senator before she even entered the race."}
{"original": "Jess Ward, Vukmir's campaign manager, said that despite the influx of cash backing Nicholson, the candidate with the most money doesn't always win ― just look at Trump in 2016."}
{"original": "Ward also took a subtle jab at the fact that Uihlein doesn't live in Wisconsin. Leah's focus has been to run a Wisconsin-based campaign, she said. Her staff is from Wisconsin, her advisers and consultants understand Wisconsin, and that's where we're coming from."}
{"original": "Nicholson and Vukmir already have traded barbs. On Wednesday, Vukmir pressured Nicholson to disavow Bannon following reports on the one-time close Trump ally bad-mouthing the president's family in a forthcoming book. Nicholson's campaign responded by saying it was disappointing she was attacking a fellow Republican."}
{"original": "GOP campaign aides who spoke with HuffPost said that yes, a bruising fight leading up to the Aug. 14 primary worries them. It's a drain on resources, and attacks get thrown around that can then be used as ammunition in the general election battle."}
{"original": "But the outside spending helps insulate against the first concern, since donors are allowed to give unlimited amounts of cash to the super PACS targeting Baldwin. And on the second point, Republicans hope that their eventual nominee can emerge from the primary the stronger for having been tested. Party officials also succeeded in getting Nicholson and Vukmir to sign a unity pledge, with each promising to support the primary winner."}
{"original": "The dynamics of the GOP race could change if Eric Hovde, a millionaire hedge fund manager from Madison, decides to jump in. But regardless of what happens among the Republicans, there will be plenty of anti-Baldwin ads running on air."}
{"original": "It's no surprise that Tammy Baldwin is the top target of big money special interests who want Washington to keep working for them, not Wisconsin, said her campaign press secretary, Bill Neidhardt. Regardless of how much these out-of-state billionaires and right-wing groups pump into Wisconsin, people here know that Tammy Baldwin has been listening to them and not the special interests. The fact is Tammy has reached across party lines to lead 'Buy American' reforms to protect the state's economy, advocate for dairy farmers and our small towns, and lower Wisconsin families' prescription drug costs."}
{"original": "While Democrats are keeping what happened to Feingold in 2016 in mind, they're also looking back at what happened in 2012. Specifically, they're looking at Sen. Sherrod Brown's successful re-election that year."}
{"original": "The Democrat from Ohio was that cycle's biggest target of outside spending by conservatives. There are a couple of other similarities: Baldwin's fight isn't attracting quite as much attention right now as some other high-profile Senate contests, just as Brown's wasn't."}
{"original": "Brown also never abandoned his progressive populist positions, even though he was running in a battleground state. Baldwin, similarly, remains one of the Senate's most liberal members ― unlike some of her Democratic colleagues in Trump states that tend to tack more to the middle or the right."}
{"original": "The site FiveThirtyEight, which tracks how often members of Congress vote with Trump, found that Baldwin is near the bottom of that metric ― right along with Democratic senators from significantly bluer states such as Massachusetts, New York and California. And that's part of the reason she's being battered so early by so much outside spending."}
{"original": "Tammy is one of the most liberal members of the Senate in a state won barely ― but won ― by Trump, Charles Franklin, the polling director at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, said. And Walker is on the ballot for a third term. I think structurally, those were reasons for outside groups in particular to think this would be a tough battle for her."}
{"original": "But Brown showed that liberals can win in highly competitive states. The money ... spent (attacking) Sherrod Brown ― that dog didn't hunt because people knew him, Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said."}
{"original": "And Democrats expect that rather than drift to the right, Baldwin will emphasize economic populist issues that appeal to voters regardless of party, in a similar way that Brown did."}
{"original": "Baldwin often talks about manufacturing issues, and Trump has even said he supports her legislation to strengthen federal requirements that American-made products be used in certain construction projects."}
{"original": "Outside money also has come to her aid. The Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic group, has spent $1 million on TV and digital ads. Majority Forward, America Working Together and Vote Vets partnered to spend $500,000 on TV and radio spots touting her. And a few months ago, the League of Conservation Voters spent $300,000 on a TV ad thanking Baldwin for a vote protecting the Great Lakes."}
{"original": "Guarasci said that while Baldwin is a progressive champion, he views her as more in the mold of Herb Kohl, the low-key Democratic senator she replaced. Baldwin made history in winning the seat in 2012, becoming the first ― and so far only ― openly gay person elected to the Senate. (Pennsylvania Democrat Harris Wofford came out long after he lost his Senate seat in 1994.)"}
{"original": "Tammy Baldwin believes in getting shit done, Guarasci said. She believes that if you call her office, you're going to get excellent constituent relations. ... She's not a bomb thrower."}
{"original": "A number of the ads run against Baldwin have focused on the GOP tax bill. How that will play in the 2018 midterms remains to be seen, but it will no doubt be a major issue: Democrats are going to emphasize the large corporate tax cut it delivered, while Republicans will say the measure's opponents voted to oppose a middle-class tax cut and preserve a rigged system benefiting special interests."}
{"original": "When Wisconsin needed relief, Tammy Baldwin raised taxes, said Freedom Partners spokesman Bill Riggs. When Washington spent too much, Tammy Baldwin raised taxes."}
{"original": "Also likely to come up in the race is the scandal at the Veterans Affairs' medical center in Tomah, Wisconsin. Baldwin has been accused of not acting aggressively enough to address the overprescription of opioids at the facility, where the Center for Investigative Reporting has noted there have been dozens of suspicious deaths."}
{"original": "Baldwin ended up firing an aide and disciplined three others over the controversy and introduced legislation intended to address opiate drug prescriptions at the VA."}
{"original": "Whether it is her failure to help Wisconsin veterans at the Tomah VA, or her efforts to block tax cuts for Wisconsin middle-class families, Senator Baldwin has proven time and again that she is working for her radical friends in Washington, not for the people of Wisconsin, NRSC Communications Director Katie Martin said."}
{"original": "And then, of course, there's Trump and how he will factor into the midterm elections."}
{"original": "He may have eked out a win in Wisconsin in 2016, but Democrats carried it in the previous seven presidential elections. Franklin said he hasn't polled Trump's approval rating in the state since June, but it generally falls about where it is nationally ― and nationally, Trump's approval is down."}
{"original": "Midterms are historically weak for the president's party, Franklin said. And if the president's approval is as low as it looks like Trump's will be, then those are forces working for Democrats, and therefore for Baldwin."}
{"original": "This piece was updated with comment from the Nicholson campaign and details on LCV's spending."}
{"original": "CORRECTION: An earlier version incorrectly stated that Baldwin fired two aides after the Tomah scandal. She fired one and disciplined three others. It also wrongly stated that Baldwin is the last remaining Democrat serving statewide."}
{"original": "The Senate's process to impeach former President Donald Trump officially began on Monday, when the House formally delivered articles of impeachment to the upper chamber."}
{"original": "There's little debate about the central facts of the matter. Trump spent months telling his supporters the election was stolen, then on Jan. 6, riled up a mob that later stormed the U.S. Capitol to try to stop the electoral count and overturn the election results. In the House, 222 Democrats and 10 Republicans voted to impeach Trump for incitement of insurrection. Even several Senate Republicans have said what Trump did was wrong, although some argue it was not an impeachable offense."}
{"original": "But Republicans are still expected to try to stop Trump from being convicted ― not by arguing he's innocent, but by arguing it's too late."}
{"original": "Trump left office on Jan. 20, and the trial is set to begin in February. He will be the first ex-president to face such a trial."}
{"original": "Republicans have already presented what is likely to be a central argument for not convicting Trump. They argue that the Constitution does not allow for the impeachment or conviction of people who no longer hold office."}
{"original": "[T]he Senate lacks constitutional authority to conduct impeachment proceedings against a former president, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said in a statement on Jan. 13. The Founders designed the impeachment process as a way to remove officeholders from public office — not an inquest against private citizens."}
{"original": "Last week, I opposed the effort to reject certified electoral votes for the same reason — fidelity to the Constitution — I now oppose impeachment proceedings against a former president, Cotton added."}
{"original": "Why are we doing this when the president is out of office? Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said on Jan. 19. When asked if she thought such an impeachment was constitutional, she added, I don't think it is."}
{"original": "I believe an impeachment trial of a former president is unconstitutional and would set a very dangerous precedent, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) tweeted on Jan. 21. There is no provision in the Constitution for holding such a trial over a former president who is now a private citizen."}
{"original": "Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) called the constitutionality of a late Trump impeachment a serious issue on Monday, according to CNN's Manu Raju. As I look at the Constitution it says that impeachment is for removal and keeping someone from running for office again, not or, he added."}
{"original": "But this wouldn't be the first Senate impeachment trial of an official who no longer held office. While there may be disagreement among constitutional scholars on whether such a late impeachment is possible, there is precedent for such an action."}
{"original": "And as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) argued on Monday, ignoring Trump's impeachment would set a precedent of its own."}
{"original": "The theory that the Senate can't try former officials would amount to a constitutional get-out-of-jail-free card for any president who commits an impeachable offense, Schumer said."}

{"original": "Critics of late impeachment focus on three words in this section of the Constitution's impeachment clause (emphasis added): The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."}
{"original": "The question is whether the phrase, all civil Officers, means that only current and not former officials can be impeached. This is the argument that Republican senators like Cotton, Ernst and Johnson make when they reject Trump's second impeachment as not permitted by the Constitution."}
{"original": "They also argue that former officials cannot be impeached because the punishment imposed by impeachment, removal from office, has already been met by their removal from office. What is the point of impeaching a president if they no longer serve in office?"}
{"original": "The response to this argument was best made by Michigan State University Law School professor Brian Kalt in a 2001 journal article on the subject. Kalt's article was published as debate swirled around a potential late impeachment for ex-President Bill Clinton for his last-minute pardon of the tax-evading financier Marc Rich."}
{"original": "What Kalt found in the history of the debate on the subject is that the authors of the Constitution knew about late impeachment in both the United Kingdom and the United States and did not discount it at the Constitutional Convention. Additionally, a number of states adopted late impeachment into their respective state constitutions."}
{"original": "Most important, though, there is precedent for late impeachment."}
{"original": "While Kalt writes that, The arguments in favor of late impeachment have caveats and flaws, he notes that, the constitutional case for late impeachment has more strengths and fewer flaws than the case against it."}
{"original": "The fact that Congress has weighed in on and approved late impeachment in the past is perhaps the strongest evidence that late impeachment is not unconstitutional."}
{"original": "Photo by Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images Secretary of War William Belknap was impeached by the House of Representatives for corruption hours after he resigned his office in 1876."}
{"original": "On March 2, 1876, the House of Representatives voted unanimously to impeach Secretary of War William Belknap hours after President Ulysses S. Grant accepted his resignation. Belknap hurriedly resigned as a congressional probe revealed that he had accepted kickbacks through his second and third wives from a wealthy contractor whom he had awarded a military trading post. He hoped that the resignation would forestall further embarrassment and punishment. It did not."}
{"original": "The Senate trial began with a motion by Belknap's counsels for the chamber to rule on whether or not it had the jurisdiction under the Constitution. They made the same argument that Senate Republicans make today in calling the late impeachment of Trump unconstitutional."}
{"original": "Those arguments failed. The Senate fully debated every aspect of the late impeachment issue and then voted to allow it in a 37-29 vote."}
{"original": "The debate featured some arguments that will be heard soon at Trump's second impeachment trial."}
{"original": "Senators against jurisdiction appealed to the lack of any mention of former officials in the Constitution's impeachment clause and warned that late impeachment would bring about abuse whereby anyone could be impeached at any time."}
{"original": "If the Senate has jurisdiction to try one private citizen upon impeachment it has a right to try any private citizen by the same process, Sen. Simon Cameron, a Republican from Pennsylvania, argued."}
{"original": "Proponents of late impeachment countered that the lack of mention of late impeachment in the Constitution does not forbid it, the debates of the Constitutional Convention did not deny it and many states affirmed late impeachment in their own constitutions. They also argued that the punishment of impeachment in the Constitution goes beyond removal to include disqualification."}
{"original": "A sentence to disqualification is a humiliating badge affixed to high crimes and misdemeanors in office, and operates for the public safety not only by the exclusion of the criminal from office but as a warning and example to all public officers, tending to purity in office, Sen. Aaron Sargent, a Republican from California, said."}
{"original": "Such a disqualification would not only be used as the maximal punishment to prevent a corrupt official from returning to power to further engage in corrupt acts, but would act as a deterrence."}
{"original": "[T]his supreme punishment is, in my judgment, inflicted not only to get rid of a bad man in office, not only to prevent that man ever being restored to office, but chiefly, by fearful example, to teach all men that American institutions and the perpetuation of free government, of the people, by the people, and for the people, demand purity in office, Sen. Samuel Maxey, a Democrat from Texas, said."}
{"original": "The two sides also debated over the meaning of prior precedents. Belknap's late impeachment was itself not the first such late impeachment to reach the Senate."}
{"original": "In 1797, the Senate held an impeachment trial for ex-Sen. William Blount, a Federalist from Tennessee, for his role in attempting to help Great Britain seize Spanish-controlled areas in Florida and Louisiana as part of a scheme he concocted to pay off debts incurred from land speculation."}
{"original": "After his scheme was revealed, the House impeached Blount and the very next day the Senate voted to expel him. This put the Senate in the odd position of having removed Blount from office, but still on the hook for holding an impeachment trial."}
{"original": "Blount's main defense was that senators, or other members of Congress for that matter, could not be impeached, but only expelled by their respective chamber. His second defense was that, if senators could be impeached, ex-senators could not be impeached. This was both the first test of whether a member of Congress could be impeached and what is called late impeachment or impeachment of a former officer."}
{"original": "The Senate didn't ultimately vote on whether he could be impeached as a former senator. That's because it sided with him on the first point: that members of Congress cannot be impeached. That precedent continues to this day."}
{"original": "Years later, when the Senate was considering the Belknap case, opponents of late impeachment argued that the Blount case amounted to a precedent against late impeachment. Those in support of late impeachment noted that the Senate had only voted on one issue: whether members of Congress were subject to impeachment. And this issue was not the same as the constitutionality of late impeachment."}
{"original": "In the end, the Senate in 1876 voted to move forward to a trial for Belknap. When the time to vote for conviction arrived, the senators who voted to acquit largely stated their belief that the Senate did not have jurisdiction as reason for their vote. The failure to convict Belknap on a rather clear-cut case of corruption due to senators' objections to jurisdiction may muddy the meaning of it as a precedent."}
{"original": "In sum, the Belknap case provides a precedent that federal officials can be impeached and tried after they have left office, Kalt writes. Nevertheless, it is a binding precedent only to the extent that the Senate wishes to be bound."}
{"original": "OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images Rioters incited to attack the U.S. Capitol by Donald Trump to disrupt the counting of the electoral college votes clash with police."}
{"original": "Over the years, lawmakers and the public have floated the idea of late impeachment for former presidents."}
{"original": "Lawmakers dropped the existing impeachment targeting President Richard Nixon because he had apologized and publicly accepted responsibility in addition to resigning his office. In 2001, Sen. Arlen Specter, then a Republican from Pennsylvania, floated the idea of impeaching Clinton after he left office for the Rich pardon, but this went nowhere."}
{"original": "It appears that the issue of late impeachment is up to the Senate to decide upon on a case-by-case basis. Which means that Trump's unique case should be examined both on its own merits and based on the reasons why late impeachments were avoided or, in Belknap's case, accepted in the past."}
{"original": "First of all, Trump was impeached by the House on Jan. 13 while he was still in office. Belknap had resigned his seat hours before the House impeached him and the Senate still held it had jurisdiction. If anything, this puts even more weight on the constitutionality of a Senate trial for Trump's second impeachment."}
{"original": "Second, what Trump is accused of doing is far worse than any action committed by any government official who faced impeachment in the past. And most of what he did to merit impeachment is part of the public record. He lied about the potential for fraud with mail-in voting. Then when he lost he pointed to his lies about mail-in voting to falsely claim that he won the election. He then attempted to pressure state-level and local Republican officials to invalidate the election results or, in the case of Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, to find votes that would make him the winner or else face prosecution."}
{"original": "When these efforts were rebuffed, he considered purging the Department of Justice in order to install a lackey who would bring lawsuits based on lies to invalidate election results in enough states for Trump to claim victory. He ultimately did not go through with this plan."}
{"original": "Instead, he summoned his supporters to Washington for a rally on Jan. 6, the day Congress would open, count and certify the electoral college results. He lied to them again by saying that Vice President Mike Pence, as the President of the Senate, had the sole power to invalidate electoral college certificates and count others backing Trump. And then when they were gathered by the White House, he told them to march on the Capitol as the electoral college certification proceedings were underway."}
{"original": "[Y]ou'll never take back your country with weakness, he said. You have to show strength and be strong."}
{"original": "As he exhorted his supporters to march on Congress, they replied, Storm the Capitol! Chants of Fight for Trump! erupted as they overran Capitol Police officers on the steps of the Capitol. The insurrection that followed resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer, and dozens of police officers injured. Many of the insurrectionists stated at the time and upon arrest that they stormed the Capitol because Trump told them to do so."}
{"original": "In short, Trump sought to overturn an election loss, first through lying about his loss and the fairness of the election; second, by abusing his power to cajole and threaten state election officials to overturn the election; and third, by directing a violent mob to attack the Capitol to stop the certification of the election results that was happening at that moment."}
{"original": "These actions occurred because Trump's time in office was running out. He had lost the election, but the extended lame-duck period from November to January enabled him to attempt to overturn the election result and install himself in office as an unelected ruler. Stating that he cannot be impeached because he committed these acts so close to his departure from office looks like a greenlight for any future president to try this again."}
{"original": "During the debate in Belknap's trial on whether or not the Senate had jurisdiction, Sen. Thomas Norwood, a Democrat from Georgia, noted such a situation as the absurd logic of forbidding late impeachments."}
{"original": "If the authors of the Constitution intended to forbid late impeachment then, Norwood said, it would seem that the people of the United States, instead of devising a wise and certain and speedy method of getting rid of public offenders and remaining rid of them, and making examples of them as a terror to evil-doers in high places, were engaged in a game of thimble-rigging with the most dangerous of all criminals, and permitting the criminals to play the game."}
{"original": "Removal itself doesn't right the wrong, Norwood argued: The offender is removed, out of office, and cannot be disqualified, cannot be impeached, even though as President of the United States he had committed treason!"}
{"original": "The Senate now has the opportunity to determine whether the Constitution permits such acts to go unpunished or not."}
{"original": "Carlos Barria / Reuters Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett's father worked for Shell during most of her childhood and well into her adulthood."}
{"original": "Amy Coney Barrett was about 6 years old when her father, Michael Coney, began his 29-year career as one of Royal Dutch Shell's top attorneys. She was 16 in 1988 when the oil giant's own scientists prepared a confidential internal memo stating: The main cause of increasing CO2 concentrations is considered to be fossil fuel burning."}
{"original": "On Tuesday, the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the city of Baltimore's lawsuit against Shell, BP and several other oil companies demanding damages for the effects of climate change. And it's unclear whether Barrett, the newest justice on the high court's bench, will recuse herself from the case."}
{"original": "Justice Samuel Alito, who owns stock in several oil and gas companies, has already recused himself, documents filed with the court show. As of Thursday evening, nothing indicated that Barrett planned to do the same."}
{"original": "Cases involving Shell raised obvious conflicts of interest for the judge in the past. A recusal list Barrett submitted as part of her job on the bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit listed Shell seven times."}
{"original": "My father worked at Shell Oil Company for many years, and while on the Seventh Circuit, in an abundance of caution, I have recused myself from cases involving those Shell entities with which he was involved, she wrote in an answer to a questionnaire during her Senate confirmation hearings in October on her Supreme Court nomination by President Donald Trump."}
{"original": "Legal experts said Barrett's father, who now works as a Catholic deacon in Louisiana, could be called for deposition as part of the case."}
{"original": "He oversaw legal issues for Shell's offshore drilling arm. The 91-page memo collating what Shell's scientists knew about climate change in the late 1980s included the impact of warming on the company's offshore installations, coastal facilities and operation, issues well within the elder Coney's purview."}
{"original": "Her dad's role in maximizing Shell's net revenue from drilling grew even as Shell's internal documents show it knew burning carbon was changing our climate and he even sought tax benefits from its efforts to adapt its drilling platforms to survive sea level rise and bigger storms resulting from climate change, said Lisa Graves, executive director of the research company True North Research and a former chief counsel for nominations on the Senate Judiciary Committee."}
{"original": "TOLGA AKMEN via Getty Images A climate activist sprays graffiti on the entrance to the Shell's British offices."}

He spent more than 20 years as an active member of The American Petroleum Institute Subcommittee of Exploration and Production Law and twice served as its chairman, according to a biography on his former law firm's website. API, the nation's largest and most influential oil and gas lobby, filed an amicus brief supporting the oil companies in the Baltimore case."}
{"original": "It is entirely possible that Justice Barrett's father could be a witness at a later point in this case, said Marco Simons, the general counsel at the environmental legal nonprofit EarthRights International. It sure creates a very problematic appearance that she is very close to the facts of this case, and in most cases that would lead a judge to recuse."}
{"original": "The Baltimore case is one of the most closely watched attempts by a city or state to force companies that spent decades funding misinformation on climate science that internal documents show their own researchers understood to pay for the destruction unchecked warming caused."}
{"original": "Maryland's largest city, which has been suffering extended heat waves and coastal flooding as a result of warming that's already underway, has asked the Supreme Court to refer its lawsuit seeking damages back to a state court. Lawyers representing the oil giants named in the litigation want the high court to keep the case in federal court, where they expect to more easily fend off the allegations."}

{"original": "Barrett's own views on climate science remain opaque. During her contentious confirmation hearings last fall, she repeatedly said she was not a scientist and therefore did not have firm views on warming. She called the issue a very contentious matter of public debate and politically controversial."}

{"original": "Pensacola got hit with a tornado last week, an event which raises a question: Was moving eight months ago to a place with great beaches and no state income tax a mistake?"}
{"original": "Surely that's a question which must have occurred to someone. After all, a tornado that squashed an apartment building, uprooted trees and damaged homes is not something anyone wanted or expected. The last time a tornado touched down in Pensacola before this year was in 1988, a time when Michael Dukakis ran for president and a postage stamp cost 22 cents."}
{"original": "The tornado missed our house by a few miles. A shift in the weather patterns might have produced a radically different outcome. We could be among the people shivering in the night. As the old Phil Ochs' song explains, there but for fortune go you or I."}

{"original": ". My wife wanted warmth but also seasons and civilization. A toasty beach near the equator was out, but a home in northern Florida could work for us both."}
{"original": "We started visiting places and doing research. We discovered that Pensacola was roughly 18 degrees warmer than DC in the winter - and only two degrees warmer on average in the summer. The city is 136 miles from the nearest nuclear generating plant and the last local earthquake took place in 1781. The beach is immaculate, the seasons are mild and there's something else: unlike many coastal Florida towns, Pensacola has a good elevation. The city is generally 55 feet above sea level compared with just a few feet for Miami or Naples."}
{"original": "According to WalletHub, Pensacola is one of the best places to live in the US; it ranks 52 on a list of 1,268 best and worst small cities -- Princeton is first. There's no state income tax and housing is perhaps a half or maybe a third of what homes cost in high-priced metro areas."}
{"original": "Unemployment is lower than in the US generally. Two people with reasonable jobs can readily afford a mortgage - and the home they can buy here is just a few minutes from one of the ten best beaches in the US according to Trip Advisor. Plus, that house won't be far from a terrific downtown that's centered on one of the ten best streets in the country according to the American Planning Association."}
{"original": "But what about that tornado? Doesn't it change everything?"}
{"original": "If Pensacola had tornadoes every few years and other places had objectively better weather than the local climate would be an issue, but have you watched the news lately? Yes, Pensacola had tornadoes this month for the first time in three decades but there was no Superstorm Sandy, 50,000 acres weren't on fire, and there's surely no drought."}
{"original": "reports that because of the storm last week there were 44 destroyed structures, 241 with major damage and 87 with minor damage. For context, in January there were 3,063 area homes listed for sale according to PAR, the"}

{"original": "The tornado struck with 155 MPH winds and surgical precision. While one townhouse cluster along the Escambia Bay was demolished, a cluster next door was relatively untouched. Where one area saw massive destruction neighboring homes had only minor and superficial damage. As these things go, it could have been far worse. At our house, amazingly, the lights didn't even flicker."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, in Pensacola the earth does not shake, massive fires are not a problem, the streets aren't flooding every day, drought is not an issue, there's no nearby fracking, the air is fresh, and nobody worries about three feet of snow."}
{"original": "The truth is that no place is perfect. Pensacola - like every community - has blemishes and imperfections, but there's a grace, friendliness, and gentility here that we have come to admire."}
{"original": "Moreover, this is a city where a lot of things work. When the tornado hit emergency crews were instantly on the scene, shelters were opened, donations were made, volunteers were everywhere, and people were helped. In the middle of brutal weather the police were out closing roads, one reason there were no fatalities. At one relief center 35,000 pounds of food and other goods were donated."}
{"original": "It's easy to get new car licenses here and at the same time you can register to vote. From our house it's about ten minutes to downtown and the international airport is just a few minutes away. The chain stores you have are pretty much the chain stores we have and Pensacolians have access to the very same Internet as everyone else."}
{"original": "Of course, there are also special attractions which make the area unique. There are more than 50 miles of immaculate beaches with crunchy white sand. The Blue Angels and the amazing National Naval Aviation Museum are here, as well as our historic places (Pensacola was discovered by the Spanish in 1559).

{"original": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) accused House Democrats of trying to swing elections with a major piece of legislation designed to clean up voting and campaign finance and strengthen government ethics."}
{"original": "McConnell described the so-called For the People Act as a power grab and a naked attempt to change the rules of American politics to benefit one party in a Thursday op-ed for The Washington Post."}
{"original": "The top Republican criticized Democrats for introducing the bill, also known as HR1, while the longest-ever partial government shutdown continues."}
{"original": "House Democrats won't come to the table and negotiate to reopen the government, but they've been hard at work angling for more control over what you can say about them and how they get reelected, McConnell wrote."}

{"original": "The act, the first major bill House Democrats have introduced to the 116th Congress, contains a package of reforms that aim to make voting more accessible, force President Donald Trump (and future presidential candidates) to release their tax returns and take power away from big political donors by incentivizing smaller donations and by requiring super PACs to make their private donors public."}
{"original": "The bill also aims to make Election Day a paid holiday for federal workers, which McConnell dismissed as a generous new benefit for federal bureaucrats. In theory, that proposal would encourage private businesses to also make Election Day a holiday, allowing more people to get to the polls."}
{"original": "McConnell also suggested that making private donors public was an attack on free speech."}
{"original": "Apparently the Democrats define 'democracy' as giving Washington a clearer view of whom to intimidate and leaving citizens more vulnerable to public harassment over private views, McConnell wrote."}
{"original": "The Republican also took issue with the bill's ban on removing people from voter rolls for not voting in a previous election, as well as a ban on voter caging, a practice in which election officials send non-forwardable mail to addresses on the voter rolls, then remove anyone whose mail is returned to sender."}
{"original": "McConnell pointed to a mistake made in California that led to 23,000 voters being registered incorrectly, with errors including wrong party preferences."}
{"original": "However, linking that part of the bill to the mishap in California is misleading, according to HuffPost's voting rights reporter Sam Levine."}
{"original": "It was an issue with software, and the head of the DMV resigned, Levine noted on Twitter. For context, there are over 19.6 million registered voters in CA. Automatic registration added 727,924 people to the rolls since launch in April."}

{"original": "With tax season upon us, many are wondering how to get the biggest bang for each buck of our refund. Save it for a rainy day? Take that trip your family's been talking about? The list goes on. It's one of the few times each year that we find ourselves check-in-hand and uncertain of how it would be best spent. Sound familiar? If so, consider investing that refund back into your career! Studies show a strong correlation between job satisfaction and overall happiness, so every dollar invested in furthering your career is a dollar well spent all-around."}
{"original": "Here are eight ways to get that refund working for you:"}
{"original": "1. Take an online course for a specific skill."}
{"original": "This doesn't mean you have to shell out thousands of dollars or return to school full-time. These days, there are tons of online courses available, many of which are free or low in cost. If there's a particular skill set that is well-regarded in your line of work but absent from your resume, now is the time to add it. Whether it's a technical skill (e.g. software, statistics) or a soft skill (e.g. management, leadership), learning a new skill can boost your confidence, impress prospective employers and command a higher salary. Don't forget to add it to your resume."}
{"original": "2. Attend an industry training or trade conference."}
{"original": "Whether you work in a common industry (e.g. healthcare, finance), or one that is a bit more obscure (say, underwater hospitality), nearly all industries have trade conferences, expos, trainings, and other events where you can network, pitch, sell and brush up on your field-specific knowledge. For just the cost of registration (and maybe associated travel), you'll meet prospective clients, business partners and mentors. Plus, you'll learn what's brand spankin' new in the industry, which you can leverage in the name of a promotion."}
{"original": "3. Buy a modern, well-fitting suit."}
{"original": "We don't advocate blowing through your entire refund check on all the latest fashions, but there is one item of clothing that is a must in every professional's closet: a modern, industry-appropriate, well-fitting and comfortable suit. Even if you don't believe that style matters in your particular line of work, a sharp suit can make a strong impression and boost your self-confidence at the next interview, business meeting or networking event. Have at least one neutral-colored, clean and pressed suit, ready to roll at all times. You never know when the next opportunity will arise."}
{"original": "Consider the benefits of hiring a professional coach. If you feel stagnated, confused about next steps, or exhausted by the job search, an experienced coach can help breathe new life into your work ambitions. A good coach can beef up your resume and LinkedIn profile, boost your networking presence, prep you for challenging interviews, and teach you critical negotiation techniques. Securing a successful job transition can be difficult (whether we're talking a promotion, a new job or a whole new field). The money you invest in a career coach is likely to come back to you tenfold in the form of higher pay and greater fulfillment."}
{"original": "5. Upgrade your professional tool belt."}
{"original": "Sharpen your competitive edge by ensuring that your professional tools are top-notch. Whether you're an accountant who depends on complex software or an artist ready to try a different canvas, the advice is the same. New products and materials are constantly hitting the market, increasing efficiency and pushing the limits of creativity. Do your research and purchase the best equipment your trade has to offer. Armed with the right hardware, software and supplies… you'll be unstoppable."}
{"original": "Your time, money and connections are your three most valuable career-related resources. Yet, with so much going on in your life, it probably seems hard to keep track of any of them, doesn't it? Lucky for us, there are apps out there to help you do just that. Use your computer, tablet and/or smartphone to access applications that mange your money, schedule your time and organize your networks. You can find To-Do lists for your tasks and deadlines, sophisticated calendars that help structure your schedule, expenditure trackers for your finances and phone books that re-arrange your contacts by job title and other helpful networking categories. Flip through the demos, read the reviews and then buy one or two to get you started."}
{"original": "7. Take your colleagues to lunch."}
{"original": "Part of what makes a job satisfying, is the feeling of community that one gets from their team. So, whether you currently have a group of co-workers that you feel grateful for, or want to make a friend or two to talk shop with, treating a few folks to lunch is a great way to foster some business bonding. Take them to that little bistro you like so much, or just have a few pizza pies delivered to the office during lunchtime. It can help to offset the daily stresses of hard work and foster communication between you and your comrades."}
{"original": "Statistics show that employees who decorate their work space are more productive than their counterparts. So, think about what gets you motivated and make sure your space reflects those stimulating sounds, sights and scents that keep your spirits at their highest. Paint your home office a warm color, spruce up your cubicle with colorful flowers or keep soothing oils in the car for your days out in the field."}
{"original": "Too often people spend their refund check on impulsive purchases, only to find that the clothes quickly go out of style or the gadget is obsolete a few months later. Your refund check can be so much more useful for your career and general life satisfaction. Take a moment to assess your professional trajectory—everything from your office desk to your industry skill set, from your business suit to your networking opportunities—and find the best way to invest the money in yourself. You'll reap those career benefits for a lifetime."}

{"original": "The Trump administration recalled thousands of furloughed Internal Revenue Service employees last week to process tax refunds despite the government shutdown. However, many staffers are reportedly skipping work, which could mean a delay."}
{"original": "According to The Washington Post, hundreds of IRS employees have been granted absences due to financial hardship, and their union said that an organized protest could cause even more workers to stay home."}
{"original": "With the shutdown dragging into its second month, National Treasury Employees Union President Tony Reardon demanded that the government figure out a way to help the IRS workers."}
{"original": "Federal employees are about to miss their second paycheck and they are growing increasingly desperate, Reardon said in a statement on Tuesday. The suffering of thousands of middle-class working families has to end, and it has to end now."}

{"original": "Wilson Ring/The Associated Press A tourist from New York City visits the Alchemist brewery in Stowe, Vermont. Vermont is trying to tempt tourists into becoming residents, part of an economic development strategy focused on luring new workers, rather than businesses."}
{"original": "For decades, cities and states have tried to create jobs and boost their economies by luring out-of-state employers. Now some areas are trying to attract workers — one worker at a time."}
{"original": "Starting in January, programs in Vermont and Tulsa, Oklahoma, will pay people to relocate to those places if they work remotely. Other resident recruitment strategies in Florida, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota and Vermont include weekends that tempt tourists to stay, discounted rent, student loan assistance and free land."}
{"original": "It's a departure — very much a sharp departure from Vermont's traditional programs, said Joan Goldstein, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Economic Development. We need people."}
{"original": "The shift in strategy marks a recognition that as fewer people are tethered to brick-and-mortar offices, state and local officials can reap the benefits of workers' spending and taxes no matter where their employers are based."}
{"original": "You need the people to get the businesses to come, and a lot of small places are immediately out of the running because the people aren't there. It feeds on itself, said Doug Farquhar, program director for rural development with the National Conference of State Legislatures."}
{"original": "Farquhar sees pay to move as somewhat of a desperate plea: We need educated people to come here and stay here. He cautions that little research has been done on the effectiveness or sustainability of the strategy. And in Vermont, some advocates for the poor have criticized state officials for luring tech bros to gentrify our communities."}
{"original": "But in a state that is desperate for more people — Vermont has about 620,000 residents, with about 45 percent of them retired or about to retire — officials are willing to give it a try."}
{"original": "The original idea was to give incentives to out-of-state companies to find people who want to live here, said Democratic state Sen. Michael Sirotkin, chairman of the economic development committee. We decided to give the money to the workers and let them find their jobs."}
{"original": "Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, signed the Remote Worker Grant Program last May. The legislature provided $500,000 over three years to reimburse expenses of remote workers from other states who relocate."}
{"original": "Each worker can receive up to $10,000 in grants over two years. Eligible expenses include computer software and hardware, internet access and membership in a coworking space."}
{"original": "Tulsa also is focusing on remote workers. Tulsa Remote will pay workers who pass a stringent online screening process and live in Tulsa for a year $10,000 in cash installments. Workers also will receive free membership in a coworking space and housing discounts. The pilot project is funded and administered by the private George Kaiser Family Foundation. No public funds are involved."}
{"original": "Tulsa's population, about 400,000, has been flat for decades. The foundation was looking for ways to attract new talent to the city, said Ken Levit, executive director of the Kaiser foundation. The foundation has already brought 50 artists and writers to Tulsa for a year or more through the Tulsa Artist Fellowship, which pays stipends and provides free rent."}
{"original": "There's no fixed budget for Tulsa Remote, Levit said. For now, it's a one-year pilot program, but the overwhelming response means it could be extended, he said. More than 8,000 people have completed lengthy online applications."}
{"original": "Ben Winchester, a rural demographer at the University of Minnesota Extension Center for Community Vitality, said people who leave small towns to attend college often want to return to their hometowns when they reach their 30s and 40s. For many of them, the challenge is finding a house."}
{"original": "That challenge led to a program in Harmony, Minnesota, a town of 1,080 that endured a years-long halt in construction during the Great Recession. In 2014, the local economic development authority started offering incentives of $5,000 to $12,000 to build houses, depending on the expected taxable value of the building."}
{"original": "Harmony Mayor Steve Donney acknowledged that the program was very slow to take off. So far, the town has paid out about $62,750 and has committed to paying out another $20,000 for eight buildings. This year, for the first time, the town has collected some new property tax revenue — about $2,200."}
{"original": "I'm a 100 percent believer in the project. So far, it's working, Donney said. It has encouraged people to build, and new people are a bonus."}
{"original": "One of my questions as mayor is, 'When do we stop this?' Donney said. But, he said, other members of the local economic development authority respond, Why would we stop this?"}
{"original": "Marquette, in central Kansas, also turned to housing incentives after failing to attract businesses."}
{"original": "Every town is looking to bring in jobs to their small town. You might as well beat your head against a wall, said Steve Piper, the former longtime mayor. We took the opposite approach. We thought: Bring the people and tell them to find their own job. Marquette is within commuting distance of the larger cities of Salina, McPherson and Hutchinson."}
{"original": "But Marquette, population 650, had no buildable lots, so the local economic development commission bought 50 acres in 2002 and started giving lots away. The modern-day homesteading story made national news, and hundreds of people contacted the town."}
{"original": "It helped. A lot of people are looking for a little Mayberry, Piper said, referring to the quaint fictional town that was the setting for the Andy Griffith Show."}
{"original": "About 30 homes have been built in the Westridge Addition area, almost all by people from out of state, and two newcomers started small businesses in town, Piper said. We still have land to give away, so that's good."}
{"original": "Student loan assistance programs, modeled on incentives for medical personnel, teachers and lawyers, may be a more promising strategy for rural areas to grow population, Farquhar said."}
{"original": "Two years ago, Maine expanded a tax credit that had been limited to graduates of in-state schools to graduates of out-of-state schools who live and work in Maine."}
{"original": "The new Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, promised in her campaign to simplify the complicated tax credit system and to invest in a Rural Return Scholarship to give young people from rural Maine incentives to return to their hometowns."}
{"original": "In Michigan, the Community Foundation in St. Clair County, about an hour north of Detroit, joined nearby counties to start the Come Home Award, a reverse scholarship that pays up to $15,000 over three years to help graduates pay off student loans."}
{"original": "The foundation historically gives out about $300,000 a year in traditional scholarships. But donors said, We're just paying young people to leave, said Randy Maiers, the foundation's executive director. We wanted to do something different."}
{"original": "Since 2016, only 13 of the more than 50 applicants have been approved, almost all with recent STEAM degrees — science, technology, engineering, the arts and math. The ideal candidate is someone who has met someone and wants to settle down and move back home, Maiers said."}
{"original": "About $45,000 is currently available for the awards, but Maiers warned, Don't tell us you're going to live with mom and dad or 'I really don't know what I want to do.' This is not for everybody."}
{"original": "States and localities also are looking to turn visitors into residents. Vermont hopes more young professionals and working families among its 13 million tourists a year will relocate, while Tallahassee is reaching out to baby boomers nearing retirement."}
{"original": "Announcing the Stay-to-Stay initiative in March, Vermont's governor said, We have about 16,000 fewer workers than we did in 2009. That's why expanding our workforce is one of the top priorities of my administration."}
{"original": "Four Vermont communities have sponsored Stay-to-Stay weekends. After a Friday night welcome reception with local leaders, tourists explore the area on their own before meeting Monday morning with entrepreneurs, realtors and potential employers. The Vermont tourism and marketing department is collaborating with local chambers of commerce and young professionals groups on the initiative."}
{"original": "We literally put on white-glove service, Tourism and Marketing Commissioner Wendy Knight said. So far, four people have relocated."}
{"original": "One is Jacqueline Posley, a 23-year-old from Mississippi. A recent graduate of Mississippi State University, Posley was working in an office in Starkville when she decided she wanted to live somewhere cold and liberal."}
{"original": "Posley and her then-fiance came to a Stay-to-Stay weekend. Her first day back at work in Starkville, she gave notice, and moved to Vermont in September. Her ex-fiance moved to New Hampshire."}
{"original": "But Posley's story also illustrates some of the challenges that Vermont faces, such as attracting people of color and helping them feel at home. She is African-American, and Vermont is 93 percent white."}
{"original": "The Vermont tourism department highlights the state's status as the first to abolish slavery and promotes a trail of African-American historic sites. And the website iamavermonter.org helps people of color connect and tell their stories about moving to and living in Vermont."}
{"original": "Posley found a job as a night auditor working the overnight shift at a ski resort, where she balances the day's income and expenses and handles the front desk. But she hasn't settled in yet. She finds Vermont's housing costs higher than Mississippi's, and her job pays less than what she made there. She loves seeing the stars at night — but not the 40-minute drive to the laundromat."}
{"original": "And Vermonters are less welcoming than she expected. Someone in a Walmart parking lot yelled at her to go back to where she came from, making her realize that Vermont is not the liberal utopia it's portrayed as."}
{"original": "I know Vermont wants new people, Posley said. They say they want millennials — but I'm a millennial and I'm not willing to commit long term."}
{"original": "These days, she's thinking about San Diego."}
{"original": "The White House's budget director justified proposed cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting by saying that it's not fair to ask a single mom in Detroit or a coal miner to pay for it."}
{"original": "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting funds PBS, which airs Sesame Street and other children's shows. President Donald Trump's federal budget plan, released on Thursday morning, proposes axing federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as well as the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities."}
{"original": "When you start looking at places that we reduce spending, one of the questions we asked was can we really continue to ask a coal miner in West Virginia or a single mom in Detroit to pay for these programs? The answer was no, Mick Mulvaney told MSNBC's Morning Joe on Thursday. We can ask them to pay for defense, and we will, but we can't ask them to continue to pay for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting."}
{"original": "Sesame Street partnered with HBO last year after years of financial struggles. While new episodes first air on the premium cable network, PBS still airs reruns that viewers can watch for free."}
{"original": "The Trump administration plans to increase military spending by $54 billion. In comparison, the CPB receives less than $500 million per year from the federal government."}
{"original": "The notion that people's tax dollars shouldn't be spent on programs they don't use is confusing enough; by that logic, the taxes from people without children wouldn't go toward public schools and people who drive to work wouldn't pay for public transportation. But Mulvaney's comment is especially bizarre considering Sesame Street's viewership: parents and their children."}
{"original": "CPB, which supports NPR and PBS, currently receives about $485 million per year, according to The Washington Post. As it rolled out its budget this week, the Trump administration was unequivocal about its plans to end federal support for CPB as part of a number of steep cuts to pay for an increase in defense spending."}
{"original": "We proposed ending funding, but technically what you'll see—it's an elimination—but you'll see an amount of money in the budget, and it is some amount of money that's necessary for us to unwind our involvement with CPB, Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters on Wednesday. So you won't see a zero next to it, but the policy is that we're ending federal involvement with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting."}
{"original": "Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of CPB, said in a statement that the elimination of federal funds would be devastating."}
{"original": "There is no viable substitute for federal funding that ensures Americans have universal access to public media's educational and informational programming and services, Harrison said. The elimination of federal funding to CPB would initially devastate and ultimately destroy public media's role in early childhood education, public safety, connecting citizens to our history, and promoting civil discussions – all for Americans in both rural and urban communities."}
{"original": "Public media is one of America's best investments. At approximately $1.35 per citizen per year, it pays huge dividends to every American, she continued."}
{"original": "Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was chastised during the 2012 election for proposing cutting PBS' funding."}
{"original": "Trump could fund CPB, which was created as a nonprofit by Congress in 1967, for 121 years with the $54 billion he is seeking to increase military spending, according to The Washington Post."}
{"original": "NEW LONDON, N.H. — Republican voters who would rather have someone other than incumbent President Donald Trump as their presidential nominee this November are down to a single choice."}
{"original": "It's not good for the United States, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld said about the Trump presidency to the couple of dozen voters who had trekked across the slick roads to hear him at the New London library. He said Trump suffers from insecurity or possibly instability. That's why he seeks this total power."}
{"original": "The other remaining Trump challenger, former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh, announced earlier Friday that he was ending his campaign just four days prior to the New Hampshire primary."}
{"original": "Walsh said Friday it became clear that no one can beat Trump from within the Republican Party when Trump supporters he spoke to insisted that Trump never lied and this critics are all traitors. It slapped me hard in Iowa. It's his party, and it's not a party I belong to. It's a cult, he said, adding that he will continue working to defeat Trump. I would rather have Bernie Sanders as president as Donald Trump. That's not even a close call."}
{"original": "Walsh won 348 votes in the Republican Iowa caucuses, while Weld won 424. Trump won 31,422 — just over 97% of all of those cast, according to the Republican Party of Iowa."}
{"original": "Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman, dropped out in November after only being in the race for two months."}
{"original": "Sanford and Walsh had come at the race from opposite directions. While both said they believed Trump was unfit for the office, Walsh essentially made that the sole rationale for his run, while Sanford stuck almost exclusively to his concerns about the rapidly increasing federal budget deficit and avoided criticizing Trump's character or leadership style."}
{"original": "S.V. Date/HuffPost Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld speaks to voters at the New London, New Hampshire, public library on Friday ahead of Tuesday's primary. Weld is the last remaining challenger to President Donald Trump for the 2020 GOP nomination."}
{"original": "Weld has used a blend of both. During Trump's impeachment proceedings, Weld from the beginning argued that Trump should be removed from office for trying to coerce Ukraine into boosting his reelection campaign by investigating the Democratic candidate he most feared. But Weld also tries to appeal to traditional moderate Republicans by pointing to his record of tax cuts and balanced budgets in Massachusetts while arguing that Republicans need to take climate change seriously and to embrace immigration."}
{"original": "Weld has also spent the bulk of his yearlong campaign on the trail in New Hampshire, hoping to use a better than expected result here to translate into wins in later states."}
{"original": "A New Hampshire-centric strategy was previously used by Pat Buchanan in 1992, who wound up winning 37% of the vote against then-President George H.W. Bush. He still lost by 15 points, and Bush essentially snuffed out Buchanan's campaign with a strong win in South Carolina, but the incumbent's appearance of weakness led to the independent candidacy of billionaire Ross Perot and, ultimately, the election of Democrat Bill Clinton."}
{"original": "Recent polling, though, shows a Buchanan-like showing is not likely. In polling from last month, Weld got no more than 9 percentage points in three surveys, with Trump scoring in the mid-80s. (Walsh got no more than 2% in any of them.)"}
{"original": "What's more, the trajectory of the modern GOP has been to embrace the white Christian nativism that Buchanan pitched that year — he famously declared a culture war at that summer's nominating convention — over the northeastern, pro-business wing of the party that Weld represents."}
{"original": "The best chances for Weld and others also lay in the possibility that a major scandal or an impeachment effort would damage Trump's standing within the party enough that a critical mass of Republicans would seek an alternative heading into the 2020 election. But the report of special counsel Robert Mueller into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia and the president's attempts to stifle the investigation came and went without much erosion in Trump's GOP support. And while the subsequent Ukraine scandal hurt Trump with Democrats and independents, Republican voters nevertheless stuck with him."}
{"original": "The long odds notwithstanding, Weld appeared to have won over some fans."}
{"original": "You are fighting an uphill battle, and I want to thank you, said John McSheffrey, a 52-year-old owner of a firefighting supply company. I changed my registration from Democrat to unenrolled so I could vote for you."}
{"original": "May you increase and multiply, Weld said, laughing."}
{"original": "Trump is scheduled to hold a campaign rally in Manchester on Monday, the evening before the primary, and his campaign announced a roster of surrogates who would come to the state on Tuesday, including his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. and campaign manager Brad Parscale."}

{"original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) delivered a rebuttal to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday with a 30-minute speech that meticulously picked apart what Trump got wrong and the things he felt the president had failed to mention."}
{"original": "I hate to say this, but not everything Donald Trump said tonight was true or accurate, Sanders said at the top of his speech after offering his congratulations to Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams, who delivered the Democratic rebuttal."}

{"original": "Sanders criticized the president for boasting about the booming economy, noting that only the wealthy were benefiting from the administration's economic policies and tax cuts."}
{"original": "For many of President Trump's billionaire friends, the truth is, they have never, ever had it so good, he said. But for the middle class and the working families of our country, the truth is that the economy is not so great."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives easily enacted a set of rules on Thursday that included pay-go budget limits loathed by some progressive members of Congress and outside activists. Just three Democrats voted against it: Reps. Ro Khanna (Calif.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii). An equivalent number of moderate Republicans voted for the rules."}
{"original": "These progressives object to the pay-as-you-go, or pay-go, rule because it would prevent legislative priorities like Medicare for All to come up for a vote unless they were paid for."}
{"original": "However, the Congressional Progressive Caucus effectively decided it was not worth tanking the entire set of rules governing the new Congress to jettison pay-go, since they had received assurances from Democratic leaders that the provision would always be waived to allow progressive bills to proceed to the House floor."}
{"original": "With the assurances that PAYGO can be waived, we do plan to vote for the House rules package and proceed with legislation to fix the statute, CPC co-chairs Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) said in a Wednesday statement."}
{"original": "Progressive congressional leaders have also noted that a change in House rules alone would not clear the path for deficit-increasing legislation to become law. Since pay-go is also written into the legal code, Congress would have to enact another law overturning it ― or otherwise exempting a particular bill from it."}
{"original": "Reps. Jayapal and Pocan promised Wednesday that they would introduce a bill overturning pay-go entirely."}
{"original": "Asked about pay-go on Thursday, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), a member of the CPC, likewise cited the need for a larger legal fix."}
{"original": "Congress can always change that law. And I think I will be supportive of that move, he said."}
{"original": "When Democrats re-took the House in 2007, they reinstated expired pay-go rules requiring any new spending to be offset. But following a decade of frustration with Republicans' willingness to discard their professed fiscal conservatism to cut taxes for the wealthy ― and a burgeoning field of research downplaying the importance of low budget deficits ― many Democrats have soured on pay-go as a vestige of a misguided era of centrist triangulation."}

{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez's staff claimed that she would try to rally the 18 no votes necessary to kill the package."}
{"original": "But Democratic leaders were confident they had the votes. By Wednesday night, it became clear that even incoming Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), one of the freshman class's progressive firebrands, would be voting yes. In her statement, Omar noted that the rules package contained a change that would permit her to wear the Muslim headscarf, or hijab, on the House floor."}

{"original": "Pay-go is terrible economic policy. And I am voting what I believe is my conscience on the issue, Khanna told HuffPost."}
{"original": "The eleventh-hour effort by Khanna and Ocasio-Cortez showcased the potential power ― and pitfalls ― of would-be efforts to leverage a smaller ad-hoc group of progressive Democrats to shape Congress' agenda."}
{"original": "The CPC has eschewed emulating the far-right House Freedom Caucus, whose smaller but more ideologically coherent membership has allowed it to operate as a bloc capable of exercising veto power over any legislation GOP leaders introduce. The caucus instead welcomes all members, including some who belong to the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition, while permitting smaller groups to take stands of their choosing."}
{"original": "Thus far, the CPC has had more success when its co-chairs exercise their leverage in concert with outside activists."}
{"original": "Jayapal and Pocan demanded that CPC members receive proportional representation ― 40 percent of the seats ― on five influential committees in which they were previously underrepresented, in exchange for endorsing California Rep. Nancy Pelosi's speakership."}

{"original": "The direct payments Congress sent most households last year in response to the coronavirus pandemic were so popular with the American public that lawmakers approved a second round of checks last month, and Biden promised to do a third."}
{"original": "But Biden paired the checks with an array of other policies that are more complicated and outright unwelcome among Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have panned the proposal despite some support for additional direct payments. Even with Democrats controlling the Senate, passing the bill would be difficult."}
{"original": "Buried inside the Biden plan, however, is an obscure policy that could be the nucleus for a program of sending people checks every month. It's a proposal to expand the child tax credit, which currently pays working parents as much as $1,400 per child annually through refunds at tax time."}
{"original": "Biden's plan would boost the refunds to up to $3,600 per child and make it easier for lower-income families to get the full amount."}
{"original": "Some Republicans like the idea of expanding the child tax credit."}

{"original": "And Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) co-sponsored a bill with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) to increase the tax credit in 2019."}
{"original": "Biden's proposal resembles the American Family Act, proposed in 2019 by Bennet and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), which would have boosted the maximum credit to $3,600 ― and instead of paying out after you file your taxes, the Internal Revenue Service would distribute refunds in advance, on a monthly basis."}
{"original": "Annual tax refunds are already one of the federal government's most important antipoverty programs. Under Bennet-Brown, low-income parents would get about $300 per month in cash and would not need any earnings to qualify. Switching to monthly support would make life easier for parents, and increasing the benefit would slash child poverty by 40%."}
{"original": "Biden retained the earnings requirement and omitted advance payments from his proposal, which would only apply for this year, but Democrats did include advance payments in one version of a coronavirus relief bill that passed the House last year.

{"original": "The idea of a big new federal program with monthly benefits has been poison in American politics, with lawmakers often doing social policy through the tax code, but the bipartisan love of checks in recent months suggests that might not be true anymore."}

{"original": "The checks have been wildly popular, he said. Now is the time to seize the energy and move the tax credits into a real benefit program."}
{"original": "Tax subsidies exist for private schools at least in part because the schools and their students' parents are deemed to serve a public purpose by shouldering the cost of educating students whom governments would otherwise have to educate on its own. This sounds good - until we remember that government pays as much or more to educate a student at Mercersburg as it pays to educate a student in Pennsylvania's public schools."}
{"original": "There is little awareness in private schools of the strong financial role of governments, a role that grows with each school's endowment and fundraising success. Like most Americans, the schools naturally prefer to trumpet their independence of government, rather than their dependence on it."}
{"original": "Sadly, U.S. tax policy assures that this subsidy goes disproportionally to the schools that need it least - those that raise the most money and generate the biggest endowments - just as the TARP money went to the biggest banks, and just as tax policy favors the wealthiest Americans."}
{"original": "Mercersburg has become a wealthy school. Its $483,000 endowment per student in SY2012, which ranked 9th among boarding schools (Appendix E), was comparable to Duke University's, but less than half that of Phillips Exeter Academy (top among boarding schools), which was in turn about half that of Princeton University (top among universities.)"}
{"original": "Rather than feigning financial independence of government, wouldn't it be more honest and more honorable for our wealthiest non-profits to regularly acknowledge the tremendous support they receive from governments and thank them profusely, just as they would any other major donor - perhaps even name a building for them? Any other annual donor of $5.7 million could expect as much."}
{"original": "A Chronicle of Higher Education study of college presidents' compensation revealed that 42 of them received over a million dollars in SY2011 - prudent management? The study did not include a look at their expense accounts, which might have been more interesting. Still more intriguing could have been a study of pay for bigtime college football and basketball coaches."}
{"original": "Executive pay at private schools is lower, of course, some would say reasonable. The IRS Form 990 reports salary and benefits for non-profits' five most-highly-compensated employees. Pay packages for the heads of the 15 wealthiest boarding schools (Appendix F) averaged $490,000 in SY2012; the next four administrators averaged $239,000. The comparable figures at Mercersburg were $430,000 and $189,000."}
{"original": "Average pay for the CEO's of S&P500 companies was 354 times that of the average American worker in 2012. Pay for school heads is not nearly so obscene, of course, but reasonable is probably not the word the superintendent of the Mercersburg public schools would choose to describe it. Her compensation that year, in a system with six times as many students as Mercersburg Academy, was $130,000."}
{"original": "Pay for Mercersburg's teaching faculty and staff is not reported on the 990s, but a clue may lie in the fact that, from SY2007 to SY2012, the Head's pay grew at 5.5% per year, on average, the other four most-highly-paids by 2.3%, and inflation by 2.0% (Appendix F.) If all pay raises, like pay, were proffered from the top down, there could be little real growth in wages at lower levels - not unlike what we read about wage stagnation for most Americans in the last 40 years."}
{"original": "It is not the pay, but the number of administrators that old Mercersburg-watchers notice most. This was once called administrative creep, an expression that was quickly bastardized by clever classroom teachers who added an s to the second word. It doesn't occur in all schools, but it is natural in the most affluent, which can well-afford a few superfluous administrators."}
{"original": "The number of administrators and administrative staff was noticeably higher at Mercersburg in SY2012 than in SY1992. Its per-student expenses, however, grew at slightly less than the 15-school average (but still more than twice the rate of inflation) over that period and ranked 15th in the bookend years. This could suggest that Mercersburg was at least no more casual about administrative growth than its wealthy counterparts."}
{"original": "Unfortunately, tuition and fees at the wealthiest schools also grew at over twice the rate of inflation in those 20 years (Appendix D), shrinking the already tiny slice (under 3% today, according to TABS, The Association of Boarding Schools) of American families who can comfortably afford boarding school. To maintain a semblance of economic diversity in their student bodies, boarding schools have all made efforts to increase their financial aid budgets."}
{"original": "Over 40% of Mercersburg's students receive financial aid. In fact, the school devotes more to financial aid, relative to its budget, than all but one of the 15 wealthiest schools (Appendix D.) But it still draws 60% of its students from that small sliver of families who can pay the full fare. Increasingly, these are not American families."}
{"original": "In the final installment of this series, we look at the growing conflict between the desires of many private schools to have student bodies that are both economically diverse on the one hand and geographically diverse on the other. We will also consider some measures that might slow the widening gap between wealthy non-profits and their poorer counterparts."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Billionaire Michael Bloomberg won't have to publicly disclose his finances until late March, well after voters in more than a dozen states take to the polls on Super Tuesday."}

{"original": "And under an extension granted to him Friday by the Federal Election Commission — the second such one Bloomberg has received — he can postpone their release until March 20."}
{"original": "The timing is significant because Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, has skipped campaigning in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire and is instead staking his bid on a big showing in contests that come later, like Super Tuesday on March 3. By getting approval to delay the release of his finances until after those pivotal contests, he is denying voters information about how much he is worth — and how he invests his money."}

{"original": "The term circular economy, which shows up more and more at political agendas, is precise but does not express the deep mental change that it implies. We live in a time when machines and labor are used not only to produce jeans, but also to consume them before selling. Actually, the idea of a circular economy is just the opposite. It's meant to extend the life of products and materials, thus making them 'circulate' longer in the economy and reducing the amount of raw materials and newly produced goods, as well as their environmental impact. 'The EU action plan for the Circular Economy' and the Chinese policy for a circular economy are just two examples of the proliferating initiatives in this direction."}
{"original": "Walter Stahel, the Swiss architect and industrial adviser, has been since the '70s one of the fathers of the idea of a circular economy, for which he argues with a 'river and lake' metaphor. Thus far, the economy is conceived as a river, in which we should try to double the flow rate per capita every ten or twenty years no matter whether in this eternally doubling flow the content of beneficial nutrients or detrimental toxins grows faster. Instead, a circular economy would be rather like a lake. Citizens and policy makers would rather preserve and improve the quality and accessibility of this lake, without increasing the affluent and effluent river more than absolutely necessary."}
{"original": "So why does this 'economy of common sense' fail to catch on? Let's take gold as an example. Its stock above ground is estimated at 180.000 tonnes, equivalent to a cube with sides of just 21 m. A portion of the world's worked gold has been circulating for millennia, melted and re-melted into countless artifacts. Thereby, relatively little material generated a great deal of usage value over time. Another portion of the world's worked gold is instead extracted from mines, at cost of great environmental damage and consumption of energy, returning quickly back underground to the vaults of banks - producing no technical usage value."}
{"original": "A further portion of the extracted gold also soon returns underground in landfills, where remains of cellphones and other devices are dumped, each containing small amounts of gold. Again, a lot of materials and energy wasted to generate very brief usage value. In its first iteration, gold is the prototype of a circular economy, yet in the second and third it's that of a linear economy."}
{"original": "Current technologies already allow us to put an end to most of the misuse and dissipation of gold and its related environmental damage. Indeed, only our misplaced conceptions prevent us from doing just that; on the one hand, we persist in conventions that give gold an exchange value out of proportion to its technical usage value, on the other hand, in many cases, it is more 'convenient' today to dissipate gold than conserve it as a result of a tax system that discourages what is desirable (employment) and encourages what is not (the use and abuse of nature)."}
{"original": "In most industrial countries, labor (which abounds and is in part underused) becomes increasingly expensive through taxation and social insurance costs. Thus we encourage replacing labor with more machines, materials and energy. Yet materials and energy (relatively scarce, thus worth saving) are lightly taxed in comparison, or even subsidized, which stimulates their use, abets joblessness (adding to social costs) and increases waste."}
{"original": "In 1976, Walter Stahel and Genevieve Reday published a report for the European Commission whose title seems a misprint: The Potential for Substituting Manpower for Energy. Hold on there. For thousands of years progress meant substituting machines for manpower, the exact opposite. This much is true. But the success of two centuries of industrial society brought about a problem of scale; human population and its material throughput reached such proportions as to turn what was real progress for billions of individuals into a collective boomerang. Today, consuming and wasting far too much material and energy compromises long-term planetary equilibrium and leads us into a new era that Earth scientists call the 'Anthropocene'; a geological epoch in which human activities began to have a significant global impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems."}
{"original": "'Substituting Manpower for Energy' (Walter Stahel) doesn't mean giving up the washing machine, nor giving up technical progress. Instead, it means giving direction to progress, using ingenuity and labor to extend the life of things, rather than reduce it. This is the very purpose of The Product-Life Institute, created in 1982 in Geneva by Walter Stahel and Orio Giarini, both university professors and consultants to companies, governments and international institutions."}
{"original": "Perhaps the contribution of Giarini and Stahel to the political economy is no less important than that in industrial ecology. In books such as Dialogue on wealth and welfare (1980) and The performance economy (2010), they redefine the concept of economic value; true value is found in what and how long things really perform, not in the amount of their production and commerce."}
{"original": "This simple concept was formulated by Aristotle in his distinction between oikonomia (care for the house) and chrematistics (care for money). But it was abandoned by many modern economists when the political economy seemed to become subordinated to quantitative economics; because it is difficult or impossible to directly measure the real usage of things, in its place we measure the quantity of their production and purchase."}
{"original": "This misbegotten premise shaped an economy that aims at continuously doubling both the production and destruction of things, rather than optimizing their lifecycle. Abandoning this concept of linear economy promises to instigate an actual counter-revolution. In the present terminal phase of our consumption-centred civilization, the ancient precept of caring for and preserving both nature and manufactured goods would subvert the present established disorder, while alleviating job loss and protecting the planet."}
{"original": "Few Americans see the United Arab Emirates as a shining example of human rights. But as mayor of New York City, Mike Bloomberg allowed the New York Police Department to initiate and expand a law enforcement relationship with the repressive government there at a time when the UAE was known to be practicing aggressive policies that would be illegal in the United States."}
{"original": "They're doing stuff there that makes stop and frisk look like child's play, said Ben Freeman, who tracks foreign influence in the U.S. at the Center for International Policy."}
{"original": "Beginning in 2008, the partnership placed NYPD officers in the UAE and approved intelligence-sharing between the police force and a regime known for persecuting political opponents. The UAE donated $1 million toward the collaboration and ultimately hired the architect of Bloomberg's widely criticized Muslim surveillance program."}
{"original": "Bloomberg is citing his experience as New York mayor to argue he is prepared to be commander in chief. Presidents from both parties have largely treated the UAE as a trusted partner ― experience handling the country is no black mark. Yet Bloomberg's connection to a rare and little-understood link between that government and a thousands-strong local agency shows a perspective that worries advocates for civil liberties and democracy abroad. The relationship he greenlighted gave a new level of legitimacy to a government that watchdogs consider one of the most authoritarian in the Middle East and risked inspiring police officers dealing with Americans to seek a troubling degree of power."}
{"original": "Bloomberg has sustained his relationship with the UAE in the years since, as well, praising it for donating tens of millions of dollars to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, and hosting a high-profile conference there last year. That fits a pattern of comfort with autocrats, particularly those who justify hardline practices by talking about national security. The Democratic presidential candidate has claimed Chinese President Xi Jinping is not a dictator despite Xi's moves to centralize power, suggested U.S. criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin is hypocritical and praised Saudi Arabia following a global uproar over Saudi agents' murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi."}
{"original": "Bloomberg did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did the NYPD."}
{"original": "The NYPD Sees A Friend In The UAE"}
{"original": "Elected shortly after the attacks of 9/11, Bloomberg allowed his hand-picked police commissioner, Ray Kelly, to focus on terrorism in an unprecedented way."}
{"original": "Kelly established a new role, deputy commissioner for intelligence, and filled it with a 35-year CIA veteran named David Cohen. He set up an International Liaison Program that sent NYPD officers to foreign cities to work with law enforcement there, dodging a restriction in the city charter that stops officers from working in other jurisdictions by paying for the project with money from the New York City Police Foundation, a nonprofit backed by wealthy New Yorkers."}
{"original": "Because the program doesn't rely on public funding, there is a lot that's shrouded from public view and a lot of concerns, especially given the size of department and its foreign activities, said Rachel Levinson-Waldman, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. The NYPD generally tries to operate without a lot of oversight."}
{"original": "In 2008, the police chief announced that Abu Dhabi, the UAE's capital, would become the latest city to host an NYPD representative, at an Emirati agency protecting the country's sensitive infrastructure. UAE representatives cited the relationship as evidence of their cooperation with the U.S. to American counterparts at a high-level dialogue the following year, a diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks shows."}
{"original": "Larry Sanchez, a CIA official sent to support the NYPD who formally joined the department as Cohen's deputy in 2004, was a top intermediary with high-ranking Emiratis. He won them over by his commitment to them, a former law enforcement source told Foreign Policy."}
{"original": "Sanchez had already made an impact in New York that reflected the style of his autocratic counterparts. He built the spying program that designated mosques as terror organizations and focused on Muslim communities based on their religious identity rather than evidence of wrongdoing, The Associated Press later revealed."}
{"original": "Once his activities began drawing scrutiny, as Muslims spoke out about their treatment by the NYPD and federal officials worried that the department's intelligence collaboration represented a CIA overreach, Sanchez left the department in late 2010. Just months later, he began crafting a new spy network ― this time for the UAE, the Foreign Policy investigation revealed."}

{"original": "Starting in 2011, the UAE's law enforcement apparatus focused more intensely on tamping down dissent in response to the Arab Spring-era protests against authoritarians across the region. The country's rulers saw supporters of political Islam, who demanded more accountable governments more influenced by religion, as their biggest threat because of their potential appeal to regular citizens, and called them not just political opponents but extremists. The perception jibed with the NYPD's philosophy at the time: treating any connection to the Muslim faith as a potential security risk."}
{"original": "Emirati security forces arrested dozens of activists, government critics and foreign nationals in 2011 and 2012. Some said they experienced torture that included beatings and being hung from a wall."}
{"original": "The crackdown at home contrasted with a soft approach to friends abroad like the NYPD: In 2012, the UAE gave $1 million to the secretive police foundation, according to a tax form published by The Intercept years later. It remains unclear what the money went to. Though the foundation gave the same amount of money that year to the department's intelligence division to support the International Liaison Program, a foundation spokesperson told the outlet the gift went to upgrading equipment and facilities."}
{"original": "The foundation did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment."}
{"original": "In the summer of 2013, UAE detainees sent rights groups statements saying authorities subjected them to systematic abuse, specifically extended solitary confinement, exposure to extreme temperatures, sleep deprivation, interrogations while blindfolded and threats of electrocution."}
{"original": "That November ― just before the end of his and Bloomberg's tenure ― Kelly flew to the country to sign a new deal enabling the exchange of ideas and training methods, his spokesman John McCarthy told the New York Daily News. He noted that though most such agreements were finalized at police headquarters, Emirati officials specially requested that Kelly visit."}
{"original": "The close ties between local police and a repressive security apparatus makes Americans vulnerable and threatens the ideals the country says it stands for, Levinson-Waldman of the Brennan Center said. NYPD officials could be introduced to UAE techniques around surveillance and then try to convince courts back home to allow them to deploy similar methods, she said, or feel pressured to provide intelligence on individuals the UAE sees as threats for behavior that would be permitted in the U.S."}
{"original": "Embracing the UAE as it clamped down on popular movements across the Muslim-majority world is morally fraught too, said Iyad el-Baghdadi, a pro-democracy activist who was detained and then deported by Emirati authorities in 2014."}
{"original": "Its mass arrests represented a complete decapitation of any native movement that can actually push for political reform and it has been a crucial supporter for aspiring dictators beyond its borders, in contexts like Egypt and Libya, he said, exacerbating public resentment that could drive people to extremism."}
{"original": "People are waking up to the fact that they are not the forces of stability ― they are creating instability, said el-Baghdadi, who obtained asylum in Norway and now runs a think tank called the Kawaakibi Foundation. Their game has been to be the arsonist and the fireman at the same time."}
{"original": "Still, the NYPD's partnership with the UAE has grown. Sanchez remained in place in the UAE as of 2017, and that year, the country's embassy announced it was donating an additional $2 million to the police foundation ― this time explicitly saying it was for the International Liaison Program. In 2018, NYPD cars featured stickers proclaiming, The Year of Zayed, a reference to the UAE's founding father."}
{"original": "This fits a pattern that we've seen with Emirati influence in the U.S…. they really spread their influence around, said Freeman of the Center for International Policy. My concern here is that it's one thing to donate to hurricane relief, but when it comes to policing, there are just so many terrible things happening in the UAE."}
{"original": "We know that the research in behavioral finance has already identified a number of potentially harmful biases for the banking business. These biases lead experts and clients to make decisions which cause financial losses. An interesting question worth exploring is if there are any biases incorporated in internal guidelines, as day-to-day banking does not account for biases."}
{"original": "• Finding a typo in a CV or resume leads people to the confirmation bias: It is believed that the candidate in question is not sufficiently qualified, due to the typo, and everything which follows in the CV is interpreted in a way in order to confirm the initial suspicion. This is related to anchoring bias, as found by Daniel Kahneman (2011)."}
{"original": "• Another bias which may have also contributed to the banking and financial crisis is the herding instinct in terms of tax benefits for instance. Client advisors followed others in their dealing with tax issues of clients."}
{"original": "• In the day-to-day business, people do not consider the halo effect when they create a list of preferred suppliers, as it is assumed that a certain company is trustworthy without questioning it. If the company is professional in highlighting its strengths and expertise, it is automatically believed that their consultants are qualified or that a particular vendor's software is competitive."}
{"original": "• Another bias that is not considered is the illusion of transparency. There is no internal guideline which alerts employees to avoid this bias. This is also a reason for poor communication in almost every project, because the members of the project think they are transparent. Not communicating properly can produce a useless result."}
{"original": "• In all aspects of banking excellence there is a strong emphasis on team work which might also supports group biases where teams isolate themselves and fail to support the organization. Not considering group biases and building strong teams might be seen as beneficial for the group, but not for the organization itself."}
{"original": "• Since the crisis, banks are dealing with extreme aversion bias. They want to be in the middle of a range of potential outcomes, which is harming productivity and innovation. Not many banks allow themselves to act differently."}
{"original": "• Another bias found in banking is the focusing effect. The entire banking business is focused on reputation and regulation. The focus should be reset in all areas with different intensity. But without noticing it, banking suffers from it since many years. This bias harms banking and makes them persisting in a weak position, which is the reason why a number of banks still has not fully recovered since the crisis."}
{"original": "• A major reason of the crisis was the illusion of control. This bias is still prevalent in day-to-day business and evidence that banking has learned only little about past issues. The illusion of control will cause losses again."}
{"original": "These are examples of a few biases which are very much prevalent in day-to-day business and should be avoided with the help of clear guidelines and instructions. One way in becoming more practical is by circumventing biases and by getting into a state of cognitive ease. Cognitive ease can be compared with mindfulness, where we are in an optimal state of mind and can make better decisions. The most effective way of remaining mindful is the regular practice of meditation."}
{"original": "The spin around the release of the president's fiscal year 2017 budget proposals is that it is a vision statement of a progressive president no longer bound by any pretense of legislative viability."}
{"original": "Given that, what do we actually learn by looking at the budget? First, the White House pretends to care about the fiscal outlook as the budget top-line keeps future deficits below 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and stabilizes the debt at roughly 75 percent of GDP. But that pretense has been in every Obama budget and the fiscal outlook remains dire."}
{"original": "It has to be rapid economic growth. Compared to the Congressional Budget Office January projections economic growth averages 0.25 percentage points faster over the 10-year budget window in the OMB economic assumptions. That might not seem like much, but it will reduce the deficit by over $800 billion over 10 years -- hardly chump change. It also assumes that unemployment stabilizes at a lower level. Unfortunately, this also has been a fixture of every budget, and economic growth remains problematic."}
{"original": "Next, the budget requires taxes -- lots of taxes. The president's unhinged willingness to tax anything jumps out to the tune of $4.5 trillion more in taxes over the 10 years. That stunning tax increase produces revenue at 20 percent of GDP -- about 2 full percentage points higher than historic norms. That's also not new; its just $1 trillion higher than the last budget."}
{"original": "The centerpiece of the tax proposals is a $10 per barrel oil fee. Of course, the tax would lead to an increase in gasoline prices; the only question is how much. Most analysts suggest that it will be in the range of $0.25 per gallon. From this perspective, one question is why the administration did not simply propose a 25-cent increase in the federal gasoline tax to fund its infrastructure initiatives. Doing it at the retail level is closer to the traditional user-fee model for the highway trust fund, although the rise of electric and hybrid cars weakens the link between gasoline use and highway wear and tear."}
{"original": "But there will be broader impacts as well, since the tax will raise the retail prices of jet fuel, heating oil, diesel fuel and others. It will interfere with global petroleum markets. While it appears that imported oil will also be subject to a $10 tax, it does not appear that the tax would be rebated on exports. If so, then having finally won long-overdue ability to export oil, U.S. producers will immediately be at a disadvantage on global markets."}
{"original": "In introducing the proposal, the administration argued that is was a fair quid pro quo for permitting oil exports and that, with oil prices low, now is a good time to introduce a tax. The latter is simply an inappropriate managing of prices (something the administration has tried before), while the former simply doesn't make sense. Oil companies should not have to pay for policy that is beneficial for the economy as a whole."}
{"original": "Finally, the only point of juicing economic growth and festooning the economy with tax proposals is to permit as much more spending as possible. Again, we've seen this movie before."}
{"original": "As it turns out, the vision is not surprising -- tax, regulate and spend -- nor is it new, and neither is it responsive to the fact that tax, regulate and spend has produced poor growth for 7 years."}
{"original": "I have always recognized John McCain's heroism as the most impenetrable sort possible in the United States. It is a militaristic heroism. A violent heroism. An obstinate heroism, and one so stereotypically masculine that it works doubly in affirming all it is we profess about men and how their behavior should be: stony, sturdy, resolute."}
{"original": "By now, the story of McCain's valor during wartime is canon. And with that reverence in mind, the gradual diminution of the senator from Arizona since his foray into politics in 1982 has been rattling to observe."}
{"original": "There is a vast chasm between the esteem once demanded for a man with McCain's background and the present environment, in which officials and spokespeople from his own party savage him at will."}
{"original": "Getty Images via Getty Images John McCain, center right, seen shortly after being released from a North Vietnamese prison camp in 1973."}
{"original": "In a recent staff meeting, White House staffer Kelly Sadler joked that McCain's concerns about the nomination of Gina Haspel to head the CIA didn't matter because — invoking the senator's brain cancer — he's dying anyway.; a former lieutenant general in the Air Force referred to McCain as Songbird John in an interview on the Fox Business Network, mocking McCain's alleged confessions under the threat of torture in Hanoi; and Donald Trump infamously suggested McCain isn't a hero because he was captured at war."}
{"original": "My concern about this tenor of rhetoric being excused isn't rooted in a particular fondness for Sen. McCain. In fact, my concern is rather selfish and premised upon a belief that a system that so frivolously injures a man who has done its bidding for almost four decades carries little promise for the people that man, himself, has injured."}
{"original": "Excluding the past three years, the entirety of my life was spent as a constituent of John McCain's, raised on the south side of Phoenix, Arizona. And in that time, it was not so much that John McCain didn't know who I was that offended me — he had millions of constituents, of course. Rather, it was the perception, as a young adult, that he didn't want to know who I was; he didn't want to know who we — the largely black working class on the south side — were; and he didn't care for our concerns as tenderly as he had for those voiced throughout Phoenix's more affluent (and notably more white) north side."}
{"original": "For years, John McCain employed a carefully crafted identity as a statesman and, in so doing, obfuscated a lot of the turmoil within his state. He accomplished this while earning praise from no less than his most prominent foe, Barack Obama himself. And with this, it took very little time for me to learn that the experience of being black in Arizona ― a petri dish for stringently conservative policies and fanatical conservative leadership ― historically required stomaching the elevation of your most virulent and cruel opposition to the highest levels of import. In my view, John McCain represented this dichotomy."}
{"original": "When the time came for him, as a wet-behind-the-ears representative in the 1982 Congress, to issue a vote on the establishment of a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, he voted against it. (Senator McCain has said he regrets this.)"}
{"original": "When Arizona legislators enacted SB 1070, the bill championed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio and found largely unlawful by the Supreme Court due to racial and ethnic profiling concerns, John McCain supported it, praising it as a good tool. He did this while manicuring his persona as a centrist and the Senate's primary dealmaker on matters of immigration."}
{"original": "When the time has come for John McCain to lend his support to conservative causes ranging from the privatization of health care to tax reductions for wealthy Americans and the authorization of war, he has done so reliably."}
{"original": "So many of his stances occurred despite my objection, and yet still, as an onlooker I envisioned a world in which this sort of ideological loyalty would bear fruit eternally for Senator McCain. I, as an American, have been trained to believe that happily giving yourself — particularly, as a white man — to the American project would result in unending adulation or, minimally, respect from the state."}
{"original": "Quite evidently, this is not so."}
{"original": "The reality is far more complicated, and McCain is, instead, presented scornfully as the failed stalwart who couldn't steer America from its first black president. He has, since his failure in 2008, been treated with the sort of disdain one may expect from an ethno-nationalist party hellbent on avoiding that outcome and nullifying its results."}
{"original": "I worry that the removal of that veneer will give rise to a viciousness we have not yet seen."}
{"original": "There is an irony in the facade of decency and decorum John McCain worked so hard to uphold crashing down all around him in the most deeply personal way: with colleagues who'd worked at his side for decades refusing to meaningfully hold those besmirching his name and mocking his most traumatic moments to account. He has been the most fitting hero possible for a nation equally invested as he is in the illusion of fairness and order. It would seem a man like John McCain would have his praises sung in perpetuity."}
{"original": "That this is not that case is a harsh reality I cannot wish on anyone in earnest. At some level, it is sobering to witness a widely proclaimed hero destroyed in that fashion, even if that hero is not yours. My gripe with John McCain has never been that I've believed him unheroic, but instead that his heroism has been confined only to instances where he encountered a physical threat. Under political threat, he has traditionally behaved differently."}
{"original": "But the neglect with which he is treated by members of his own party does speak to our arrival at a new stage in American politics. It betrays a coldness — a disinterest in the facade and the pleasantries that accompany it, a disinterest in playing the game, and an outright rejection of integrity."}
{"original": "I worry that the removal of that veneer may give rise to a viciousness we have not yet seen."}
{"original": "The Pew Charitable Trusts Letters pile up in the mailbox of the College Park, Georgia, split-level home from which the Hicks family was recently evicted."}
{"original": "ATLANTA — On a brisk morning in mid-December, Valencia Hicks was running late to the Fulton County courthouse in hopes of avoiding eviction."}
{"original": "The 43-year-old mother had been forced out of her home the year before, a process that had uprooted her family from their apartment in East Point, Georgia. At her new brick split-level, Hicks decided not to pay her $995 monthly rent because her landlord hadn't adequately fixed broken appliances, preventing the family from enjoying affordable home-cooked meals. The landlord, in turn, filed for eviction."}
{"original": "Like most tenants facing eviction in Fulton County, Hicks is African-American and lacked a lawyer. She planned to tell the judge about her family's hardships. Not only did she have a disability, reliant on government checks for rent, but she also was raising two boys who each had autism."}
{"original": "Without a favorable ruling, a landlord could move forward with padlocking the door and placing their items on the curb. If she was lucky, she might get her wish of celebrating Christmas there."}
{"original": "A long understudied facet of the American housing market, evictions have hit no area of the country harder than the South, a region home to most of the top-evicting large and mid-sized U.S. cities, according to a list released by Princeton's Eviction Lab."}
{"original": "Last year Eviction Lab debuted what's thought to be the nation's largest eviction database, revealing that U.S. property owners had submitted at least 2.3 million eviction filings in 2016. For housing experts from Louisiana to Virginia, it provided the evidence to confirm what they long suspected: Black renters disproportionately bore the brunt of the eviction crisis."}
{"original": "Eviction Lab found that nine of the 10 highest-evicting large cities were not only located in the South but also had populations that were at least 30 percent black."}
{"original": "Moreover, the top 25 entries in its ranking of mid-sized cities — including East Point, population 35,000 — experienced an eviction rate at least four times higher than the national average of 2.3 percent."}
{"original": "If you've read about the housing crisis, it seems located in New York and San Francisco, but the eviction crisis is happening in cities with a fairly low cost of living like North Charleston, South Carolina, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, said Matthew Desmond, a professor of sociology at Princeton and the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book Evicted."}
{"original": "There's a lot of questions left unanswered, but the data allows us to see the problem in a way we'd never seen it before, Desmond said. That's allowed the narrative to change in some communities."}
{"original": "The current shutdown of many federal agencies could make the matter worse. If the shutdown lasts much longer, housing experts fear evictions could spike nationwide because landlords who rent to low-income tenants might not be able to get rental assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development."}
{"original": "As some southern legislatures kick off their 2019 sessions this month, many state lawmakers are considering a new slate of bills to curb the larger affordable housing crisis. Following the launch of Eviction Lab's database, local advocates intend to further raise awareness of the consequences of eviction, a process that can start with a single missed rent payment."}
{"original": "Steve Helber/The Associated Press Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, a Democrat, greets attendees after remarks at a 2018 meeting of the Campaign to Reduce Evictions in Richmond, Virginia."}
{"original": "Not only do evicted people face barriers to new housing, studies suggest evictions also are linked to worse health and educational outcomes, according to research respectively from Desmond and the Urban Institute. With evictions often clustered in lower-income black neighborhoods, entire communities can face the fallout of a churn of new neighbors that severs close-knit social networks."}
{"original": "This status quo is often protected and nurtured by politicians and property owners. Landlords in Mississippi routinely file for eviction as a legal way to collect rent, according to an investigation last year by Mississippi Today."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, some lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Georgia statehouse have stymied proposals to strengthen tenant rights."}
{"original": "From 2012 to 2016, Republican state Rep. Wendell Willard, then the chairman of the influential House Judiciary Committee, received at least $30,000 from various companies with ties to the housing industry, based on a Stateline review of campaign contributions. No bill to bolster tenant rights advanced out of his committee."}
{"original": "The former chairman of the Georgia Senate Judiciary Committee, Republican Josh McKoon, didn't grant a hearing to a bill that would have forced landlords to fix unsafe or unhealthy conditions in rental units such as mold growth, pest infestation and tainted water."}
{"original": "McKoon says the committee under his leadership granted hearings to any lawmaker who requested one, but that lawmakers sometimes file legislation to have a broader conversation about an issue."}
{"original": "We try to give judges a fair amount of discretion, said Willard, who said campaign contributions had no influence on his decision-making on the issue. I think we have a pretty good body of law in Georgia that's been developed over many decades on dispossessory. But if something needs to be changed, we try to change it."}
{"original": "Armed with data and heightened public awareness, in part thanks to Desmond's book Evicted released two years ago, some housing advocates are pursuing changes in law with a renewed energy to decrease evictions, increase affordable housing and reduce disparities that exist for black renters in the South."}
{"original": "While eviction rates have spiked in states like South Carolina, according to Eviction Lab data, Georgia and Virginia have seen their rates trend downward since the Great Recession."}
{"original": "Evictions are both a consequence of cumulative forces of poverty — and black poverty — and a cause of it, said Dan Immergluck, an urban studies professor at Georgia State University. Evictions hurt folks in all kinds of ways. Because evictions are concentrated in black neighborhoods, it impacts whole communities."}
{"original": "Evictions are the latest in a long line of housing policies that have disproportionately harmed black Americans. Over the past century, well-documented discriminatory practices like redlining, restrictive covenants and predatory lending have denied black people the opportunity to buy homes."}
{"original": "Discouraged from homeownership — and the accompanying wealth-building benefits — many black people rented instead. In 2015, the African-American homeownership rate was about 42 percent, more than 20 points lower than the rate for all groups, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. But a 2018 study found that black people are more likely to pay higher rents than white people in the same areas."}
{"original": "And a Cleveland State University researcher surveying rental agreement laws found that no southern state had a suite of laws protecting tenants over landlords."}
{"original": "Every week, attorney Jesse McCoy sees this play out inside eviction court in Durham, North Carolina. The tenants, he said, are mostly black. Many make honest pleas to a judge about their life's circumstances — which almost always lack legal standing."}
{"original": "McCoy thinks many of those same tenants would have legitimate grievances, from roach infestations to black mold, that might yield a favorable outcome. But without consulting counsel, he said, they rarely raise legal arguments."}
{"original": "If you don't understand rights, you can't advocate for yourself, said Sue Berkowitz, director of the SC Appleseed Legal Justice Center, an organization that helps clients in South Carolina, a state with an eviction rate of 8.9 percent, nearly four times the national average."}
{"original": "Housing attorneys throughout the South think that tenants facing an eviction case could have better outcomes in court if they were guaranteed the right to counsel — a right now ensured in select cities such as New York."}
{"original": "An eviction — even a filing — follows you around, said Elora Raymond, an assistant professor of city planning and real estate development at Clemson University. If you get evictions filed against you in Georgia, and move to California, you still have that history."}
{"original": "If that's happening more in South Carolina or Georgia, she said, referring to two states with high percentages of black residents, and less in Montana or Colorado — there's a racial implication."}
{"original": "Virginia Poverty Law Center attorney Christine Marra said tenants who have had rental applications denied are less likely to find safe or affordable housing."}
{"original": "In some cases, those renters often can find housing only farther from where they lived before, potentially impacting other family issues, such as a child's academic performance. And health care researchers have found that evictions are linked to higher rates of depression, stress and suicide."}
{"original": "Garland Nellom, a 51-year-old mother of three who faced eviction in New Jersey, said she moved to Georgia four years ago after her youngest son, who had asthma and an allergy to the mold she later discovered in their apartment, died. He was 11 years old. Nellom found an apartment in College Park, Georgia, for $745 a month."}
{"original": "Soon, she noticed problems including rodents and mold. She withheld her rent in protest — a practice that in some northeastern and western states can be done legally to force serious repairs from a neglectful landlord, but in Georgia can be grounds for eviction. Her landlord took legal action."}
{"original": "They ultimately settled the dispute, thanks to a lawyer Nellom had secured through the Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation, and she stayed. This past summer she left for good upon finding exposed wire in her laundry room, which had flooded once again. Given her spotty housing record, landlords wanted her to pay a higher security deposit, which she was unable to do living on disability."}
{"original": "I was fearful I was going to die, she said. I had nowhere to go — nowhere. I put my name on homeless shelter lists. They were full. I had neighbors gracious enough to let me stay."}
{"original": "Faced with the scope of the eviction crisis, advocates are lobbying for changes to address housing disparities throughout the South."}
{"original": "In North Carolina, McCoy has helped oversee Durham's eviction diversion program, which pairs Duke law students with unrepresented tenants facing eviction."}
{"original": "South Carolina state Rep. Marvin Pendarvis, a Democrat from North Charleston, is pushing a bill to approve repair and deduct, a practice allowed in many states, in which tenants front the costs of repairs if a landlord doesn't fix the issue, and deduct that amount from a future rent payment."}
{"original": "And in Virginia, which is home to some of the nation's highest eviction rates, a coalition of lawyers, researchers and activists last year launched the Campaign to Reduce Evictions."}
{"original": "The group has drafted more than 30 proposed changes that would make it easier for tenants to understand the court process for evictions, increase tenant legal rights trainings, pump $20 million into the state's housing trust fund and expand the state's low-income housing tax credit."}
{"original": "In response to news reports about Virginia's high evictions rate, National Apartment Association President Robert Pinnegar recently claimed that misunderstandings about evictions have unfairly cast landlords in a negative light."}
{"original": "Apartment owners do not target evictions for any group or reason, he wrote in a letter to the Washington Post. Evictions are a last resort in the rental housing business."}
{"original": "Housing advocates further recognize that changes can only be effective if they also address the shortage of affordable housing affecting many southern cities."}
{"original": "Some officials have recognized the need: Atlanta Democratic Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has vowed to put $1 billion toward more affordable housing. But low-income housing developers say additional funds or tax credits are needed to build new units."}
{"original": "Policies like inclusionary zoning — requiring developers to make a fixed percentage of rental units affordable in new developments — have received a mixed reception across the South."}
{"original": "Don't just build new affordable housing, Immergluck said. States and localities need to think about creating their own voucher program that might focus on particular populations like families with kids. I don't see southern states funding a permanent voucher program. Maybe it's short term."}
{"original": "Short of a universal housing voucher program, something that Desmond has called for, the Princeton professor thinks states could reduce evictions by making smaller policy changes, such as providing additional legal support, wraparound services, short-term financial assistance or better record keeping."}
{"original": "We might have a referendum on housing in 2020 — and we haven't had that in a long time, Desmond said. I do think we're in a moment where we could ask for something ambitious."}
{"original": "Until tenant rights and affordable housing supplies improve, many experts say black southerners like Hicks will remain vulnerable to eviction. Hicks showed up over 30 minutes late to her Dec. 18 court date. Weary and worried, she said she experienced more traffic than usual."}
{"original": "In a letter to the judge, Hicks explained that she hadn't slept well because one of her autistic sons had tried to open the upstairs windows of their house late that night. But the judge, offering no explanation, denied Hicks' request to stay longer in her brick split-level."}
{"original": "According to court records, Hicks' landlord could have filed for a writ of possession immediately to regain possession of the house. So Hicks called apartment complexes and family members hours away in case she needed to relocate fast."}
{"original": "She desperately wanted a place nearby to keep her boys in the same special-needs program at Banneker High School. But no one she called had immediate availability. She felt disheartened."}
{"original": "Evictions shouldn't hurt you after the eviction, she said. The laws are more for the landlords and rental companies than the tenants. It's hurting people. It's hurting us."}
{"original": "The day after New Year's, Hicks was finishing up packing her house, thankful the county marshals hadn't yet been called to place her possessions on the curb. Her landlord had let her stay through the holidays, but wanted her out in just a few days' time. She didn't know where her family would go next. But one thing was certain: She couldn't stay there."}
{"original": "My daughter is 16 and has her first paying job. Does she need to file a separate tax return?"}
{"original": "Congratulations to your daughter--and to you. A first job is an important milestone for both kids and parents. It's a step toward independence and personal responsibility for your daughter. And it's an opportunity for you to teach her some financial realities."}
{"original": "Taxes are definitely a part of that financial reality. So I'll first discuss the parameters for filing a tax return. Then I'd like to get into ways you can help your daughter learn to manage her money wisely--which, to me, is the most important lesson of all."}
{"original": "Basic guidelines for filing a teen's tax return"}
{"original": "Whether or not your daughter needs to file a separate tax return depends on three basic factors:"}
{"original": "Is she considered a dependent by the IRS? How much income does she have? What type of income does she have?"}
{"original": "The IRS considers a child to be a dependent if he or she:"}
{"original": "Is under 19, or under age 24 and a full-time student, or permanently disabled at any age;"}
{"original": "Lives with you more than 50% of the year; and"}
{"original": "Doesn't provide more than half of his or her own financial support."}
{"original": "Next, you need to look at her income, both the amount and type. Here's where it gets more complicated because there are different rules and income limits for earned income from a job, unearned income from dividends, interest or investment gains--or a combination of both"}
{"original": "This is pretty straightforward. A dependent who doesn't have unearned income only has to file a separate tax return if earned income is above the standard deduction--$6,300 for 2015. So if your daughter earned less than that, she wouldn't have to file."}
{"original": "But it could be a good idea to do it anyway. If her employer withheld federal income tax, she might be entitled to a refund. You don't want her to miss out on that. Plus, it's a good learning experience."}
{"original": "Unearned income is a different story. If a child has unearned income above $1,050 for 2015, a tax return is required. But when dealing with unearned income only, you can choose to either file a separate return for your child or include that income on your own return. One caveat: If you include it on your return, it could boost you into a higher tax bracket--and possibly higher tax rates."}

{"original": "To make this a little clearer, let's say your daughter had $100 in interest income plus $5,000 in earned income. She wouldn't have to file a return because both her unearned and earned incomes are below the thresholds and her total income of $5,100 is less than $5,350 (earned income plus $350). However, if she had $400 in interest income, she would have to file because her total income of $5,400 would be more than her earned income plus $350."}

{"original": "You may have heard of the Kiddie Tax, so I think that's also worth a mention. This has to do with tax rates on unearned income."}
{"original": "For 2015, your child's unearned income less than $1,050 is not taxed. Unearned income between $1,050 and $2,100 is taxed at his or her rate. Unearned income above $2,100 is taxed at the parent's highest income tax rate. If your child has a lot of unearned income, that could be pretty significant."}
{"original": "Whether or not your daughter files a return, I'd definitely talk to her about taxes and withholding, and have her work with you as you prepare either hers or your own return."}
{"original": "Then take it beyond taxes and talk about responsible money management. Now that your daughter is earning her own money, help her create a budget so she can make the most of it. For instance, what do you expect her to pay for? Clothes? Entertainment? Gas? Have her keep track of her expenses monthly (an online budget calculator can help)."}

On January 9, 1966, Vernon Dahmer announced on the radio that he would pay the poll tax for anyone who could not afford to register to vote. (Despite the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, a poll tax was still charged in local elections in Mississippi.)"}
{"original": "The next day, Dahmer's home was firebombed by the Ku Klux Klan. Dahmer guarded the front door while his wife and children escaped out the back. He died the next day from severe burns and smoke inhalation."}
{"original": "The following remarks were prepared by sociologist and SNCC veteran Joyce Ladner for a commemoration of Vernon Dahmer on January 8, 2016, hosted by the Clarion Ledger in Jackson, Mississippi."}
{"original": "I want to thank the Dahmer family, particularly Ellie Dahmer and the Dahmer children who had to find ways to go on after his life was cut short. They kept his life and legacy in the forefront of our minds. They ensured that those who took his life were prosecuted. I also want to thank Jerry Mitchell, Clarion Ledger investigative reporter, who played a key role in the conviction of the Ku Klux Klan imperial wizard, Sam Bowers, who ordered the fatal firebombing of the Dahmer family."}
{"original": "January 10, 2016, will mark the 50th anniversary of the murder of civil rights martyr and American hero, Vernon Ferdinand Dahmer. He was a civil rights leader, community leader, and businessman in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. In the early hours of January 10, 1966, members of the Ku Klux Klan shot into and firebombed the home he shared with his wife and children in the Kelly Settlement section of Hattiesburg. It occurred soon after he announced on local radio that he would accept poll taxes at his grocery store and take them to the Forrest County Voting Registrar, Theron Lynd. He offered to pay the poll taxes for those who could not afford them. In doing so, he was going up against the formidable Lynd, who had a reputation for failing most Blacks on the literacy test when they tried to register to vote. I was a college senior when I failed the literacy test in 1964."}
{"original": "I will never forget the 6 A.M. call to my St. Louis apartment from my mother back in Hattiesburg who told me that the Ku Klux Klan had torched the Dahmer home and store to the ground, and that Mr. Dahmer was in critical condition. Her next call later that day was to tell me he had died. His murder caused me to have a loss of innocence because I was reminded that the civil rights struggle could still cause the unleashing of the most virulent racial violence against activists. I could not understand how he had survived for so long when others like Rev. George Lee, Emmett Till, Medgar Evers, Herbert Lee, Clyde Kennard, Louis Allen, Mack Charles Parker, the three civil rights workers (two of whom I knew), and others had died. I always saw Mr. Dahmer as a big bear of a man who was courageous, outspoken, and indestructible. How could they kill him too? I thought the most violent era of the Civil Rights Movement had passed. But his murder let me know that it hadn't."}
{"original": "Mr. Dahmer was president of the Hattiesburg NAACP chapter and led local and statewide voter registration campaigns at a time when one signed a death warrant by doing so. His mantra was, If you don't vote, you don't count. He was well known to Sam Bowers, the Ku Klux Klan leader in the area who ordered his murder. For a long time Vernon and Ellie took turns sleeping so that one could be awake if their home was attacked. However, they had stopped guarding their home shortly before the Klan attacked. That night at around 2 A.M., Molotov cocktails and gunfire were shot into the Dahmer home. Vernon helped Ellie and their young daughter and sons get out of the house through the windows. Then he went back into the house that was in flames and shot at his assailants to give his family time to find cover. His elderly aunt, who lived in the family grocery store next door, managed to get out safely as it also erupted in flames."}
{"original": "It was Vernon Dahmer's courageous trip back inside the flaming house that was fatal. He was only 58 years old. Four of his six sons, who were serving their country in the United States military, arrived home in time for the funeral to grieve for their father, the ultimate patriot, and to help to pick up the pieces from the devastating psychological, emotional, economic, political, and family carnage the Klan caused."}
{"original": "In his short 58 years, Dahmer launched voter registration drives, and adhered to the philosophy that it was his responsibility to be his brother and sister's keeper. Perhaps it was also his economic independence that made him a target for the Ku Klux Klan. He annexed large tracts of land, built a commercial farm of cotton, owned a sawmill, a planer mill, and a grocery store. He hired his Black neighbors from Kelley Settlement to work for him, thereby carrying out his philosophy of being a good neighbor. This was largely unheard of in the fifties and sixties because very few Black people owned businesses. The jobs he provided reduced Black flight to northern cities and strengthened the local community. Vernon Dahmer was a generous man who believed in the power of a united community. He was also a leader in the Shady Grove Baptist Church as leader of the choir and Sunday school Superintendent."}
{"original": "I met the man I still call Mr. Dahmer when I was in my early teenage years. His sister, Eileen Beard, was a member of our church and she and my mother were best friends. She invited my sister, Dorie, and me to go with her and her husband Kenneth, their neighbor civil rights activist Clyde Kennard, and her brother Vernon Dahmer to several statewide NAACP meetings in Jackson. As we rode up the old two-lane Highway 49, they talked about the importance of finding ways to get Negroes registered to vote. For Mr. Dahmer, voting was the only way to move from second class to full citizenship. I was spellbound as I listened to them talk about a subject that was so verboten that one could be killed for it. You see, this was the late 1950s when the NAACP was outlawed in Mississippi. These were extremely dangerous times."}
{"original": "When we arrived in Jackson, I surveyed the large number of cars and trucks bearing license plates from throughout Mississippi. I couldn't help but wonder if the white people would soon learn the names of those who attended these meetings. The police wrote down the tag numbers of all the vehicles and made sure that the police in each town knew who was present at the meeting. It led to attendees being fired from their jobs and violent harassment. This can be confirmed by perusing the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission records. I worried if the Hattiesburg police were going to have my father fired from his job. The harassment did not intimidate Mr. Dahmer, the Beards, or Clyde Kennard because they were determined to forge ahead in the uphill struggle for civil rights."}
{"original": "Those rides to and from the mass meetings in Jackson had a deep effect on me. Although I had a strong racial consciousness from the time I was a young child, meeting Vernon Dahmer and Clyde Kennard strengthened my desire to find ways to help my people take a stand against racial discrimination."}
{"original": "That time came in 1958 when Mr. Dahmer and Clyde Kennard invited Medgar Evers to Hattiesburg where they organized a Hattiesburg NAACP Youth Chapter. Teenagers from throughout the area came together at True Light Baptist Church to meet Evers, who was already a civil rights legend. Mr. Dahmer also invited Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) members Hollis Watkins and Curtis Hayes (Muhammad) to Hattiesburg in the early 1960s to stay at the family's farm and do voter registration organizing. These acts of courage launched a new generation of young people who were poised to strike a blow against segregation and discrimination. This would not have occurred had it not been for Vernon Dahmer."}
{"original": "Dahmer's contributions to the Civil Rights Movement were substantial. He was dedicated to the proposition that everyone should have the right to vote, irrespective of his or her race or social standing. He was courageous at a time when courage was in short supply. He helped to lay the groundwork for the protracted Civil Rights Movement that officially came to Mississippi with the arrival of the Freedom Riders in 1961. Most of all, he paid the ultimate price for the cause of civil rights by giving his life."}
{"original": "While Dahmer never had the chance to vote, his impact was evident when Ellie Dahmer was elected in 1992 to serve as the election commissioner. She served for more than a decade in the same district where her husband had been killed."}
{"original": "Today, we celebrate the life of Vernon Dahmer, without whose sacrifice 50 years ago there would be no Black legislators, desegregated schools, or a large Black professional class throughout the state. It is on the shoulders of Vernon Dahmer that young people continue to organize today for justice for all."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― Ever since President Donald Trump signed a massive corporate tax cut into law last month, some of the biggest American companies have been touting pay increases as evidence of profits translating into meaningful gains for workers."}
{"original": "But there's a problem with this spin: Nearly all of the companies involved, from Walmart to Wells Fargo, were wildly profitable before the legislation passed, and the benefits they're now promoting constitute just a tiny fraction those profits. Compared with the massive gains analysts expect to accrue to shareholders as a result of the new tax law, these perks really are, as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said earlier this month, little more than crumbs."}
{"original": "Whatever revenues corporations have left after paying for workers, supplies and other costs of doing business ― including taxes ― gets booked as corporate profit, enriching the company's owners. Nothing in the tax code prior to the GOP overhaul prevented companies from turning over any of these profits to their employees in the form of higher wages or bonuses. But by slashing the corporate tax rate rom 35 percent to 21 percent, the bill did make sure that a much larger share stays with shareholders. For some companies, the difference could mean billions of dollars a year."}
{"original": "Consider Verizon, HuffPost's parent company, which said it would give all its workers 50 shares, which will vest over two years. With about 161,000 employees, at $54 per share at the time of the announcement, the total benefit would come to about $434 million. Since the company said it would save $3.5 billion to $4 billion from the tax bill, the stock award represents somewhere between 10 percent and 28 percent of Verizon's annual tax savings, and just 1.4 percent of the company's profit in 2017."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, announced it would spend an additional $700 million over the next two years on employee pay, thanks to the tax bill. That's less than 5 percent of the company's most recent annual profit. Walmart announced the closure of 63 Sam's Club stores, which will result in hundreds of layoffs, the same week."}
{"original": "Companies are probably more interested in a short-term public relations boost than anything else, said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. We can't know whether these decisions had been made prior to the tax cuts."}
{"original": "None of this is preventing House Republicans from attempting to take credit for every dollar workers receive. For the families who are living paycheck-to-paycheck, an increase in take-home-pay and a $1,000 bonus to start out the new year ― these are not crumbs, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said in an email blast."}
{"original": "House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) is keeping an official running tally of more than 250 companies that have announced pay increases because of the tax bill. Of the 48 companies from the list that also ranked among the 500 biggest firms by revenue in 2017, only 18 are actually raising wages, as of Tuesday morning. Most are doling out small, one-time bonuses and improved retirement benefits. Some haven't announced pay increases of any kind."}
{"original": "Eleven of the 18 firms that did announce raises are banks, mostly bumping hourly pay to $15 ― which they would likely be doing without the advantageous tax changes."}
{"original": "One of the banks on the GOP list, Capital One, didn't mention the tax bill when it told employees their hourly pay would rise to $15. A bank spokesperson told HuffPost the raises had nothing to do with taxes."}
{"original": "As we noted to our associates, over the past year, we've focused on raising base pay as part of our long term pay strategy, the spokesperson said. Seeing top competitors move toward a minimum wage of $15/hour created an optimal opportunity for us to accelerate our pay strategy so that we can continue to maintain our competitive edge in attracting and retaining great talent."}
{"original": "In other words, the Capital One pay increase had more to do with labor market conditions than a desire to share tax bill savings. The median hourly pay for a bank teller in 2016 was $13.10, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and several banks had been slowly raising teller pay of late. In its announcement celebrating the tax bill, PNC acknowledged that its new $15-an-hour minimum wage would complete a goal that has been underway for some time. In their announcements, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, SunTrust, BB&T, and U.S. Bancorp all credited the tax bill for moving with their peers to a $15 minimum wage."}
{"original": "SunTrust also said it would hand out $1,000 employee bonuses ― but only to workers who completed a financial fitness program. Like other banks, SunTrust is raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour. The company also said it would offer unspecified merit based pay increases for certain other hourly teammates. SunTrust notched $2.3 billion in earnings in 2017."}
{"original": "Neither Bank of America nor American Express, which the GOP also listed as evidence that tax reform works, are raising wages as a result of the bill. Bank of America announced that it will pay a one-time bonus of $1,000 to 145,000 workers ― a total of less than 1 percent of the company's $18.2 billion profit from 2017 alone. American Express said it would make an unspecified incremental contribution to our employee profit-sharing plans."}
{"original": "Though Republicans cite Hartford Insurance Group's plan to give a $1,000 bonus to 9,500 employees ― an amount equal to about 3 percent of the dividends the company pays out each year ― the company's CEO sounded ambivalent about the overall consequences of the tax bill itself, worrying it would spur a race to the bottom in tax policy around the world."}
{"original": "I think we need to ultimately still recognize that the governments, the states need a certain percentage of revenue that supports basic goods and services, Christopher Swift said at a Connecticut Business and Industry Association conference."}
{"original": "It's possible the tax law itself created an incentive for companies to pay bonuses before the end of their fiscal years, which for some firms match the calendar year and for others extend through February. Since wages are deducted from a corporation's taxable income, and the corporate tax rate is sharply lower for fiscal 2018, firms have an incentive to boost compensation earlier in order to reduce the amount of income subject to the higher rate."}
{"original": "At the end of the day, total compensation for workers may be about the same as it would otherwise be, but the corporation gets tax savings from making the payment sooner rather than later, Daniel Hemel of the University of Chicago law school and David Kamin of the New York University law school wrote in a blog post on Saturday."}
{"original": "Several companies said last fall that they'd use a tax windfall for stock dividends and buybacks, not for higher wages, simply converting it into shareholder wealth. But Republicans insisted workers would eventually benefit from the law. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett wrote in an October paper that a lower corporate tax rate would spur investment that would ultimately result in wage increases of at least $4,000 annually. The wage hikes weren't supposed to spontaneously appear in press releases; the theory is that companies would make new capital investments that would eventually make workers more productive, and ultimately more valuable."}
{"original": "If the tax bill is sparking increased investment, it's probably too soon to tell. One influential analysis, by the financial firm Moody's, said not to expect a surge."}
{"original": "We do not expect a meaningful boost to business investment, Moody's analysts said in a report last week, arguing that most companies would use their increased profits to purchase shares of their own stock, enriching company owners, or by just paying off debt more quickly."}
{"original": "Dean Baker, a labor expert with the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the lack of raises among the corporate announcements suggested the new tax law hadn't really altered the labor market."}
{"original": "The fact they're giving bonuses indicates they don't feel confident enough the tax cut's changing the market environment where they will have to raise wages, Baker said."}

{"original": "Donald Trump sees Michael Cohen, and I would say justifiably, as the greatest threat to his presidency and what could be criminal and impeachable actions as president, Davis, who represents Cohen, told MSNBC's Kasie Hunt on Sunday."}
{"original": "Davis slammed Trump for Saturday's Fox News interview in which the president attacked Cohen and his father-in-law as Cohen prepares to publicly testify before Congress next month. Trump claimed Cohen, his longtime personal lawyer, is lying to get a sentence reduced and vaguely referenced possible wrongdoing by his father-in-law as the money in the family."}
{"original": "I and most Americans have no idea what President Trump is fantasizing about in demonizing the father-in-law of Michael Cohen ― the father of his wife ― and he won't even tell us, Davis said."}
{"original": "The president's pattern of incessant attacks show he feels the walls are closing in, Davis added."}
{"original": "Trump told Fox News' Jeanine Pirro that Cohen ought to stop trying to give up dirt on him and focus on his own father-in-law."}
{"original": "He's in trouble on some loans and fraud and taxi cabs and stuff that I know nothing about, and in order to get a sentence reduced, he says, 'I have an idea. I'll give you some information on the president,' Trump said of Cohen. Well, there is no information. But he should give information maybe on his father-in-law because that's the one that people want to look at because where does that money ― that's the money in the family."}
{"original": "Trump told Pirro he didn't know father-in-law Fima Shusterman's name."}
{"original": "Shusterman gave at least $20 million worth of loans from 2017 to 2018 to Yasya Shtayner, a woman whose family runs Chicago Medallion Management Corp., the Chicago Sun-Times reported last year. The business operates 368 cabs, according to the report, including 22 owned by Cohen."}
{"original": "In 1993, just before Shusterman's daughter married Cohen, Shusterman pleaded guilty to failing to abide by federal reporting rules for major cash transactions, according to The New York Times. He was sentenced to probation."}
{"original": "Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to tax fraud, making false statements to a bank, a campaign finance violation and lying to Congress about negotiations for a Trump Tower project in Moscow. He has said in court that Trump directed him to make hush money payments to two women who alleged affairs with Trump."}

{"original": "In Iowa, a bill that would directly give families over $5,000 to help finance the cost of private school is quickly making its way through the legislature. In Georgia, lawmakers introduced a bill that would give families savings accounts with money to use on private school tuition. In Florida, Republicans are set to push new legislation that would expand the state's already-vast network of publicly funded private school scholarships."}
{"original": "In the first few weeks of 2021, state legislators have introduced a wave of new bills designed to expand or create new voucher, tax credit and education savings account programs. While these programs are often controversial ― eliciting staunch opposition from public school groups and teachers unions ― advocates say they have seen new momentum after a wave of Republican wins in statehouses and a pandemic that has forced millions of schoolchildren to learn from home. So far, new legislation related to private school choice has been introduced in over 15 states during 2021."}
{"original": "Private school choice programs have long been a pet cause of conservatives, and expanding such initiatives was the singular goal of former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos during the Trump administration. While she failed to expand these programs on a federal level despite repeated attempts, they are experiencing a surge at the state level, just weeks after her departure."}
{"original": "The coronavirus has really opened people's eyes to the idea of alternatives to the public school system, said Mike McShane, director of national research at EdChoice, a group that promotes voucher programs. I think it's difficult to underestimate the role COVID has played and the unhappiness with the way traditional public schools responded to it."}
{"original": "In the past few weeks, McShane says, he has seen bills related to school choice prioritized and moved through state legislature committees at a breakneck speed. At the beginning of the Trump administration, enthusiasm for these programs waned, likely due in part to DeVos' unpopularity ― an EdChoice survey from that time found that a dip in approval for all school choice programs in 2016 ― but the organization is now finding that every form of school choice we poll is at its highest level of popularity right now."}
{"original": "A recent poll found that about 73% of the general population supported voucher programs. In 2016, this number had been at 57%, down from previous polling, according to the group's data."}
{"original": "In many communities, private schools have been more likely to open in person during the pandemic, and many report seeing higher rates of enrollment, in large part due to parents frustrated with the limitations of remote learning."}
{"original": "There's been debate within the school choice movement: Was DeVos or Trump a net positive or net negative? At some point, that kind of debate is academic because I think COVID just completely swamped it, said McShane."}

{"original": "School voucher programs take taxpayer money and directly funnel it to scholarships for families to help them afford private schools. Tax credit programs provide individuals or corporations with tax credits if they donate to organizations that dole out scholarships for private schools. In states with education savings accounts, families are given access to accounts with money to spend on private schools or other education services."}
{"original": "Supporters argue that these programs give students the opportunity to choose and attend the school that works best for them ― an option affluent families always have ― regardless of their own economic circumstances."}
{"original": "Public school advocates and unions have long lamented the influence of these programs, which they frame as a path to privatizing public schools. They argue that such programs funnel needed funds away from public school districts and into private institutions. As students use these scholarships, they take their per-pupil funding from the state with them, even as overhead costs for public schools, which required to serve all students, remain the same. Further, private schools aren't beholden to the same anti-discrimination rules, academic standards or requirements regarding students with disabilities as public schools, and a vast majority are religious."}
{"original": "About three-quarters of private schools that participate in voucher programs are religious, a previous HuffPost investigation found, with many of them using fundamentalist Christian, anti-science curriculum. Of religious schools that participate in these programs, at least 14% have explicit policies discriminating against LGBTQ students and staff. At least several schools push LGBTQ children to attend conversion therapy, a medically discredited practice that is illegal in over a dozen states, a HuffPost investigation found. In some states, voucher programs have sordid origins: They were used to help white families escape desegregated schools after Brown v. Board of Education."}
{"original": "But amid the pandemic and after a summer Supreme Court ruling that found states couldn't block religious schools from participating in voucher programs, voucher programs have seen a surge in forward energy, even if the court's ruling was largely symbolic."}
{"original": "We've been tracking these bills for three years now and this is a completely different level, said Katherine Dunn, a policy analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center's SPLC Action Fund, which is opposed to private school choice programs. We're not seeing a lot of bipartisan support for the proposals we're tracking ― it's a result of a lot of the gains from Republicans who are pushing these through."}
{"original": "A new Georgia bill is almost identical to one that was previously proposed in 2019, except it expands eligibility for a new education savings account program to include students whose school districts are not 100% in person. Also eligible are students from lower-income families, students who were adopted out of foster care, students with disabilities, a documented case of bullying, or parents in the military. While the bill failed to make it out of committee in 2019, it absolutely has more momentum this time around, said Stephen J. Owens, senior education policy analyst at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute."}
{"original": "I think lawmakers are seeing an opportunity; there's frustration with some parents about how some school openings or closing have gone, said Owens, whose group opposes these bills."}
{"original": "Owens takes particular issue with the bill's inclusion of students whose public school district isn't 100% in-person teaching, noting that it would apply to most kids in the state."}
{"original": "It's causing a lot of heartburn among district leaders, as some feel bullied to open in-person, sometimes against the wishes of the parents or teachers or a basic understanding of public health, he said."}
{"original": "[DeVos] didn't care about the pandemic as an issue to be solved, she saw it as an opportunity to jumpstart an agenda that had been going nowhere. Derek Black, professor of law at the University of South Carolina"}
{"original": "In Iowa, another school choice bill that is rapidly making its way through the legislature has also drawn the attention of critics. The bill would provide families with children attending low-performing public schools with over $5,000 to send their kids to private schools, and also allow students in schools under court-ordered desegregation plans to transfer to charter schools."}
{"original": "Iowa already has a tax credit program, albeit a small one, but past efforts to expand private school choice in the state have stalled. A recent analysis from the Iowa Legislative Services Agency found that if passed, the program would cost public schools nearly $4 million by its third year — a small fraction of the state's overall education budget, though critics say they believe the cost will prove higher."}
{"original": "Such a program would not start until the 2022 school year, a time when the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic has hopefully passed and public schools are on a path to normalcy."}
{"original": "Derek Black, professor of law at the University of South Carolina who focuses on education policy, is skeptical that these programs have become any more popular to citizens, despite legislators' sudden attention. Trump and DeVos may have also had a big hand in pushing Republican legislators to fast-track these bills."}
{"original": "In states where citizens got to vote on such initiatives through public referendums, they've been swiftly defeated. In 2018, an Arizona referendum that would have expanded the state's already-vast voucher program was voted down by a wide margin. And while these programs poll well among parents, Black suspects that's due to a failure to explain the detrimental impact vouchers could have on public schools or their inability to serve all students.

{"original": "Associating private school choice with the Trump brand may be helpful in red states, at least in the short-term, where legislators might be still working to display their Trumpian bonafides. Black also wonders if DeVos' ability to use the pandemic to attack traditional public schools may have been successful."}
{"original": "The passage of these bills may prove to be the former education secretary's greatest accomplishment, even if she's no longer in office."}
{"original": "If there's anything smart that DeVos ever did, malevolent as well, it was that she didn't care about the pandemic as an issue to be solved, she saw it as an opportunity to jumpstart an agenda that had been going nowhere, said Black. She didn't achieve much in federal policy change, but we're turning a blind eye to reality if we don't admit she did fundamentally change the way we talk about education, the specific terms we use."}

{"original": "He is testing the waters for a possible run in 2020 as a self-described centrist independent, but the reaction has led to a lot of flak from Twitter users, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and now The View co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar."}
{"original": "Schultz appeared on the show on Tuesday and said that he, a lifelong Democrat, felt compelled to run as an independent because of the toxicity and the lack of compromise of both parties."}
{"original": "Although he agreed that President Donald Trump was responsible for closing the government, Schultz said both sides deserve blame for the harm that came to 800,000 unpaid federal workers."}

{"original": "You talk about the Democrats not wanting to negotiate. They cannot negotiate with a toddler.

Now your entry into the race pretty much guarantees a Republican is going to win."}
{"original": "Schultz disagreed, saying that a far left Democrat would also lose the general election."}
{"original": "If he runs against a far-left, progressive person, who is suggesting 60 percent, 70 percent tax increases on the rich and a health care system we can't pay for, President Trump is going to get re-elected, Schultz said. All I'm saying is, let me go out to the country and let the people hear my story. I grew up in the projects of Brooklyn. I gave my company comprehensive health insurance, equity in the form of stock options and free college tuition for every employee."}
{"original": "Goldberg then told Schultz he was making the same kind of I'm a businessman claims that Trump used during his 2016 campaign."}
{"original": "This is the same problem you-know-who has, she said. When you own your company, you can make these changes as you want them to be. When you have to report to the Senate and the Congress and all the 50 million people that come in the middle, that's a little bit different."}
{"original": "Later in the show, Schultz said he doesn't want Trump to be re-elected ― and Behar had a sharp response."}

I'm up in the morning before my wife and after I get tired of sitting in the coffee place across the street, I walk back to the building and sit in the den watching the news, which always includes plenty about Trump, before going back to our apartment. Usually that's on Saturdays and Sundays, and there's never anybody else in it."}
{"original": "We were in Cleveland on a rare weekday to take our son to a medical appointment. When I was sitting in the den, an older gentleman was about to come in and saw me through the glass door, and then walked off. A little while later, a younger guy entered and quietly asked if it would be okay if he and a few others came in to do their morning prayers, telling me this is what they did in that room every day. I said sure, and would the TV bother him if I turned it down, or should I turn it off? He said the TV was fine. Soon after, the others joined him, including the older guy. They were Middle Eastern, and Muslim."}
{"original": "As they were getting ready, putting their rugs down, I felt the need to say, By the way, I despise Donald Trump. They chuckled quietly and went about their prayers. Then my phone dinged, which was my wife letting me know she was up, and I headed out."}

Sure, middle aged white guys are responsible for most of our country's ills. But even if I've been aware of that forever, I don't remember feeling the need to apologize for it. Don't get me wrong – I don't mean because I voted for Trump. Hell no. And I didn't stay home, or vote for a third, fourth or 10th party candidate either."}

{"original": "Earlier in the year, Baltimore Ravens Justin Tucker, one of the best in the league, sought to make a field goal. But he was, by all accounts, partly swallowed up by a sort of sinkhole in the middle of the field, missing his 3-pointer, of course. It was hardly the only play of the game where players slipped and slid on the field, affecting the outcome of the game."}
{"original": "Levi's Stadium is regarded as the worst NFL field, as the 49ers football team that plays on it can't even get real practices in. They've had to continually resod the field. Practices have to be canceled while the stadium is fixed. But it's a new stadium, and that's all that matters."}

It bakes the fans on both sides in early season games. It does not protect the fans from the elements. Many fans headed for the exits during one Miami Super Bowl, thanks to a tropical drenching."}

Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Army veteran Tony Raskins, retired Tuskegee Airman Charles McGee and his great-grandson, and fourth-grader Janiyah Davis and her single mother.

Later, he launched into a xenophobic tirade about undocumented immigrants, describing them as criminal aliens running loose in sanctuary cities."}
{"original": "The speech, like his reelection campaign's Super Bowl ad touting his commutation of a life sentence for nonviolent offender Alice Marie Johnson, and his supporters' cash giveaways in Black communities, show how Trump plans to court Black voters in 2020 ⁠— sleight-of-hand appeals, self-aggrandizing claims of success and hollow promises."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, he's still attacking policies that actually help communities of color, like the Affordable Care Act. And he never let go of the birther lie."}
{"original": "The Los Angeles Times recently covered an EdBuild report about the California State Lottery, which is presented to the public as a means of generating funding for public education. What the program actually amounts to, however, after all the costs and winnings are siphoned away, is a transfer of $449 million out of the state's poorest communities and into schools in better-off areas."}
{"original": "Check out our report to explore all of our visualizations and data, including the exploratory map of every lottery retailer's annual sales and select neighborhood schools throughout the state."}
{"original": "To our knowledge, this is a study that makes accessible one of the largest data sets on the lottery and schools to date, and it was important for two reasons. First, this isn't just a California problem. Lotteries are government programs that exist to generate public revenue, and in 35 states, their stated purpose is supporting public schools-- across the country, they prove to be both inefficient and dramatically regressive. Lotteries in these states raise $54 billion, largely from low-income communities, of which only $15 billion is returned to schools."}
{"original": "But the second and more significant reason that this study deserves attention is that the lottery, while it may make up a small portion of education funds, is just one example of the unfair and inequitable ways that America funds its schools. Certainly, it doesn't seem just that West Compton is only getting $164 per student back from the lottery when the neighborhood spends $11,650 per student on lottery tickets. Similarly, it isn't fair that, on the other side of the country, the city of East Hartford, Connecticut is taxing itself at a rate four times higher than the much more affluent town of Greenwich to pay for schools, simply because school systems rely heavily on property taxes, and East Hartford's property is worth so much less. Similarly, states that require school districts to cover a minimum share of student costs- regardless their ability to pay- like Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Iowa, also perpetuate inequity by forcing low-income districts to draw on more limited tax bases to support students with greater needs."}
{"original": "Lotteries are also clearly representative of the entrenched nature of regressive education funding systems in general. This is powerfully illustrated by the whirlwind case of Texas where, in 2013, state representatives who opposed the lottery program as a regressive tax on the poor won a short-lived victory, garnering enough votes to eliminate the it. The roll call was decisive--81 voted to abolish the lottery, while 65 voted to keep it--but lottery defenders argued that the state couldn't afford to lose the $2.2 billion generated by the program (about 5% of the state's nonfederal education revenue in 2012-13), and by that afternoon, the House held another vote and reversed itself. (In a halfhearted gesture, the state instead appointed a commission to evaluate the lottery; the group's report ultimately recommended retaining the program.)"}
{"original": "This story demonstrates that even when there is overwhelming agreement that a program sources public money disproportionately from poor communities and is, in fact, bad policy, it can be incredibly hard to get rid of. As public education becomes reliant on a revenue source, it becomes entrenched, and any effort to eliminate it must either risk leaving schools in the red or must find more progressive sources of funding."}
{"original": "Across the country we see examples, from the lottery to property and sales tax schemes, that rely on low-wealth communities putting in more effort--that is, investing a higher proportion of their disposable incomes--to fund their schools than their affluent neighbors do. In a country that leans so heavily on these revenue streams to support education, it will be a hard, political slog to create school finance systems that promote real equity. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be talking about it- in fact, we should raise our voices louder."}
{"original": "Our states should be funding schools in a manner that balances the scales for students and communities with significant economic needs. However, when funds are raised disproportionately from the lowest-income areas, it places an extra weight on poor communities. And when funds aren't distributed back to the schools in a way that recognizes and responds to the needs of students, all hope of balance is lost."}
{"original": "Democrats are beginning to write President Joe Biden's proposal for emergency COVID-19 relief into actual legislation, unveiling a bill Monday that covers some of the biggest parts of what is expected to be a $1.9 trillion package."}
{"original": "That includes another round of stimulus checks. Most U.S. households would receive $1,400 per person under the legislation House Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.) released, though for this third series of checks, Democrats are cutting off higher-income Americans."}
{"original": "The legislation is a win for progressives who have been fighting against calls from more moderate Democratic and Republican colleagues to reduce the number of families that would receive direct payments by lowering the income eligibility thresholds."}
{"original": "Nonetheless, the House bill is a compromise. All individuals making $75,000 or less (and all joint filers earning $150,000 or less) would receive full payments of $1,400, as Biden originally proposed, but the checks will cut off altogether for individuals who make more than $100,000 (or twice that for joint filers). The changes appear to be partly due to the White House's concerns about higher-earning Americans receiving direct payments."}
{"original": "Our nation is struggling, the virus is still not contained, and the American people are counting on Congress to meet this moment with bold, immediate action, Neal said in a statement. From increasing direct assistance to those who need it most to expanding tax credits for low- and middle-income workers, we deliver substantial solutions in this package."}
{"original": "The bill also extends federal unemployment programs, but only through August instead of September, as Biden had proposed in his original outline of the COVID-19 relief plan. Current emergency federal unemployment benefits are set to expire in mid-March, which threatens the livelihoods of an estimated 11.2 million Americans, according to one estimate."}
{"original": "Republicans and some moderate Democrats have sought to taper down some of Biden's proposals in recent weeks, spurring backlash from some lawmakers who emphasized that Democrats won the White House and their narrow majority in the Senate on a promise of another round of stimulus checks and a robust emergency package."}
{"original": "It's unclear whether Senate Democrats will keep the exact same structure for direct payments in their coronavirus relief legislation. Both chambers are tasked with writing separate legislation under special budget rules that will allow Democrats to pass the $1.9 trillion package via a simple majority vote. The goal is to merge the two bills and send the final product to Biden's desk by March."}
{"original": "Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a key moderate who had called for slimming down portions of the bill, said he was open to the House Democrats' proposed changes for direct payments."}
{"original": "As long as we're targeting to people that really need it, Manchin told reporters on Monday."}
{"original": "The House bill also includes a major proposal to expand the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600 and make it fully refundable so that parents with no income can receive the credit as cash refunds. The extra payments could sharply reduce child poverty."}
{"original": "The legislation tells the Internal Revenue Service to distribute the payments in advance, on a monthly basis, so that the credit essentially becomes a child allowance ― but only if the IRS can handle the task."}
{"original": "A summary of the legislation says the payments are intended to be delivered on a monthly basis starting in July, but if the IRS discovers that the job is infeasible, then it can issue the payments as frequently as is feasible."}
{"original": "Despite concerns about feasibility, Democrats stuck with their child tax credit expansion even after Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) proposed a similar monthly child benefit that would be paid by the Social Security Administration, an agency with a lot more experience paying monthly benefits."}
{"original": "Democrats have very little room for error if they want to make good on Biden's first and most pressing campaign promise and pass these bills before federal benefits programs expire on March 14."}
{"original": "It's become increasingly clear that Republicans aren't going to sign on to Biden's proposal, and the White House has been adamant that significantly slimming down the relief package would fail to address the current public health and economic crisis. That means every Senate Democrat has to be on board with the final package to pass it through budget reconciliation."}
{"original": "The risk here is not doing too much, it's doing too little, Jared Bernstein, a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, told HuffPost last week."}
{"original": "The stakes continue to be high. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned over the weekend that the job market was stalling in an interview with CBS Sunday. The January jobs report showed meager improvements to the economy and bleak numbers for the job market. The labor force is shrinking, millions remain unemployed, and key industries like retail, health care, transportation and hospitality are still shedding jobs."}
{"original": "With the March benefits deadline just more than a month away, Democratic-led House committees, like the Ways and Means Committee, which handles all tax-related policy in addition to unemployment programs and benefits for families, are releasing their portions of what will ultimately be the $1.9 trillion package."}
{"original": "On Monday, a separate House committee on labor and education also released a bill that covers Biden's plan to safely reopen schools. It includes $130 billion in funding for ventilation systems, reducing class sizes and obtaining protective gear, among other things. The legislation allocates $39 billion for child care providers to cover costs for families struggling to keep up with tuition."}
{"original": "Notably, Democrats included the hotly debated proposal to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next four years — something Manchin has already said he opposes.

The complaint asks the court to invalidate the probe and bar the two officials from attempting to move forward with it."}

{"original": "But legal and advocacy groups protested the allegations, which derived primarily from crosschecks with records maintained by the state's Department of Public Safety, which issues driver's licenses and identification cards. Applicants have to show proof of citizenship when they apply for such documents, but don't need to check in again if they naturalize later as U.S. citizens. Critics contend the list is almost certainly loaded with false positives, most of whom were legal permanent residents when they first started driving, but later became citizens."}

{"original": "The LULAC lawsuit described Whitley and Paxton's Friday news dump as a carefully crafted and orchestrated program to spread inaccurate information that allowed them to publicly state whatever they wished without fear of contradiction on any specifics.

{"original": "Democrats in Congress hope they can find enough votes to pass a $15 minimum wage bill and send it to President Joe Biden's desk. But within the next three months or so, the new administration plans to institute a $15 wage floor for some workers on its own."}
{"original": "Under a campaign proposal that Biden has reaffirmed since taking office, government procurement rules would be changed so that workers employed under federal contracts would have to be paid at least $15 per hour. That could increase wages for at least a quarter of a million workers across the country in food service, building maintenance, construction and other fields."}
{"original": "Executive action, by its nature, is limited: The vast majority of U.S. workers are not paid with federal tax dollars. But such an order from Biden would be arguably the biggest boost yet of progressives' pursuit of a $15 minimum wage floor for all. Many low-wage federal contractors could see their pay increase by more than a third, potentially pulling some out of poverty."}
{"original": "It will be a big deal for hundreds of thousands of workers, said Karla Walter, senior director of employment policy at the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-aligned think tank. It will ensure that those workers are earning decent wages and benefits to do the work of the federal government, and it will re-exert the federal government's role as being a model employer."}
{"original": "Drew Angerer via Getty Images President Joe Biden plans to raise the wage floor for federal contractors to $15 an hour."}
{"original": "The government does not keep reliable statistics on the contract workforce, so experts say it is difficult to know exactly how many workers would see a raise if Biden issues the order. But back-of-the-napkin math extrapolated from a Labor Department analysis of a similar proposal suggests around 240,000 workers would be directly impacted, said Heidi Shierholz, the agency's former chief economist who is now with the Economic Policy Institute. Shierholz said such an estimate would be conservative."}
{"original": "Indeed, many additional workers would likely feel the effects as contract employers readjust their pay scales to reflect the new minimum. Some companies may decide to increase the wages of workers already earning $15 so that those workers don't find themselves at the bottom of the pay ladder alongside less-experienced colleagues. And competition for workers could force businesses not directly impacted by the order to raise their wages as well."}
{"original": "There is no guarantee that Biden will move ahead with the plan, but the administration says it has begun the work that would allow the president to sign such an order within 100 days. For Shierholz, the plan demonstrates that Biden is serious about wielding executive power to help workers in a way that former President Donald Trump did not."}
{"original": "The devil is in the details in a lot of these things, and there's still a lot of important policy decisions to be made, she said. But at this stage, I'm very encouraged."}
{"original": "Using the power of the federal purse to improve working conditions in the private sector is nothing new. Presidents going back at least to Franklin Delano Roosevelt tweaked contracting rules to influence private workplace policies and address discrimination. The basic idea is straightforward: Instead of subsidizing crappy jobs, the government should use its weight to set a higher bar for working conditions."}
{"original": "In 2014, then-President Barack Obama utilized the very same tool to set $10.10 as the minimum for certain workers under federal contracts. Obama's executive order tied the contractor wage floor to an inflation index, so that minimum has since risen to $10.95. The Biden administration has not said how quickly a hike to $15 might take place."}
{"original": "The center of gravity in the [Democratic] party when it comes to labor has shifted dramatically. Joseph Geevarghese, director of Our Revolution"}
{"original": "But Biden's campaign proposal indicates how mainstream the concept of a $15 minimum wage has become, thanks to the success of the Fight for $15, a union-backed campaign to boost wages that began in 2012. It also demonstrates just how much Biden himself has evolved on the minimum wage and the use of executive power since the Obama years."}
{"original": "A year after the Fight for $15 began, the Obama-Biden team urged Congress to raise the federal minimum wage ― to $9 per hour. Progressive Democrats eventually got the president on board with a $10.10 proposal. At that point, very few members of Congress were willing to support $15 publicly, aside from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and then-Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.)."}
{"original": "Labor activists recall a difficult time persuading the Obama White House to do more for workers through executive orders. Then-Vice President Biden headed up a middle class task force that produced economic proposals but not much in the way of implemented policy."}
{"original": "Joseph Geevarghese sat in some of those meetings as the director of Good Jobs Nation, a union-backed campaign aimed at improving low-wage jobs under federal contracts. Geevarghese, now director of the progressive group Our Revolution, said the Biden team resisted executive action then, particularly when it came to using procurement rules to influence labor policy. They often cited legal reasons for not pushing ahead with executive orders, he recalled."}
{"original": "Good Jobs Nation grew so frustrated that they eventually staged demonstrations outside the White House, with striking janitorial and fast-food workers calling on the Obama administration to increase wages for federal contractors. Those demonstrations coincided with the Fight for $15's nationwide strikes, which drew national headlines."}
{"original": "Geevarghese credits those workers with Biden's evolution."}
{"original": "It's a testament to the fact that there was tremendous grassroots pressure on the Democratic Party, he said. The center of gravity in the party when it comes to labor has shifted dramatically."}
{"original": "The Obama administration eventually did use its powers to help federal contract workers, implementing not only the $10.10 order but other executive actions as well, including one meant to punish contractors with a history of wage theft and work hazards. But some of those efforts came so late in the Obama years that the Trump administration and congressional Republicans were able to quickly undo them."}
{"original": "It will be a big deal for hundreds of thousands of workers. Karla Walter, a senior director at the Center for American Progress"}
{"original": "President Biden appears determined not to make the same mistake. He has already revoked Trump executive actions that undermined labor unions and is moving ahead quickly with his own orders. He even took the precedent-breaking step of firing the Trump-appointed general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board."}
{"original": "These first signals are positive, Geevarghese said. Biden's not going to hold back. He's not going to try to depend on congressional cooperation. He's going to lead by example."}
{"original": "Still, the impact of a minimum wage order depends on how it's crafted. The administration could set tight boundaries around which workers qualify for a $15 floor, limiting the order's economic reach. Or it could create broad criteria that include more workers. The Obama order applied primarily to federal contracts related to services, concessions and construction ― i.e., subcontracted janitors in federal buildings, cooks and cashiers in parks and cafeterias, and construction workers on public projects."}
{"original": "Walter, of the Center for American Progress, said the Biden administration could try to apply a $15 minimum wage to large groups of workers who produce goods for the government. She offered the example of a poultry plant processing chickens that go to feed troops or other workers under a defense contract."}
{"original": "Republicans and business groups have strongly opposed a $15 minimum wage, saying it would be too dramatic an increase and force companies to lay off unskilled workers, particularly in less expensive markets. But $15 for federal contractors should draw far fewer doomsday predictions, as the government itself would ultimately absorb the cost through more expensive contracts."}
{"original": "Biden, like many Democrats, has been stumping for a $15 federal minimum wage that would apply everywhere. He even inserted that proposal into his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, bundled with stimulus payments, unemployment benefits, state and local aid, and other goodies."}
{"original": "The Democratic-controlled House passed a $15 proposal in 2019 and recently introduced a similar bill. Meanwhile, Sanders and other progressives have been making the case for Democrats to push the minimum wage raise through the Senate without any GOP support, using a procedural maneuver known as budget reconciliation."}
{"original": "But Democrats hold a bare 50-seat majority in the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting a tie-breaking vote. It's not clear that they would have enough support within their own caucus to move so aggressively on the minimum wage, or that the Senate parliamentarian would approve of such a use of reconciliation."}
{"original": "In other words, a federal minimum wage of $15 could be bottled up in Congress for months or years to come. For some, that's even more reason for Biden to do whatever he can on his own."}
{"original": "There's a huge low-wage federal contract workforce, Geevarghese said. This would set the precedent: If you want to do business with the U.S. government, you have to be a model employer and you have to pay a decent wage."}
{"original": "When college student Trevor Hill stood up at a CNN town hall in 2017 and asked House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) if her party might move further left to mark a starker break with right-wing economics, her answer was clear: I thank you for your question but I have to say we're capitalist. And that's just the way it is."}
{"original": "No major Republican has felt a similar need to affirm loyalty to capitalism; everyone quite rightly assumes it. Yet the two major U.S. political parties' shared celebration of capitalism raises basic questions about U.S. society that deserve more attention than they get."}
{"original": "Capitalism's fundamental political problem is its class division between a small number of people who are employers and the majority who are employees."}
{"original": "Capitalism's cycles between good and bad times, as well as the inequality it produces through vast gaps in income and wealth, cause conflict and division. And these tensions threaten the whole system, as the recent yellow jackets mass movement in France demonstrates. There, a fuel tax rise sparked weeks of protest across the country as those who live beyond France's wealthy urban centers rejected ― occasionally violently ― yet another rise in their cost of living and demanded growing concessions from French capitalism."}
{"original": "In response, employers have built political alliances with some parts of the employee class. For example, inside the Republican Party, they worked long-standing deals with evangelicals to, for example, oppose abortion and coalesce around Supreme Court nominees, while inside the Democratic Party, they made alliances with large groups of religious and ethnic minorities."}
{"original": "They have had to make these and many more such political alliances because they are simply too vulnerable to go it alone. Their alliances' goals always included making sure that the capitalist system itself survived, partly by preventing the majority from voting for tax and regulation policies that would undo the inequalities and instabilities of capitalism."}
{"original": "Whichever party wins, it's capitalism that prevails."}
{"original": "Despite its socially destabilizing business cycles and income inequality, U.S. capitalism has been able to reproduce itself. This was achieved through the employer alliances constructed within both major political parties."}
{"original": "The aim of the Republicans is to identify and appeal directly to segments of the majority that feel aggrieved or threatened by certain social trends. In the U.S., this has meant appealing to, for example, white people facing the decline of white supremacist and racist practices; men seeing their dominance lessen over women at work and at home; and religious people facing the rise of secularism or disinterest in religion."}
{"original": "It's a gathering together of conservatives fearing the changes that are undermining old social positions and privileges. Its appeal is simple and clear. Vote for the GOP to have the government slow, stop or reverse those trends. The party always links that appeal to a rigid commitment to preserving and strengthening the economy. By this they mean private property, markets and businesses where a dominant class of employers rules over employees."}
{"original": "The Democrats' mode of alliance is to appeal to the entire class of employees by endorsing state programs of mass economic, social and cultural support. For example through subsidized higher education, unemployment insurance, Social Security increases and so on. The Democrats' plan is to pay such programs' costs by means of taxes imposed partly on employers and partly on employees."}
{"original": "These state programs are pitched to employers as relatively inexpensive ways of preserving and strengthening a social solidarity that includes and so supports capitalism. The programs are pitched to employees as benefits flowing from the capitalist economy if and when they have voted to put the government in Democratic Party hands."}
{"original": "The Democrats have generally built alliances with those segments of the employee class who most need government support (those paid below median wage and salary levels) and with those who welcome those social trends such as secularism, urbanism, diverse sexuality and immigration that upset the people who the Republicans target for alliances. The so-called culture wars in the U.S. both reflect and reinforce the class alliances constructed inside the two parties."}
{"original": "Both parties push partnership between employers and employees as an essential goal, while accusing the other party of threatening or undermining that partnership. Both also get the bulk of their funding for pursuing these political goals from capitalist employers. Donations from employees make up a much smaller proportion of their funding."}
{"original": "Whichever party wins, it's capitalism that prevails. The statements and activities of the party in opposition serve to funnel disaffection with the party in power into votes for regime change. Capitalism is kept out of the debates, gets a critical pass and remains secure."}
{"original": "It also blocks possibilities for more than two parties. The GOP and Democratic Party have together produced and sustained the rules that make third parties difficult to start or maintain."}
{"original": "In many other capitalist countries, it was not possible to limit political parties to two. In France, Germany and beyond, while there are center-left and center-right parties similar to the Democratic and Republican parties in the U.S., there are also politically significant parties further to the right and left. In France, for example, the National Front is a powerful rightist party led by Marine Le Pen, while the La France Insoumise (France unsubdued) is a powerful leftist formation led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon."}
{"original": "ARIS OIKONOMOU via Getty Images António Costa is Portugal's socialist prime minister. In many countries other than the U.S., green and anti-capitalist socialist parties are components of government coalitions."}
{"original": "In several European countries, green parties are also important. In Portugal and Luxembourg, green and anti-capitalist socialist parties are components of government coalitions. Democracy in all such countries reflects people's demands for freedom to choose among parties with divergent attitudes toward capitalism. In contrast, the U.S. ― the nation that most loudly and routinely proclaims its commitment to democracy ― rigidly restricts its political parties to two that both celebrate capitalism."}
{"original": "Modern party politics has its contradictions. By its growing dependence on major donations from corporations, it risks exposing its class nature. Failures of major parties to solve key social problems increasingly provoke people to turn against the party system. Contemporary movements for social change are increasingly skeptical of allying with any existing political parties."}
{"original": "France's yellow jackets movement ― successful in defeating President Emmanuel Macron's attempts to introduce taxes that disproportionately hit those least able to afford them ― illustrates that skepticism perfectly."}
{"original": "Similarly, the entry of Elizabeth Warren into the 2020 presidential primaries ― like Bernie Sanders' effort in 2016 ― moves in the direction of politically mobilizing the increasingly broad social disaffection with capitalism. Time will tell whether U.S. conditions make that direction sustainable within a changed Democratic Party or only outside it."}
{"original": "There is an emerging sense that new and very different parties are needed, parties that gather many segments of the employee class for a confrontation with all those who explicitly or implicitly accept and support capitalism."}

{"original": "LOS ANGELES -- California has squandered hundreds of millions of tax dollars on faulty convictions that have led to people collectively wasting hundreds of years behind bars, according to a new report on the state's criminal justice system."}
{"original": "Researchers examined 692 failed adult felony convictions that occurred in the state between 1989 and 2012, and released their findings Wednesday in a blistering report. A failed conviction is one that is later reversed or dismissed due to a number of legal problems, including an innocent person being wrongfully charged in a crime they did not commit; a judge, prosecutor or police officer committing misconduct or error during a case; or a case being built on the back of faulty or incomplete evidence."}
{"original": "These flawed proceedings have cost California taxpayers more than $282 million, according to the Criminal (In)Justice study, which was released by the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Law and Social Policy at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law."}
{"original": "In part, these millions of dollars come from expenses incurred from incarcerating people with faulty convictions and settlements in lawsuits over these errors. The slew of legal proceedings that led up to these faulty convictions -- including hundreds of jury trials, dozens of mistrials and hung juries and more than 700 appeals and petitions -- were also costly."}
{"original": "The researchers took a novel approach in the sample cases they included: Rather than focusing solely on wrongful convictions, they also included defendants who were found not guilty or whose convictions were ultimately dismissed. For various reasons, the state could not prove these people -- who may or may not be innocent -- had committed a crime."}
{"original": "The bottom line is every case we included was someone who was targeted, arrested, prosecuted, convicted, almost always incarcerated -- for sometimes a long period of time -- and at the end of the day they went home without a conviction, Rebecca Silbert, report co-author and senior vice president at the Opportunity Institute in Berkeley, California, told The Huffington Post."}
{"original": "In some of those cases they clearly didn't do it, in some of those cases it's not as clear, but it's a problem either way, she said."}
{"original": "By far, the most expensive flawed convictions that were later reversed or dismissed were in homicide cases -- more than half of all the costs in the report originated from failed homicide prosecutions."}
{"original": "If held back-to-back and nonstop, the reversed and dismissed cases detailed in the report would keep a single courtroom with a full staff of judges, juries and attorneys working for more than 20 years, the researchers note."}
{"original": "But the tax dollars spent represents only a fragment of the total damage done. The nearly 700 individuals who were subjected to these failed prosecutions perhaps paid the ultimate price -- collectively, they lost over 2,000 years in jails or prisons."}
{"original": "But that's just the beginning of their problems. Employers can see if a job applicant has been sentenced to prison, but can't always find out if he or she has been dismissed due to a faulty conviction. Formerly incarcerated people who do get jobs tend to have significantly diminished incomes, even long after leaving prison. And children of people who have been incarcerated are likely to be stigmatized, suffer long-term emotional and behavioral challenges, and have a greater chance of living in poverty or general instability at home."}
{"original": "The individuals in this report were often incarcerated in the prime of their lives, in the time when they could have been getting an education, starting a career, and building a family, the report states."}
{"original": "And flawed convictions are not resolved quickly. In the hundreds of cases researchers examined, defendants fought on average for four and a half years before their convictions were finally dismissed. In about one-quarter of all the cases, more than five years passed between the first appearance in the system and the case ultimately being reversed and dismissed. Some were in prison for more than 20 years, and others would have spent life in prison without parole had their cases not been overturned."}
{"original": "California convicts roughly 200,000 people each year, and the report looks at less than 700 faulty convictions over a little more than a decade. Some people may consider that to be an acceptable rate of error. But Silbert wholeheartedly rejects that notion."}
{"original": "Nobody ever said, 'It's only one airplane that crashed or just one person who died on the operating table, what's your problem?' she said. It's medical malpractice and airline safety that you see this idea that we should have a zero error rate -- I don't see why criminal defendants should be any different."}
{"original": "Because there's no systematic way to identify these cases, Silbert said there are probably several others that weren't included in the research."}
{"original": "We did the best we could, but we know for sure we haven't covered all the errors, and all the damage done, by a system that doesn't always work well, Silbert said."}
{"original": "Here are the primary causes of these flawed proceedings that cost so much:"}
{"original": "Prosecutorial misconduct was the most expensive issue, even though it wasn't the most common issue overall or evenly distributed among all the various crimes in the cases -- it most frequently occurred in faulty homicide cases and prosecutions for lewd acts on a minor. Overall, it accounted for $53 million, or nearly one-quarter of all costs tallied in the report."}
{"original": "Misconduct by a prosecutor can consist of many actions, such as perjury, soliciting false or misleading evidence and presenting it in court, tampering with evidence, or failing to turn over evidence to the defense. It can be intentional or accidental, but all of it derails a defendant's right to a fair trial."}
{"original": "The trouble is identifying the misconduct. Because so much of what prosecutors do is behind the scenes -- gathering evidence and working with police and investigators as they build their case -- malfeasance is often not discovered until years, sometimes decades, after a conviction. In many cases, it's never discovered at all."}
{"original": "But the available data on prosecutorial misconduct clearly points to a problem that is steady and widespread. Misconduct by police and prosecutors occurs with such frequency that it has become one of the primary causes of wrongful convictions, according to the criminal justice reform group Innocence Project."}
{"original": "California prosecutors caught cheating the system often don't face consequences. There were more than 700 cases of prosecutorial misconduct in the state between 1997 and 2009, according to a 2010 study the Northern California Innocence Project. Only six prosecutors in those cases were ever disciplined."}
{"original": "Prosecutorial misconduct also has one of the most destructive effects on the the criminal justice system as a whole because it fundamentally perverts the course of justice and costs taxpayers millions of dollars in protracted litigation and undermines our trust in the reliability of the justice system and subverts the notion that we are a fair society, the Northern California Innocence Project study says."}
{"original": "Prosecutors were responsible for another $19 million in costs for proceeding with cases in which the evidence, facts or law did not support it moving forward, according to Criminal (In)Justice."}
{"original": "This kind of error occurs when prosecutors pursue a conviction in a case, but a later discovery indicates that there isn't sufficient evidence to support it or that the defendant's behavior was not actually criminal, for example."}
{"original": "These errors as a whole reflect misjudgment or overzealousness by the prosecution and are therefore grouped as 'failure of discretion,' the report reads."}
{"original": "Jury misconduct -- meaning jurors not following instructions, or improperly considering evidence when deciding the fate of a defendant -- occurred across many of the cases analyzed in the report. It cost taxpayers $32 million."}
{"original": "Misconduct from a jury member can begin during the jury selection process -- if a prospective juror does not disclose any conflicts -- and can continue during the trial -- for example, if a juror discusses the case with someone not on the jury. It can have disastrous effects on the outcome of a trial."}
{"original": "The report highlights the case of Darrell Hunter, who in 2000 was convicted of killing 20-year-old Ronald Small at a party three years earlier. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, even though he denied being at the party and there was no physical evidence connecting him to the crime. However, a judge later discovered that a juror had given misleading responses during the jury selection process. Hunter was granted a new trial. With new evidence and a new jury, he was found not guilty in 2008 and released."}
{"original": "Problems with eyewitnesses cost another $31 million, the report found. This category includes witnesses lying, retracting their testimony or identifying the wrong person, as well as police improperly conducting eyewitness identification procedures."}
{"original": "The cases involving mistaken eyewitness identification are legion, U.S. Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski, a leading voice on misconduct in the criminal justice system, wrote last year."}
{"original": "Indeed, eyewitness misidentification plagues the criminal justice system and is one of the leading factors of wrongful convictions in the U.S., playing a role in more than 70 percent of convictions that are later overturned through DNA evidence, according to the Innocence Project. And while research has shown that eyewitness identifications are highly unreliable, especially, as Kozinski notes, when the the witness and the alleged perpetrator are of different races, the evidence continues to be heavily relied upon in criminal cases."}
{"original": "The case of Kevin Lee Green, detailed by the Innocence Project, is a startling example of how mistaken eyewitness testimony can taint a case. On Sept. 30, 1979, Green, was a 21-year-old corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps who came home to find his 20-year-old pregnant wife, Dianna Green, unconscious in bed. She had been raped and strangled and had suffered a blow to the head. When she regained consciousness, Dianna had no memory of the event. She lost the ability to speak and her baby was stillborn."}
{"original": "Despite her memory loss, Dianna testified that her husband had attacked her after an argument. Green said he was at a local fast food restaurant when the attack happened, and a cashier at the restaurant provided an alibi for him. Without any evidence other than his wife's testimony, Green was sentenced in 1980 to 15 years to life in prison for the attack. Later, when DNA testing became more advanced, evidence discovered at the scene was found to match the DNA of a serial killer named Gerald Parker. In 1996, Parker confessed to attacking Dianna and to committing five other murders. After 16 years in prison, Green was finally exonerated. The California governor at the time, Gray Davis, awarded Green $620,000 in compensation for the time he spent in prison for the crime he never committed."}
{"original": "The Sixth Amendment guarantees everyone the right to effective legal representation, but the report found that doesn't always occur in California. And a defense attorney who fails to represent their client appropriately, through negligence before or during a trial, can have profoundly negative consequences for a defendant. The report found such problems cost state taxpayers $27 million."}
{"original": "Take the case of DeAndre Maurice Howard, who was found guilty of opening fire on two men in South Los Angeles. One died and one was wounded, and Howard was sentenced to 75 years in prison. But two years later, the victim who survived the shooting gave a sworn statement that Howard was not the gunman, adding that he would have testified as such if he'd been called as a witness. After years of rejected appeals, Howard was finally granted a new trial after alleging that his attorney was ineffective for not having called the surviving witness during his original trial. He was found not guilty on all charges and finally released after spending 11 years in prison."}
{"original": "The report also found that police violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable search and seizures, in an overwhelming number of state drug cases and in a smaller number of weapons cases."}
{"original": "When police make a search without a warrant and obtain illegal evidence, the court is obligated to block that evidence -- even if it's proof that a crime has been committed. But once the evidence is rejected, the case is frequently dismissed and all the resources that went into the case up until that point go to waste, which has cost taxpayers $12 million overall, according to the report."}
{"original": "Tainted Testimony From Informants And Police"}
{"original": "Unreliable, or plainly untruthful, testimony from police, jailhouse informants or confidential informants resulted in about $15 million in costs for state taxpayers, the report found. These kinds of errors were most frequent in cases involving homicides or drugs."}
{"original": "An example of this is playing out right now in Orange County, California, where fallout from a tainted jailhouse informant program has already unraveled multiple murder cases."}
{"original": "It's common for law enforcement to enlist informants to help bolster a case -- the tactic is perfectly legal, even when the informant receives something in exchange. But in some Orange County cases, defense attorneys allege that the sheriff's jailhouse informants held recorded and unrecorded conversations with inmates who were already represented by lawyers -- which is a violation of an inmate's right to counsel. Prosecutors allegedly took damning evidence gathered by the informants and presented it in court, while withholding evidence that could have been beneficial to the defense -- a violation of a defendant's right to due process."}
{"original": "While it remains unclear how many cases may be affected by tainted informant evidence, some have argued that every case in the county from the last 30 years in which an informant was used deserves to be re-examined."}
{"original": "About $21 million in costs were associated with failed convictions due to inadequate police practices, including authorities ignoring evidence, failing to follow leads, obtaining statements from suspects in violation of the Fifth Amendment -- which protects individuals from self-incrimination -- and eliciting false confessions out of suspects ."}
{"original": "False confessions are a particularly troubling aspect of criminal justice. Criminal (In)Justice researchers say that it's impossible to know how often defendants confess to crimes they never committed, but that there is a growing awareness that false confessions occur across a wide variety of cases."}
{"original": "The Innocence Project analyzed hundreds of cases around the nation stretching back to 1989, and found false confessions to be a primary cause of wrongful convictions. Overall, about 31 percent of wrongful conviction cases included a false confession. For homicides, that number balloons to 63 percent."}
{"original": "The coronavirus recession is over, if you ask the billionaires of the world. According to a report released Monday by Oxfam, the top 1,000 billionaires collectively lost about 30% of their wealth when COVID-19 restrictions stalled global economies in March. By the end of November, they'd made it all back."}
{"original": "For the world's richest, it took less than 10 months to recover the financial losses caused by the pandemic. For the world's poorest, the report estimated, it will take more than 10 years."}
{"original": "While a wealthy minority have amassed vast fortunes before and during the pandemic, the majority of the world's population have been struggling to survive on poverty wages and without access to decent health care or education, Paul O'Brien, vice president of Oxfam America, told HuffPost. Today's levels of extreme wealth concentration are not sustainable. Billionaires are a sign of economic sickness, not health. They are the symptom of a broken economy."}
{"original": "The pandemic threatens to undo the progress of more than two decades of declining global poverty. The World Bank has estimated that more than 200 million people may sink into poverty as a result of COVID-19's economic effects — in low-income countries and in rich ones, including the United States. Startlingly, the Oxfam report found that the cost to prevent people from falling into a life lived on less than $5.50 a day would be far less than the profits made by the world's wealthiest during the coronavirus crisis."}
{"original": "Jeff Bezos could have personally paid each of Amazon's 876,000 employees a one-off $105,000 bonus ... and still be as wealthy as he was at the beginning of the pandemic."}
{"original": "According to Oxfam's calculation — based on poverty data from the World Bank and wealth data from Credit Suisse and the Forbes Billionaires list — the world's 10 richest people, including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla founder Elon Musk, added $540 billion to their collective net worth in the last three quarters of 2020. If they handed over around $80 billion, they could keep those imperiled millions above the poverty line for a year while economies rebuild."}
{"original": "With the remainder of their 2020 profits, these 10 billionaires could pay for both rounds of the COVID-19 vaccine for every person on Earth and still come out ahead. (Oxfam used World Health Organization data to estimate a cost of around $9 per dose, a total expenditure of $141.2 billion for the world's 7.8 billion inhabitants.)"}
{"original": "Oxfam timed the release of the report to coincide with the start of the annual World Economic Forum's Davos meeting (virtual this year), where industry and government leaders convene to address critical issues."}
{"original": "The report paints a stark portrait of the divide between CEOs at the top and laborers at the bottom, many of whom have continued to work in dangerous circumstances, without the option to stay home to avoid the virus."}
{"original": "Raj Sisodia, a business professor at Babson College and co-founder of the Conscious Capitalism movement, likened standard corporate structure to India's caste system. At the top: generously paid professional, college-educated people with benefits and stock options, supported by the chew them up and spit them out workforce — people locked into low-paying hourly jobs, without health care, paid leave or retirement benefits."}
{"original": "That needs to change, Sisodia said. There has to be a modest ratio between pay at the top and pay the bottom."}
{"original": "That's not currently the case. In the last 40 years, executive pay has increased by 1,000% while worker pay has budged less than 12%."}

{"original": "But handouts won't bring about the fundamental restructuring that is needed, said O'Brien: Asking the wealthy to be charitable is no substitute for taxing them and the companies whose profits have soared in past years."}
{"original": "Oxfam recommends implementing wealth taxes as an important step toward creating a fairer, more equitable economic system."}
{"original": "The super-rich use a network of tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of tax and an army of wealth managers to secure sky-high returns that are not available to an ordinary investor, he continued. Big corporations are dodging taxes, driving down wages for their workers and the prices paid to producers, and investing less in their business in order to maximize returns to their wealthy shareholders. Both big business and the super-rich use their money and connections to ensure government policy works for them. This has to stop."}
{"original": "The report's other policy recommendations include investing in social services and guaranteed income, moving away from using gross domestic product as a metric for economic growth, and making fighting inequality central to pandemic recovery."}
{"original": "The most effective way of getting people back on their feet in the wake of this pandemic is to build fairer, more sustainable economies that work for everyone and not just a fortunate few, said O'Brien.

{"original": "Each year, more than 8 million tons of plastic ends up in the oceans. Much of it can't be broken down and will remain in the oceans for centuries. The debris injures and kills fish, seabirds and marine mammals. It also causes fish to be smaller and slower than those raised in clean water."}
{"original": "There's also a concern that it could be harmful for humans to consume fish that have ingested plastic, but more research needs to be done on the issue."}

{"original": "So when, at the end of last year, the U.K. government approved a tree-planting project on 100 acres of peat bog in northern England, conservationists raised the alarm."}
{"original": "Contractors dug long trenches to drain the water and planted rows of conifer trees that act like straws, sucking up water and drying out the soil, explained Joshua Styles, botanist and founder of the North-West Rare Plant Initiative. As the soil dried out, thousands of years worth of carbon started to be released. The Forestry Commision halted the project and apologized, saying it had failed to properly assess the location."}
{"original": "The mistake is just one example of how tree-planting efforts to tackle climate change can wildly miss the mark. If you don't want to do any harm to the environment, Styles told HuffPost, it needs to be properly thought out."}
{"original": "As governments and corporations set ambitious climate goals, planting trees has emerged as a favorite way to offset greenhouse gas emissions. The carbon absorbed by new trees is intended to make up for what is being released. But this seemingly simple climate solution isn't as easy as plopping seedlings in the soil."}
{"original": "Getting tree planting right, experts explain, means accounting for which trees to plant where, how long those trees will live and how local communities will benefit. Many tree-planting schemes are plagued by poor planning and a lack of foresight that could mean they won't actually make up for the emissions they're meant to offset and may even do more harm than good."}
{"original": "Forests are crucial for combating climate change. They absorb one-third of the emissions caused by the burning of fossil fuels. On the flip side, cutting down and degrading forests contributes around 12% of global emissions, according to estimates from the International Union for Conservation of Nature."}
{"original": "There are different ways governments and businesses can use forests to offset the carbon they release into the atmosphere. One is to prevent deforestation or support efforts to restore existing forests to optimal health. The United Nations' REDD+ program allows countries and companies — such as Microsoft, Toyota, Shell and BNP Paribas — to pay to protect forests in other parts of the world to help them meet their emission reduction goals."}
{"original": "Then there is tree planting, an increasingly popular option."}

In 2019, British budget airline EasyJet, for example, announced that it would invest over $33 million in tree planting and other efforts to offset its jet fuel emissions, while Delta's pledge to become carbon neutral will largely focus on planting trees and restoring wetlands."}
{"original": "But environmentalists say the tree-planting approach often feels more like PR than serious climate action."}
{"original": "The expansion of forestry framed as a climate change mitigation solution is being used for corporate greenwashing, as an excuse for continued use of fossil fuels, said Alison Smith, co-author of a new Oxford University review of tree planting and other nature-based solutions to climate change."}
{"original": "Even in the best-case scenario, planting trees doesn't necessarily cancel out the climate damage caused by the release of greenhouse gases — and it's really hard to get right."}
{"original": "Putting The 'Plan' In Tree Planting"}
{"original": "Tree planting initiatives have to be done very carefully to avoid perverse effects, said Eric Lambin, environmental sciences professor at Stanford University."}
{"original": "That starts with where you plan to plant."}
{"original": "Ideally, trees should be planted in areas that used to be forests but were degraded or destroyed. Planting trees in other areas — such as grasslands or peat bogs — or replacing natural forests with rows of identical species, will result in a loss of biodiversity, which makes ecosystems less resilient to threats such as fire and pests, and potentially a loss of stored soil carbon. Placing tree plantations on cropland risks pushing farmers to clear new land — possibly forests — for cultivation."}
{"original": "Different geographies present particular challenges. For instance, if you're planting in the snowy northern boreal region, trees' darker surfaces may absorb and help trap more heat than the white snow cover, explained Susan Cook-Paton, a senior restoration scientist at The Nature Conservancy, which has been running its Plant a Billion trees initiative since 2008."}
{"original": "And you have to pick the right trees to survive in the environment, she added. Native tree species will have a better chance at handling a given area's conditions — from drought and monsoons to warding off regional pests — and supporting biodiversity. Non-native trees, on the other hand, may increase the risk of fire, change the soil, or even decompose and release carbon more quickly."}
{"original": "Alfribeiro via Getty Images Aerial view of a field planted with eucalyptus seedlings in Brazil"}
{"original": "You have to plan for permanence, said Karen Holl, professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz."}
{"original": "Tree planting isn't a term she likes much. We should think of it as tree growing, she said. A lot of these programs are focused on digging a hole and putting a tree in the ground. That's very different than growing a tree to get the benefits you want."}
{"original": "In addition to storing carbon — which takes decades to accumulate — these benefits may include flood protection, cooling and shade, or fruit."}
{"original": "Growing trees is an inherently slow process. It takes anywhere from just under a decade to 30 years or more for a tree to mature. As time ticks on, the trees get to work: They store carbon, purify the air, protect the soil, and enable new habitats to form. That means long-term thinking needs to be embedded in whatever target is adopted."}
{"original": "But businesses and countries banking on trees to reduce their carbon footprints are failing to plan far enough into the future, according to Holl. Beyond setting a goal for how many seedlings are planted, she would like initiatives to incorporate goals for how many of those trees survive after 10, 20, or 50 years."}
{"original": "Short-term thinking can be costly. After the Indian Ocean tsunami hit Sri Lanka in 2004, government bodies and NGOs spent roughly $13 million restoring mangrove trees; mangrove roots help stop erosion and protect shoreline from storms. But many of the trees were planted poorly — often in unsuitable locations or at the wrong depth — and seedlings weren't tended to. Only one-quarter of the sites planted had more than 10% of their trees still living five years later."}
{"original": "If you plant a bunch of trees thinking you've offset your emissions, and they're all dead within 20 years, then you've done nothing. William Anderegg, assistant professor of biology at the University of Utah"}
{"original": "Often, governments offer subsidies and tax breaks for people who plant trees on their land, but incentives can backfire, Lambin warned."}
{"original": "Many landowners will be tempted to collect the subsidy for planting trees even if their land does not meet the conditions for environmentally sound plantations, he explained. A study he co-authored on Chile's official tree planting scheme, in effect between 1974 to 2012 — which several other South American nations modeled their plans after — found that government subsidies were used to replace existing forests with monoculture tree plantations."}
{"original": "Even when trees are planted in the right places, you need to design payment programs in a way that ensures farmers continue to protect forests over the long term, added the study's lead author, Robert Heilmayr, assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara."}
{"original": "Given the first few years of planting require the most attention to ensure trees' survival, it's common for subsidies to be paid out over a five-year period. To ensure longer-term growth, said Lambin, governments can require the subsidy to be repaid if the plantation is converted to a different use (such as back to farmland). Landowners can also sometimes receive tax breaks for as long as the trees stay standing."}
{"original": "Yet there are a lot of ways a tree can die — the buzz of a saw, the borehole of a beetle, or the inferno of wildfire — and the majority of seedlings typically don't survive."}
{"original": "There is a limit to the carbon that can be stored by newly planted trees — and this carbon is at risk if trees are harvested or if they die from fire, drought or disease as the climate continues to warm, said Smith."}
{"original": "If you plant a bunch of trees thinking you've offset your emissions, and they're all dead within 20 years, then you've done nothing, said William Anderegg, assistant professor of biology at the University of Utah."}
{"original": "Tree growth and tree cover (how much of an area of land is populated by trees) must be monitored to make sure the trees stay standing long enough to achieve a project's goals. The complex and arduous process typically involves collaboration between nonprofit project organizers, conservation groups and government agencies."}
{"original": "Traditionally, monitoring was done by people on the ground. Part of this involved someone going into the forest and wrapping a tape measure around the trees to measure growth — an important metric for calculating carbon sequestration. While this method still plays an important role in providing on-the-ground detail, increasingly, tree-planting groups are using satellites and other remote technology like drones to measure biomass as well as look for changes in tree cover."}
{"original": "After about five years, if the forest is continuing to grow the way we expect, we can feel pretty good about its long term potential, said Eric Sprague, vice president of reforestation at American Forests, the country's oldest preservation organization, which partners with companies such as Ikea and Bank of America and helps monitor progress for One Tree Pledge, an organization that plants trees as carbon offsets for individuals and construction companies."}
{"original": "Being able to judge success takes time, said Holl."}
{"original": "Cavan Images via Getty Images Trees accumulate carbon over decades of growth and release that stored carbon if they die or are felled."}
{"original": "To have the best chance of getting it right, the experts agreed, tree-planting projects should prioritize factors beyond just carbon offsets, like water and air quality. When you can manage a forest to provide multiple benefits, that's often a much more promising approach, said Heilmayr."}
{"original": "Above all, long-term success requires involving the local community."}
{"original": "Poorly designed projects sometimes ignore the rights of local people to govern their natural resources, undermining the legitimacy and long-term success of the project, said Nathalie Seddon, co-author of the Oxford paper."}
{"original": "There's a pretty broad history ... of these large international groups coming in and basically treading all over Indigenous rights, Anderegg noted. In the end, these projects tend to fail the people who rely on historic lands or forests for their livelihoods and may bring about unintended ecological consequences."}
{"original": "In India, the government's effort to plant teak trees to combat the country's emissions has sparked an ongoing conflict with Indigenous communities who say their rights are being violated and that the original ecology of the land they live on is being destroyed; no other trees can grow once the teak is planted, and animals are likely to be driven away as the vegetation changes."}
{"original": "Projects that lean towards agroforestry, when the trees are integrated with farming, can be more successful because the community is able to earn income in the process, Holl added."}
{"original": "But she said there were few examples that check all the boxes — from choosing the best seedlings to benefiting the local community and sustaining the forest over time. She did cite one case study in Ethiopia where locals were involved from the outset of the project, people consistently watered and fertilized the trees over time, and they used methods to encourage the trees to regenerate naturally, recolonizing the earth with their own seeds. The people who planted the trees had ownership over them, roughly doubling the trees' survival rate between 1990 and 2019. Combined, all of these efforts helped boost forest cover from 3% to 17%."}
{"original": "There's a lot of focus on [tree planting] being a simple, easy, feel-good solution, said Anderegg. But there is a growing realization that this is hard and needs to be done right."}
{"original": "In the absolute best-scenario, he added, it only gets us 10 to 15% of the way towards solving climate change."}
{"original": "Even if every single project were a complete success, some experts dispute whether there would even be enough available land on Earth to grow the billions of trees so many governments and companies have hung their hopes on."}
{"original": "Many are wary, even skeptical, about any overreliance on forests to combat rising carbon emissions."}
{"original": "If you're company X and you're going to either offset your carbon or reduce emissions, reducing your emissions is very, very certain and very likely permanent, Anderegg said. While it takes decades before the full climate benefit of trees kick in, shutting down a coal power plant is instantaneous."}
{"original": "There's a lot of focus on people wanting to plant our way out of climate change, Holl said. But if we do not aggressively reduce our emissions, then tree growing is not going to get us out of this."}

{"original": "That was strange because Trump's budget plan submitted just days ago called for cutting at least $610 billion from Medicaid and slicing an additional $250 billion from health care by repealing Obamacare. The White House plan also calls for cuts in future spending on health care for children from low-income households. There is no additional spending for any health care in the plan."}
{"original": "The weird disconnect on health care wasn't a first for the president. When Trump met with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in New York City in early May, the president praised that nation's health care system. You have better health care than we do, Trump said."}
{"original": "He was perhaps unaware that Australia has a government-run, publicly funded universal health care system — and at a fraction of the cost of American health care. It's a system Trump would be more likely to denigrate as socialist and even worse than Obamacare. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last week that Trump's health care proposal would leave an additional 23 million Americans with no health care coverage by 2026."}

{"original": "A windfall from the new federal tax law gives many states the flexibility to comprehensively rewrite their own tax codes, something not seen for decades."}
{"original": "Rick Bowmer, The Associated Press Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes, a Republican, at the Utah Taxpayers Association 2018 Legislative Outlook Conference this month. On the heels of a sweeping rewrite of the nation's tax laws signed into law in December, many states are considering big changes to state tax codes."}
{"original": "The federal tax overhaul has caused a lot of angst in some state capitals, but leaders in many states also see a rare opportunity to substantially revamp state tax codes, many of which haven't been significantly changed in years."}
{"original": "The opportunity comes because the 36 states that use the federal code as a starting point for their own personal income taxes are in a position to realize a generous windfall since the federal law eliminates many tax breaks that states might not adjust."}
{"original": "That unexpected extra money has given states the flexibility to rewrite their tax codes without creating as many losers — and the accompanying political hardship — as most tax revamps entail."}
{"original": "Lawmakers in Iowa, which last changed its overall tax structure in 1997, are looking at broad rate changes and other rewrites. Colorado has been looking at sweeping tax changes since at least 1984, mostly directed at sales taxes, but broader changes are getting a push this year from the federal rewrite. Idaho considered significant tax changes in 2015, but fell short, and now lawmakers and the governor are talking up those changes again. Big tax overhauls also are on the table in Michigan and Missouri."}
{"original": "And in New Mexico, GOP Gov. Susana Martinez this week said it's time for her state to tackle the big one — comprehensive tax reform."}
{"original": "Let's finally tackle comprehensive tax reform this session, she said in her state of the state address, seizing on tax reform in the wake of the federal overhaul, like a number of other governors."}
{"original": "But while many governors and legislators are looking to revamp tax codes in a big way, the temptation is not universal. While most Republican governors are at least looking at lowering taxes, some GOP legislators say they are hesitant due to uncertainty about revenue forecasts for the new tax law."}
{"original": "Some Democrats want to fund their own priorities but also are holding back due to worries about underfunded pensions, cuts to federal government programs such as Medicaid, the federal-state health plan for low-income Americans, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, and other concerns."}
{"original": "But the issue that will be uppermost on lawmakers' minds this legislative year is how to deal with tax and budget changes."}
{"original": "For years, there have been quite a few states that have talked about a desire to create a more neutral and more pro-growth tax code, but have been limited by revenue availability, said Jared Walczak of the right-leaning Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based tax analysis group. Now, with the federal overhaul signed by President Donald Trump in December, there is an opportunity for states to consider serious tax reform."}
{"original": "A majority of states will see a revenue increase if they do nothing, but their taxpayers also will pay more. That's because the new federal law eliminated many tax breaks, meaning federal taxes are assessed on more income. The federal tax code, however, tried to help taxpayers out by also increasing the standard deduction, lowering their tax liability. If states use the income line from the federal form as a starting point, but don't adjust the deductions underneath, state residents would pay more."}
{"original": "After the sweeping Reagan-era federal tax overhaul in 1986, many states that tied their state income taxes to the federal code changed their laws in 1987, in some cases due to a similar windfall or to align their tax brackets with the federal code. And just like federal tax laws, state codes have changed incrementally over the past three decades, so that neither resemble what they looked like in 1986. But sweeping tax overhauls in the states have been rare since then."}
{"original": "Kansas cut taxes drastically in 2012, counting on economic growth to make up the difference. But despite vast budget cuts, the state's revenue never caught up, creating a roughly $300 million budget hole and prompting a backlash among residents and lawmakers."}
{"original": "North Carolina revamped its tax code in 2013, and, like the recent federal rewrite, lowered individual rates, cut corporate taxes, and doubled the individual standard deduction. Republicans leaders hailed the overhaul as the key to 300,000 new jobs in the state, but Democrats and liberals maintained that the job increases were due to a national wave of economic activity, not the state's action."}
{"original": "This time around, in addition to wholesale rewrites, some states are weighing whether to use the newfound millions to augment their rainy day funds, give state taxpayers a break, or fund new or languishing priorities such as education, transportation and pensions."}
{"original": "In Colorado, Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper has proposed increasing the state's rainy day fund to 8 percent of the general fund, due to better-than-expected state revenue and an estimated $300 million boost from the federal rewrite. But some in the Legislature want the money for highway construction instead."}
{"original": "Meg Wiehe, deputy director of the Washington-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning group, urged states to proceed cautiously, especially if they are looking at big, permanent, rate cuts. That's because the federal rate changes and other modifications are temporary, and could disrupt states again when they expire in 2025."}
{"original": "Today, as 2018 sessions begin in statehouses across the country and with budgets at the top of the to-do list, tax writers and analysts say the windfall from the federal rewrite already is playing an outsized role in those discussions. But any lucky break also creates competing constituencies."}
{"original": "For about a year, for example, Utah lawmakers have discussed how to change state taxes, which have not been changed significantly since 2008. Greg Hughes, the Republican speaker of the Utah House, estimated the state stands to gain between $75 million and $150 million this year due to the federal tax changes, which has given the state's comprehensive overhaul effort new impetus."}
{"original": "Hughes tried last year to go for what he called the big lift of comprehensive tax reform, but he was stymied. He thinks the extra revenue gives more momentum to his efforts in 2018. But Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, also a Republican, said he wanted to wait for deeper analysis of the impact of the tax overhaul from state financial officials."}
{"original": "Iowa stands to gain $106 million next year and $138 million in 2020 from the federal tax changes if nothing is done to the state tax code, according to Iowa's Department of Revenue. That's about 2 percent of the state's $7.3 billion budget."}
{"original": "Our goal is to give that money back to Iowans and to do so as part of a plan to take a comprehensive look at taxes in Iowa, said Iowa Senate President Jack Whitver, a Republican."}
{"original": "Whitver and other Republicans argue that revamping the state tax code and lowering tax rates would result in economic growth. But even in the best of cases, that growth can take years to materialize, and, Whitver says, the windfall from Washington could help tide the state over during the adjustment."}
{"original": "Wiehe noted that Iowa has wanted to lower tax rates for a long time. They haven't been able to figure it out, she said. Now, it's pretty convenient to have a couple hundred million dollars so they can do what they want."}
{"original": "In Idaho, State Tax Commissioner Ken Roberts told the Legislature to expect a net gain of $97.4 million in revenue this year if no changes to the state tax code are enacted."}
{"original": "Gov. C.L. Butch Otter, a Republican, took a look at the estimated tax gain and pledged in his state of the state address this month to propose a plan that would blunt the increased levies on Idaho taxpayers. He said he would work to substantially retool the state tax code to conform with the federal one, but he left wiggle room to accept some of the new revenue for his priorities, which include beefing up the state's reserves and putting funds into education and health care."}
{"original": "By leaving room for negotiation, Otter opened the door to a more complex rewrite of the state's tax code, and Democrats jumped on Otter's plan, calling for a refundable tax credit for larger families and an expansion of Medicaid."}
{"original": "In Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, Jan. 8 called for an increase in the state's personal exemption to offset the potential $1.5 billion in increased taxes that Michigan taxpayers would have to pay without action. That proposal opened the door to more comprehensive tax change proposals by both Republicans and Democrats."}
{"original": "We are putting Michigan families first, by working to enact a simple and fair solution to fix the unintended consequences of the federal tax plan, Snyder said in a statement, referring to the higher taxes the state will collect absent any tax law changes."}
{"original": "Snyder, a fiscal conservative, earlier had condemned the GOP tax plan as fiscally irresponsible because it adds to the federal deficit. But Republican members of the Michigan Legislature already are clamoring for deeper cuts to state taxes, beyond Snyder's simple solution to lower taxes just enough to make up for the federal windfall."}
{"original": "Arlan Meekhof, the Senate majority leader, and a fellow Republican, said Snyder's plan was merely a good start. I think there's more we can do to put people's money back in their pockets, he told the Detroit News. Michigan's last big tax change was a cut in corporate taxes in 2011."}
{"original": "Any time there's extra money around, competition is fierce. In Maryland, for example, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has pledged to rewrite the state tax code to lower rates in an effort to blunt the $400 million in higher state taxes residents could otherwise expect."}
{"original": "But Democrats in the state Legislature, including Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., say some of the money should be kept in reserve to cover the costs of CHIP, the federal health insurance program for low-income children, or Medicaid."}
{"original": "Miller even suggested the changes could be so sweeping and controversial that he would favor an extended session or special session to deal with it."}
{"original": "(Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump administration's timetable for tax reform is set to falter following setbacks in negotiations with Congress over healthcare, the Financial Times reported on Monday."}

{"original": "It is fair to say it is probably delayed a bit because of the healthcare, Mnuchin told the newspaper."}
{"original": "Mnuchin also told the Financial Times he agreed with Trump's view that the dollar's strength in the short term was hurting exports, but said he saw the currency's strength over the long term as a positive."}
{"original": "As the world's currency, the primary reserve currency, I think that over long periods of time the strength of the dollar is a good thing, the Financial Times quoted Mnuchin as saying."}
{"original": "Trump has signaled he wants to streamline the income tax system, cut federal regulations, reduce corporate income tax and add new taxes to prod companies to keep or move production to the United States."}

{"original": "After a grimace and eye roll, it was crystal clear where Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was headed Thursday when she was challenged on her support for a wealth tax."}
{"original": "Warren is proposing an annual 2-cent tax on every dollar over $50 million of a family's net worth. Billionaires would pay a 6% tax above $1 billion."}
{"original": "There is no evidence that anyone is going to leave this country because of a 2-cent wealth tax, an exasperated Warren responded when CNBC host Sara Eisen raised the argument. Several nations have far higher tax rates, in addition to wealth taxes, so it's not clear where they would go."}
{"original": "How about a counter-argument that's based on fact? the senator snapped."}
{"original": "The wealthiest in this country are paying less in taxes than everyone else, Warren said. Asking them to step up and pay a little more, and you're telling me that they would forfeit their American citizenship .... I'm just calling your bluff on that."}
{"original": "Warren added: Can we just keep in mind right now in America who is paying taxes? She noted that the bottom 99% of Americans paid roughly 7% of their total wealth in taxes in 2020. But the top one-tenth of 1% paid only 3.2% of their total wealth in taxes, she added."}
{"original": "If they added a 2-cent wealth tax, they'd still be paying less than most of the people in this entire nation, Warren added."}
{"original": "All I'm saying is can we have just a little fairness here? she said. Someone has to pay to keep this nation going. And right now what the ... wealthiest people in this country have said is, 'Let's let everyone else pay for it.' Because what they want to do is not only keep their wealth, they want to keep building their wealth faster than anyone else."}
{"original": "As Americans struggle to meet their mortgages and rents, keep food on the table and pay medical bills amid the economic and deadly toll of COVID-19, U.S. billionaires over the past year have become $1.1 trillion wealthier."}
{"original": "The rich often pay lower tax rates than wage earners because much of their income comes from investments that are taxed at a lower rate than wages. And top-margin tax rates are significantly lower now than they were from 1917 to 1986, when rates were slashed during the Reagan administration."}
{"original": "In addition, Donald Trump and the Republicans slashed corporate taxes 40% — from 35% to 21% — granted business-owning taxpayers a 20% deduction and doubled the ceiling on tax-free inheritances for a couple to $22 million."}
{"original": "The Trump administration tax changes meant that for the first time in a century, the nation's billionaires paid a lower effective tax rate than steelworkers, schoolteachers and retirees, according to an analysis by economists at the University of California, Berkeley."}
{"original": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a grand ambition to make his country into a cashless society. In 2014, he launched a scheme to provide bank accounts to the nearly 40 percent of the population with little or no access to financial services. In November 2016, he withdrew 500 and 1,000 rupee notes ($7.80 and $15.60), the country's two most common banknotes, from circulation."}
{"original": "The aim was to clamp down on black-market money and get more people into the formal economy, but it had a negative effect on the poor, with micro and small-scale service businesses cutting 35 percent of staff in the first few months, and some families left unable to afford fruit and vegetables."}
{"original": "Hindustan Times via Getty Images A protest in January 2017 against the withdrawal of high-value bank notes. Activists called for the removal of withdrawal limits on money and no transaction charges for cashless payments."}
{"original": "Cash is on the decline worldwide; non-cash transactions grew 11.2 percent globally in 2015. But for some, the Modi experiment is a sign that cashless societies will hurt the poor, and India is not alone in having poor, unbanked populations. An estimated 7 percent of American households don't have access to bank accounts, according to the most recent survey from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. And a government study at the end of last year found that the U.S. homeless population had risen for the first time since 2010. Given rising inequality, what happens to those on the margins of the economy when cash is no longer king?"}
{"original": "Proponents of a shift away from cash often point to Kenya or Sweden as proof that such a transition can happen without further disadvantaging the poor. In Sweden, which is on track to be the world's first cashless society, a magazine called Situation Stockholm has equipped its homeless sellers with credit card readers. And M-Pesa, a mobile money service first rolled out in Kenya, has 30 million subscribers and has been credited with raising 2 percent of Kenyan households out of extreme poverty."}
{"original": "Bloomberg via Getty Images Residents transfer money using the M-Pesa banking service at a store in Nairobi, Kenya."}
{"original": "But Mehrsa Baradaran, associate dean for strategic initiatives and J. Alton Hosch associate professor of law at the University of Georgia, says that absent these countries' unique context, these examples would be difficult to follow in the U.S."}
{"original": "Kenya had one national bank and one mobile company that had a monopoly, she explains. Everyone was on the same mobile network so they just rolled out M-Pesa on the mobiles and everyone immediately got on. The U.S. has a dual banking system (state and federal) and more than 6,500 banks meaning rolling out mobile banking would require a lot more coordination, says Baradaran. Kenya had a different population ― more poverty and less of a profit model-oriented banking system."}
{"original": "As for Sweden, Baradaran says, They just don't have the level of poverty that we do. ... They have a lot of social services and they've transitioned off cash because they have a less-stratified society."}
{"original": "Economist Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor who formerly served as the chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, argues in his book The Curse of Cash for a gradual elimination of cash to get at the black market and to crack down on tax evasion."}
{"original": "To protect the unbanked, he proposes making free basic debit card accounts available to everyone, as many countries are now doing, he told HuffPost. If India can make free basic accounts available to everyone, surely the U.S. can do the same."}
{"original": "But Baradaran points out that U.S. banks have historically refused to do this. In the U.S., banks have a monopoly on payments and transactions, she says. If you're unbanked, you have to operate in cash. All of these fintech providers, like Venmo, PayPal, etc., they all connect to banks too. So, how do we force people into banks? There have been so many efforts in the U.S. over the years to get banks to offer free accounts, but [the banks] refuse because those accounts aren't profitable for them."}
{"original": "Grant Kerber, a volunteer with Oakland Omni Commons and Food Not Bombs, says the suggestion to simply bank the unbanked seems out of touch with how poor people actually live. Things like ID cards, driver's licenses, these are already incredibly difficult for people who are marginalized in society to get access to, so the whole digital payment thing just pushes the goal post even further out."}
{"original": "Not that there aren't problems with cash. It's actually really expensive to be unbanked, Baradaran explains. You're constantly having to pay out part of your income in fees to turn your cash into other forms of transactional currency ― a prepaid card, for example ― or to turn your cash into checks and back again."}
{"original": "She does have a potential solution. In her book How the Other Half Banks, Baradaran suggests a postal banking system. There are already brick and mortar post offices in most neighborhoods, so my idea was that people could bring cash to the post office, they could hold it for them and give them a digital account, she says."}
{"original": "Such a system would be appealing to the fintech folks, who might pick up hundreds of thousands of new customers by linking to these postal accounts, and shouldn't bother the banks, which have been avoiding dealing with this segment of the population for years. But Baradaran says she still gets a lot of pushback on it from economists and academics, mostly middle- or upper-class people who see the proposition of having to stand in line at the post office to bank as untenable."}
{"original": "But that's because they're not the ones it's for, Baradaran says. It's not for people who are already living comfortably with a bank account and direct deposit, who can just bank through the mobile app on their phones. It's for people who have none of that."}
{"original": "Unless you're poor, it's hard to understand what it's like to be poor, Baradaran says. And a lot of people don't realize that if you go into any water office or electric utility office in the country right now, there's a line of people in there waiting to pay their bill in cash."}

They opposed Barr's votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which provides health insurance to tens of thousands of the district's residents, and both supported expanding the law instead.

{"original": "Congress should pass a COVID-19 relief bill before federal unemployment benefits begin to expire in March, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday."}
{"original": "We are going to hit a cliff, an unemployment insurance cliff, in March, where millions of people won't be able to have access to unemployment insurance, Psaki told reporters in the White House briefing room."}
{"original": "Federal unemployment benefits for gig workers, and those who have been out of a job for more than six months, start to expire on March 14, a deadline Congress set last month in its most recent pandemic relief bill. The legislation also provided an extra $300 per week for all unemployment recipients, which will expire at the same time."}
{"original": "President Joe Biden has proposed boosting the weekly supplement to $400 and maintaining it though September, along with the other federal jobless aid programs. But the unemployment policies were just one part of a much larger proposed relief package that would include $1,400 payments to most households and a host of other Democratic priorities, such as raising the minimum wage."}
{"original": "Biden has been trying to win support from Republicans for his proposal, but so far, none have endorsed it. The White House has not ruled out bypassing Republicans by using a special budget process called reconciliation, which would allow Democrats to push legislation through the Senate with a simple majority vote instead of needing to get 10 Republicans to go along with the chamber's 50 Democratic votes."}
{"original": "There are a number of means of getting bills passed, Psaki said Monday."}
{"original": "Another obstacle to getting legislation done is that the Senate is holding votes to confirm Biden's Cabinet nominations, and will start its second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump in February."}
{"original": "Psaki said the White House does not expect the final bill to look exactly like Biden's original 19-page outline, which also called for increasing money for vaccine distribution and boosting tax credits for low-income workers and people with children."}
{"original": "Some Democrats are particularly excited that the Biden plan included expansions of the earned income tax credit and child tax credit. The proposal, which is modeled on earlier Democratic legislation, would boost the maximum value of the child credit from $2,000 to $3,600 and make it fully refundable, meaning families would receive the credit as a cash payment."}
{"original": "Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said the credits are particularly helpful to front-line workers who can't do their jobs from home, and that giving parents extra money would slash child poverty."}
{"original": "I want to see Congress make this investment in kids and workers, who need help to see through this pandemic, Brown said in a statement to HuffPost."}
{"original": "Brown is the co-author of the American Family Act, which would increase the value of the credit and direct the IRS to pay it in advance, essentially turning a tax benefit into a child allowance program."}
{"original": "The White House outline didn't call for advance payments, but Janet Yellen, Biden's nominee to serve as Treasury secretary, said at a hearing last week that she supports the idea and would try to get it implemented as fast as possible if Congress approved it."}
{"original": "The child tax credit is one area where there could be a bipartisan breakthrough. Several Senate Republicans, including Utah Republicans Mike Lee and Mitt Romney, have endorsed increasing the child tax credit, but they have not yet embraced Biden's proposal."}
{"original": "Some Democrats have suggested jettisoning the more controversial parts of the Biden plan in favor of a checks and shots bill, with direct payments and more money for distributing the coronavirus vaccine."}
{"original": "The looming expiration of federal unemployment benefits for millions of people won't necessarily spur bipartisan cooperation. Republicans have only grudgingly gone along with the expansions that were included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act."}
{"original": "Last month, at the insistence of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Congress set the federal benefits to phase out gradually, so there would be less of a cliff for Democrats to fret about. Workers who are already receiving federal benefits before March 14 will be able to continue until April 5, but new claims will be disallowed at the earlier deadline."}
{"original": "If Congress doesn't act, 11 million workers could be cut off from federal unemployment benefits in March and April, according to an initial estimate from The Century Foundation."}
{"original": "Decades of psychological research have revealed a fundamental reality about our human nature: we are lazy when it comes to planning for long-term issues like retirement. The silver lining is that studies have also found that the government and private sector can actually translate our laziness into smart retirement decisions with low-cost interventions. In the aggregate, this could be one solution that addresses America's looming retirement crisis."}
{"original": "We call it looming, but the retirement crisis has already arrived. 10,000 Baby Boomers will retire every single day of 2017 in the United States. If the Social Security Administration's estimates are correct, Baby Boomers—a generation of almost 80 million Americans—will retire at this same rate for at least the next 15 years."}
{"original": "But as Americans approach retirement, they are woefully underprepared. The median household nearing retirement has saved only $14,500. But this number is deceptive, it obscures the fact that almost half, or around 40 million working age households, do not have any personal retirement savings."}
{"original": "This problem will worsen over the next several decades because fewer and fewer private companies are offering pensions. Among Fortune 500 Companies, the number of employees covered by pension plans fell from 60 to 24 percent between 1998 and 2013. Public pensions for state employees like teachers, firefighters, and policemen, aren't faring much better, with states facing a $1 trillion shortfall in pension funding."}
{"original": "To top it all off, the Social Security Trust Funds are dwindling as more workers retire and fewer pay into the system. Over the next decade, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that outlays for Social Security, already the U.S.'s single largest government program, will nearly double from $910 billion in 2016 to $1.7 trillion by 2027. Absent any reforms, CBO predicts that Social Security would need to cut payments by almost a third in 2030 to remain solvent, around the time that the final wave of Boomers retires."}
{"original": "So what can policymakers do to tackle this problem? While policy options to shore up Social Security and provide tax incentives to companies providing pensions seem like a nonstarter in today's political climate, changing personal behavior and biases lie at the heart of a long-term solution."}
{"original": "Studies in behavioral economics and nudging show several ways to spur additional saving. Nudges, according to Harvard University's Cass Sunstein, are liberty-preserving approaches that steer people in particular directions, but that also allow them to go their own way."}
{"original": "So how can the government nudge citizens into saving for retirement? Three ways:"}
{"original": "First, automatic enrollment in retirement plans has a proven track record of promoting and increasing savings. Put simply, the default option matters. Automatic enrollments are a powerful tool because they help people overcome cognitive biases (i.e. our own laziness), such as inaction and procrastination, and also use the power of suggestion to make saving the norm."}
{"original": "We know from case studies that for this plan to work, the default contribution must be high enough at the onset or increase gradually over time to add up to enough savings. That's because our laziness strikes again, and most employees will never alter the original contribution amount."}
{"original": "But if structured properly, there appears to be significant potential to incentivize greater saving through automatic enrollments. One study found that automatic enrollment in a company's 401(k) resulted in 86 percent participation rates, compared with just 37 percent when employees were required to opt-in to the plan. Achieving a 50-percentage point jump is a remarkable feat for such a simple tweak in policy. If all workplaces implemented a change in the default, we could see millions more households saving for retirement."}
{"original": "Second, government and the private sector can promote life cycle defined contribution plans—investment portfolios tied to a person's retirement date. In light of the fact that only 1 to 3 percent of investors change their initial portfolio investments, using life-cycle funds that automatically rebalance each year is one approach to overcome the cognitive biases that could result in less saving over time. Pegging savings to a participant's retirement date allows for increased returns early on, and more effective risk management for participants as they approach retirement."}
{"original": "Third, the government needs to assess whether its existing attempts to spur additional retirement savings are working as intended. Right now, tax deductions for retirement contributions don't seem to be working as intended. One study found that the effect of retirement tax incentives was negligible in increasing saving—for every $1 of the government spent through the tax code, citizens' additional retirement contributions increased by a paltry one cent."}
{"original": "In addition to reality-testing existing programs, there needs to be an emphasis on equity by targeting underserved workers or the Boomer population without savings. A relatively new U.S. Treasury-led program called myRA has partnered with employers to assist workers who lack access to a workplace retirement savings plan or cannot afford minimum dollar thresholds for individual retirement accounts. This type of public-private innovation is necessary. Regardless of whether programs like myRA are a success or a failure, the government and employers can learn from these pilots before adopting more comprehensive policies to help prepare Americans of all income brackets."}
{"original": "Behavioral nudges are by no means the silver bullet to spur savings, but they represent a crucial step in long-term wealth generation for retirees. Nudges provide a relatively low-cost solution that could significantly alter existing habits and overcome our overwhelming laziness when it comes to saving money. And if the new habits stick, even micro changes in the present can yield macro effects over time. If successful, retirement can remain the golden years instead of the lean ones."}

{"original": "Donald Bowers via Getty Images Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, CEOs of Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, respectively, say they are joining forces, along with Amazon, to manage the health care needs of their employees."}
{"original": "The recent news from Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway that the three companies plan to team up to create a new company to manage the health care needs of their employees has prompted a flurry of excited pronouncements about what this new venture means for the future of health care delivery in the United States."}
{"original": "Fox Business praised the new company as nothing short of revolutionary, while Bloomberg enthused it had the potential for disrupting the broader industry. CNBC predicted the group could succeed where insurers and government have failed. Others pointedly interpreted the joint venture as a free market counterpunch to the government's overreach in the sector, symbolized most recently by Obamacare, a target for hatred by conservatives. It shows how health care reform should work in this country, Investor's Business Daily editorialized. You don't need government calling the shots to bring meaningful reforms."}
{"original": "Never mind that the details for the new company are few. Other than the announcement of the joint venture, leaders from the three companies have been unable to say what their new organization will do exactly. But that hasn't stopped the sort of irrational exuberance that often greets the slightest hints of innovation from the private sector, especially in the realm of health care."}
{"original": "Yet all these responses ― from touting the new venture as an innovative disruption to hailing it as a needed private sector response to the government's failure ― demonstrate a lack of historical perspective on how health care has operated in the United States and how our strange system of tying health insurance to employment has created our present circumstances. In this light, the new venture from Amazon et al. isn't a radical intervention in the system but merely a natural evolution of what is already in place. More importantly, it's a response to the failure of free market capitalism, not the government."}
{"original": "The new venture from Amazon et al. isn't a radical intervention in the system but merely a natural evolution of what is already in place."}
{"original": "Throughout the 20th century, attempts to create a government-run health care program were repeatedly thwarted by those who argued that individuals, rather than the federal government, should be in charge of their own medical decisions. Yet instead of individuals, employers became the arbiters of most Americans' health care through a system of employment-based health insurance."}
{"original": "That system stands in marked contrast to what other developed nations built in the 20th century. In Western Europe, progressive governments created state-run health care systems to care for their citizens as part of the extensive social safety nets developed in the first half of the century. In the U.S., Theodore Roosevelt's bid for the presidency in 1912 on the Progressive Party ticket included the first call for a single national health service. But the opportunity died when Roosevelt lost the election, in part because his plan had been decried as socialized medicine. That slur would prove incredibly effective at stalling other attempts at health care reform throughout the 20th century."}
{"original": "Rather than forming a state-run health system, the federal government offered companies incentives to provide health insurance to their employees through a series of tax measures in the 1940s and 1950s. With those incentives and a booming post-World War II economy, employers found that offering health insurance to their employees was one of the best ways they could recruit and retain workers in a scarce labor market."}
{"original": "What started as a competitive advantage provided by some companies soon became the basic standard Americans expected from their employment. That worked well for those with a job. But it also left many Americans ― particularly the elderly and the poor ― without coverage, something the private market seemed unwilling to fix."}
{"original": "For a radical overhaul, for a true disruption, there's really only one possible actor: the federal government."}
{"original": "Medicare and Medicaid, signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, would fill in those gaps. Like all efforts to provide any sort of government-based health care, the programs faced stiff opposition from business leaders at the time. But they were also the logical consequence for a nation that had opted for an employment-based system rather than a comprehensive federal program. In such a scenario, the government had to pick up the slack for the people the private sector was not serving."}
{"original": "Medicare has had its challenges, of course, but it is worth noting how happy Americans have been with the program historically. Less satisfied are those Americans with employer-based insurance and, not surprisingly, those who lack health insurance altogether."}
{"original": "In this context, it's important to recognize that the new health care company Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway are launching has been prompted by their own dissatisfaction with current private market options. Their plan offers a critique of what free market capitalism has generated, not an indictment of the federal government."}
{"original": "It also bears repeating that this joint venture will serve only the three companies' own employees. While the new company may have lessons for other employers, it will not provide the sort of wholesale disruption of the American health care system that so many have breathlessly predicted. More likely, it will merely be yet another tinkering at the margins, yielding small ripples of innovation rather than a tidal wave of change."}
{"original": "For a radical overhaul, for a true disruption, there's really only one possible actor: the federal government. That's something Warren Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, understands. Just last year, he argued that government-run health insurance probably is the best system. But conservatives in Congress often backed by influential business leaders have not allowed the federal government to bring about that result."}
{"original": "That the billionaire investor would advocate such a measure should help us rethink what really counts as disruption in this economy. That his company would join forces with Amazon and JPMorgan Chase to create their own health care company should also chasten our expectations of how much the free market can bring about the large-scale change that is truly needed for health care in the United States."}

Lawmakers need to stand up for genuine pro-solar policies like net metering, renewable portfolio standards, and tax credits that accelerate job creation and help level the playing field with heavily-subsidized industries like oil gas. Policymakers also need to guard against greenwashing campaigns that co-opt progressive rhetoric to advance the interests of absentee investors or big polluters. For New Mexico legislators, this vote is a crucial test."}
{"original": "Republicans spent the final weeks of the 2018 midterm elections downplaying their tax cut and instead sought to fire up their base with tough talk on immigration and an unrelenting focus on House Speaker-in-waiting Nancy Pelosi, according to a new analysis."}
{"original": "The analysis comes from Democratic strategists at Navigator Research and The Messina Group, and looks at television ads, social media posts, campaign Facebook ads, and candidate and committee websites in 108 congressional districts seen as competitive by the Cook Political Report. The analysis examined the messages both parties used as Democrats flipped 40 seats and took control of the House of Representatives."}
{"original": "What's more, the analysis shows, many ads in which Republicans do mention taxes didn't focus on the tax legislation they passed in 2017, which provided a steep tax cut for corporations. Of the GOP ads that referred to taxes, 40 percent also mentioned Pelosi, and 35 percent also raised the subject of health care – often suggesting Democrats would raise taxes to pay for a universal health care system."}
{"original": "Republicans ran on a negative, anti-Pelosi message first and foremost, rather than a positive message that emphasized their record over the past two years or a constructive vision for the future, the authors wrote of the GOP's tax messaging. Even on an issue for which Republicans have a clear legislative record, they largely spent their energy stoking fear about what Democrats would do instead if they gained control of the House of Representatives."}
{"original": "Republican messaging on taxes peaked in mid-October, with a majority of ads mentioning the topic in some way. But only about one-third of GOP ads during the rest of the campaign mentioned taxes."}
{"original": "Instead, Republicans ran more ads focused on immigration ― frequently using the term illegal and warning of the dangers of sanctuary cities. (Mentions of the gang MS-13 were relatively rare, according to the analysis, appearing in less than 10 percent of GOP ads.)"}
{"original": "Interestingly, Republicans ran ads focused on immigration across the political map ― not just in the rural areas that dominate President Donald Trump's political base and have in the past seemed most susceptible to hard-line immigration rhetoric. The GOP actually aired a slightly higher percentage of immigration ads – 16 percent ― in denser suburban areas than it did in purely rural districts (10 percent), or in districts that were a mix of rural and suburban (12 percent)."}

{"original": "The early days of public opinion research captured Americans' response to the first major efforts by the U.S. government to provide health care to its citizens, an undertaking that saw success in the passage of Medicare in 1965. A review of polls archived at the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research reveals the battle for public support for Medicare."}
{"original": "Health insurance itself was a relatively new notion in the 1940s, but most Americans liked the idea. A 1944 NORC poll found 92% thought it was a good idea to pay a certain amount each month for insurance to cover any hospital care they might have in the future. But only 34% said they themselves had any insurance against hospital bills, and just 15% against doctors' bills. Though a 54% majority said they would prefer to have insurance, 38% said they would rather pay medical bills each time. Still, support in this poll for a large-scale government health insurance bill was high; 68% thought it would be a good idea if the Social Security law also provided paying for the doctor and hospital care that people might need in the future."}
{"original": "Among those who opposed expanding Social Security in this way, a plurality of 37% thought it represented too much government interference or might lead to socialism. Overall, however, the public approved of government taking the lead on health care. When asked in a 1945 Gallup poll which they preferred, a mandatory government health plan or an optional plan set up by the medical profession, 53% of respondents chose the former; just a third the latter. After President Truman called for a national health insurance program in November 1945, 59% in a Gallup poll approved of the plan; 25% disapproved."}
{"original": "Despite public support, the American Medical Association opposed Truman's plan strongly and loudly. The proposal languished. By 1949, those in a Gallup poll who had heard about the Truman plan were equally divided between supporters (38%) and opponents (38%). When provided descriptions of the president's plan and an alternative put forth by the A.M.A., only 33% preferred the former. A May Gallup poll the same year found the country divided between 44% who would have Congress pass the government's compulsory health insurance program which would require wage or salary deduction from all employed people to provide medical and hospital care to them and their families, and 47% who would not. By 1950, a Gallup poll found that, of those who had heard about the Truman plan, only 24% approved, while 61% disapproved. Over the next few years, repeated Gallup polls found majorities opposing a government health insurance plan run by the federal government. A 1953 ORC poll showed just 30% saying the federal government should provide government health insurance for all. Government-supported health insurance seemed to be a non-starter."}
{"original": "Over the fifties, growing numbers of employer-sponsored health care plans greatly increased the proportion of insured Americans. But health care costs for the uninsured remained a serious problem, one President Kennedy was determined to address when he took office. Kennedy believed the key to achieving passage of a health care bill was to focus on the specific problem of covering the elderly. This was a popular position. In May 1961, support for a Social Security tax to pay for old age medical insurance was a solid 68% in a Gallup poll. In a January 1962 ORC poll, 51% of American believed there was a great, urgent need for payment of doctor, hospital, medicine bills of old people. An additional 33% saw some need; only 10% saw no need. Of those who believed there was any need, 52% thought the federal government should meet it; 33% thought state government should deal with it. Very low proportions thought private industry (2%), voluntary agencies (6%), or individuals (6%) should deal with this problem."}
{"original": "But the fight over what would be Medicare had just begun. The A.M.A., along with insurers, vehemently opposed Kennedy's proposal on the grounds that the president was introducing socialism to America's medical system. One letter in the Archives of Otolaryngology read:"}
{"original": "Before swallowing the attractively flavored bait of hospitalization under social security for the aged, the public should become better informed of the philosophical implications of adopting the principle of medical and hospital services through Social Security, for unquestionably, once accepted, this mechanism is capable of infinite expansion in every direction until it includes the entire population."}
{"original": "A major campaign to influence public opinion was undertaken to prevent such a scenario, much to Kennedy's frustration. He countered with an unusually aggressive outreach effort of his own, including 33 AFL-CIO rallies. In a May 1962 speech, he argued that a minority of Americans had been unduly alarmed by misrepresentation of the bill, while the majority supported it:"}
{"original": "All these arguments were made against social security at the time of Franklin Roosevelt. They are made today. The mail pours in. And at least half of the mail which I receive in the White House, on this issue and others, is wholly misinformed. Last week I got 1,500 letters on a revenue measure―1,494 opposed, and 6 for. And at least half of those letters were completely misinformed about the details of what they wrote."}
{"original": "And why is that so? Because there are so many busy men in Washington who write-some organizations have six, seven, and eight hundred people spreading mail across the country, asking doctors and others to write in and tell your Congressman you're opposed to it. The mail pours into the White House, into the Congress and Senators' offices―Congressmen and Senators feel people are opposed to it. Then they read a Gallup Poll which says seventy-five percent of the people are in favor of it, and they say, What has happened to my mail?"}
{"original": "Kennedy's number was touched with a kiss of blarney; that 68% approval in Gallup's poll the May before had represented peak support for the initiative. Despite his efforts, public support for expanding Social Security to provide medical benefits weakened over 1962. In March Gallup poll, a 55% majority supported a plan that would be paid by increasing the Social Security tax deducted from pay checks. Thirty-five percent preferred a plan that would let each individual decide whether to join Blue Cross or buy some form of voluntary health insurance. By May, opinion had shifted slightly, with the Social Security approach favored by 48% and private insurance by 41%. In July, just 44% of Americans preferred the Medicare plan; 41% private insurance. With the public split, the bill backed by Kennedy stalled in committee in the House. A revised version amended to a welfare bill was defeated in a July vote in the Senate."}
{"original": "In an ORC poll following the vote, a plurality of 44% of Americans said the bill should have passed, while 37% said Congress did right in not passing it. In respondents' evaluation of the problems with the bill, no one problem stood out as much more important than the others; substantial proportions considered each of several possible problems to have been serious. The country remained split between changing the government Social Security program to cover medical insurance for older people (43%) or expanding voluntary medical insurance plans (41%)."}
{"original": "Johnson was not put off by Kennedy's failure and in 1964 looked to use the fallen president's initiative as a springboard for again attempting to pass an elder care bill. Public approval of the idea of Medicare had rebounded from the lows of two years before. Gallup polls during the 1964 election found approval between 57% to 62% for a compulsory elder medical insurance program financed out of Social Security taxes."}
{"original": "In this somewhat arcane debate over financing of medical care, wording mattered. In a February 1965 Harris poll, 62% favored President Johnson's program of medical care for the aged under Social Security. But, in a separate question, 56% said they favored the AMA plan in which everyone who could afford it would be covered by private health insurance and those who couldn't would be covered under a government health plan. As is often the case with health policy, the public seemed more certain that something ought to be done than what exactly that something should be."}
{"original": "The Medicare bill was successfully passed at last in July 1965. A Harris poll in August found that 82% approved. When asked which of ten bills passed by the last Congress was the most important to them personally, a plurality of 28% chose Medicare. By 1967, only 8% of the country in a Harris poll wanted Medicare to be cut back, 51% wanted it to stay as it was, and 35% expanded. The road to acceptance had been long and hard, but the American public was firmly behind the new program."}
{"original": "With so many Social Security numbers hacked last year, most taxpayers are on high alert to make sure cyber-crooks don't misdirect their tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service. The best way to prevent it is to file your taxes early."}
{"original": "But now the IRS is warning taxpayers about a new and growing scam involving criminals who steal data from tax professionals and file fraudulent tax returns. The refund money goes into taxpayers' real bank accounts ― but then these criminals use various tactics to con the taxpayer into turning those funds over to them."}
{"original": "In one version of the new scam, criminals pose as debt collection agents acting on behalf of the IRS. They tell the taxpayer that a refund was deposited in error, and they give information to forward the money to their collection agency."}
{"original": "In another version, the taxpayer gets an automated call with a recorded voice purporting to be someone from the IRS. The caller threatens the taxpayer with criminal fraud charges, an arrest warrant and a blacklisting of their Social Security number. The recorded voice gives the taxpayer a case number and a phone number to call to return the refund."}
{"original": "One key point: The real IRS will never call or email a taxpayer. Anyone who initiates contact in this manner and claims to be calling on behalf of the IRS is a scammer."}
{"original": "The IRS warns that versions of the scam may continue to evolve, and the number of potential victims has already grown from a few hundred to several thousand in just days."}
{"original": "Why is this scam enjoying such success? Unlike previous scams, it offers a higher degree of believability that the call from the alleged IRS representative is real. After all, the taxpayer actually does have a tax refund in his or her bank account as proof and the caller knows the exact amount and possibly other personal details."}
{"original": "The IRS urges taxpayers to follow its established procedures for returning money on an erroneous refund. If the mistaken refund was a direct deposit, contact the Automated Clearing House department of the bank or financial institution where the deposit was received and have them return the refund to the IRS. Taxpayers can also call the IRS toll-free at (800) 829-1040 (for individual returns) or (800) 829-4933 (for business filers) to explain why the direct deposit is being returned. If a paper check was sent and not cashed, the IRS advises taxpayers to write void in the endorsement section on the back of the check and submit it to the appropriate IRS location, given here."}
{"original": "If you cashed a paper check of an erroneous refund, submit a personal check, money order, etc., immediately to the appropriate IRS location with a note explaining that it's a repayment of an erroneously paid refund. And do it quickly, because you may be charged interest on the money that wasn't yours."}
{"original": "One last thing: Taxpayers receiving erroneous refunds should contact their tax preparers immediately, says the IRS. That's because thieves are targeting professional tax preparers, using phishing and other schemes to steal client data to feed the scheme."}

Donors included lobbyists who have represented the fossil fuel industry, for-profit college companies and major pharmaceutical makers."}
{"original": "Buttigieg raised nearly $6,000, Biden raised nearly $3,000, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) raised $500 from individuals who have worked as federal lobbyists within the past year."}
{"original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders raised just over $1,000 in mostly small, recurring donations from registered lobbyists but had not specifically promised not to do so. Warren, who also pledged to eschew lobbyist fundraising, refunded several donations made by federal lobbyists."}
{"original": "The Biden campaign said it would return the donations HuffPost flagged if it had not already done so, and the Buttigieg campaign said it was looking into whether it should refund the money. After publication, the Klobuchar campaign said it would return the donations as well."}
{"original": "Buttigieg in recent days has sent fundraising emails touting his rejection of special interest cash. At Pete for America, we have kept our promises to voters, reads a recent example. We do not accept money from corporate PACs, fossil fuel executives, or lobbyists. But with four days until the Iowa Caucuses, we can't fall behind on our fundraising efforts."}

{"original": "Biden accepted $1,740 from Gregory Hahn, an Indianapolis attorney whose clients have included an Indiana for-profit college test prep company accused of scamming its customers. His campaign also took donations from a longtime attorney and lobbyist for pharmaceutical manufacturers, Robert Kingham, and lobbyists with numerous ties to the natural gas industry and other pharmaceutical companies. A lobbyist who specializes in advising major multinationals and high-net-worth individuals on international tax issues, Philip West, donated $500."}
{"original": "According to the Federal Election Commission disclosures, none of these donations was refunded (which is what campaigns typically mean when they reject undesirable donations) before the end of 2019."}
{"original": "The Biden campaign had either refunded the donations HuffPost flagged or was in the process of doing so, a spokesman for the campaign said."}
{"original": "We are vigilant in screening donations, Sean Savett, a Buttigieg campaign spokesperson, told HuffPost, but with more than 730,000 donors, some may slip through, and we want to thank you for bringing these donations to our attention."}
{"original": "The Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment."}
{"original": "All of the Democratic candidates for president have made some promise to reject campaign cash from powerful special interests. Every single candidate pledged to refuse campaign donations from corporate PACs. Most of the remaining front-runners — including Klobuchar, Biden, Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — have promised to reject donations from federal lobbyists, and Sanders has promised to reject donations from pharmaceutical lobbyists."}
{"original": "That promise is not as straightforward as it sounds. The common understanding of what counts as lobbying is much broader than what the federal law counts as lobbying. Washington is full of hundreds of people working for issue groups, corporate public relations, trade associations and law firms who don't have to register as lobbyists even though the bulk of their work involves influencing lawmakers. And for the relative few who are considered lobbyists under federal law, the law is notoriously easy to evade."}
{"original": "Campaigns get to make their own determination about what counts as a lobbyist, and they tend to like the narrower definition. In April, Biden held a fundraiser with the executive who oversees Comcast's lobbying arm but is not himself a registered lobbyist. And erstwhile candidate Beto O'Rourke accepted donations from the chief executive of a giant lobbying firm called Subject Matter."}
{"original": "Sanders's campaign, too, accepted roughly $1,000 from two federal lobbyists. The lobbyists who gave to his campaign were Ian Thompson, an American Civil Liberties Union lobbyist who made contributions totaling $735.62, and Marilyn Park, a lobbyist for the American Federation of Government Employees union, who gave a total of $377.70."}
{"original": "Crystal Mason voted in Tarrant County with a provisional ballot in the 2016 presidential election at the insistence of her mother. At the time, she was on supervised release after serving jail time related to a felony tax fraud charge. Texas prohibits felons from voting while they are on probation, but Mason's lawyer told HuffPost no one had ever told Mason she was ineligible."}
{"original": "State District Judge Ruben Gonzalez sentenced Mason to five years in prison in March, even though Mason insisted she didn't knowingly vote illegally and asked prosecutors why she would want to jeopardize her freedom. Gonzalez noted during Mason's trial that she had signed an affidavit at the top of her provisional ballot affirming that she eligible to vote."}
{"original": "Since her sentencing, she has been out on a $20,000 bond; she also requested a new trial, saying the court had not fully explored evidence that showed Mason didn't know she was ineligible. Gonzalez denied that motion on Monday."}
{"original": "Mason's sentence has attracted national attention because of its severity and because charges of institutional racism have surfaced. Mason, who is black, has a case that stands in stark contrast to a white justice of the peace in the same county. He pleaded guilty to turning in forged signatures to get on the ballot but was sentenced to five years of probation. An online petition gathered over 38,000 signatures requesting that the charges against Mason be dropped."}
{"original": "Alison Grinter, Mason's attorney, said in an interview that she would appeal Gonzalez's decision. Grinter said she would argue on appeal that the Texas statute prohibiting people like Mason from voting was overly broad and unconstitutional. The statute says that someone convicted of a felony can only vote once they complete their sentence, including any term of incarceration, parole, or supervision, or completed a period of probation."}
{"original": "Grinter says it's unclear what the term supervision means. When Mason voted in 2016, Grinter said the only way in which Mason was supervised was by being required to periodically log in to a website, update her contact information and affirm she had not been arrested."}
{"original": "That last term, supervision, is really broad and is not defined. We're not really sure who falls into that and who doesn't. We feel like that is a real problem, not only for a criminal statute but also as citizens, she said. Who can vote and who can't? We don't know."}
{"original": "Grinter also said she would argue that the Texas statute blocking Mason from voting is inconsistent with a federal law that allows people to cast a provisional ballot if they believe they are eligible to vote. The state can later block that ballot from being counted if they determine the person was, in fact, ineligible to vote. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Texas Civil Rights Project presented this argument in a brief they filed on behalf of Mason, but Gonzalez declined to consider it. He said they were not filed in time to consider in the request for a new trial and weren't raised at her initial trial."}
{"original": "There are going to be Crystal Masons in the world. There are gonna be people who cast a provisional ballot because they're not sure or they mistakenly believe that they are qualified, she said. If you round up every single Crystal Mason that there is, you might be able to patchwork together a fraud on the populace which is that in person voter fraud is a real thing. Once you do that you give a lot of fertile ground to lawmakers who want to pass voter intimidation laws."}
{"original": "Review of Plutocrats United: Campaign Money, the Supreme Court, and the Distortion of American Elections. By Richard L. Hasen. Yale University Press. 256 pp. $32.50"}
{"original": "There are two things that are important in politics, Marcus Hanna, chairman of the Republican National Committee and United States Senator from Ohio once declared: The first is money, and I can't remember the second."}
{"original": "More than a hundred years later, things haven't changed all that much. Money influences the outcome of elections, access to politicians, and the content of legislation. And the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) opened the floodgates of corporate and union spending in elections and paved the way for the emergence of Super PACS."}
{"original": "In Plutocrats United, Richard Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine and the author of The Voting Wars: From Florida 2000 to the Next Election Meltdown, provides a careful and compelling analysis of the role of money in American politics and proposes a legal strategy to reform campaign financing to give all Americans a meaningful opportunity to participate in elections and protect First Amendment rights to free speech and freedom of the press, without allowing the wealthy (and non-human entities, including corporations) to exercise undue influence."}
{"original": "Hasen maintains that debates over campaign finance limits should not turn on whether or not they will reduce corruption. Access, he acknowledges, may be a legitimate expectation of donors to a candidate's campaign - and evidence of outright bribery is scarce. A better approach would cite political equality as an interest in its own right. Since the Supreme Court called for one man, one vote in Reynolds v. Sims (1964) and struck down the poll tax in Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections (1966), Hasen points out, it has recognized that voting rules should give equal political power to all citizens. The Court has not yet held that each voter has a constitutional right to equal influence (through the electoral process) in having his or her preferred policies enacted into law, but Hasen believes it could and should do so to limit the likelihood that disparities in resources will be turned into disparities in political influence."}
{"original": "Hasen advocates levelling campaign financing up as well as down. Spending limits of $25,000 per election with a two year aggregate cap of $500,000 (and an exemption for media corporations which cover elections), he claims, would neither benefit incumbents nor inhibit competition. A $100 voucher, which every eligible voter could give to a candidate, political party or advocacy support, might even enhance political participation. Pointing to decades of experience with campaign finance limits in the United States and from the much stricter systems in Great Britain and Canada, Hasen insists that his proposals will not endanger freedom of speech or freedom of the press."}
{"original": "He reminds us as well that the Supreme Court has always recognized that the First Amendment doesn't mandate no regulation ever of speech, expression or the spending of money on speech or expression. Courts have declared that society has a compelling reason to penalize libel and child pornographers, for example, as long as the regulation is reasonable. Senator Ted Cruz's scare tactics to the contrary notwithstanding, neither Lorne Michaels, the producer of Saturday Night Live, the NAACP, the Sierra Club or the little old lady who put up a $5 political year sign are likely to land in jail if Citizens United is no longer the law of the land."}
{"original": "Hasen understands that getting any changes in campaign financing through Congress and the courts won't be easy. His own proposals will almost certainly not command majorities in the House of Representatives or the Senate - and if they did wouldn't pass muster with the Supreme Court. And with good reason. Hasen deems a constitutional amendment on campaign finances a non-starter, especially when a solid majority of state legislatures are controlled by Republicans. An amendment, moreover, could well do more harm than good. The original language recently crafted by Senate Democrats, for example, seemed to give local, state, and federal legislatures far too much latitude to suppress political speech. A draft put forward by the group Move to Amend, Hasen indicates, did not include a press exemption, raising serious questions about whether a state could stop the New York Times or Fox News from covering an election. The simplistic amendment proposed from former Justice John Paul Stevens allows reasonable limits on campaign contributions but does not define reasonable."}
{"original": "Unless and until the aging Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy are replaced by progressives, Hasen writes, no change is possible. For now, he recommends keeping the issue alive with short term fixes (which, to be sure, will face an uphill battle in Congress), such as more robust and rigorous disclosure requirements for donors and multiple matching funds for small campaign contributions."}
{"original": "Alas, this assessment appears to be born more of resignation than resolve."}
{"original": "There are so many people in this world who are lost, scared, and just plain bored who turn to Twitter for answers and entertainment. I created my religion for these wandering, laughless souls. I created my religion out of a societal need. The need for a self-proclaimed social media demigod to provide jokes. Followers are followers for a reason. They want to follow. I didn't ask to be a leader. I asked everyone to be followers and they're following. Also, it's a really great way for me to receive a lot of likes and retweets on my way to tax-exempt status."}
{"original": "Democrats in Congress renewed their push to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour on Tuesday, with leaders from both the House and Senate announcing they would introduce bills this week."}
{"original": "The idea of a $15 wage floor from coast to coast has never had more momentum, or more political viability. Democrats have taken control of both chambers of Congress and the White House for the first time in eight years. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has already called on lawmakers to pass a $15 law, which has been the rallying cry of the Fight for $15 campaign by low-wage workers."}
{"original": "But Democrats still face major hurdles in their effort to more than double the federal minimum wage ― and not just from Republicans. The party still has not garnered all the support for a $15 minimum wage that it would need within its own caucus, as some moderate Democrats continue to resist an aggressive increase."}
{"original": "It shouldn't be too hard to gain enough support to pass the bill in the House, although Democrats hold a slimmer majority in the chamber than they did when the Raise the Wage Act passed in 2019. Of the six Democrats — all from swing districts — who voted against that bill, only Rep. Kurt Schrader (Ore.) remains in Congress today. Four others lost reelection to Republican challengers, and New York Rep. Anthony Brindisi's race against Republican Claudia Tenney still remains too close to call. With a smaller majority, Democrats can only afford to lose three votes and still pass legislation."}
{"original": "All but three House Republicans voted against raising the minimum wage at the time, and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a vote on the bill in the upper chamber."}
{"original": "We must use reconciliation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)"}
{"original": "But Democrats have the barest of majorities in the Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris would break a 50-50 tie, and getting to 60 votes seems nearly impossible. Republicans have repeatedly balked at the proposal to raise the minimum wage, citing the potential for job losses. Most business lobbies have opposed an increase for years, leading to the longest stretch ever without a raise to the federal wage floor."}
{"original": "If the federal government mandates a universal $15 minimum wage, many low-income Americans will lose their current jobs and find fewer job opportunities in the future, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said in a statement after Biden supported raising the minimum wage in a COVID-19 relief proposal unveiled before his inauguration."}
{"original": "Unable to clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, Democrats likely would have to blow up the filibuster or use procedural maneuvers to have any hope of sending a bill to Biden's desk."}
{"original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the new Budget Committee chairman, advocated for the latter strategy. He said there was a moral imperative for Congress to pass a minimum wage hike for the first time since 2007."}
{"original": "There ain't nobody in America … who can survive on $7.25 an hour, Sanders said. You can't make it on nine bucks. You can't make it on 12 bucks an hour. … The minimum wage must be a living wage enabling people to live with dignity."}
{"original": "Yet not all Senate Democrats are signed on. There's a close eye on those like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has become something of an avatar for the centrist politician and who could break from his party on the issue."}
{"original": "In 2019, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would increase the pay of 17 million people, but also potentially cost 1.3 million jobs — though the study noted that there was significant uncertainty in that estimate."}
{"original": "The net benefit to the country and citizens is substantial, Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said at the time, citing additional estimates in the CBO report that the increased wage would lift 1.3 million Americans out of poverty. The job loss number was a range ... there's a lot of evidence now that it doesn't cost any jobs in places that have already raised the wage."}
{"original": "Without Republicans on board, Democrats may need to push the bill through a legislative maneuver called budget reconciliation. It only requires the support of a simple majority, but has limitations under Senate rules. Reconciliation bills must have a budgetary impact that's not just merely incidental to the policy. It's not at all clear that increasing the minimum wage would impact federal spending or revenue in that way, and even supporters like Yarmuth are skeptical."}
{"original": "Sanders isn't humoring those limitations, however. He said his office has spoken with the CBO recently and that the last report on the legislation was too narrow in scope to accurately reflect the budgetary impact of increasing the minimum wage."}
{"original": "Please remember that if the Republicans could use reconciliation to pass trillions of dollars in tax breaks for wealthy and large corporations, if the Republicans can use reconciliation process to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and if the Republicans could use reconciliation to try and repeal the Affordable Care Act ... then we can and we must use reconciliation to protect the working families of this country, he said. We must use reconciliation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour."}
{"original": "Tom Williams via Getty Images Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) said Democrats would push the minimum wage increase as a measure on the House floor, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said senators would try to insert it into a COVID-19 relief bill."}
{"original": "For now, Democrats don't have a clear strategy on how to pass this bill at all. Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the sponsor of the House bill, said Tuesday that they would push the minimum wage increase as a separate measure on the House floor, whereas Sanders implied he would fight to include the minimum wage hike as part of a broader push for additional COVID-19 relief."}
{"original": "The federal minimum wage of $7.25 prevails in the 21 states that don't already mandate a higher one, many of which are clustered in the South. Congress passing even a gradual raise to $15 would impact many more states, since only a handful are already on a path toward that benchmark. Florida became the eighth state to pass a $15 law when voters approved a ballot initiative in November."}
{"original": "The bill the House passed in 2019 would increase the minimum wage to $15 over the course of six years, then tie it to an inflation index. The staged increase is meant to assuage hesitant business groups, but there are other elements of the bill that could prove just as contentious."}
{"original": "Democrats insist on phasing out what's known as the tip credit, a feature that allows businesses like restaurants to pay a lower minimum wage to tipped workers and let gratuities make up the difference. Local efforts to abolish the tipped minimum wage have met fierce resistance from employers and even many workers in cities like Washington, D.C. The National Restaurant Association has strongly opposed the federal effort."}
{"original": "Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said Democrats will stand firm on that demand, as well as on one to end sub-minimum wage for workers with disabilities."}
{"original": "We won't accept carveouts, and we won't accept leaving anyone behind, Murray said."}
{"original": "Amazon announced Thursday that it plans to add 100,000 new jobs around the country over the next year and a half."}
{"original": "The online retailer said the positions would include all types of jobs, including engineers, software developers and customer service reps, as well as warehouse workers ― in its growing distribution network. The positions would be full-time and come with standard benefits and health care, as opposed to the temp jobs Amazon is known for in the runup to the holidays."}
{"original": "Although the company didn't give an estimated breakdown of those 100,000 jobs, it's likely most of them would be in the fulfillment centers where workers busily pick, pack and ship orders out to Amazon customers. Glassdoor, a site that tracks salaries based on worker input, pegs the average pay for a fulfillment associate at $12.33 per hour."}
{"original": "Amazon used to have its fulfillment centers clustered in certain states for tax advantages, but it's expanded rapidly to new areas in recent years in order to speed up delivery and dominate the market. The company has opened seven new fulfillment centers in Texas alone since 2013."}
{"original": "But when Amazon adds new positions, it shouldn't necessarily be seen as a clear net gain for the job market in general. After all, the company and other online-only retailers have helped bury plenty of brick-and-mortar chains and mom-and-pop stores along the way, and they will continue to do so. Many Amazon positions are essentially replacing retail jobs that are having a harder time surviving as buyers bargain hunt online."}
{"original": "Amazon's annual revenue recently topped $100 billion per year. The company dominated online sales during the holidays, accounting for more than a third of web sales in November and December. CNBC attributed a lot of those sales to Amazon's offer of one- and two-hour delivery in certain markets, allowing last-minutes shoppers to still buy gifts in time for the holiday."}
{"original": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tore into former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Tuesday after he mocked her plan to raise taxes on the very wealthy as nothing more than a ridiculous publicity stunt."}
{"original": "Schultz, who's thinking about running for president as an independent in 2020, slammed Warren's proposal to impose a 2 percent wealth tax on net worth above $50 million and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion during an interview on NPR's Morning Edition."}
{"original": "When I see Elizabeth Warren come out with a ridiculous plan of taxing wealthy people a surtax of 2 percent because it makes a good headline or sends out a tweet, when she knows for a fact that's not something that's ever gonna be passed ― this is what's wrong, Schultz said. You can't just attack these things in a punitive way by punishing people."}
{"original": "Warren, who launched an exploratory committee for a 2020 presidential bid last month, fired back at the billionaire coffee kingpin later that morning."}
{"original": "What's 'ridiculous' is billionaires who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system rigged for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else, Warren wrote on Twitter. The top 0.1%, who'd pay my #UltraMillionaireTax, own about the same wealth as 90% of America. It's time for change."}

{"original": "We have a billionaire who says he wants to jump into the race and the first issue he's raised is no new taxes on billionaires? she said to HuffPost. Let's see how that goes."}
{"original": "Schultz announced that he is seriously considering a presidential run on Sunday, drawing outrage from Democrats who worry an independent candidate would help President Donald Trump win a second term. A viable independent candidate could attract Democrats and Republicans alienated by Trump's presidency, potentially fracturing the electorate in ways that boost him in 2020."}
{"original": "Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who himself is flirting with a 2020 run, warned on Monday that a third-party candidate would have no chance of winning the election."}
{"original": "I have seen enough data over many years to know that anyone running for POTUS as an independent will split the anti-incumbent, anti-Trump vote, Bloomberg wrote in a statement. The stakes couldn't be higher. We can not afford the risk of spoiler politics that result in Trump's re-election."}
{"original": "There's unlikely to be any formal paid sick leave in the latest COVID-19 rescue bill unless at least 10 Republicans sign on to it, despite the policy's proven effectiveness in slowing the spread of the coronavirus, according to three congressional aides who spoke to HuffPost."}
{"original": "Without Republican support, Democrats will also likely have to leave out paid family and medical leave, illustrating the limitations of Democrats' razor-thin majority in such a deeply partisan Congress."}
{"original": "Democratic aides said they didn't see a way to include a requirement that companies provide paid leave under the constraints of budget reconciliation, a legislative process Democrats are pursuing to pass legislation in the Senate with only a simple majority."}
{"original": "We knew a mandate would never survive [under Senate rules], said one Democratic House aide. It's not like we didn't expect it."}
{"original": "At best, the package would include tax credits for small businesses that opt to offer employees paid time off. A more substantive leave policy that passed with bipartisan support back in March 2020 did require some companies to provide paid leave. It expired at the end of last year."}
{"original": "It is what it is, said a Democratic Senate aide, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the state of negotiations. The aide said that it was still a good sign that tax credits will be included in the package, calling that momentum."}
{"original": "Though the details are still being worked out, the tax credits would likely be available only to small companies. These businesses would get some money back for giving workers paid time off to deal with COVID-19 issues. But it's not clear if companies would even be required to let workers know such leave is available to them."}
{"original": "Most progressives don't see these tax breaks as anything close to legitimate paid sick leave, but simply an extension of the status quo. The U.S., unlike most other developed nations, does not mandate paid sick leave, so few companies offer it — and typically only to fairly well-paid white collar workers."}
{"original": "Congress's failure to include paid sick leave during a pandemic has frustrated progressive advocates. Paid sick and family leave is needed for a raft of critical reasons: First, it would allow workers exposed to COVID-19 to stay home to quarantine or recover from their illness, thus preventing the spread of the disease. The leave could also give workers time off to go get vaccinated. And longer-term family leave is critical to parents who need to be home with children because of school and day care closures. Already millions of women were pushed out of the labor force to deal with that pressure."}
{"original": "It remains deeply disappointing and utterly incomprehensible that Democrats and Republicans can't come together around a public health policy that would prevent COVID cases. Vicki Shabo, New America paid leave specialist"}
{"original": "The rescue package floated by 10 Republican senators last week, countering Biden's opening proposal, entirely omitted the policy."}
{"original": "Advocates call it a wasted opportunity."}
{"original": "It remains deeply disappointing and utterly incomprehensible that Democrats and Republicans can't come together around a public health policy that would prevent COVID cases, help the vaccination process and help keep people in the workforce, said Vicki Shabo, a paid-leave specialist at the New America think tank. Especially women and people of color."}
{"original": "With 50 seats in the Senate, and Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote, Democrats can pass their relief bill without any Republican support through budget reconciliation — a process they started this week. Otherwise, any bill passed by the Senate needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster."}
{"original": "But while bypassing Republicans means Democrats can get a lot of things their colleagues across the aisle have balked at, reconciliation comes with some tradeoffs."}
{"original": "Reconciliation bills must directly impact federal spending or revenue, and they also cannot raise the deficit beyond a certain threshold over the next 10 years. In this case, Senate Democrats put that top-line figure at $1.9 trillion."}
{"original": "A blanket paid leave requirement, or mandate, doesn't directly impact the budget, and therefore would run afoul of Senate rules. Democrats haven't yet decided whether they will include the mandate in their final bill text and simply subject it to an objection from a Republican colleague on the Senate floor."}
{"original": "There are some workarounds. Democrats are pursuing one in this emergency relief push, structuring a paid-leave tax credit for some businesses similar to one that passed back in December."}
{"original": "In the event the mandate can't survive through reconciliation, Democrats are budgeting to continue the voluntary credits from the December deal, a Democratic aide familiar with the talks said."}
{"original": "But without requiring companies to actually give employees paid time off, these tax credits just don't amount to much."}
{"original": "Last year, Congress did have bipartisan momentum around leave, and was able to mandate that some businesses offer paid sick leave to deal with the coronavirus."}
{"original": "Caroline Brehman via Getty Images Democrats had hoped for a national paid sick leave mandate in the latest round of COVID-19 relief, but that is now looking unlikely given their use of restrictive Senate rules to avoid a Republican filibuster."}
{"original": "It was far from an ideal policy. Under White House pressure, Republicans carved out a huge exemption for big businesses. Those with more than 500 employees didn't have to offer paid sick leave at all; that meant essential workers at places like Amazon and Walmart were entirely left out. There were also loopholes involving health care workers."}
{"original": "All told, as many as 106 million workers were excluded, according to one estimate. There haven't been many studies detailing the impact of those carveouts. However, we do know that millions of women were forced out of the labor market last year in part because they needed to be home with children due to school closures. A paid leave policy could have kept those women attached to their jobs — allowing them to take time off to support children home from school, instead of abandoning work wholesale."}
{"original": "But even those restrictions were not enough for Republicans. As the leave was expiring in December, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) blocked an extension of the leave in negotiations. Along with most Republican senators, they had soured on the idea of forcing businesses to provide the time off."}
{"original": "At the time, now-incoming chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), said she would fight for the policy once Biden was inaugurated. But it seems Democrats will likely have to kick this fight down the road once again."}
{"original": "Murray plans to focus on the need for paid leave at a committee hearing to consider the nomination of Marty Walsh for labor secretary on Thursday, an aide to Murray told HuffPost. Republicans are out of step with even the business world on this one. Just this week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a conservative-leaning lobbying group, endorsed the idea of paid sick and family leave as it was structured in the expired legislation."}
{"original": "The leave that passed last year was effective in slowing the spread of disease, according to a study in the journal Health Affairs. Several small-business owners also told HuffPost last year that the policy was a lifesaver, helping them hold on to employees and stay in business amid the pandemic."}
{"original": "The Biden White House had wanted to expand and extend paid sick and family leave in this latest rescue package, proposing a policy that would cover all workers and increase the benefit provided to them."}
{"original": "Three congressional Democratic aides said they hoped it could be passed with Congress's next big legislative package — what the Biden's administration is teasing as a jobs and infrastructure plan that would go beyond emergency COVID-19 relief."}
{"original": "But it's not entirely clear that Republicans will be on board for that slate of bills either. If Democrats are forced once again to resort to another budget reconciliation package to pass their agenda, they will hit the same snag with paid leave ― though congressional aides said they might be able to figure out a workaround with a longer lead time."}
{"original": "Shabo, from New America, is convinced it is possible to pass paid leave through the reconciliation process if lawmakers change the way the policy is structured."}
{"original": "Not only is it technically doable within the Senate's reconciliation rules, it would be a real tragedy if they don't, she said. How can you 'build back better' after a pandemic like this ― and after the exacerbation of disparities that already existed before by gender, race and job ― without creating a national paid leave program, along with child care and long-term care supports?"}
{"original": "Democrats are facing similar complications around their desire to raise the minimum wage; it remains up for debate whether such a policy would significantly impact the federal budget in order to pass muster under Senate rules."}
{"original": "For now, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) are soon expected to reintroduce their own permanent paid leave bill, the Family Act. The hope is that the legislation, which is structured differently than the emergency leave provisions, will garner 60 votes in the Senate."}

Not all debt is passed on after you die, but life insurance provides a tax-free lump sum of money to your loved ones and is a guaranteed worry taken off the table."}
{"original": "It also helps cover your family's financial needs. Whether it's housing, everyday costs (kids seem to need a lot of clothes, food, and school supplies...), or saving for college or retirement, there won't be any what ifs once the primary breadwinner is gone."}
{"original": "And what about those charitable donations? You can name a charity as your beneficiary so your death benefit goes toward a good cause. If the arts are more your thing, you can choose a museum instead. Maybe you'll even get a wing named after you! That'll go way beyond 2017."}
{"original": "If you're someone who goes to the gym regularly, you're probably annoyed at all of those people showing up to your SoulCycle classes. Don't worry, most of them will be gone by February. But life insurance might provide many people the incentive they need to get in shape, because it'll help slim down their life insurance premiums, too."}
{"original": "New Year's resolutioners have a lot of different ideas on getting healthy. Maybe it's losing weight. Maybe it's eating healthier. Maybe it's quitting smoking. The good news is these can all help."}
{"original": "Take losing weight, for instance. Obesity is linked to health conditions like diabetes and heart disease. That means that during the underwriting process, when a life insurance carrier is seeing how risky you are to insure based on your current health and health history, you'll pay more if you're overweight because you're more likely to develop chronic symptoms over the term of the policy. Losing weight and keeping it off for a year can help you get lower rates."}
{"original": "If you quit smoking, not only will you save hundreds or thousands of dollars a year on cigarettes, but staying tobacco-free for a year can bump your rates down to non-smoking levels when you apply. That can cut premiums by as much as half."}
{"original": "Fitbits and Pokemon Go are great and all, but if you really want motivation to get out and exercise, saving on life insurance should be at the top of your list."}
{"original": "Okay, I know what you're thinking. If you're paying for life insurance in the new year - an added expense - how is that making you better with money?"}
{"original": "Because it makes you look at your whole financial picture."}
{"original": "It can be hard getting a grasp on money. You have immediate expenses like a mortgage and groceries, and then all of a sudden those Starbucks purchases are adding up, and then whoops! You haven't contributed to your IRA at all and Junior is going to have to participate in some weird clinical trials to afford college."}
{"original": "But when you buy life insurance, you're forced to think decades ahead. How long will you need a policy to last? What sort of expenses is it going to have to cover? That five-year plan your boss is always asking you about is nothing compared to the 30-year plan you're thinking about when it comes to your retirement."}
{"original": "All of your debts, expenses, and financial goals need to be considered when you buy life insurance. Want to get a better handle on your money, to start saving more and spending less? Life insurance will force you to look much further ahead than just 2017 - meaning you've already crossed something off next year's resolution list."}
{"original": "Technically life insurance won't make you spend more time with your family (unless buying it bring about an impending sense of mortality and you want to make the most with what time you've got left). But it will make you consider your family, and that can have a spillover effect."}
{"original": "Think about it: Life insurance isn't really for you. If it's being used, it's because you're not around anymore. You're really buying it for your family. You're making sure they can get by without you, and that your passing won't have a financial impact on their future. That shows that you really care about them."}
{"original": "Spending time with family is a great goal for showing you care about your family here and now. Buying life insurance shows you'll care about them for years to come, even when you're gone."}
{"original": "There's a lot to stress out about in this world. For most people, money is at or near the top of their freak-out list. Wouldn't you like a little peace of mind going forward?"}
{"original": "Reduce the stress in your life and enjoy it more with the financial security blanket that is life insurance. If the worst happens, there's a built in safety net for your family's financial future. No more sleepless nights wondering what happens to the home if you were to pass, or how college plans might be derailed, or if your own student loans will be more likely to haunt your family than your ghost will."}
{"original": "So what's on your New Year's resolution list? Let us know, and let's figure out together how life insurance can help you cross out your own resolutions!"}
{"original": "Since then, a consensus has emerged among economists that the stimulus package, which ended up costing roughly $840 billion, greatly benefited the economy but should have gone much further."}
{"original": "On Monday, Biden met with 10 Republican senators who pushed for a smaller stimulus package that would total $600 billion. It would offer smaller checks to people, provide less unemployment insurance, and give no aid to state and local governments. Biden told Senate Democrats this week that he believed the size of the GOP senators' counterproposal was too small."}
{"original": "Democratic senators have expressed some unease with wealthier households receiving stimulus checks and have been discussing whether to further limit the number of people who receive payments."}
{"original": "Previously, payments went to all individuals who earned $75,000 or less in the most recent tax year (and all joint filers earning $150,000 or less). The payments shrank by $5 for every $100 of income above those levels, ultimately disappearing for a childless worker who earned more than $103,000."}
{"original": "One option Democrats are discussing is to lower the phaseout threshold to $50,000 for individuals and $100,000 for married couples."}
{"original": "The Biden administration has said it is willing to potentially change the pool of people who would get checks, while keeping the payments at $1,400 per person."}
{"original": "It hurts so bad, and you wish you could quit it. But you're driving down the highway and it comes on the radio, or you're at the newsstand to get gum and you see the headlines ― you can't get the disgracefulness of Donald Trump and his crew out of your face, or out of your mind. So you plunge back in, with another edition of Trump Team Disgracefulness Power Rankings. Damnit."}
{"original": "Republic Report, which focuses on how money corrupts democracy, has met its abusive dream mate with the kleptocratic administration of President Donald J. Trump. Trump and his lieutenants personify how money and greed, mixed with serious bigotry, disrespect for constitutional freedoms, know-nothing ignorance, and an endless capacity for lying, can really, really corrupt democracy."}
{"original": "Hence, Trump Team Disgracefulness Power Rankings, counting down the week's ten most disgraceful figures in the Trump administration. Grab a 48-pack of Zima and join us."}
{"original": "This week T-Rex erupts, Huckabee Sanders fakes the news, and bloody Donald raises money for his campaign and his hotel in one big party."}
{"original": "Permanent spoiler alert: We simply can't imagine anyone other than Donald J. Trump ever occupying the top spot in the rankings. But we won't get tired of him winning. Believe me."}
{"original": "10. Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State. Last week's ranking: ―"}
{"original": "Marginalized by Trump and his team, Tillerson, according to Politico, finally blew his stack at presidential personnel director Johnny DeStefano for repeatedly blocking Tillerson's picks for key State Department jobs. The outburst reportedly stunned those in the room, who included chief of staff Reince Priebus (two weeks ago ranking: 10), Prince Jared Kushner, and Tillerson omnipresent chief of staff Margaret Peterlin. According to Politico's sources, Kushner approached Peterlin afterward and told her that Tillerson's outburst was completely unprofessional... (A dressing down in that Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy voice must be scary.) This report, indicating that Tillerson may have some spine and reaffirming that White House aides are mostly to blame for the ridiculous understaffing at State so far, almost moved Tillerson out of our countdown ― almost."}
{"original": "It remains the case that Tillerson could be working with the career State Department staff to make a positive difference in all kinds of ways; Trump likely wouldn't even notice. Instead, Tillerson calls values like human rights obstacles to U.S. interests, held a press briefing on a Saudi Arabia trip without inviting the U.S. media, and appears to have ignored his commitment to recuse from matters related to the company he used to run, ExxonMobil. But fundamentally, Tillerson is just a large gaping hole where a Secretary of State is supposed to be: To many State Department employees, Mr. Tillerson is something of a phantom who says little in staff meetings, rarely leaves his seventh-floor office — where he is surrounded by ... a small group of protective aides — and does not solicit their views."}
{"original": "That's OK, though, because when it comes to foreign relations, President Trump, Stephen Bannon, Ivanka, and especially Jared got this."}
{"original": "9. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary. Last week's ranking: 10"}
{"original": "Asked at the Tuesday press briefing about morning tweets by Trump that called CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, the Washington Post, and the New York Times all Fake News! Sanders played to Trump and his base, attacking the media for covering the Trump-Russia hoax and claiming that the president is subjected to a constant barrage of fake news. Like Trump, Sanders raised the incident where three CNN staffers resigned following the retraction of a story about Trump official Anthony Scaramucci."}
{"original": "Sanders has every right to call out media operations when they get facts wrong. But Sanders is supposed to be a professional, doing a professional job, and to ratify Trump's inflammatory and absurd use of the term fake news to refer to legitimate news organizations is simply, yes, disgraceful. It's also the case that when CNN and other legitimate news organizations make mistakes, they tend to correct them promptly. Meanwhile, Trump has lied hundreds of times, and never admits or corrects a mistake ever. Where his whopper cannot be sustained ― such as the suggestion that President Obama wasn't born in the U.S. or that there are Comey tapes ― he just makes like Sherlock Holmes and announces he has solved the case."}
{"original": "8. Kellyanne Conway, Counselor to the President. Last week's ranking: ―"}
{"original": "At least some of Kellyanne Conway's absurd rationalizations of Trump disgracefulness have been original (such as the amazing alternative facts). This week, Conway relied on an old GOP trick (believe me), saying on ABC's This Week that the Senate healthcare bill doesn't cut Medicaid. While Medicaid spending would rise year to year under the bill, the effect of the bill would be to cut Medicaid spending from what would occur in the absence of the bill. That's a cut. (Boss Trump followed up with a tweet along the same lines.)"}
{"original": "Conway also offered a let them eat cake defense of the bill, saying that people who lose coverage,if they are able-bodied and they want to work, can go get jobs that provide coverage. Only thing is, as Jonathan Cohn writes, The majority of able-bodied adults on Medicaid already have jobs. The problem is that they work as parking lot attendants and child care workers, manicurists and dishwashers ― in other words, low-paying jobs that typically don't offer insurance. Take away their Medicaid and they won't be covered."}
{"original": "7. Jeff Sessions, Attorney General. Last week's ranking: 7"}
{"original": "In addition to reviving the counterproductive war on drugs, and his cancellation of an Obama order to phase out federal use of the often-horrible private prison industry (which donated big to Trump), Sessions has banned government lawyers from reaching agreements that take some of the funds disgorged from corporate defendants in civil and criminal settlements and give it to non-profit groups. This practice takes cash ponied up by manufacturers, polluters, or banks caught engaging in fraud or other misconduct and provides it to groups that work to protect the public by fighting against such misconduct, helping victims, or crafting policy solutions. Big corporate donors don't like this constructive approach, so Sessions just got rid of it."}
{"original": "6. Mike Pence, Vice President of the United States. Last week's ranking: 6"}
{"original": "For his rapturous gazes at Trump in every meaningless White House meeting and ceremony. Also for the same reasons as the GOP Congress, see 2 below."}
{"original": "5. Stephen Bannon, White House Chief Strategist. Last week's ranking: 5"}
{"original": "Again this week, we have almost no idea what Bannon did, beyond making marks on his white (supremacy) board. Whatever he did, he's a disgraceful bigot."}
{"original": "4. Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education. Last week's ranking: 3"}
{"original": "Lord knows just how big a mess Betsy DeVos plans to make of her supposed area of expertise, K-12 education. For now, many of her Department's public actions have focused on hurting college students, especially the victims of predatory for-profit colleges. Proceeding with her plans to dump Obama rules aimed at holding bad colleges accountable, DeVos's team apparently has also now set its sights on campus sexual assault, that is, on weakening protections against campus sexual assault. Since 2014, the Department has every week released a list of colleges and universities being investigated for alleged mishandling of sexual violence claims. This week, Candice Jackson, the acting head of the Department's Office for Civil Rights, gave a speech in which she denounced the effort as a list of shame and said the Department might soon stop publishing it ― which would make nervous college administrators happy but would weaken accountability and protection of students."}
{"original": "We also neglected, amid a sea of Trump team disgracefulness, to mention that two weeks ago DeVos's Department invited representatives of the right-wing evangelical groups Family Research Council and Focus on the Family to appear on a panel at a Department conference on Engaging Fathers and Families. Among other atrocities, both groups oppose LGBTQ rights and support the odious practice of gay conversion therapy. DeVos didn't attend the event and has said she opposes conversion therapy, but members of the DeVos family are major donors to both of these family organizations. And earlier this year, DeVos, Trump, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions teamed up to cancel Obama protections for transgender schoolchildren."}
{"original": "Department of Education officials say DeVos is the lightest of lightweights, and that a handful of her appointees are running the policy efforts at ED, cutting most career staff out of the loop of information, let alone decision-making. In particular, insiders say, Robert Eitel, a former executive at the predatory schools Bridgepoint Education and Career Education Corp., is playing a key role in policy affecting for-profit colleges, casting doubt on his commitment to recuse from some matters. A good number of the conscientious career staff are out looking for new jobs."}
{"original": "3. Scott Pruitt, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator. Last week's ranking: 4"}
{"original": "Why is Scott Pruitt so determined to lead the effort to destroy America's environment and the world's climate? I suppose because it's a niche that has provided him with big donations from the fossil industries, fueling his rise from Tulsa lawyer and minor league baseball owner to state senator to Oklahoma attorney general to EPA head, and perhaps next to the U.S. Senate seat up in 2020 and currently occupied by 82-year-old James Inhofe (R-OK). From there, maybe oil, gas, and coal money could propel Pruitt into the White House."}
{"original": "I mean, if we still have a damn country at that point. Seriously, is this a good tradeoff?"}
{"original": "Last week, we hit Pruitt over the revelation that his EPA had kicked dozens of respected scientists off the agency's Board of Scientific Counselors. This week it was revealed that Pruitt's chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, pressured the leader of that board, Deborah Swackhamer, before her scheduled congressional testimony, to play down the dismissals. I was stunned that he was pushing me to 'correct' something in my testimony, Swackhamer said. I was factual, and he was not. I felt bullied. Lamar Smith, the House Science Committee chair who loves fossil fuel companies as much as Pruitt, insisted that Jackson did nothing wrong."}
{"original": "2. Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader (last week's ranking: 2), Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, and all other Republicans in Congress."}
{"original": "At this point, given the stark awfulness of Donald J. Trump (see 1, below), the entire Republican caucus in each house of Congress is a disgrace for not: (1) making an express, concerted public break with Trump; (2) approaching the Democrats to jointly launch an impeachment investigation for abuse of office; and, even, heaven forbid (3) working with the Democrats to get things done that will actually help the American people, including by strengthening, not weakening, health care; creating jobs; and making genuine investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and education. Unfortunately, so long as Trump gives the congressional GOP what its donors want — tax cuts for the rich and deregulation of corporations — McConnell, Ryan, et al. seem okay with allowing Trump to act disgracefully. Sad!"}
{"original": "1. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States. Last week's ranking: duh"}
{"original": "Thursday morning Trump attained a historical low level of petty disgustingness for a U.S. president, with his tweets stating that he refused to meet at Mar-A-Lago over New Year's Eve with cable TV hosts and increasingly vocal Trump critics Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski and that the latter was bleeding badly from a face-lift."}
{"original": "Trump might as well replace the Andrew Jackson painting in the Oval Office with one of Andrew Dice Clay."}
{"original": "But that was just one marker in another week full of Trump disgracefulness."}
{"original": "Trump attended a $35,000-a-person fundraiser Wednesday for his 2020 re-election campaign ― at the Trump International Hotel down the street from the White House, once again using his political power to benefit his business interests, flaunting his kleptocratic awfulness and disregard for ethics standards right in front of the American people. I was outside with a feisty group of protestors, but reporters, after being told by the White House late in the day that they could attend, were afterwards uninvited because of supposed logistical concerns. Us protestors could see the event, or maybe some lower-donor auxiliary room of it, through the hotel windows, and we saw one guy making a point of chewing plates of food while staring at us, while a Jonah Ryanish dork pressed his ear against the glass and mouthed I can't hear you."}
{"original": "It was also clearer than ever this week that Trump has absolutely no idea what he's talking about on health care ― other than the droning in his head that Obamacare is a total and complete disaster. He obviously doesn't know or care what is in the House or Senate bills, including that the bills are fundamentally a tax cut for the rich that leaves pretty much every health care consumer worse off. He just wants to sign something, anything, because his entire presidency is driven by revenge for getting ribbed by Obama six years ago at the White House Correspondents Dinner."}
{"original": "President Flintstone also made his latest Russiagate confession, telling Fox News Sycophant Ainsley Earhardt (this week's ranking: 11) that his tweet threatening that there might be tapes of his meetings with James Comey was aimed at influencing Comey's upcoming congressional testimony: when [Comey] found out that there maybe are tapes out there, whether it's governmental tapes or anything else or who knows, I think his story may have changed and you'll have to look into that because then he'll have to tell what actually took place at the events.... you'll have to determine for yourself whether or not his story changed. Earhardt sycophantically summed up Trump's ramblings: It was a smart way to make sure he stayed honest in those hearings. To which Trump Flinstonishly replied: Well, it wasn't very stupid, I can tell you that. He added: He did admit that what I said was right and, if you look further back before he heard about that, maybe he wasn't admitting that."}
{"original": "In fact, Comey's account to the Senate Intelligence Committee ― including that Trump got him alone and said I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go ― was entirely consistent with the account that Comey had leaked to the media prior to his testimony; Comey did not admit that Trump was right. But you already knew that. Comey's account, backed by Trump's own admissions regarding his motivations, solidifies a powerful case of obstruction of justice against Trump, a matter currently being probed by special counsel Robert Mueller."}
{"original": "It's unclear what Trump's Bad Dream Team of lawyers thought of Trump's latest confession; loose cannons themselves Marc Kasowitz (two weeks ago ranking: 8) and Jay Sekulow (last week's ranking: 8) may not have been phased, but presumably mercenary Jared lobbyist Jamie Gorelick (two weeks ago ranking: 9), and actually appropriate criminal lawyer John Dowd were shaking their heads."}
{"original": "But even worse than the spectacle of our head of state compulsively confessing to obstruction of justice is Trump's refusal to take seriously or act on the continuing threat of Russian interference in our democracy. Likely because Trump sees evidence of Russian manipulation of the 2016 election as a threat to his presidential manhood, CNN reports that Trump's own advisers are struggling to convince him that Russia still poses a threat. Trump has done nothing publicly to punish or deter Russia regarding election interference, and, according to CNN, Multiple senior administration officials said there are few signs the President is devoting his time or attention to the ongoing election-related cyber threat from Russia."}
{"original": "JFC. Trump is again this week's number one in Republic Report's Trump Team Disgracefulness Power Rankings. Trump is not merely a disgrace; he's a total and complete disgrace."}
{"original": "This article also appears on Republic Report."}
{"original": "The Me Too movement has successfully taken down some powerful men who sexually abuse and harass women. But a large group of survivors has been excluded from the conversation: incarcerated women."}
{"original": "Women in prisons and jails face rampant sexual abuse at the hands of correctional officers. If you go into a prison and ask, Who has been a victim of sexual harassment or assault? I'm certain everyone will raise their hand. Rape is a part of prison culture, and our voices have been silenced for too long. Me Too must include us, too."}
{"original": "Incarcerated women have their rights stripped from them, including the right to consent or object to sex. Sexual contact of any kind with an incarcerated person is illegal. But when I got to prison, it didn't take long for me to experience unwanted sexual advances from male correctional officers. It is a normal part of daily prison life for officers to abuse their power and harass the women they are supposed to monitor. Often, unwanted attention turns into sexual assault. Often, they rape us. And we are forced to stay silent."}
{"original": "Being confined in a facility where our abusers work every day is torture. This is something I experienced firsthand, time and again, during my 17-year sentence."}
{"original": "Sergeant P. asked me to sleep naked for him. I refused. The next morning he entered my cell and woke me up by roughly grabbing my breasts saying, You didn't do what I asked. He woke me up every morning after that ― sometimes with sexual advances and sometimes just to intimidate me. When he looked at me, I felt violated, as if bugs were crawling all over my body. And he knew there was nothing I could do about it."}
{"original": "Officer B. explicitly told me whenever we were alone how he would fuck me, and his harassment didn't stop there. Once, while I was discarding food into a loud, giant compacter behind the mess hall, Officer B. came up behind me. He yanked down my pants and tried to penetrate me as my screams were drowned out by the loud compactor. He only stopped when the machine turned off."}
{"original": "Incarcerated women cannot escape their abusers, and they place themselves at risk of retaliation if they speak up."}
{"original": "Officer S. roughly grabbed my breasts and nipples while patting me down and frisking me. He ran his hands down my body and cupped and squeezed my vagina."}
{"original": "Officer R. raped me, and I was reminded of this every day, as the window of my housing unit looked out onto the building where the assault took place."}
{"original": "This daily humiliation and violence were all too familiar. My boyfriend also raped me. He acted like I was his property, and if I didn't give my body to him, he took it. When I became state property, the officers treated me the same way ― and I am not alone in this reality."}
{"original": "Over 85 percent of incarcerated women have experienced sexual violence in their lifetimes ― and the abuse is repeated behind prison walls. Women in prison are disproportionately women of color, and the vast majority are economically marginalized."}
{"original": "Incarcerated women cannot escape their abusers, and they place themselves at risk of retaliation if they speak up. When an incarcerated woman does come forward about sexual abuse, the prison's response is often to transfer her out of the facility ― not the officer. This system effectively keeps the men who commit such violence inside, and brands the victims who speak up as troublemakers and snitches. Most incarcerated women want to avoid transferring facilities because this could jeopardize their minimal access to family visits."}
{"original": "I was one of those women. I am from Rochester, so being in upstate New York meant my family could regularly visit me. I had previously been incarcerated downstate, during which time I saw my family just once in four years. I couldn't go that long without seeing them again, so I kept silent about the abuse I was experiencing."}
{"original": "Halfway through my sentence, I got tired of the lack of recourse. So, when I caught an officer having sex with a woman in the officer's bathroom, I risked retaliation and made an official complaint to the inspector general. When the head of the IG sex crimes unit came to see me, she said she could do nothing unless I brought her physical evidence. Stunned, I asked if that meant in effect I had to engage in a sex act with the officer to gather this evidence. She replied, Or however you can get it. No further action was taken, and the woman was transferred downstate. Nothing changed."}
{"original": "Today, I am no longer afraid to speak out. The power of Me Too made me think: Why not us, too? Even though we broke the law, rape, intimidation and sexual harassment were not part of our sentence. I want to say to the officers: Your job was to maintain care, custody and control, not to rape or harass me."}
{"original": "The core values of prison culture ― punishment and control ― give rise to abuse. Lawmakers should seek alternatives to incarceration that create real opportunities for people to both take responsibility for the harm they have caused and also heal from the trauma they have experienced."}
{"original": "Here in New York, activists are campaigning to pass the Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act, which would give judges the discretion to direct abuse survivors to alternative programs when they are convicted of crimes directly related to abuse. Activists in other states should follow suit."}
{"original": "Even though we broke the law, rape, intimidation and sexual harassment were not part of our sentence."}
{"original": "Everyday citizens may not think mass incarceration affects them, but it affects every one of us, right down to our tax dollars. Each American can, and should, take the time to listen to formerly incarcerated women and men, and learn about what happens every day behind prison walls."}
{"original": "Prisons are ultimately money-making institutions that re-victimize people who have experienced trauma in the name of keeping society safe. Once we recognize that, we must question our belief in a system that fails us all, over and over again."}
{"original": "Through my partnership with the Women & Justice Project, I am part of a large community of formerly incarcerated women who are helping to guide the transformation of Manhattan's Bayview Correctional Facility. The former women's prison once had the highest rate of reported staff sexual abuse. We are now transforming it into The Women's Building, a global hub for girls' and women's rights movements. A critical step in this process is to acknowledge the building's history as a space of both dehumanization and women's resilience and to recognize the potential to transform other women's prisons around the country."}
{"original": "However, incarcerated women need a voice while they're still inside those walls. For the Me Too movement to have a meaningful impact on ending rape culture, it must include the voices of incarcerated women, who, at this very moment, are still silently enduring horrific abuse."}
{"original": "Kim Brown is an anti-domestic violence and criminal justice reform activist, who served 17 years in prison for defending herself from her abuser."}
{"original": "It will grow annually because the excise tax increases annually, Pace told The Huffington Post. We also expect many new farms to come online this year. Only roughly half of the licensed farms were operational in 2016."}
{"original": "A Pueblo County spokeswoman said in a statement to HuffPost that finding new ways to help students pay for college is important to her community."}
{"original": "It is so critically important to make college affordable for our youth if we want to provide long-term economic opportunity to our community, she said. Too many kids can't afford to go to college, with this program we are taking cannabis-tax revenue and using it to provide for a brighter future in Pueblo."}
{"original": "Florida just joined the growing list of states that have put an end to the so-called tampon tax."}
{"original": "Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed a law on Thursday making feminine hygiene products including tampons, pads and menstrual cups tax-exempt, the AP reports. The law goes into effect in January."}
{"original": "The measure was part of a larger $180 million tax cut package."}
{"original": "The majority of states across the country subject menstrual products to sales taxes because they're considered a luxury item."}
{"original": "But opponents of the standard argue that feminine products are a necessity and that taxing them is effectively a tax on menstruation. (The Tax Foundation, the conservative-leaning non-profit, has countered that ideally, sales tax should apply to all consumer products, regardless of whether they're a necessity or luxury.)"}
{"original": "According to the AP, Florida now joins 13 other states that, in addition to Washington D.C., have exempt menstrual products from sales tax or do not have a sales tax at all. Measures doing away with the tax have enjoyed unusually bi-partisan support in state legislators, prompting media outlets to call them viral legislation. Florida, for example, is a politically purple state with a decidedly mixed record on reproductive and women's rights ― yet the change was supported by progressive and conservative lawmakers alike."}
{"original": "This common sense legislation will result in a tax savings for women all over the state who purchase these necessary products, Sen. Kathleen Passidomo (R-Naples), who originally filed the bill, said in a press release."}
{"original": "However, not all states have jumped onboard. California, a traditionally blue state, tried to pass such a measure last year. It failed when Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed it despite broad support in the House and Senate."}
{"original": "Women have no choice but to buy these products, said one California assemblywoman who championed the California bill."}
{"original": "You can't just ignore your period, she added. It's not like you can just ignore the constant flow."}
{"original": "Estimates suggest that women spend more than $18,000 on their periods over the course of their lifetime, between pads, tampons, birth control and new underwear."}
{"original": "Did you know that with the exception of Christmas, people spend more money on Mother's Day than any other holiday? The forecast for 2017 is $23.6 billion, and if you think scammers aren't on the job, there's a new marshmallow bridge spanning Loon Lake I'd to sell you a piece of."}
{"original": "In order, the most-gifted recipients of Mother's Day sentimental swag are mothers and stepmothers, then wives, daughters, sisters or stepsisters, grandmothers, godmothers, and, for the overzealous beyond that familial range — friends."}
{"original": "Here are four scams you'll want to avoid while you're shopping."}
{"original": "These days, paper greeting cards cost anywhere from 50 cents to $8, but the average cost of a festive snail-mail missive is between $4 and $5. This explains the huge uptick in e-cards' popularity. They are more environmentally friendly and cost nothing. Sounds like a win-win, right? Not exactly. This method of transmitting heartfelt sentiment — as with all new technology — has the potential to create a massive headache for the mothers in your life who have something coming to them."}
{"original": "Specifically, the problem with e-cards is that they open the door to fake e-cards. Most people on social media accept friend requests from strangers, and once those strangers are welcomed into the fold, they are allowed as friends to see friends of their new friends. They can figure out who among your relatives has kids, and send them a fake e-card in your name — one carrying malware that can steal the recipient's identity or wreak havoc in cyberspace. One click can install a keystroke logger that turns any electronic device into a transmitter of login information (endangering every account, especially finances), rope devices into botnets that distribute spam or launch distributed denial of service attacks on major websites."}
{"original": "Remember the rule: Never trust, always verify. Ask the person who sent you the e-card, in a separate email, if they sent a card. Don't click through without a response, because there is no way to know the URL and determine if it's legitimate."}

{"original": "Nothing brightens a mother's day more than a beautiful bouquet. If you are ordering online, make sure the URL matches the shop's website if you clicked through from anything other than your own search results. Call the shop to make sure they are the real deal."}
{"original": "Another favorite ruse dating back some time: Selling fake coupons from stores that promise monthly or weekly flower delivery. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, most likely it is. Either work with a florist you know or find one near the recipient and conduct business with them directly."}
{"original": "Fake coupons for saving are making the rounds again this year, most recently on Facebook, where people have been tempted by a $50 coupon redeemable at Lowe's Home Improvement. If you click through, you'll be asked to take a survey that solicits personal information and to post the offer on your Facebook timeline. Needless to say, the coupon is worthless."}
{"original": "These coupons are not offers extended by Lowe's, the company wrote in response to customer questions on its Facebook page. It is a scam and Lowe's is unable to honor the coupon."}
{"original": "Likewise, you should avoid a similar $75 coupon for Bed Bath & Beyond also making the rounds on social media. It's a classic phishing scheme. When victims click on the link, they land on a fraudulent site that looks like the real thing, where consumers are prompted to enter sensitive personal information as well as their credit card number."}
{"original": "Bed Bath & Beyond similarly warned consumers that the coupons were fraudulent."}
{"original": "We are sorry for any confusion and disappointment this fake coupon has caused, it wrote on its Facemaiebook page. We are partnering with Facebook to have these coupons removed. Thank you for your understanding!"}
{"original": "Facebook did not immediately respond to request to comment."}
{"original": "Caution should be used when it comes to any coupons, be they for a restaurant, an all-inclusive spa day or an in-home massage. It's always best to call a favorite spot and make arrangements. There are plenty of crooks out there willing to represent those places to steal your personal or payment information."}
{"original": "A whopping $46 billion was spent on gift cards last year, and numbers like that always attract scam artists. How it works: The scammer goes to the in-store sales rack and writes down the numbers on gift cards. They then call the customer service departments identified on the back of the cards to see if (and when) they have been activated. Like tax-related fraud, this scam succeeds or fails depending on how fast a transaction occurs, so if you get a gift card, it's always best to use it as soon as you can. Otherwise, you may find it's already been cashed in."}
{"original": "Finally, beware of third-party sites selling discounted gift cards. While some gift card resale sites are legitimate and offer buyer protections, not all do and open marketplaces that don't specialize in this type of sale can be particularly susceptible to fraudsters. That's why I recommend always going to the official financial service or retailer's website to purchase gift cards."}
{"original": "Fashion and quality at the best price, in a sustainable way! shouts H&M's Twitter bio. That's how the Swedish company wants its customers to think of the brand."}
{"original": "The fast-fashion behemoth has gone to great lengths to claim sustainable status in recent years. Its Conscious Collection features garments made from organic cotton, recycled polyester, lyocell and, as of its next collection, Circulose, a textile made from recycled clothes. H&M releases a yearly sustainability report, and an in-store recycling scheme is in place so customers can drop off a bag of their unwanted clothes in return for a 15% discount."}
{"original": "Zara, owned by Inditex –– which, according to some rankings, is the most profitable fashion company in the world ― also makes bold sustainability commitments. It has pledged to make its clothes from 100% sustainable materials by 2025."}
{"original": "Sustainability is the new buzzword for the fashion industry. Over the course of just three or four years, awareness of the environmental impact of fashion has skyrocketed. In its 2019 Year in Fashion report, the global fashion search platform Lyst reported that searches that include sustainability-related keywords have increased 75% year on year, with specific searches for more sustainable materials such as Econyl (a form of nylon made from waste products) and organic cotton (which doesn't rely on environmentally harmful pesticides or fertilizers) are on the rise, too."}
{"original": "In response to increased scrutiny and consumer interest, brands have reacted quickly, turning to returns schemes and recycled and organic materials to level up their sustainable credentials."}
{"original": "ymgerman via Getty Images An H&M store in Brisbane, Australia. The company is making pledges on its climate and environmental impact but is also opening hundreds of new stores a year."}
{"original": "While these brands may appear to operate sustainably on the surface, their underlying goals remain the same: to sell as much as possible to as many people as possible."}
{"original": "In 2019, the H&M Group, which already has 593 stores in the United States alone, opened 281 stores globally — more outlets for the 600 million garments that it reportedly manufactures each year. The H&M Group also counts COS, Weekday, Monki, & Other Stories and ARKET among its brands and, over the course of 2019, expanded the five brands into 70 new markets."}
{"original": "And Zara may have made big commitments on materials, but it still releases 500 new designs each week, adding up to more than 20,000 a year."}
{"original": "In H&M's case, having some 'sustainable' materials in the mix makes little difference when in 2018 they overproduced $4.3 billion worth of goods. Timo Rissanen, associate professor of fashion design and sustainability at Parsons"}
{"original": "Such a huge output puts a strain upon the environment in varying ways. To make just a single T-shirt, for instance, takes 594 gallons of water — as much as one person would drink in two and a half years. The industry as a whole uses 1.3 trillion gallons of water a year for fabric dyeing alone, and it isn't just using up water; it's also polluting it."}
{"original": "During the manufacturing process, wastewater, chemicals and dyes are released into local bodies of water, destroying ecosystems, killing aquatic life and contaminating the groundwater. And this pollution continues after clothes are purchased ― as many as 1.5 million microfibers are released when synthetic clothes are washed, contributing to plastic pollution in waterways."}
{"original": "The [fast-fashion] business model is inherently unsustainable, says Timo Rissanen, author, zero waste designer and associate professor of fashion design and sustainability at Parsons School of Fashion in New York. The challenge is applying the concept of planetary boundaries to an individual business. If we know there is a finite amount of pie, how do we determine which brand gets how much of the pie? At the moment, most businesses operate as if all of the pie was theirs alone, and even then as if the pie was limitless."}
{"original": "In H&M's case, Rissanen continues, having some 'sustainable' materials in the mix makes little difference when in 2018 they overproduced $4.3 billion worth of goods."}
{"original": "A spokeswoman for H&M said sustainability was embedded in the company. Our critics often conflate the size and scale of H&M with our sustainability work when discussing us, but the truth is that these are two separate issues, she said in a statement to HuffPost. Our aim is to move to a fully circular business model where resources stay in use and nothing goes to waste, meaning that the scale of our production won't have the environmental impact it has had in the past."}
{"original": "HuffPost contacted Inditex for comment but had not heard back at the time of publication."}
{"original": "Certainly, growth for growth's sake and ever-rising sales seem irreconcilable with true sustainability, so perhaps we need to ask exactly how brands are framing sustainability in the first place."}
{"original": "What are they measuring? What are they thinking of as sustainable? asks Céline Semaan, founder and CEO of Slow Factory, a design lab that works with companies to research and implement sustainability-focused initiatives."}
{"original": "Semaan says that many brands are thinking about sustainability in terms of their own operations when they should be thinking of it in terms of the environment."}
{"original": "That's what the word was supposed to be defining: sustainability for our ecosystems, for our resources, for our human labor. They are part of this large machine that requires them to overproduce and relies on the insecurities of the public that over-purchases, Semaan said."}
{"original": "To target the real issues ― overproduction and overuse of finite resources ― fashion brands must slow down, says Semaan. But, she adds, less production means that there will be less funds to support their operation, and as long as the outcome of slowing down is less profit, they're unlikely to embrace that particular solution."}
{"original": "Hackwith Design House, a Minnesota-based sustainable fashion brand that manufactures everything in-house, understands the difficulty of balancing scale with a truly sustainable model. It's so much more expensive, but we believe it is worth it to be able to oversee our production, says director of operations Erin Husted. We could grow much faster if our margins could be bigger, but they can't be if we want to continue to be sustainable and ethical. We just have to be a lot more patient."}
{"original": "What are they measuring? What are they thinking of as sustainable? They are part of this large machine that requires them to overproduce and relies on the insecurities of the public that over-purchases. Céline Semaan, founder and CEO of Slow Factory"}
{"original": "The added expense of manufacturing in-house is reflected in Hackwith Design House's prices, which are 10 times that of something comparable from H&M. Higher prices represent the true value of safer working conditions for garment workers, more sustainable practices in the supply chain and better quality, but they're still a barrier many brands struggle to move past."}
{"original": "Still, as a smaller brand, Hackwith Design House can keep a careful eye on its scale and production compared to a global conglomerate. Where enormous, continent-spanning brands are concerned, Semaan believes that slowing down will not happen overnight ― or perhaps at all ― so at Slow Factory, she works hard to capture and reintroduce into the supply chain materials that would otherwise go to waste."}
{"original": "If we aren't going to convince them to slow down overall, which is the main objective, we can at least slow down and mitigate the amount of waste, she says. For many brands, it's a case of retrofitting their operations with sustainable systems including waste recapturing and cleaning wastewater, which is certainly positive for the environment but can still be considered greenwashing — a distraction from the real issue."}
{"original": "Even for brands that have been sustainable since day one, scaling up requires a precise plan and framework to ensure that growth doesn't mean environmental destruction."}
{"original": "Reformation, the cult Los Angeles-based sustainable label, introduced a variety of initiatives to hold itself accountable as it grew, Kathleen Talbot, chief sustainability officer and VP of operations, told HuffPost, from carefully vetting new manufacturing partners to becoming 100% carbon-, water- and waste-neutral, to its Sustainability at Reformation framework."}
{"original": "The goals of the framework include reducing links with mills not certified as sustainable, training on sustainable purchasing practices and building a program to reduce, reuse and recycle fabric scraps."}
{"original": "Reformation also tracks its environmental footprint by adding up the pounds of carbon dioxide it emits, gallons of water it uses, and pounds of waste it generates for every product it makes. It's a lot of extra work, but staying sustainable as you grow has gotten easier, Talbot believes."}
{"original": "Honestly, it was lonely when we started 11 years ago, she said. Our mill and manufacturing partners thought we were crazy - we were asking a million questions and pushing to our standards, and none of their other clients were doing that. We were told 'no' a lot. We still get some of this but see so many opportunities ... The momentum of the industry and willingness to be more sustainable has made it easier for us to scale."}
{"original": "The bigger the scale, though, the more complex the supply chains are and the higher the risk of unwittingly (or, indeed, knowingly) engaging with poorly regulated supplier factories that cause pollution, use child labor and engage in environmentally irresponsible agricultural operations."}
{"original": "Rissanen suggests we turn toward alternative fashion models for which growth isn't inherent, such as not-for-profit fashion brands like Origin Africa, which puts its profits towards humanitarian causes, employee-owned brands like Eileen Fisher and community-based, nonprofit sharing platforms."}
{"original": "From clothes rental to peer-to-peer sharing platforms such as Tulerie, Wardrobe and Rent the Runway, alternatives are on the rise, with the U.S. apparel rental market set to be worth over $4 billion by 2028. But the issue remains that existing fashion brands need to make far more dramatic changes than the ones they're currently making."}
{"original": "Consumers and activists can make an impact by buying less and supporting brands that take sustainability seriously, but, experts argue, without industry fully on board, making any real headway will be almost impossible. Voluntary action only goes so far, as H&M and Zara demonstrate. Experts argue that regulation and incentives are what's needed for genuine business model change."}
{"original": "Kelly Sullivan via Getty Images Rent the Runway's West Coast flagship store opened in San Francisco in May 2019."}
{"original": "Governments can step in, just as France did with its ban on the destruction of unsold consumer goods, making it compulsory to hand in the products for reuse or recycling and diverting them from landfills or incinerators. The U.K. introduced the Modern Slavery Act, which has built awareness and increased the identification of potential trafficking victims by 17%, and the state of California introduced its Transparency in Supply Chains Act, which makes retailers and manufacturers provide information on what action they're taking, if any, to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains, plus a recent fur ban that tackles the cruelty and environmental issues associated with the trade."}
{"original": "As for incentives, they must be economic, says Semaan. We can incentivize good behavior through economic action, she said. [Then] it has an economic argument and it has way more chance to be implemented than if it was a philosophical argument."}
{"original": "Government subsidies can fund sustainable fashion research and development. And taxes could be applied to particularly polluting or resource-heavy garments and fabrics, similar to Canada's carbon tax, which puts a price on emissions. Or, as the U.K.'s Environmental Audit Committee suggested in its Fixing Fashion report, the tax system could be used to shift the balance of incentives in favor of reuse, repair and recycling."}
{"original": "Existing fashion brands need to make far more dramatic changes than the ones they're currently making."}
{"original": "Economic incentives can disrupt the status quo. The U.K.'s 5-pence (7-cent) plastic bag charge, for instance, resulted in a 90% drop in usage, while Sweden, which offers tax reductions for the installation of renewable energy devices, among other incentives, reached its 2020 target of 50% renewable energy production eight years early."}
{"original": "While there is currently little data on the impact of economic incentives for the fashion industry, looking to other sustainable sectors suggests incentives are a path to elevated development and significant systemic change."}
{"original": "Shifts within the fashion industry are happening, but as long as overproduction is the most profitable path, brands, as we've seen, are unlikely to hit the brakes and become truly sustainable. Huge system change, not huge growth, is what will lead the fashion industry into a more sustainable future."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― Many Democrats say they oppose changing Senate rules to eliminate the 60-vote threshold on legislation, otherwise known as the filibuster, despite some calls from the left urging them to do so to more easily advance their agenda in 2021."}
{"original": "Ambitious Democratic proposals like Medicare for all or the Green New Deal stand little chance of becoming law in the near future given near-unanimous Republican opposition and the Senate's long-standing supermajority requirement. Even if Democrats manage to claw back to power in the Senate and recapture the White House in 2020, the GOP would likely prevent them from advancing to a final vote by using the filibuster."}
{"original": "That's why some on the left are pushing Democrats to either be honest with voters about the chances of passing major legislation they've introduced or simply rip the Band-Aid off and ditch a rule that doesn't actually appear in the Constitution anyway."}
{"original": "The Founders invented the Senate as a majority-rule body. The supermajority threshold is a 20th-century mutation. [Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell] will deny any Dem POTUS 60 votes on everything. If Dems win the WH & Senate in 2020, they should nuke the 60-vote threshold on day one and get on with it, Adam Jentleson, a former spokesman for ex-Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), said last month."}
{"original": "Other progressives like Brian Fallon of the advocacy group Demand Justice have argued that Democrats stand to benefit more from eliminating the filibuster because Republicans are generally less likely to propose sweeping changes in domestic policy due to their conservative ideology."}
{"original": "But nearly a dozen Democrats rejected those arguments in interviews on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, calling the filibuster a critical tool that helps foster bipartisanship, as well as a means of guarding against political passions that can bubble up in the House and the executive branch. Many of those Democratic senators also expressed concern about a scenario in which Republicans once again controlled both Congress and the White House."}

{"original": "If last year we did not have the filibuster, the Trump administration and the GOP majority could have rammed through an incredible range of laws that those same progressive groups would find incredibly destructive to the nation. So while I understand the frustration ... I think the consequences of getting rid of it are too great, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Tuesday."}
{"original": "Indeed, if the filibuster had not been on the books during the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency, Republicans could have passed a whole host of legislation Democrats most likely would not liked to have seen become law ― including, possibly, funding for his border wall."}
{"original": "What you might think today would be in your favor, might not be in your favor tomorrow, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who was just elected to a six-year term, added on Tuesday."}
{"original": "Some Democrats still harbor regrets over the decision in 2013 to unilaterally end the filibuster for executive and judicial nominees. Democratic leaders said at the time they were forced to take the step to confirm a number of President Barack Obama's nominees given unprecedented GOP obstruction from people like McConnell. Reid, who pulled the trigger on the rule change, still maintains that it was the right thing to do. But now that Republicans are confirming young, conservative judicial nominees at a historic pace under the Trump administration, some Democrats say there is reason for caution about going even further."}
{"original": "I would remind people there was a lot of interest in getting rid of the filibuster for judges and for the Supreme Court, and that has not served us well, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told HuffPost on Tuesday when asked whether she supported eliminating the filibuster on legislation."}
{"original": "Many 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls also share concerns about going nuclear to kill the filibuster. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), the most recent entry in the field, said last week he would personally resist efforts to get rid of it. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, said last month she would consider ending the filibuster. In the meantime, the presidential candidate said that lacking 60 votes means you haven't done enough advocacy and you need to work a lot harder."}
{"original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a potential White House contender, has endorsed several progressive proposals on health care and climate change. He has also recently introduced legislation that would drastically expand the estate tax on the wealthy, a proposal he says would would raise $2.2 trillion. But the senator declined to address how to go about getting such proposals passed into law on Tuesday."}
{"original": "It's a little bit speculative. I need to worry about what's happening in the country right now. That's a little bit into the future, Sanders said when asked whether he supported killing the filibuster."}
{"original": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), meanwhile, was the only 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful who did not rule out the prospect of going nuclear in a Democratic-controlled Senate."}
{"original": "Everything stays on the table. You keep it all on the table. Don't take anything off the table, Warren said in an interview with Politico last week."}
{"original": "The debate over the filibuster is likely to heat up in the Democratic primary over the next two years with many progressives in the race floating a wish list of progressive proposals on everything from health care and taxes, to voting rights and climate change. But some Democrats think the conversation isn't exactly productive for the party when it comes to running Washington."}
{"original": "Some of us have to think about governing. ... In terms of nuts and bolts, in terms of making this place work better, I don't think that talk is helpful, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) told HuffPost on Tuesday, noting he was not running for president."}
{"original": "The likelihood of ending the 60-vote threshold on legislation is extremely small in the near future due to bipartisan opposition. Trump repeatedly pushed McConnell to kill the filibuster last year in order to build the wall, for example. The Kentucky senator has resisted the president's entreaties, estimating in an interview last year that two-thirds of his caucus oppose doing so."}
{"original": "I don't think the legislative filibuster, which has been around for a long time, is a problem. And it does, I think, generate on many occasions kind of a bipartisan solution, and I don't think that's always bad for the country, McConnell said in the interview."}
{"original": "Still, progressives don't view the threat of a filibuster as an impediment to proceeding with legislation like Medicare for all. In fact, they argue that building political support for big new ideas often takes time, and the traditional place where that has occurred in the past is in the lower chamber."}
{"original": "With any kind of movement, especially with one as I think is very much needed like 'Medicare for all' or any sort of universal health care, all of those movements start somewhere, and it's got to start in the House, freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) told HuffPost on Tuesday, noting the new Democratic majority will soon hold the first hearings on Medicare-for-all legislation."}
{"original": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) describes her current work on a legislative response to the coronavirus crisis as Phase Four. This is misleading. There is no grand tactical initiative unfolding in Congress, bill by bill, as leaders seek to address new stages of the disaster."}
{"original": "What Pelosi wants, and what seems to be taking place, is a do-over. The bill that she and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) rammed through last week misjudged both the nature and scope of this calamity, and failed to offer anything approaching an adequate remedy."}
{"original": "We know last week's bill was bad because Pelosi felt the need to begin writing another one almost immediately. And the economic numbers we have received over the past week are indeed harrowing. Over the entire course of the Great Recession, notes economist J.W. Mason, the unemployment rate increased 5.5%. Over the past two weeks, it has skyrocketed 6.5%. Ten million Americans have been laid off in less than a month. We are almost certainly experiencing the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression at this moment ― the official numbers just aren't in yet ― and the crisis is still accelerating."}
{"original": "That Pelosi is, at least, going through the motions about doing something is good news. McConnell let the Senate take a vacation after passing last week's bill, and currently does not plan to return to work for three weeks."}
{"original": "The bad news is that what Pelosi and the Democratic Party leadership are calling Phase Four looks like a bunch of warmed-over agenda items from the last 5 years."}
{"original": "Mark Wilson via Getty Images Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in February."}
{"original": "After Democrats won a bunch of wealthy suburban districts in the 2018 midterms, party leadership began prioritizing a big tax cut for upper-middle-class homeowners. It's a rather strange about-face from the posture Pelosi took last month, when any aid had to be targeted″ to the families who needed it most. We've moved from making sure no $1,200 checks go out to families with six-figure incomes to funneling aid directly to Lexus Democrats in just a few days."}
{"original": "House Democrats followed this galaxy-brainer with a press conference on infrastructure spending. Let's be clear: Infrastructure spending is important. This is exactly the right time for a bold, multi-trillion-dollar initiative to revamp America for the 21st century and restructure supply chains so that we actually make things in this country again. It's time for new agencies and new ideas ― new Tennessee Valley Authorities and Works Progress Administrations and plenty of sledgehammers for the corporate juggernauts standing in the way."}
{"original": "Instead, Democrats talked about targeting the most efficient upgrades for roads and bridges, $10 billion for community health centers and $40 billion for clean water upgrades."}
{"original": "All told, the Democratic proposal comes to $760 billion over five years, which is serious money in normal times. But it's less than half the size of a vague proposal President Trump floated on Twitter last week, and it's nowhere near what will be needed to counter the economic hurricane now hitting our shores."}
{"original": "Americans aren't used to their politicians throwing around trillion-dollar bills, but we have entered a multi-trillion-dollar downturn. Morgan Stanley estimates that the U.S. economy will shrink by 24% this quarter ― an unprecedented decline ― while Goldman Sachs thinks it will be more like 30%."}
{"original": "And these dire predictions are likely evading the truly bad news. State budgets are about to collapse as tax revenues disappear. People who don't have incomes can't pay income taxes. And without revenues, states will slash spending, which means firing people. We're at double-digit unemployment right now, and state and local government austerity hasn't even kicked in yet."}
{"original": "Thus far, Wall Street's woes in this crisis have come from without. The coronavirus hit to the real economy is putting pressure on the financial sector. But there is a phase of the crash coming in which Wall Street's problems will rebound back out into the real economy, in a replay of the 2008 financial crisis."}
{"original": "A year ago, financial watchdogs were sounding an alarm about escalating levels of shoddy corporate debt ― even JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon joined in. This bubble ― $10 trillion by some estimates ― will almost certainly burst in the current downturn. Credit rating agencies are downgrading massive quantities of corporate debt, in many cases for retailers that seemed perfectly healthy only a few weeks ago."}
{"original": "When this corporate debt gets cut to junk-bond status, massive pension funds and hedge funds and other investment vehicles will be forced to dump them ― either for matters of professional dignity or because the law forbids them from owning junk bonds. Even the Federal Reserve's massive new emergency lending facilities require firms to post investment grade securities as collateral ― no junk bonds allowed."}
{"original": "This could easily spark a panic in its own right. But there will still be another shoe to drop when corporate debt blows up. Thanks to a loophole banks managed to work for themselves in the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulations, we don't really know how much the biggest banks have been betting on these debt securities through offshore accounts."}
{"original": "The Obama administration belatedly tried to address this problem in late 2016, but the Trump-appointed regulators have let it slide. In the 2008 crash, junk mortgages were only a small fraction of the financial problem ― a pile of other bets on those mortgages in the derivatives market were what brought Wall Street to its knees. And we have no idea what American banks have been betting on corporate debt in the years since."}
{"original": "In other words, we're about to experience something the United States hasn't been through since the Great Depression. And a few weeks into that, we may well layer a second Great Recession on top of it."}
{"original": "You can't fight that with some checks in the mail and infrastructure week. You have to rethink the American economy, and fight for a vision of a different future. The moment demands a New New Deal for the 21st Century. Or at least, leaders who know how to govern."}

{"original": "It didn't take long for Tretina's income from writing on the side to exceed what she was earning at her full-time job. But I kept putting off quitting because of the security of a paycheck and employer-offered health insurance, she said."}
{"original": "In 2018, she took the plunge and officially transitioned to writing full time. Needless to say, it was the right decision. During her first full year as a freelancer, her income was double what she had earned as an employee. By the second year, she made more than $200,000. I never thought those kinds of earnings were possible with a communications or English degree, and I know it wouldn't be possible if I wasn't self-employed. In 2020, she decided to help other aspiring writers find the same kind of success and co-founded the Freelance Writer Academy."}

After quickly working her way up the ranks in finance, she realized that much of the industry lacked the empathy, understanding and personalization required to really help people. So she created a Facebook group to offer better personal finance advice for women of color."}
{"original": "I taught every day for completely free, Kennedy said. That opened the door to people wanting to work with me one-on-one."}

{"original": "Leaving the security of a steady paycheck, employer-sponsored retirement plan and health insurance coverage opens the door to many financial unknowns. Not only will you be responsible for covering expenses such as taxes and insurance premiums on your own, but your income probably won't be predictable ― at least in the beginning."}
{"original": "That's why it's important to sit down and figure out what you need to earn from your business to survive. And to make that number a bit easier to swallow, it helps to cut down your spending to essentials only."}
{"original": "Kennedy referred to it as her bare-bones budget. I only focused on what we needed to get by, she said. In fact, Kennedy estimated that her previous monthly budget included about $3,500 in expenses. Once she revamped it, her monthly spending was pared down to about $2,000."}
{"original": "Tretina and her husband also focused on slimming down their spending before she quit her full-time job. We moved to a cheaper apartment and cooked at home instead of dining out, she said. She also paid off her student loans before making the switch. By reducing our expenses, I felt more comfortable about freelancing full time because I had more breathing room in our budget. If the worst-case scenario happened and my freelancing income decreased, we would still be able to make ends meet."}
{"original": "Keep in mind that a typical monthly budget or paycheck-based budget doesn't really work when your income fluctuates from month to month. In addition to cutting your spending, it's a good idea to learn how to budget on a variable income."}
{"original": "Even if you do a great job of cutting unnecessary expenses from your budget, Kennedy said that the first year as an entrepreneur can be particularly unpredictable. That's why it's important to have an adequate emergency fund. If your income isn't enough to support your budget or a major unexpected expense comes up, you shouldn't have to rely on credit cards or other debt to get out of the hole."}
{"original": "Most experts recommend you have enough saved to cover at least three to six months' worth of living expenses. But you may want to have even more stashed away, especially considering the state of the job market. I was comfortable with having six months of expenses tucked away, but you may decide you need more or less, Tretina said."}
{"original": "Once you begin working for yourself, you no longer have taxes automatically taken out of your pay by an employer. That's now your job. And working for yourself can change your tax situation in other ways, too."}
{"original": "Because my income substantially increased, I've moved into a higher tax bracket, Tretina said. Plus, I have to make estimated tax payments each quarter; previously, I just adjusted my W-4 withholdings so I wouldn't have to make quarterly payments."}
{"original": "Since there may be a lot of changes and nuances to your tax situation, it's never a bad idea to hire a professional to prepare your return for you. Both Tretina and Kennedy hired accountants once they began working for themselves. For me, that was one area I did not want to screw up, Kennedy said."}
{"original": "Know when it's the right time to quit your day job."}
{"original": "There are many reasons why you might want to leave your day job. Money is probably a big factor, especially if you're earning more through your side hustle (or have the potential to)."}
{"original": "My writing side hustle was bringing in more income than my full-time job, and I was regularly turning away prospective clients because I simply didn't have the capacity to take on new work, Tretina said. To me, that was a sign that it was time to transition to working for myself full time."}
{"original": "But there can also be emotional reasons for wanting to leave, and it's important to be sure the numbers line up before you follow your heart. Sometimes you have a very good month, and it's exciting, Kennedy said. When you have something that you're very passionate about, and the money is coming in, sometimes emotions can supersede reality."}
{"original": "The secrecy of President Donald Trump's tax returns will be the subject of a hearing next week, Democrats in the House of Representatives announced Thursday."}
{"original": "Democrats have had the power to request Trump's tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service since they assumed control of the House this year, but they've hesitated. To build the public case for disclosure, the House tax committee's oversight panel will examine its authority to obtain the president's tax returns at a Feb. 7 hearing."}
{"original": "Trump was the first major presidential candidate in 40 years not to release tax returns, which would have revealed detailed information about his sources of income and how much tax he pays. Democrats vowed to get the returns themselves, but haven't done it yet."}
{"original": "Pressure is building, with an ABC News/Washington Post poll showing a healthy majority of Americans support the move. Tax March, a coalition of liberal groups, has been pressuring Democrats to hurry up, and Democratic members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus have been getting antsy, too."}
{"original": "Bill Clark via Getty Images Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) plans to get Donald Trump's tax returns."}
{"original": "Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), the chairman of the tax committee, has said he wants time to lay out a case for the move and that staffers drafting the request are doing it methodically and need time."}
{"original": "Trump's tax returns could show whether he evaded taxes, as a blockbuster New York Times report alleged that he and his father, Fred Trump, did for decades in the 20th century. The returns could also provide information about the sources of financing and debt at his multi-billion dollar real estate business."}
{"original": "As part of the public case, Democrats introduced legislation by Reps. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) and Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) that would require presidential candidates to disclose 10 years of tax returns."}
{"original": "Before 2016, presidential candidates routinely disclosed their tax returns, Pascrell and Eshoo said in a statement. Donald Trump refused to clear that low bar, and as a result, the American people remain in the dark about the extent of his financial entanglements and potential conflicts of interest."}
{"original": "The legislation will be part of the hearing, but the big topic will be how Democrats present their case to obtain Trump's tax returns. Pascrell has sought Trump's tax returns since February 2017 through resolutions invoking Section 6103 of the tax code. This provision allows the committee to obtain any individual's tax returns from the IRS for the purposes of an investigation. Republicans on the committee have blocked Pascrell's resolutions more than a dozen times. All the chairman has to do, though, is send a request to the IRS."}
{"original": "Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has hinted that he will not comply with the Democrats' request, which could get tied up in court for months."}
{"original": "Committee Democrats previously told HuffPost that they would get Trump's tax returns if they won a House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. This hearing is the first step in that process."}
{"original": "One of my favorite charities is Nowzad Dogs, which started off reuniting soldiers with the dogs they befriended while on tour in Afghanistan, and has now expanded to offer veterinary care to working animals in that war-torn country. I currently serve as the official ambassador for Nowzad Dogs in the United States."}
{"original": "Ten years ago this February, Royal Marine Sergeant Pen Farthing rescued a dog named Nowzad, who had been used in dog fights in Afghanistan. Nowzad was smuggled across Afghanistan to begin the long journey to Pen's home in England. At that time he had no idea that the bond he had formed with this stray dog would be the catalyst for the start of the first animal welfare charity in Afghanistan."}
{"original": "Pen knew that other soldiers would want to bring the dogs and cats that they had adopted while fighting in Afghanistan back home with them, and so he founded Nowzad Dogs. Today, Nowzad Dogs has enabled 1,000 soldiers to bring their dog or cat back to their home countries when they finished their tour of duty."}
{"original": "The Nowzad Clinic was created in Kabul to provide a place for the animals to stay before departing for the United States, England, Canada, Spain and other countries. This clinic now provides vaccines and health care for donkeys, cows, sheep, goats and chickens. And of course, dogs like Mac - found curled up on the side of the road with crushed back legs- receive exemplary care. Mac is now enjoying a full life with his specially made wheel chair."}
{"original": "The clinic employs the first-ever Afghan women to become fully trained veterinarians. More than 90 Afghan veterinary students attended practical hands-on training at the Nowzad clinic last year alone. It is the first clinic and animal shelter in Kabul and actually helps people as well because it stops the spread of rabies."}
{"original": "The Nowzad Clinic is known for its animal welfare education, and this charity employs 20 Afghan nationals, who are as passionate about bringing animal welfare to Afghanistan as Pen and his team are."}
{"original": "All of this has been achieved with minimal funding. Pen ensures every single cent donated is used to care for the animals."}
{"original": "In 2014, Pen was named CNN Hero for his work with Nowzad Dogs. But despite this great honor, he still desperately needs funding to continue his work."}
{"original": "Cathy Kangas with a Nowzad Dog"}
{"original": "I have supported Nowzad since its inception when I first read Pen's book, One Dog at a Time, about his work in Afghanistan. It is an uplifting, positive story about how a Royal Marine took care of a docked-eared Afghan fighting dog in between patrols and attacks by the Taliban, and soon embarked on a global effort to help dogs, soldiers and the animals of Kabul."}
{"original": "Pen has shown that one person can have an amazing impact, bringing good to an environment written off by many. Nowzad is demonstrating what can be achieved when people from all walks of life and cultures cast differences aside and work toward a common goal."}

{"original": "The ongoing policy debate regarding the federal government's role in the housing marketplace often pits taxpayers against homeowners, as if their goals are separate and somehow incompatible."}
{"original": "Although the national rate of homeownership has dropped to a 48-year low of 63 percent, the fact still remains that the taxpayer on one side of the debate, is also the homeowner on the other side almost two-thirds of the time. As a result, the oft-repeated argument, the taxpayers are on the hook for the homeowners' mortgages, is at best misstated."}
{"original": "When one considers that the homeowner demographic and the taxpayer are in fact one and the same, the question of policy solutions becomes far more practical and productive than the unending politically-tinged wrestling match we're used to hearing in Washington."}
{"original": "Consider the concept of credit risk transfer."}
{"original": "Far more understandable than the name alone might lead one to believe, credit risk transfer allows the taxpayer to share the burden of large-scale mortgage repayment risk with the private sector that is incentivized to bear this risk. It also allows the homeowner continued access to 30-year mortgages at competitive, yet affordable fixed rates. And the fact that the homeowner and taxpayer are often one in the same makes this more than just a housing finance term or policy initiative. It's common sense, plain and simple."}
{"original": "Under the current mortgage finance operating model, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (commonly referred to as the Government Sponsored Enterprises, or GSEs) acquire mortgages from lenders and then package and sell them to investors. The homeowners to whom the mortgages are granted have an ongoing obligation to repay the principal and interest costs of these loans. In the event that a homeowner fails to pay their mortgage, the GSEs are obligated to pay at least some of the difference to the investors. The risk described here is called credit risk and the GSEs have a great deal of it. Reasonable estimates on their $4.5 trillion book of mortgages is that they carry about $200 billion of real risk outlays at any given time - even more if the economy turns sour and mortgage defaults spike."}
{"original": "If GSEs can't cover the payments, the U.S. Treasury provides a backstop made up of your taxpayer funds. Today that backstop exists in the form of the GSEs under the 89th consecutive month of government conservatorship."}
{"original": "The U.S. taxpayer bears the ultimate burden and threat of having to (repeatedly) bail out the GSEs. The FHFA - the GSEs' assigned federal regulator agency - has been working to find private sector companies willing to assume this roughly $200 billion of credit risk. As one could probably guess, this is no simple or easy task."}
{"original": "In recent years the GSEs have started to spread significant portions of this risk through mind-numbingly complicated transactions involving complex securities, contracts and debt offerings. In late 2015, the GSEs committed to another year of this program."}
{"original": "But there is a more simple and easy solution. It's called Deeper Cover Mortgage Insurance."}
{"original": "In Deeper Cover Mortgage Insurance the GSEs transfer primary credit risk on the loans it guarantees through the use of expanded credit enhancement on a loan-by-loan basis provided by private mortgage insurers. In essence, if a homeowner stops paying their mortgage, the private mortgage insurance covers losses to investors after the home is sold - generally in a foreclosure or short sale. The most frequently discussed Deeper Cover Mortgage Insurance proposal would insure up to 50 percent of the loan. This is more than enough to make investors whole in even the toughest of economic downturns."}
{"original": "The insurance provided by Deeper Cover Mortgage Insurance could be executed cheaper than the GSEs' current fee structure for the same protections. Of course, in order for this form of credit risk transfer to be effective in reducing costs to homeowners, a commensurate reduction of GSE fees must reflect the greatly reduced risk of loss borne by the GSEs."}
{"original": "A recently completed study by the Milliman group researched this exact issue. Their findings conclude that Deeper Cover Mortgage Insurance reduced borrower costs by an average of $8 per month. That adds up to $2,300 over the life of an average homebuyer's loan."}
{"original": "This perfect marriage of homeowner savings and taxpayer protection is precisely why a number of groups including America's Homeowner Alliance support this method of Credit Risk Transfer."}
{"original": "Unfortunately, it seems the regulator wants to give the GSEs the ability to experiment with other kinds of Credit Risk Transfers. These alternatives might benefit the GSEs in the short term - but almost certainly not the homeowner."}
{"original": "While the GSEs are under the control of the government, we're making a plea to the regulator to use Deeper Cover Mortgage Insurance (the proven method of Credit Risk Transfer), to protect the taxpayer and benefit the homeowner as well. Almost two thirds of taxpayers are homeowners. Why should they be OK with the government experimenting with their tax dollars to benefit the government controlled GSEs? How about benefiting the taxpayer homeowner instead?"}
{"original": "Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg claimed that releasing his tax returns to the public would be complicated and take a long time during Wednesday's ninth Democratic presidential primary debate in Las Vegas."}
{"original": "It just takes us a long time. Unfortunately or fortunately, I make a lot of money and we do business all around the world and we are preparing it, the billionaire, who is self-funding his presidential campaign, said when asked about making them public. The number of pages will probably be in the thousands of pages. I can't go to Turbo Tax."}
{"original": "Bloomberg entered the race in November, months after his competitors had already begun their campaigns. In addition to not releasing his tax returns, Bloomberg has twice delayed filing a personal financial disclosure form with federal regulators, leaving details of his self-financed campaign hidden, potentially until after the critical Super Tuesday contests next month."}
{"original": "We're releasing them. They'll be out in a couple of weeks. That's as fast as we can do it, Bloomberg said at the debate Wednesday."}
{"original": "The former mayor's answer didn't sit well with the other candidates on stage, who groaned and immediately shot their hands in the air to register their desire to respond."}
{"original": "Everyone up here has returned their tax returns, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said. It is a major issue because the president of the United States ... has been hiding behind his tax returns."}
{"original": "Donald Trump was the first major party nominee since Gerald Ford to not release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential campaign. He has since claimed they are under an audit that has now lasted four years."}
{"original": "In January 2016, Trump's explanation for not releasing his tax returns was similar to Bloomberg's: We're working on that now. I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working that over in the next period of time, Trump said at the time. This is not, like, a normal tax return."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― It's starting to look like a classic standoff between Capitol Hill and the White House: Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Democrats insist that a Coronavirus stimulus bill primarily address paid sick leave while President Donald Trump and some Republicans hold strong for a payroll tax cut."}
{"original": "On Tuesday, Trump came to the Capitol to sell Senate Republicans on his plan to temporarily suspend or reduce the payroll tax ― a 12.4% levy evenly split between employees and employers. Some Republicans have floated the idea of eliminating the payroll tax for 90 days to help the economy deal with the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. Trump has proposed suspending it until Election Day."}
{"original": "Coming out of the meeting, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) suggested Democrats ought to like the payroll tax idea, noting that Democrats and the Obama administration supported a temporary 2-percentage-point reduction in the tax from 2011 through 2012."}
{"original": "If we don't get ahead of this threat, you're going to see unemployment rise as the economy dips, and so I think it's not time to wave partisan flags, Cornyn said. Got to pull together. This is kind of an economic 9/11 that we need to address."}
{"original": "Cornyn and other Republican senators said the president and his team laid out a range of possible economic policies, but neither the administration officials nor GOP senators coalesced around any particular proposal."}
{"original": "The ranking GOP member of the Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, told HuffPost that Trump's economic team would be meeting with the panel's Republicans on Wednesday to review various proposals, with an eye toward the payroll tax holiday, direct assistance for certain industries, and help for businesses and individuals who need to quarantine as COVID-19 spreads."}
{"original": "But Democrats are showing some real opposition to a payroll tax cut."}
{"original": "Essentially, they argue, a payroll tax holiday would do little to address the outbreak and it would do nothing for the workers who need paid sick leave or are unemployed."}
{"original": "Their plan is to pass a bill offering paid leave for employees who need to self-quarantine or are sick with the virus. On top of that, Democrats say they want unspecified expansions of unemployment insurance and federal nutrition assistance programs."}
{"original": "We ought to be dealing with the immediate needs of people who are directly impacted, House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) told HuffPost. That's people who are going to be quarantined, lose wages, and so forth."}
{"original": "Yarmuth said Democrats would be more open to addressing larger economic stimulus issues down the road, if necessary. But with lawmakers not in session next week, he said it seems a greater priority to pass legislation in the coming days that would ensure that workers who need to stay home would get paid and still have jobs when they return."}
{"original": "That was a consistent theme from other Democrats."}
{"original": "Any immediate legislation needs to be focused on things targeted for those who are most at risk of economic damage, Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) told HuffPost. The payroll tax [cut] is very slow to have economic impact. We've done it before. It's not the most effective."}
{"original": "Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano (D-Calif.) told HuffPost he ailed to see how a payroll tax cut is going to really help people who are low-income, who depend on wages, and who don't have paid sick leave to go home and comply with a quarantine,"}
{"original": "Takano said the government needed to promote policies that would encourage some people to stay home and slow the spread of the illness, which a guarantee of paid sick leave would accomplish."}
{"original": "He also said he was resistant to a payroll tax cut because it would undermine Social Security and Medicare, two programs that the levy helps fund. It's a cynical tactic in my view to carry through on ― you know, the president said in his budget he wants to cut Medicare and Social Security, Takano said."}
{"original": "Republicans were generally supportive of the president's idea of suspending the payroll tax. They also didn't sound overly enthusiastic about issues like paid sick leave, but they didn't seem unalterably opposed to that."}
{"original": "Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), a staunch conservative, said a payroll tax cut might be a good thing, adding that he always likes it when people get to keep more of their money."}
{"original": "But he also didn't rule out a more finely tuned bill, like one that would address paid sick leave. I got to look at the whole proposal, he said."}
{"original": "He expressed concern about families who rely on schools as a form of child care if wholesale school district shutdowns began multiplying."}
{"original": "Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), who recently switched parties during the Trump impeachment proceedings, showed that he still has some Democratic beliefs ― he told HuffPost that, while he has backed a cut to the payroll tax, he also wanted any coronavirus stimulus bill to address paid family leave and how to provide food for children relying on the school lunch programs."}
{"original": "I just don't want to see people, when we were in the greatest of economies that I can remember, now have to go through hell just to survive here, he said."}
{"original": "If you think that people who are scared to go out to eat, or shop, or whatever ― go to a concert ― are going to do it because you give them a couple hundred dollars, they're not going to do it House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), on President Donald Trump's push for a payroll tax cut to lessen the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak."}
{"original": "Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a moderate, went further, expressing support for ideas like paid sick leave while showing some potential discomfort with a tax cut."}
{"original": "I'd rather see a more balanced approach that deals with paid family medical ― that's what I'd like to see, Fitzpatrick said, adding that the math has to work on a tax cut."}
{"original": "The math appears tricky on a payroll tax cut. While the average American would see 6% more in their paychecks, that would only amount to a few hundred dollars a month for most people. Meanwhile, around a quarter of federal revenue comes from the payroll tax."}
{"original": "In short, the result would be a significant hit for tax receipts and provide only a little more money for individuals. And Democrats don't believe it would do much to solve the economic issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak."}
{"original": "If you think that people who are scared to go out to eat, or shop, or whatever ― go to a concert ― are going to do it because you give them a couple hundred dollars, they're not going to do it, Yarmuth said."}
{"original": "Democrats say they would like to pass legislation addressing immediate economic challenges posed by the outbreak by the end of this week, before lawmakers go on a spring recess. But with the two parties seemingly far apart on the specifics ― as well as the overarching aim of a stimulus effort ― a bill could easily slip to the end of March."}
{"original": "Unemployment insurance and food benefits are automatically available for laid-off workers and people with low incomes, and it's unclear what additional assistance would look like."}
{"original": "Most states provide up to 26 weeks of unemployment insurance for people laid off through no fault of their own, and in past recessions Congress has added additional weeks of benefits. But that extra assistance wouldn't kick in for six months. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said Democrats might favor looser eligibility standards for people on temporary layoffs or even just extra money to help states pay claims."}
{"original": "Democrats said the U.S. Department of Agriculture should make sure kids won't miss out on free lunches if their schools are closed. And Democrats have said the USDA should suspend its plans to start trimming food benefit eligibility next month. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has said the cuts will still happen, but he announced Tuesday that the department would allow schools shuttered by the outbreak to hand out meals to children in their surrounding neighborhoods."}
{"original": "If Pelosi doesn't reach a deal with Trump withing the next day or two, the House may move forward with a bill focused on providing paid sick leave, expanded unemployment insurance and some greater food assistance ― essentially daring vulnerable Republicans to oppose it and the president to veto it."}
{"original": "It's doubtful, though, that the Senate would take up House-passed legislation without Trump's blessing."}
{"original": "Fat Tuesday is Mardi Gras, a day of revelry, gluttony, intoxication and showers of shiny plastic beads. It is the party to end all parties because it's followed by Ash Wednesday, when Lenten sacrifices commence."}
{"original": "Fat Cat Tuesday is the day – Jan. 2, 2018 – on which the boards of directors of America's biggest corporations handed their CEOs more money than those same CEOs would deign to pay their workers for an entire year of labor, 260 days."}
{"original": "It was a day of revelry, gluttony and private jets for CEOs and worthless shiny plastic beads for workers."}
{"original": "The occasion is commemorated in Britain as well. There, though, it took CEOs three days to accrue more compensation than the total annual wages of the typical worker."}
{"original": "That's because American CEO pay takes the cake – and we're not talking Mardi Gras King Cake containing a tiny plastic baby Jesus figure because no Son of God would be associated with U.S. CEOs' sinfully gluttonous pay packages."}
{"original": "The average pay of Fortune 500 CEOs – a gobsmacking $14.3 million – is four times that of top executives at comparable sized corporations worldwide, according to a study by Bloomberg analysts."}
{"original": "And it's 265 times what the median U.S. worker earns ­– enabling U.S. CEOs to rake in more cash for one day at the office than the median worker gets for laboring an entire year."}
{"original": "Here's how it breaks down: The typical CEO at a Fortune 500 corporation got $53,846 for showing up at the office on Tuesday, Jan. 2, 2018. The median American received $44,668 for working the entire year of 2017."}
{"original": "For one day on the job, those fat cats were awarded $9,178 more than all the wages a typical American earned over an entire year. That $9,178 is one fifth of an average worker's annual earnings."}
{"original": "Given that, it's no surprise that America holds another dubious distinction: it's the country with the most cavernous pay gorge between fat cats and typical workers."}
{"original": "It doesn't have to be that way. In Norway, the top CEOs average $1.28 million in compensation, meaning they earn 20 times what that country's typical worker does ­ – not 265 times. And yet, somehow, Norwegians attract talented executives to run their companies."}
{"original": "Germany, a country respected worldwide for its success in manufacturing and exporting, manages to find executives willing to work for only 174 times the pay of the country's average worker."}

Even if he fails, he'll get a $27 million bonus. That's $27 million for a fiasco. It's a guaranteed bonus of wonderland proportions. Golly gee willikers, Mickey!"}
{"original": "Disney has $37.7 million sitting around to give Iger, but charged its theme park workers for costumes. That meant 16,339 Disney Park Donald Ducks and Buzz Lightyears earned less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, a violation of federal law. The U.S. Labor Department ordered Disney to repay them $3.8 million."}
{"original": "Looks like Disney tried to get solid gold Mouseketeer ears for Iger out of the hides of its lowest-paid workers. Now that's goofy."}
{"original": "Non-CEO American workers have been stuck with nothing but shiny plastic beads for decades as their wages stagnated. But the fat cats at the top got more no matter how badly they performed."}
{"original": "Take Goodyear's CEO Richard J. Kramer. The company hasn't lost money over the past several years, but its performance has been less than notable. Despite that, the board of directors, for which Kramer is chair, keeps bumping up his compensation. It rose from $17 million in 2012 to nearly $20 million in 2016."}
{"original": "Three extra million over four years. It would take the median worker 67 years to earn the $3 million that the board of directors handed Kramer for mediocre accomplishments."}
{"original": "U.S. Steel Corp. has struggled in recent years, cancelling a planned new headquarters building in Pittsburgh after suffering losses of $1.5 billion in 2015. That year, former CEO Mario Longhi's compensation dropped 35 percent. Still, the board of directors paid the now-retired CEO $8.6 million for losing $1.5 billion. That takes some steel cojones."}
{"original": "As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued rules requiring public corporations to begin reporting this year the ratio between the CEO's compensation and the pay of its median worker."}
{"original": "That's nice. Really. The more depressing information workers can get about pay grabs by their bosses the better."}
{"original": "More effective in actually dealing with the problem, however, is what the Labour Party in Britain is proposing. If elected to power there, Labour says it would tax excessive CEO pay and disqualify from bidding on government contracts all corporations with CEO-to-worker pay ratios of more than 20 to 1, which is the current pay ratio in Norway."}
{"original": "That's what America needs so workers receive a fair share of the wealth that their labor creates – in other words, significantly more than shiny plastic beads."}
{"original": "J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is the champion of both a Green New Deal and raising taxes on the richest Americans."}
{"original": "American voters are narrowly supportive of a proposal to end fossil fuel use and create clean energy jobs by raising taxes, according to a poll sponsored by supporters of the proposal."}
{"original": "Registered voters were, by 5 percentage points, more likely to support than oppose a Green New Deal plan paid for by raising taxes, including a tax on carbon emissions, an online YouGov Blue survey of 1,282 voters taken Jan. 26 to Jan. 28 found. Among independents, the outcome was identical. Democratic voters were 48 percentage points more likely to support than oppose the plan, while Republicans were 50 points more likely to oppose than support it."}
{"original": "The full question read: Would you support or oppose a Green New Deal to end fossil fuel use in the United States and have the government create clean energy jobs? The plan would be paid for by raising taxes, including a tax on carbon emissions."}
{"original": "Overall, 43 percent of voters supported the measure and 38 percent opposed, with 10 percent neither supporting nor opposing and 9 percent responding that they were unsure of their opinion."}
{"original": "The findings ― commissioned by the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress and shared with HuffPost ― show the Green New Deal's popularity with Democrats and the extent to which its main advocates have electrified long-static debates on both climate and tax policy in the United States."}
{"original": "Data for Progress This chart from the YouGov Blue survey shows net support for a Green New Deal funded by increased taxes among Democrats and independents."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) became the face of the Green New Deal movement late last year when she joined left-wing activists in a sit-in protest in then-incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office to demand Democrats support transitioning to 100 percent renewable electricity and giving millions of Americans federally backed jobs in the clean energy sector."}
{"original": "By December, 81 percent of registered voters said they supported a plan to generate 100 percent of the nation's electricity from clean sources within the next 10 years, upgrade the U.S. power grid, invest in energy-efficiency and renewable technology, and provide training for jobs in the new, green economy, according to a poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University. That included 92 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans, with an eyebrow-raising 57 percent of conservative Republicans in agreement."}
{"original": "Yet the survey prompt made no mention of the costs, and the pollsters warned that the overwhelming support for the Green New Deal was likely to wane as the proposal became more politicized."}
{"original": "In January, Ocasio-Cortez suggested raising top marginal tax rates to 70 percent to help fund the program. The remark, made in a 60 Minutes interview, ignited a fresh debate over how much the richest Americans should give back, and it set the stage for at least two 2020 presidential candidates to announce new proposals to tax the wealthy. She's now planning to introduce Green New Deal legislation with Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) sometime in the coming weeks."}
{"original": "At this point, nearly every major Democrat joining the crowded 2020 primary field has voiced support for a Green New Deal in some form. The latest poll shows the policy will clearly be a major fixture of this cycle's policy debate, said John Ray, a senior political analyst at YouGov."}
{"original": "Millennials, ages 18 to 37, are shown in the poll as the age group most supportive of a Green New Deal. The Silent Generation, people 72 and older, were more likely to oppose the proposal."}
{"original": "We tailored our Green New Deal item to present respondents with a realistic sense of both its anticipated costs and benefits, and found net support for the policy cornerstones of the Green New Deal, the jobs program and the pivot away from fossil fuels, Ray said by email."}
{"original": "The poll identified a generational divide on the Green New Deal. Millennials ― defined by the Pew Research Center as people ages 18 to 37 ― were more likely to support than oppose the policy, by 24 percentage points. Yet the Silent Generation ― people older than 72 ― were 25 points more likely to oppose than support the Green New Deal. Accordingly, self-reported retirees were the only employment status that primarily opposed the policy."}
{"original": "The divide is not unexpected. In October, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change determined the world has roughly a decade to halve global emissions or face cataclysmic warming of at least 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. At that temperature, the damage from more extreme weather and sea level rise could hit $54 trillion. That has helped foster a sense of what some call intergenerational climate debt ― costs of planetary damage passed on to the young and as-yet unborn."}
{"original": "Even when the Green New Deal faces attacks from the right, Americans will stay on the Green New Deal train, Sean McElwee, the co-founder of Data for Progress, said by email. Choo choo, motherfuckers."}

{"original": "On the surface of it, school choice sounds like a great idea."}
{"original": "Parents will get to shop for schools and pick the one that best suits their children."}
{"original": "Oh! Look, Honey! This one has an exceptional music program! That one excels in math and science! The drama program at this one is first in the state!"}
{"original": "But that's not at all what school choice actually is."}
{"original": "In reality, it's just a scam to make private schools cheaper for rich people, further erode the public school system and allow for-profit corporations to gobble up education dollars meant to help children succeed."}
{"original": "1) Voucher programs almost never provide students with full tuition."}
{"original": "2) Charter and voucher schools don't have to accept everyone"}
{"original": "When you choose to go to one of these schools, they don't have to choose to accept you. In fact, the choice is really all up to them. Does your child make good grades? Is he or she well-behaved, in the special education program, learning disabled, etc.? If they don't like your answers, they won't accept you. They have all the power. It has nothing to do with providing a good education for your child. It's all about whether your child will make them look good. By contrast, public schools take everyone and often achieve amazing results with the resources they have."}
{"original": "3) Charter Schools are notorious for kicking out hard to teach students"}
{"original": "Charter schools like to tout how well they help kids learn. But they also like to brag that they accept diverse students. So they end up accepting lots of children with special needs at the beginning of the year and then giving them the boot before standardized test season. That way, these students' low scores won't count against the charter school's record. They can keep bragging about their high test scores without actually having to expend all the time and energy of actually teaching difficult students. Only public schools take everyone and give everyone their all."}
{"original": "4) Voucher and charter schools actually give parents less choice than traditional public schools"}
{"original": "Public schools are governed by different rules than charter and voucher schools. Most public schools are run by a school board made up of duly-elected members from the community. The school board is accountable to that community. Residents have the right to be present at votes and debates, have a right to access public documents about how tax money is being spent, etc. None of this is true at most charter or voucher schools. They are run by executive boards or committees that are not accountable to parents. If you don't like what your public school is doing, you can organize, vote for new leadership or even take a leadership role, yourself. If you don't like what your charter or voucher school is doing, your only choice is to withdraw your child. See ya."}
{"original": "5) Charter Schools do no better and often much worse than traditional public schools"}
{"original": "Pundits and profiteers love to spout euphoric about how well charter schools teach kids. But there is zero evidence behind it. That is nothing but a marketing ploy. It's like when you're in a bad neighborhood and walk past a dive that claims to have the best cup of coffee in the city. Yuck. Surely, some charter schools do exceptionally well. However, most charters and almost all cyber charters do worse than their public school counterparts. Fact."}

{"original": "9) School choice takes away attention from the real problems in our public schools – poverty and funding equity"}
{"original": "10) School choice is not supported by a grass roots movement. It is supported by billionaires."}
{"original": "The proponents of school choice will tell you that they are only doing the will of the people. This is what parents want, they say. Baloney. While there are individuals who support school choice, the overwhelming majority of money behind this movement comes from conservative billionaires actively trying to dismantle the public education system. They want to steal the public system and replace it with a private one. They don't care about your child. They just want to steal the hundreds of billions of tax dollars we pay to educate our children. This is not philanthropy. It is a business transaction meant to screw you and your child out of your rights."}
{"original": "If we really want to ensure every child in this country gets an excellent education, the answer isn't school choice. Instead, we need to commit to supporting our public school system. We all need to be in this together. Yes, our schools should look at the needs of each child and tailor education to fit appropriately. But that shouldn't be done in parallel school systems. It should be done under the same umbrella. That way, you can't defund and defraud one without hurting all. It can't just be about your child. It has to be about all children."}
{"original": "That's the only choice worth making."}
{"original": "This was originally published on my blog."}
{"original": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos loves to tell the story about a former teacher named Jed."}
{"original": "Here's how it goes. Jed, a once-passionate public school teacher, was told to keep it down at school because his class was having too much fun learning. He left the profession, DeVos likes to suggest, because he didn't have enough autonomy to teach as he wished. If only there were fewer federal mandates and more flexibility, DeVos often says before pushing for more school choice."}
{"original": "Politicians and public figures often trot out anecdotes about everyday people whose experiences illuminate a larger issue. But DeVos has referenced Jed quite regularly. She has used the Jed anecdote in three speeches since 2017, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal and when testifying before Congress. She most recently spoke of him on Monday in a speech she gave to the National School Boards Association."}
{"original": "But who is Jed? The real-life Jed, HuffPost discovered, is actually mortified by the attention."}
{"original": "I hate knowing she is using my words to further push her agenda, which is the antithesis of me, said Jed Dearybury, who was a finalist for South Carolina Teacher of the Year in 2014. Honestly, it makes me mad as hell. It makes me want to fight harder."}
{"original": "Dearybury met with DeVos, along with nine other former teachers, in July of 2017. DeVos wanted to chat with educators who had recently left the classroom to learn more about their experiences and why they switched jobs."}
{"original": "In truth, Dearybury, who spent over 13 years teaching at public elementary schools in South Carolina, didn't leave the classroom over frustration with his district or state or federal mandates. He changed jobs so he could advocate for teachers on a larger scale, without fear of overstepping."}
{"original": "He now works for the Palmetto State Teachers Association as the director of professional development and communications. The organization is as close as you're going to get to a union in South Carolina, said Dearybury. After publication he told HuffPost in another interview that while South Carolina is legally prohibited from having unions, PSTA is a professional association that represents and unifies teachers across the state in the absence of one. (Dearybury spoke to HuffPost in an individual capacity and not as a representative of his employer.)"}
{"original": "I love all these teachers striking across America. I wish every teacher in America would walk out on the same day, said Dearybury, who left the classroom around three years ago. In the later interview with HuffPost, he clarified that while we don't want strikes, sometimes they do get people's attention."}
{"original": "He had no idea his words were going to be used in public speeches and congressional testimony. He was under the impression it was a casual, off-the-record conversation."}
{"original": "The anecdote he provided in the meeting, about being told to keep it down, was told as an example of how even sometimes fellow teachers have overly rigid views of pedagogy. Indeed, it was another teacher ― not a school administrator ― who had reprimanded him. Two other meeting attendees have confirmed this version of events to HuffPost."}
{"original": "Dearybury worries that leaders of his former district, which he loved, will hear one of DeVos' speeches and interpret it as him criticizing them. He is also concerned his words will be interpreted as an endorsement of DeVos' agenda."}
{"original": "A spokesperson for DeVos did not respond to a request for comment."}
{"original": "Secretary DeVos has referenced Jed when speaking before highly polarizing groups, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council."}
{"original": "The frustration they expressed, I think, is indicative of a system that for too long has tried to control everything from above and has not respected and honored the needs of the individual students, DeVos said of the teachers she met with, including Jed, when speaking before Congress in May."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Dearybury says he is concerned about the treatment of LGBTQ students under the Trump administration and the unequal distribution of funds between schools in rich and poor areas."}
{"original": "I want equal opportunities for all students. In this administration, when they say equal opportunity, they think you mean you want rich kids to go to private school and get a tax credit, he said."}
{"original": "This story has been updated to include additional comments from Dearybury about PSTA."}
{"original": "CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the title of the National School Boards Association as the American School Boards Association."}
{"original": "American students are being taught an inadequate and often sanitized version of history when it comes to slavery, according to a new report."}
{"original": "The report, from the Southern Poverty Law Center, looks at how slavery is presented in K-12 classrooms and found that students are often taught a deeply incomplete version of events. Students learn inspirational stories ― about figures like Harriet Tubman and good Samaritans who helped slaves reach freedom in the underground railroad ― before they learn about the horrors of enslavement. When they learn about slavery, it is often presented as an isolated, albeit unfortunate phenomenon, disconnected from white supremacist ideologies that abetted it and the racism that continues as a pervasive part of American life today."}
{"original": "Only 8 percent of high school seniors surveyed by an independent polling firm for the study identified slavery as the primary reason for the Civil War. Almost half identified tax protests as the main cause."}
{"original": "Teachers also posted disappointing results. About 66 percent of social studies teachers surveyed said they discuss the immorality of slavery with their classes. A little over half of surveyed teachers said they talk about the continued legacy of slavery in today's society with students. Southern Poverty Law Center said the study surveyed more than 1,700 social studies teachers that subscribe to its teaching tolerance project, as well as others found on commercial lists."}
{"original": "The study also reviewed 15 states' content standards, and 10 popular U.S. history textbooks. It found that while some states did better than others, they generally demanded only superficial-level teaching on the subject of slavery. Textbooks were similarly problematic."}
{"original": "While more than 90 percent of surveyed teachers said they feel comfortable talking about slavery in their classroom, many teachers revealed a higher level of discomfort in answers to open-ended questions, especially when dealing with young children."}
{"original": "I focus on the resistance factor more to avoid the children being scared by man's humanity to man [sic]. I don't want to steal any child's innocence, though I want to make sure that the children know the real history of their country, wrote one teacher."}
{"original": "The impact of inadequate teaching about slavery does not end when students leave the classroom. It contributes to how they see the world, the country's distribution of power, and the institutions around them."}
{"original": "It's not simply an event in our history; it's central to our history, the report notes."}
{"original": "Fixing the way slavery is taught in schools has a specific urgency at this moment in history, amid a surge in white nationalism, the report says. Understanding and facing the history is an essential first step of alleviating the indelible stain slavery has left on the country."}
{"original": "If we don't get the early history of our country right, we are unlikely to be equipped to do the heavy lifting necessary to bridge racial divides now and in the future, the report says. It is a moral necessity if we are to move the country forward toward healing slavery's persistent wounds."}
{"original": "Wind power is forecast to surpass hydroelectricity for the first time as the nation's top source of renewable electricity sometime in the next year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday."}
{"original": "The sector is expected to produce 6.4 percent of utility-scale electricity in 2018, and 6.9 percent in 2019, propelled by a construction boom of new turbines across the country."}
{"original": "Few new hydropower plants are in the works, so new electricity generation depends on how much rainfall and water runoff pools in existing dams and reservoirs. Hydropower provided 7.4 percent of utility-scale generation in 2017 ― a particularly wet year ― but that figure is projected to fall to about 6.5 percent in 2018 and 6.6 percent in 2019."}
{"original": "Although changes in weather patterns also affect wind generation, the forecast for wind power output is more dependent on the capacity and timing of new wind turbines coming online, Owen Comstock, the lead industry economist at the EIA, wrote in a press release."}
{"original": "The news marks a new milestone in wind's steady rise. Wind energy usurped hydropower's generating capacity for the first time in February 2017 as turbine installations tripled from 2008."}
{"original": "EIA A chart from the Energy Information Administration shows the rapid growth of wind energy generation since the early 2000s."}
{"original": "The latest announcement comes two days after President Donald Trump imposed new import fees on solar panels in a move analysts say will drive up costs and slow down a sector that has grown 17 times faster than the U.S. economy. The decision represented the most direct hit yet to the renewables industry from a White House that remains deeply skeptical of clean energy and the man-made climate change that necessitates it."}
{"original": "Yet, as solar deployments are now expected to slow by 11 percent over the next five years, wind turbines are on track to continue proliferating. The United States is projected to gain 37 gigawatts of new wind capacity between 2017 and 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The share of capacity increases each year, from 7 gigawatts in 2017 to a projected 11 gigawatts in 2020."}
{"original": "What this means for generation is, basically, we're seeing greater, bigger wind turbines, and more turbines that are better situated for the environment that they're in, Alex Morgan, North America wind analyst at BNEF, told HuffPost by phone Wednesday morning. So, more bang for your buck."}
{"original": "Part of what's driving the boom is a rush to build turbines to get the full benefits of the production tax credit. Congress extended the subsidy, which has been in place since the early 1990s, for five years in 2015. But the credit began phasing down by 20 percent in 2017, kick-starting a dash to build as many turbines as possible before the federal benefit expires."}
{"original": "Wind power has increasingly been a key energy resource during extreme weather events, such as the recent 'bomb cyclone.' Dylan Reed, Advanced Energy Economy"}
{"original": "Yet states are expected to continue providing incentives for wind energy long after 2020. The offshore wind industry ― a popular form of energy in Europe, though currently limited in North America to five turbines off the coast of Block Island, Rhode Island ― is only expected to gain steam after 2021, according to BNEF. For example, in New York, where the state plans to get half its electricity from renewables in 12 years, a series of projects off the coast of Long Island are expected to provide 2.4 gigawatts of energy by 2030, enough to power 1.25 million homes."}
{"original": "It's no surprise to see wind power gaining in generation nationally like this as it now competes on long-term contract price in many markets across the U.S., Dylan Reed, head of congressional affairs at the trade group Advanced Energy Economy, told HuffPost by email."}
{"original": "After a year of powerful gusts from record-breaking storms, the energy source has proved itself more valuable than ever, he said. Wind power has increasingly been a key energy resource during extreme weather events, such as the recent 'bomb cyclone.'"}
{"original": "However, effects of climate change are not necessarily a tailwind for turbines. Warming temperatures will significantly reduce the power of winds across north mid-latitudes, cutting wind strength across the central U.S. ― the nation's main wind-producing region ― by nearly a fifth, according to a provocative study published last year."}
{"original": "We found some substantial changes in wind energy, Kristopher Karnauskas, an author of the study and researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder, told The Guardian. But it does not mean we should not invest in wind power."}
{"original": "OTTAWA — Expanding the Trans Mountain pipeline will now cost at least $12.6 billion — a major increase from a three-year-old estimate of $7.4 billion on a project that Finance Minister Bill Morneau insists the Liberal government still plans to sell back to the private sector."}
{"original": "This was in the range of the considerations we looked at, Morneau said Friday in Ottawa."}
{"original": "The project will deliver $1.5 billion of available cash flow once it's finished, which means it remains commercially viable and, I think, very interesting for the eventual commercial buyers that we're going to be seeking, because we don't intend on keeping this in government hands, he said."}
{"original": "Trans Mountain Corp., the federally owned company managing the project, has spent $2.5 billion, leaving an additional $8.4 billion needed to complete the project, plus $1.7 billion of financial carrying costs."}
{"original": "Jason Franson/CP Pipe for the Trans Mountain pipeline is unloaded in Edson, Alta. on June 18, 2019."}
{"original": "Ottawa is also being told to set aside an extra $600 million in reserve to cover unforeseen expenses."}
{"original": "President and CEO Ian Anderson said about half of the cost increase was from delays and the other by design changes, such as adding thicker pipe in some areas and enhanced leak detection provisions. He said the project is expected to be in service by December 2022."}
{"original": "It's really important to know that the project that we're all working on and building today is not the project that we originally envisioned and introduced early in 2012, he said."}
{"original": "Nor is it the one we last provided a cost estimate for in early 2017. It isn't even the one we envisioned as early as 2018 when our ownership changed. It's much, much more today."}
{"original": "The 2017 estimate of $7.4 billion was made by Houston-based Kinder Morgan, Inc., which sold the pipeline to the federal government in 2018 for $4.5 billion. The company said political risk that the project would never get built was too much to bear and was planning to halt the expansion."}
{"original": "Should Ottawa now be unable to sell the pipeline as planned, the total cost to federal taxpayers to buy and build the project would be $17.1 billion — a cost the Liberals defended Friday as necessary to get Canadian oil to new markets beyond the United States, and use the revenues to fund a transition to a low-carbon economy."}
{"original": "Alberta Environment Minister Jason Nixon suggested a backstop of $2 billion promised by the previous provincial NDP government was not on the table."}
{"original": "At the end of the day, we see this as the federal government's responsibility, he said. We're in this situation because of their political failure and we expect them to get the job done that they've promised Albertans."}
{"original": "Critics have attacked the project's greenhouse-gas emission and oil-spill risks, and charged it will be a money-loser because of unproved markets in Asia — making Trans Mountain fail financially and leave the public holding the bag."}
{"original": "This should get back in the hands of the private sector immediately so that not a single tax dollar is spent to build this pipeline, Conservative natural resources critic Shannon Stubbs said. She called on the government to be transparent with taxpayers about costs."}
{"original": "The total cost could make it impossible for Ottawa to sell it to a new owner as planned, said Sven Biggs, climate and energy campaigner for Stand.earth."}
{"original": "Any time a major project increases its cost by this much you have to hit the pause button and reconsider whether or not you're still getting value for the taxpayer, he said in an interview Friday."}
{"original": "TMX CEO says pipeline will be money-maker"}
{"original": "Anderson said the pipeline will be a money-maker every day through its contractual period of 20 years. He pointed out 80 per cent of the space on the pipeline is contracted to 13 clients, including domestic oilsands producers like Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., as well as international firms such as Total S.A. and a subsidiary of PetroChina."}
{"original": "Opponents of the pipeline expansion have vowed to do whatever it takes to stop the project despite losing a legal challenge before the Federal Court of Appeal this week. The four First Nations who lost the court challenge on Tuesday have 60 days to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada."}
{"original": "The expansion project would triple the capacity of the existing pipeline between Edmonton and a shipping terminal in Burnaby, B.C. to about 890,000 barrels per day of diluted bitumen, lighter crudes and refined products."}
{"original": "New Democrat MP Peter Julian, who represents a Burnaby-area riding, said the Liberals shouldn't bankroll the expansion if they claim to be champions of the environment."}
{"original": "There's already a pipeline ... that would be maintained, but the idea that we spend on top of that another $13 billion in construction when it is extremely controversial does not make sense, he said."}
{"original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) just proposed huge increases to the estate tax, which would reverse decades of cuts that have allowed the nation's richest to establish generations of wealth."}
{"original": "Sanders wants to tax billionaires at a top rate of 77 percent when they die, a massive increase from the current rate. His Thursday announcement of what he's calling the For The 99.8% Act came just days after Republican senators announced they wanted to repeal the estate tax wholesale."}
{"original": "Sanders said the bill would raise $2.2 trillion from the more than 500 people who are billionaires in the U.S. at a time when Democratic contenders for president seem to be in a race to one-up each other with new ways of getting the rich to pay their fair share. Sanders is expected to announce his candidacy for 2020 soon."}
{"original": "Our bill does what the American people want by substantially increasing the estate tax on the wealthiest families in this country and dramatically reducing wealth inequality, Sanders said in a press release. From a moral, economic, and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so much and so many have so little."}
{"original": "Win McNamee via Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders is introducing a bill to increase the estate tax on the nation's billionaires to a rate of 77 percent."}
{"original": "Republicans have railed against the estate tax for years, calling it the death tax. It was drastically lowered during the George W. Bush administration― even disappearing for a time in 2010 ― and cut again with the most recent GOP tax overhaul. On Monday, GOP Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and John Thune (S.D.) introduced legislation that would go even further: permanently eliminating the federal estate tax altogether."}
{"original": "Currently, assets worth more than $11.4 million are taxed at a maximum rate of 40 percent. As recently as 1976, the tax rate was 77 percent on assets of $10 million in today's dollars."}
{"original": "Sanders would like to get back there: Under his plan, estates between $3.5 million and $10 million would be taxed at 45 percent. After that, the tax rate would increase to 50 percent for assets of $10 million to $50 million and to 55 percent for assets between $50 million and $1 billion."}
{"original": "Any assets above that would be taxed at a rate of 77 percent. Sanders said the bill would affect the richest 0.2 percent of earners."}
{"original": "His proposal is just the latest tax-the-rich idea coming from Democrats this year. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has announced a 2020 presidential run, has proposed an annual wealth tax of 2 percent on people with more than $50 million in assets ― that's a levy the wealthy would pay while they're still living. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has said she wants to raise the top marginal tax rate on incomes over $10 million."}
{"original": "In many ways, the US led the world toward the development of progressive taxation and the reduction of inequality at the global level during the first half of the 20th century, Thomas Piketty, an economist known for his work on wealth inequality, told HuffPost in an email about Warren's proposal. Unfortunately, one century later, in 2019, the rise of inequality creates new threats to liberal democracies. It is time to take a new step and to develop new policy instruments, in line with the challenges raised by global wealth trends. "}

At a Monday event in Manhattan, he called Ocasio-Cortez's recent criticism of billionaires un-American and misinformed. Then on Tuesday, he described Warren's proposed wealth tax as ridiculous."}
{"original": "What's 'ridiculous,' Warren responded, is billionaires who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system rigged for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else."}
{"original": "Sanders' proposal also would get rid of some of the tax shelters and dodges that the wealthy use to get out of paying the estate tax. That move echoes policy proposals from Warren and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). Each has included reforms to estate tax loopholes as funding mechanisms for other legislative proposals."}
{"original": "Figuring out how to raise taxes on the rich is shaping up to be one of the core pieces of the Democratic primary, said Greg Leiserson, director of tax policy and senior economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. He's agnostic so far on the method, though. Any of the proposals could work, he said, adding: I think we should be taxing wealth more and I'm excited to see these different approaches."}

{"original": "But who can blame them for taking non-traditional paths, given the poor financial hand they've been dealt: record levels of college debt, uncertain job prospects, stagnant wages, and more. It's why one in three Millennials is deeply dissatisfied with their financial situation, according to a much-quoted new study from George Washington University and PwC."}
{"original": "Findings from a recent Harvard survey cut even deeper: half of Millennials say the American Dream is dead. Yep, that cornerstone of post-war America--the house, the car, the upwardly mobile career track--is about as relevant to them as black & white TV. To parents raised on the mythology of the American Dream, that's grim news."}
{"original": "But the situation may not be as dire as it appears."}
{"original": "As they've done with everything from communications to careers, Millennials are redefining what it means to lead a better life (something parents see as key to the American Dream, according to a 2015 60 Minutes/Vanity Fair poll). This new paradigm is rooted in the experiences of people who came of age after the financial crisis of 2008, and reflects how they see the world. It offers a flexible lifestyle (one that some might see as transient) and a reworking of the traditional measures of success."}
{"original": "Here are three ways that our kids will make their own American Dream--and thrive."}
{"original": "1. They'll rethink what college means--and how to pay for it."}
{"original": "Two-thirds of parents say the American Dream includes sending their kids to college, according to a September poll from the youth media company Fusion. These moms and dads are right to think this, as college grads earn about $1 million more over their lifetimes."}
{"original": "For Millennials, cost and career aspirations are informing this major life decision more than ever (call it pragmatism if you want). Gone are the days of selecting a school based on its bucolic campus or dominant football program. Kids (and parents) want more value--and less debt."}
{"original": "That's why it's so critical to start the college cost conversation early--like 9th grade-early. Want an incentive? A start-up called Raise.me allows high schoolers--as early as freshman year--to earn micro-scholarships from over 100 colleges. Got an A in chemistry? Won the lacrosse playoffs? Volunteered at your local animal shelter? Each awesome achievement can earn your kid $500 to over $1,000 from various colleges. Even mayor of Millennials Mark Zuckerberg backs it: Facebook is one of Raise.me's main supporters."}
{"original": "Best way to avoid the college cost guessing game? Fill out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid)--the key to scholarships, grants, work-study, and low-rate federal loans. The form is notoriously long and complicated, but it's getting better! Starting this year, you can access the FAFSA on October 1, 2016 (up from January 1, 2017). Why the new, early start? It means you'll be able to auto-fill the form for the 2017-18 school year using your 2015 tax return data. (More details here.)"}

{"original": "In 1986 (back when I was graduating from college!), 76% of young people saw owning a home as essential to the American Dream. Today that's down to 59%, according to the Fusion poll."}
{"original": "That means your kid is more likely to bunk with you--or rent--than take on a mortgage she can't afford (so don't turn her bedroom into a home office just yet). If she does move in with you, make sure she uses this time as an opportunity to save! (And work out any financial details in advance with this helpful guide from eHow.com.)"}
{"original": "Renting has traditionally gotten a bad rap, but it lets your kid explore--new towns, new jobs, new people!--without being stuck in one place. Take our selfie-stick seller: his Southeast Asia stint lasted less than a year before he was back in the states and settling into a new city and new gig. Like his fellow Millennials, he'll probably rent for several years. Buying may not even cross his mind until his early 30s. A Zillow study shows the average first-time homebuyer is now 33, up from 29 in the 1970s. Of course, you'll want to talk to your kid about the realities of owning a home, including how to sock away a chunk of money for a down payment once she's ready."}

{"original": "A study from Upwork, a company that helps businesses find freelance workers, showed that 62% (mostly Millennial) freelancers planned to work a full-time job and moonlight on the side for two years before quitting to follow their dreams. Two years may not be a magic number (a specific financial goal would be safer), but at least they're earning--and learning--prior to taking the leap."}
{"original": "Today's young people aren't all work and no play, either. Millennials' drive for success, salary, and even entrepreneurial goals pales in comparison to their desire to spend time with family and friends, which they rank as one of the most important things in their lives, according to the Harvard survey."}

{"original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Sunday that he and Democrats holding the Senate majority will use budget reconciliation, a process by which certain legislation can be passed with the support of a simple majority, to pass a coronavirus relief bill as soon as we possibly can."}
{"original": "We are going to use reconciliation ― that is 50 votes in the Senate plus the vice president ― to pass legislation desperately needed by working families in this country right now, Sanders said on CNN's State of the Union."}
{"original": "Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, became chairman of the powerful Senate Budget Committee when Democrats regained control of the chamber earlier this year. The senator has been a vocal proponent of Democrats finding ways to enact President Joe Biden's agenda despite Republican opposition, and reconciliation is one method, effectively preventing Senate Republicans from using the filibuster to block certain types of legislation."}
{"original": "What we cannot do is wait weeks and weeks, and months and months, to go forward, Sanders said, arguing against a protracted debate over the relief bill. We've got to act now."}
{"original": "Tasos Katopodis via Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders said Democrats will use budget reconciliation to pass coronavirus relief legislation."}
{"original": "The United States has more confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more deaths from the disease than any other country, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. At least 25 million Americans have been infected and more than 418,000 have died from the coronavirus. The pandemic has also battered the U.S. economy, forcing widespread business closures and layoffs. This week, the Labor Department announced weekly jobless claims remain historically high."}
{"original": "Still, several Senate Republicans have opposed Biden's pandemic relief bill since it was unveiled two weeks ago, arguing it costs too much. The immediate GOP opposition to Biden's agenda harkens back to Republicans' vows to obstruct former President Barack Obama's agenda after he entered office in 2009, when Democrats similarly held control of Congress and the White House. The threat of obstruction has inspired a growing number of Democrats to support passing some key measures through budget reconciliation."}
{"original": "In 2017, Republicans in the Senate majority used budget reconciliation to narrowly pass steep tax cuts shown to largely favor wealthy Americans and large corporations. At the time, Sanders said Republicans were abusing this process by using it to pass the cuts despite their deep and widespread unpopularity."}
{"original": "On Sunday, the senator stood by his criticism of using budget reconciliation for the GOP tax cuts, and he said the dire circumstances brought about by the pandemic call for its use now."}
{"original": "Yes, I did criticize them for that, Sanders said."}

MasterCard is putting $510 million towards the project."}
{"original": "Though the funding is coming from the government's so-called Strategic Innovation Fund, which supports projects meant to spur innovation for a better Canada, Tories have already framed it as a handout for a hugely profitable company."}
{"original": "The Government of Canada has invested in a major new cybersecurity centre which will make Canada world-leading when it comes to countering cyber crime, ensuring cyber security, as well as developing new technology, Joly said."}
{"original": "Bergen noted that since MasterCard's revenue last year was reported as more than $16 billion, they can afford to develop their own cybersecurity."}

{"original": "The vast majority of Americans are eligible for at least $1,200 worth of coronavirus recovery rebates from the Internal Revenue Service, but there's just one catch: You have to file a tax return."}
{"original": "Some might struggle to do so. Not everyone is required to file a federal return each year, and millions of households don't."}
{"original": "The IRS specified in a rebate fact sheet on Monday that people who usually don't file tax returns, such as seniors, people with disabilities, veterans and people with low incomes, will need to file a simple tax return to receive an economic impact payment."}
{"original": "Congressional offices have been inundated with calls from senior citizens worried they'll miss the payments, according to a Tuesday press release from Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee."}
{"original": "Neal noted that because of the social distancing measures taken to limit the spread of the deadly virus, volunteer tax clinics are closed. He urged Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to find a solution that will allow vulnerable groups to receive these funds automatically, without needing to file an additional return."}
{"original": "Treasury Department spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment."}
{"original": "The Trump administration is moving fast to get the payments into people's bank accounts. The president signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act into law less than a week ago, after the legislation itself came together in about a week ― basically warp speed for Congress."}
{"original": "The legislation was packed with subsidies for businesses, funding for states and hospitals, and huge increases to unemployment benefits in addition to the direct payments to households."}
{"original": "Individuals earning $75,000 or less are eligible for $1,200, and couples earning less than $150,000 can get $2,400, with the size of the benefit gradually phasing down for incomes above those thresholds. Households with minor children get an additional $500 per kid. Anyone who filed taxes for 2018 or 2019, and who has already set up direct deposit with the IRS, should see the money in their bank accounts within weeks."}
{"original": "Theoretically, any low-income household should be able to file its taxes online for free (here is the IRS.gov page with links to approved free services). But new filers trying to get rebate payments through the free online process may have some problems."}

{"original": "One person in Indiana, who said their only income is disability benefits, said the free online tax software wouldn't allow them to file online or enter bank account information. The person, who requested anonymity, had received too little in disability benefits to owe federal tax, and because they had no earned income, wouldn't receive a normal refund, so the filing software said they weren't eligible to file online."}
{"original": "I had to print mine out and mail them in to the IRS and the Indiana Department of Revenue, the person said in an email. I wrote in my bank account numbers when I signed the return."}
{"original": "I created a TurboTax account and tried to make a dummy return for a single person with no earned income. The software said that because my Form 1040 would have zeroes on lines for income, tax, credits and payments, that my federal return was ineligible for e-filing, according to IRS rules."}
{"original": "The IRS did not immediately respond to requests for comment."}
{"original": "A spokesperson for Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, said the company is partnering with the IRS on how we can assist individuals who do not usually file a return to submit necessary information to the IRS related to stimulus payments."}
{"original": "A spokesperson for another tax prep company, H&R Block, said they're modifying our do-it-yourself online products and working with the IRS and an industry trade association so that people who are typically not required to file taxes can submit a return for free and provide bank account information."}
{"original": "The IRS does not run its own free online site for tax preparation, instead outsourcing the service to tax prep companies that have been notorious for using the lure of free filing to push paid products on customers. In a separate letter on Tuesday, Neal urged an industry trade group known as the Free File Alliance to make sure non-filers don't have a hard time getting their pandemic rebates."}
{"original": "The likely solution for people who are unable to electronically file their taxes will be for them to tell the online software that they had $1 worth of interest income, said Tim Hugo, director of the Free File Alliance. Hugo said it was an adequate workaround when a similar problem cropped up in 2008, which was the last time the government sent everybody stimulus checks."}
{"original": "It's been done before. It's tested, Hugo said, adding that the companies were working with the administration to finalize the guidance."}
{"original": "The hiccups in the tax filing process were exactly why some policy experts had warned Congress not to require tax filing for rebate eligibility."}
{"original": "This seemingly technical issue will determine whether large numbers of low-income veterans, people with disabilities, and seniors receive the stimulus payments, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Niskanen Center, two Washington think tanks, said in a joint statement last week."}
{"original": "As many as 15 million households did not file returns last year. Non-filers likely include a lot of seniors on Social Security and people with incomes so low they don't owe federal taxes and aren't required to file returns."}
{"original": "These are among the people who struggle the most to make ends meet and thus among the likeliest to spend every additional dollar they receive, providing the greatest potential boost to the economy, the joint statement said. Ensuring they get these payments will both blunt the worst impacts of the current crisis for a very needy group and ensure that the payments have the largest possible stimulative effect."}
{"original": "This story has been updated to include comment from Tim Hugo."}
{"original": "Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee (D) signed a pledge Tuesday promising to reject donations from the fossil fuel industry ahead of a likely run for the White House that he's vowed to uniquely center on climate change."}
{"original": "In an interview with HuffPost, Inslee, 67, said he added his name to the list of more than 1,300 politicians across the United States who took the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge."}
{"original": "The vow, administered by a coalition of 16 left-leaning environmental groups, commits candidates to adopt a policy to not knowingly accept any contributions over $200 from the PACs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies — companies whose primary business is the extraction, processing, distribution, or sale of oil, gas, or coal."}
{"original": "This is just one small statement that they should not continue to have undue influence over our decision-making over the existential threat against our nation, Inslee said by phone Tuesday night. This challenge calls for the scale of national effort similar to when we went to the moon, similar to when we beat fascism."}
{"original": "Inslee is the second governor to sign the pledge, following newly elected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D). California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who was sworn in this week, took a similar pledge ― called Oil Money Out ― but the oath was limited to the oil industry in the Golden State. But Inslee is the third likely contender for the next Democratic presidential nomination to take the pledge, after Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.)."}
{"original": "The Democratic Party has to put a candidate forward who will make it the primary commitment to get this stuff done, Inslee said. It can't be put in just one of the baskets of many issues."}
{"original": "By signing, Inslee is laying the groundwork for a historic, if long-shot, bid for the presidency on the single issue of scaling back planet-warming emissions and preparing for climate change. The move is bold but timely. Record-breaking storms, droughts and wildfires wreaked havoc across the U.S. over the past three years as President Donald Trump attempted to boost the fossil fuel industry by gutting or delaying nearly every major federal climate regulation."}
{"original": "Even amid a three-week partial government shutdown leaving federal workers scrambling for pay, the Trump administration is continuing to approve oil and gas drilling permits, Bloomberg reported."}
{"original": "Bloomberg via Getty Images An American flag flies on top of a Unit Drilling Co. rig in the Bakken Formation outside Watford City, North Dakota."}
{"original": "In October, United Nations scientists issued a dire warning, giving world governments a 2030 deadline to halve emissions or face a cataclysmic temperature spike. Yet emissions hit an all-time high last year and look set to continue soaring as new estimates released Tuesday showed a 3.4 percent surge in the United States alone."}
{"original": "A new generation of left-wing Democrats, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), ran as champions of a Green New Deal, a sweeping federal policy to end fossil fuel use and guarantee high-wage clean-energy sector jobs to every American. It's a popular idea. One poll released last month pegged the number of registered voters who support a Green New Deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative Republicans."}
{"original": "Yet only some of the high-profile Democrats hoping to challenge Trump in 2020 have made the issue a top priority. Sanders held a town hall on climate change in December and is preparing legislation on a Green New Deal. Merkley was the first senator to back a Green New Deal last year. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) followed soon after, explicitly tying his push for a federal job guarantee to the climate proposal."}
{"original": "Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) and Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) voiced tepid support for the concept of a Green New Deal."}
{"original": "The pledge, even more than the Green New Deal, represents a true litmus test for serious climate action in 2020 and beyond, R.L. Miller, the president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote, said by email of Inslee's announcement. Our democracy is being drowned in a dark oily tidal wave of dirty money and it needs leaders who can rise above."}
{"original": "Inslee stands alone as the first candidate to say climate change takes priority over other hot-button issues like health care, immigration and inequality."}
{"original": "The political capital that needs to be invested, the intense gathering of allies to push this through Congress, just requires an all-out effort, Inslee said. That's not going to be done just because somebody now decides they're interested in climate change. It takes someone who's frankly cared about it for years and years."}
{"original": "Inslee boasts a lengthy record on climate."}
{"original": "In 2006, Inslee, then one of Washington's 10 U.S. representatives, spearheaded an effort to set a renewable portfolio standard in the Evergreen State. In 2007, he co-authored a book called Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy, which, as the title implies, laid out a vision for bolstering the renewable-energy and electric-vehicle industries. In 2009, he co-founded the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition in the House of Representatives. Later that year, he sponsored the federal cap-and-trade bill known as Waxman-Markey."}
{"original": "This is the 11th hour. But it should be our hour to shine. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D)"}
{"original": "Since he was first elected governor in 2012, Inslee repeatedly championed incentives for electric vehicles, with the goal of getting 50,000 on Washington state roads by 2020. In 2016, he became the first governor to issue an executive order capping carbon dioxide emissions. A glowing profile published last week in The Atlantic credited Inslee with pursuing arguably the most progressive and greenest agenda in the country, with fields of solar panels, fleets of electric buses, and massive job growth to show for it."}
{"original": "In just the past year, Inslee kiboshed two major fossil fuel projects and added new regulations on existing infrastructure. Last January, he personally intervened to reject permits to build what would have been the nation's largest oil-by-rail facility at the Port of Vancouver. He signed a bill in March putting a new tax on pipelines, forcing the operators to fund a state program to protect against oil spills. In May, he blocked construction of a $680 million coal-export terminal on the Columbia River."}
{"original": "This is the 11th hour, Inslee said of the time that's left to halt catastrophic global warming. But it should be our hour to shine."}
{"original": "Inslee fought over the past year to pass Initiative 1631, a ballot measure that would have put a $15 per metric ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions and directed the money toward expanding public transit, energy-efficiency retrofits for big buildings and new wind- and solar-powered plants. The proposal, dubbed by some a state-level Green New Deal, failed after the oil industry spent a record $31 million pressuring Evergreen State voters to reject the measure. It was Inslee's third attempt at putting a price on carbon in his state."}
{"original": "But Inslee said he's not wedded to a carbon pricing scheme as the central focus of a climate policy. Carbon taxes are gaining favor among Republicans and oil companies. But a new gas tax triggered fiery protests in France and became a rallying cry over the past few months against carbon taxes that don't directly benefit low- and middle-income workers."}
{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS A photo shows the smoky haze that obscured the Space Needle and downtown Seattle in August 2018."}
{"original": "People have focused on this issue of a carbon tax, but it may not be necessary to finance renewable energy infrastructure, Inslee said. We may find other ways to finance this. You look at the Trump tax cuts that were misbegotten and gave all these tax benefits to the upper-income groups, and people weren't worried about the deficit when they did that."}
{"original": "Inslee faces some critics on climate change. In February, 13 young people in Washington, ages seven to 17, sued the state, alleging Inslee and the agencies under his control violated the constitutional rights of a generation by failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions. One plaintiff ― Jamie Margolin, a 17-year-old activist in Seattle who founded the youth climate group Zero Hour ― railed against Inslee in a series of tweets last week accusing the governor of fighting tooth & nail against the lawsuit, which a state judge tossed in August."}
{"original": "Margolin called Inslee an old corperate [sic] establishment white man who screws over the youth and indigenous folks of his state. She pointed to the ongoing fight over a massive liquefied natural gas terminal in Tacoma, Washington, which the Puyallup Tribe and leaders from 14 other Northwest tribes pleaded with Inslee to reject."}
{"original": "Asked about the accusations on Tuesday, Inslee said the Tacoma facility had already begun permitting and that his administration was going to follow the law and allow the process to play out, though he said he requested additional carbon dioxide analyses of the project."}
{"original": "I cannot make statements about eventual permitting until that plays out, he said. In a follow-up email, Inslee's spokesman reiterated that the project doesn't have final permitting yet."}
{"original": "Earlier this year, Inslee visited the scorched remains of Paradise, California, a town decimated by the state's deadliest wildfire in history. He said that visit made clear to him that the 2020 election needed to be singularly focused on the crisis at hand."}
{"original": "It looked like Dresden after World War II, Inslee said. In my final days, when I look back and ask what I did to deal with climate change, I want to be able to say I did everything I could, including possibly running for president."}
{"original": "PUTNAM VALLEY, N.Y. (AP) — New York state's parks commissioner is trying to figure out if the state is obligated to keep former President Donald Trump's name on a 436-acre state park on land he donated in the New York City suburbs 14 years ago, after local opposition sunk his plans for a golf course."}
{"original": "Commissioner Erik Kulleseid told lawmakers at a budget hearing Wednesday that he has received frequent emails about rebranding Donald J. Trump State Park in Putnam Valley. A 2006 agreement says the park must bear Trump's name in exchange for the donation, but Kulleseid said the condition is not in the deed and it's unclear if it's binding."}
{"original": "Trump donated the land to the state, receiving a significant tax write-off, after he was unable to get approval for a private golf course there. It was never completed as a fully functional state park and isn't listed on the website of the state office of parks, recreation and historic preservation."}
{"original": "A Change.org petition asks to rename the park for Sojourner Truth, an icon of the abolitionist and women's rights movements. There's also a bill under consideration to rename the park for Heather Heyer, who died when a car struck counterprotesters at the Unite the Right white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in 2017."}

{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled an economic relief plan that would deliver $1,400 to most Americans and invest in a national vaccination program — and also endorses a whole host of Democratic policy priorities from increasing the minimum wage and expanding paid leave to extending unemployment benefits."}
{"original": "Biden addressed the nation on the details of the plan, called the American Rescue Plan, on Thursday night as he prepares to assume control of the federal government next week amid a still-raging pandemic throttling the country's health care system and economy. On average, the coronavirus has killed more than 3,000 Americans a day over the past week, and unemployment claims nationwide are on the rise. Nearly 1.2 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, according to the latest report from the Department of Labor."}
{"original": "The $1.9 trillion plan is designed to both immediately address those crises, while also delivering on longer-term Democratic priorities."}
{"original": "There is real pain overwhelming the real economy, Biden said. It's not hard to see that we are in the middle of a once-in-several-generations economic crisis within a once-in-several-generations public health crisis."}
{"original": "The 19-page outline sprawls from taxes to health care to workplace safety, and it's not clear which of its policies will remain top priorities when negotiations begin in earnest. Some items, such as unemployment benefits, are already on the coming Capitol Hill agenda this year."}
{"original": "The plan, as currently designed, would likely need bipartisan support to pass Congress. But Democrats, who will soon have control of the Senate majority, also have a legislative maneuver called budget reconciliation available to them, which will allow them to pass certain proposals with only a simple majority."}
{"original": "JIM WATSON via Getty Images We are in the middle of a once-in-several-generations economic crisis within a once-in-several-generations public health crisis, President-elect Joe Biden said."}
{"original": "Biden includes $1,400 direct payments in his proposal, which added to the $600 checks sent out with the last relief package would amount to the $2,000 he vowed to get out to Americans."}
{"original": "In its last COVID-19 relief bill, Congress extended federal unemployment benefits for gig workers and the long-term jobless only until April. Biden's plan would extend benefits through September, and also boost the $300 per week federal supplement to $400."}
{"original": "That's a more modest increase than top congressional Democrats are currently demanding. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who will be the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee once Democrats take control of the Senate, and was instrumental in writing the original $600 unemployment insurance program in March, said he intends on pushing a return to that original benefit."}
{"original": "The new jobless claims are going to be especially important to Senate Democrats and it will really strengthen our case, Wyden said Thursday morning, citing new numbers released Thursday showing 18 million Americans claiming unemployment aid. The original four-month law actually reduced the poverty rate."}
{"original": "Tom Williams via Getty Images Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), right, and Sen. Ron Wyden, (D-Ore.), will be instrumental to negotiations on this COVID-19 relief and economic recovery package."}
{"original": "The unemployment provisions, along with the direct payments, have gotten some pushback from left-leaning lawmakers, who had understood Biden's promise of $2,000 to be on top of the existing $600 Congress approved last month, not including them."}
{"original": "″$2,000 means $2,000. $2,000 does not mean $1,400, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told The Washington Post, additionally tweeting that she hoped the unemployment benefit would be retroactive to when the original program lapsed over the summer."}
{"original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who will soon be the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and was among the most vocal champions of the $2,000 checks, was more direct in his praise."}
{"original": "President-elect Biden has put forth a very strong first installment of an emergency relief plan that will begin to provide desperately needed assistance to tens of millions of working families facing economic hardship during the pandemic, Sanders said in the statement."}
{"original": "The plan also appears to omit a proposal favored by Wyden and many Democrats to tie benefits to the unemployment rate instead of setting an arbitrary cut-off deadline. Biden supports the idea and it's mentioned as a possibility after the September cut-off, but a senior official said he is not prioritizing economic triggers for jobless benefits in the administration's first proposal."}
{"original": "In a statement after the proposal's release, Wyden said he looked forward to taking the lead on the proposal while reiterating his support for increasing the jobless benefit and making the program more responsive to the economy."}
{"original": "A core pillar of Biden's proposal is boosting vaccination, through what he's calling a national vaccination program that will provide states and local governments with extra funding, above and beyond what last year's COVID-19 relief bill offered. Biden has said his goal is to administer 100 million doses in the first 100 days of his administration ― a pace that is higher than current levels, but still a lot lower than what is likely necessary to achieve herd immunity by summer."}
{"original": "The Biden plan also calls for the federal government to launch community vaccination centers around the country and deploy mobile vaccination clinics to hard-to-reach areas, although the transition team has not specified whether the federal government will be creating and running those centers directly or whether it will simply be providing support to state and local governments, many of which have already launched some efforts along those lines."}
{"original": "Also in the rescue proposal: A call to hire 100,000 public health workers, both to combat the pandemic and create jobs, as well as funding for schools to test and prepare classrooms for a return to in-person learning."}
{"original": "Biden plans to deliver remarks on Friday outlining his plan to speed up the vaccine rollout in more detail."}
{"original": "The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far, he said."}
{"original": "Much of Biden's opening bid is an expansion of assistance already on the books and some new revenue streams for struggling public works. It includes an additional $30 billion in rental and utilities assistance, $5 billion for housing those at risk of homelessness, extensions of the eviction moratorium and the increased nutrition benefit, more than $150 billion in funding for schools and funding for struggling public transit systems, among other programs."}
{"original": "The incoming administration also wants to pass a slew of changes to low-income tax credits that Democrats have sought in recent years, including an increase in refunds for parents from the child tax credit and a boost to the earned income tax credit for childless adults. But Biden has apparently not embraced proposals to make the credits payable in advance, meaning the changes wouldn't benefit anyone until 2022, and would only boost refunds for one tax year."}
{"original": "If parents received tax credits in advance ― as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.) proposed last year ― the policy would resemble the kind of child benefit that is standard in other advanced countries, and it would probably put a huge dent in child poverty."}
{"original": "The proposal's $1.9 trillion price is significantly higher than anything Republicans have been comfortable with in recent months, but Biden has repeatedly argued deficit spending is necessary to combat the pandemic's damage. The proposal does not include any tax increases or revenue raisers to offset the cost of the aid."}
{"original": "The consensus from economists from everywhere from the Fed to the IMF to other top institutions is that at this very precarious moment in the crisis, the senior Biden official said. The risk of doing too little at this moment is far greater than the risk of doing too much and therefore. The investments in this package will actually deliver real relief, prevent scarring, prevent human suffering and actually put us on a path to a stronger recovery, and a stronger and more stable fiscal position."}
{"original": "That said, Democrats do have a lot of political considerations to take into account. Many Biden officials remember the political failures of the 2009 economic relief package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a policy that economists maintain was economically sound, but Republicans made so politically toxic that Democrats lost control of the House just a year later."}
{"original": "That's a history that will likely define the initial negotiations as Biden comes into office with slim majorities in both chambers of Congress."}
{"original": "Unity is not a pie-in-the-sky dream, it is a practical step to getting things done, said Biden, who has often insisted he will find common ground with Republicans despite skepticism from other Democrats."}

{"original": "Last week, an all-male group of lawmakers, in the state of Utah, voted 8-3 to uphold the state's sales tax imposed on tampons. Invoking a slippery-slope fallacy that claimed that supporting the change would open the door to all sorts of crazy requests for exemptions, the measure failed, according to CBS News."}
{"original": "Here, in my home state of California, two Assembly Women, Cristina Garcia and Ling Ling Chang, put forth a bill, which would make tampons, pads and panty liners exempt from sales tax. The tampon tax bill, as now commonly referred to as the pink tax, took the form of California Assembly Bill 1561. California, along with Ohio, New York, Utah and Virginia hope to follow the lead of tax-exempt feminine hygiene product states such as: Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and New Jersey."}
{"original": "In most states, items, which are already exempt from taxes, include non-necessities such as prescription drugs, most food and grocery items and a long list of medical equipment. But, according to legislation in 45 states, evidently having our periods is a luxury. A luxury? On what planet?! I can see it now: Come to Planet Period! Luxuries include bloating, cramping, mood swings, acne breakout, weight gain and stained clothing! And, if that's not luxurious enough, the icing on the cake is that you get taxed!"}
{"original": "Women, according to the New York Times, spend roughly $7.00 per month on tampons and pads. That's a lot of money over the course of women's menstruating years. Let's also contextualize the tampon tax. In 2016, according to figures published by CNNMoney.com, women already make roughly .74 cents to the dollar on men. In addition, because men don't menstruate, this tax can be viewed as a material form of gender discrimination. This means, then, that there are many women who are literally choosing to purchase feminine hygiene products, or put food on the table."}
{"original": "To prove the point that periods--a monthly visit from Aunt Flo aren't luxury items, protests, taking various forms, have recently been enacted. In August of 2015, as covered in the Independent UK, a woman, Kiran Gandhi, ran with blood dripping down my legs for sisters who don't have access to tampons... More recently, in November of 2015, People Magazine highlighted a free bleeding protest that was staged outside of the Houses of Parliament in London, England. Two women, Charlie Edge, and Ruth Howarth, donned white pants and let it flow for three hours. Since their protests and live tweets, with full images, they have been receiving hate mail and threats. Being grossed out by the natural phenomenon of bleeding, and engaging in period shaming is another blog entirely. However, for the purpose of this essay, this strategy certainly points to the ludicrous nature of tampons being viewed as luxury items, and not as a necessity."}
{"original": "Let's look as some other taxed luxury items, in order to have a point of comparison. What about this statistic? According to Time magazine, ten of our fifty nifty United States tax tampons, but not soda pop! Make sure you have extra cash, if you are on your period, in the states of: Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, South Carolina, Vermont, and Wyoming. So, again, in case you didn't follow the logic: soda is a necessity. Tampons and pads are not. Another fun fact? The great state of New York will tax you for having your period and needing to purchase a tampon, but not admissions to live circus performances, purchases of American flags or dry cleaning expenses. Evidently, periods are not considered patriotic. But, look on the bright side, when you ruin your white pants from not being able to afford a pad, you won't get taxed on your dry cleaning trying to get that stain out!"}
{"original": "It looks as if this anti-pink tax movement has gained momentum. California will most likely repeal the tampon and pad luxury tax. And if/when it passes, it will indeed be an important step in the ongoing struggle for gender equality. Other states will, then, hopefully follow suit. We must be vigilant until the tax is removed in all 50 states. In addition, we must continue to address the other related forms of gender discrimination referenced earlier... 74 cents to the dollar. And what about pushing this movement even further? How about free feminine hygiene products in all public restrooms? This way, women don't have to choose between food or hygiene products."}
{"original": "Achieving gender and economic equality? Well that, would, indeed be luxurious."}

{"original": "THE CHAOS IN THE WHITE HOUSE was threatening Mike Pence's chances of ever becoming president, and that was unacceptable. It was the spring of 2017. Special counsel Robert Mueller had just launched his investigation into the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump associates were scrambling to lawyer up, Pence included. And a group of the vice president's close friends and advisers were growing fearful that everything Pence had worked for was about to be lost. His unquestioning loyalty to Trump was becoming an enormous liability. A friend familiar with the discussions said a decision was made that they had to be more strategic. Luckily, Pence knew someone who could help, an operative he trusted completely. Nick Ayers was only 34 at the time, but in his short career, he had already inspired more admiration, envy and animosity among his peers than almost anyone else in Washington's consultant class. On June 29, it was announced that Ayers would be taking over as Pence's chief of staff. In an interview with The New Yorker, Anthony Scaramucci summed up the calculation this way: Nick's there to protect the Vice-President because the Vice-President can't believe what the fuck is going on. Pence has always relied unusually heavily on his staffers, according to five people who have worked with him. One confessed to being surprised by his malleability. A consultant who knows Pence well explained that while he is ideologically unshakeable, he is often unsure about operational matters."}
{"original": "If you bump into him at an airport and tell him he needs better yard signage, he will immediately assume you are right, said the consultant, who has done pretty much just that. [1] Before Ayers' arrival, Pence could not quite bring himself to tell Josh Pitcock, his well-liked aide of 12 years, that he was going to be replaced. Instead Pitcock, who was planning to depart at some point anyway, found himself having endless, confusing calls with Ayers about the newcomer's role. Eventually, Pitcock suggested: Why don't you just have my job? In the early months of Trump's presidency, according to a former senior White House official, Pence had been acting like a staffer, wandering in and out of the Oval Office with nothing to do. Ayers swiftly inserted himself into meetings at which Pence had not been included and carefully guarded access to his boss. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council and an old Pence friend, told me that for a while he couldn't even get his calls returned. Ayers was also close with the right people. He had ingratiated himself with Jared Kushner and the younger Trumps while volunteering as an adviser for the campaign and later as a well-regarded member of the transition team. (He and the Trump sons share an enthusiasm for hunting.) After arriving in the White House, Ayers started flattering Trump's chief of staff, John Kelly, relentlessly. (A regular West Wing visitor told me that Kelly completely has his number.)"}
{"original": "[2] Another example of a canny Ayers attempt to win support for himself within the White House: In October, Ayers exhorted a gathering of RNC donors at the St. Regis hotel in Washington D.C. to purge any Republican lawmakers who failed to vote for the MAGA agenda. Somehow, a recording of the speech found its way to Politico. Trump's inner circle reportedly approved. Perhaps most useful of all is Ayers' knack for staying on the right side of the president. During the 2016 GOP primary, Ayers served as chief strategist on Pence's gubernatorial reelection campaign in Indiana. Pence remained strategically supportive of nearly all the final presidential candidates. He eventually endorsed Ted Cruz in a video, but was so flattering of Trump that Trump would (not incorrectly) call it more of an endorsement for me. People on the Cruz campaign detected the hand of Ayers. Nick is really good at threading a needle, one person close to Cruz explained. Ayers and Pence on the night in 2016 when Trump asked Pence to be his running mate. TWITTER These days, Pence is almost deferential around his chief of staff, two sources told me. The more Nick is right, the more the vice president is empowering him, said one. And the 2018 midterms will see Ayers' power expand significantly. It is Pence, not Trump, who will anchor the GOP's urgent effort to avoid massive losses in Congress."}
{"original": "By the end of April, Pence will have appeared at more than 30 campaign events this year, with Ayers masterminding the details. Ayers is also one of the chief arbiters of which candidates receive money from Pence's leadership PAC, the Great America Committee. Even Ayers' many detractors concede that he's very good at his job. A number of Republicans believe he has salvaged Pence's chances of succeeding Trump as president—which is very far from where he was nine months ago. The person close to Cruz said that Cruz would not run against Pence unless he is implicated in a serious finding by Mueller. Ayers is critical to helping Pence (and by extension the GOP), this person wrote me. On the one hand, he explained, Ayers is carefully crafting strategies to show Trump [Pence] is loyal. On the other hand, he went on, Ayers is insulating Pence from Trump's radioactive decisions. No easy task. Few can do it consistently. Ayers is a master at it. In person, Ayers is known to be exhaustingly charming. He has a panache you don't normally encounter in D.C. Floppy blond hair, wide smile, swift stride, expensive suit. His greatest weapon is a Southern drawl that makes you feel as if everything is happening in slow motion. If you talk slow, people think you think slow, said Mark Meadows, the Republican congressman and chair of the House Freedom Caucus. [Ayers] thinks four times as fast as he talks."}
{"original": "Despite his age, Ayers is solicitous in the manner of a courtly older gentleman. Sometimes, he will ask permission from reporters to remove his coat or tie with an elaborate politeness. He is given to grandiloquent declarations of integrity. One thing I am not, is I am not a liar, was an example recalled by a Republican consultant who has spoken with him often. I am always truthful. People can call me a lot of things, but one thing I am is a truthful person. This Southern Baptist preacher schtick is the sort of thing GOP donors swoon over, the consultant told me, but it doesn't always go over so well with Ayers' peers. Almost every operative that comes across Nick just absolutely cannot stand the guy, the consultant added. Still, while Ayers' affect may be cloying, it does place his principal guiding motive—himself—disarmingly in plain sight at all times. It is a central tenet of politics that you can have money or power, but not the two at the same time. Ayers is a rare exception. He is not shy about showing his wealth—issuing gracious invitations to hunting parties on his estate on Georgia's Flint River; sending Christmas cards that are fatter than most and wrapped in a bow. He has occasionally been known to lease a private jet—unusual among a crowd of strategists-for-hire who are accustomed to Marriotts and economy class."}

CHIP SOMODEVILLA/GETTY IMAGES FROM TOP : Ayers getting sworn in as chief of staff with his wife and triplets watching (TWITTER) ; with Pence after the Senate passed tax reform legislation last December (DREW ANGERER/GETTY IMAGES) When he joined the administration, Ayers' White House financial disclosure attached some hard numbers to his high-roller image. After less than seven years of working as a political consultant and a partner in a media buying firm, Ayers reported a personal net worth between $12 million and just over $54 million. (For context, one leading strategist told me that a top-level consultant could expect to make $1 million in an election year and about a third of that in the off year.) And his business arrangements can be difficult to track. In the 2016 election cycle, Ayers spearheaded the Missouri gubernatorial campaign for Eric Greitens, who is now under indictment for invasion of privacy. In addition to the consulting fee of $220,000 paid to Ayers' firm, he was paid over what appears to be a very similar time period by at least two different entities involved in the race."}
{"original": "Astonishingly, when Ayers entered the White House, he didn't immediately sell his lucrative business, C5 Creative Consulting, as previous administrations would have required. He also obtained a broad waiver permitting him to talk to former clients. His ownership of C5 turned his White House job into a minefield of possible conflicts of interest. As chief of staff to the vice president, Ayers' duties can include advising Pence on which candidates to support—decisions that can have a huge influence on fundraising and, hence, political advertising. In addition, in his private work for the Pence PAC, he is in a position to steer donor dollars into races where the company could potentially benefit. That's staggering, one seasoned Republican operative told me. In an environment where ethical scandals are spilling into public view on a near-daily basis, each seemingly more flagrant than the last, no one paid much attention to Nick Ayers' consulting firm. Ayers himself declined to speak on the record and did not respond to a detailed list of questions for this article. After multiple attempts to clarify the status of Ayers' business, Pence's office sent a statement just as this story was going to press to say that his next financial disclosure in May will reflect the sale of his company. The White House provided no proof that the sale had occurred."}
{"original": "Waiting for so long into his White House tenure to address the issues posed by his ownership of C5 (and seemingly only under pressure) was a characteristic move from Ayers—and one strikingly at odds with the plain-spoken virtue that the vice president seeks to project. But, as is clear to those who have followed Ayers' rapid ascent to the top of his profession, he has made an art form of skillfully navigating the gray areas in electoral politics. And in the process, he has demonstrated that the real danger in our porous, post-Citizens United campaign-finance regime isn't always what's illegal, but what's been made possible."}

{"original": "AYERS GREW UP MODESTLY in Cobb County, Georgia. His father, a landscaper, and his mother, who worked for a laundry equipment company, divorced when he was young. Ayers took summer jobs, including buffing cars, for extra cash. I decided I never wanted to be in a position of anxiety, he once told The Washington Post. I have always been a worrier and planned way ahead. In high school, he told the reporter, he was the cautious one in a crew that ran on the edge of the line—the guy who would organize huge drinking parties but serve as the designated driver. I would say, 'Look, we have to be careful here. We can't let people find out.' In 2001, while he was a freshman at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, Ayers met a reserved senior who would become his close friend and sidekick: Paul Bennecke, the state chairman of the College Republicans. The pair signed on to state senator Sonny Perdue's long-shot campaign for governor. In a matter of days, Ayers was zipping around the state in Perdue's four-seater plane. Perdue's upset victory swept a Republican into the governor's mansion for the first time since Reconstruction—and two very young, very ambitious operatives into the big leagues. Two years later, Ayers was running Perdue's reelection campaign. The 22-year-old gained a reputation for being a shameless self-promoter, a recurring accusation he has never done much to dispel."}

For more stories that"}
{"original": "to our newsletter. SIGN UP Less than two weeks before the election, Ayers did get egg on his face. One night, on his way back to campaign headquarters, he was arrested for driving under the influence. Refusing a breathalyzer test, he admitted to imbibing a Jack Daniels and Diet Coke. (All counts were dropped except one for reckless driving.) A two-part video of the arrest can be found online. It is impressive mainly for the deluge of flattery that the handcuffed Ayers directs at the arresting officer as he is driven to the station. I have a ton of respect for the state patrol, Ayers tells him. At one point he asks brightly, Can we chat politics? In 2006, Perdue was appointed chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Ayers became the RGA's executive director—a spectacular promotion for a 24-year-old with no experience in national politics. Bennecke was the political director. Someone who met Ayers through the RGA remembers him dipping tobacco and partying frequently at the hotspots of D.C. in that era, places like Rhino Bar or Smith Point. For a time, he roomed with Bennecke. In 2005, Ayers had married Perdue's second cousin, Jamie Floyd, although he would tell The Washington Post he was so consumed by his work that the couple didn't really have sex for the first three years of their marriage. My God, they are going to give him whatever he wants."}
{"original": "When Ayers showed up at the RGA, it was a bit of a backwater, mostly a place for parking spare corporate dollars. But it was about to transform into one of the most powerful loopholes in campaign finance law. Under the leadership of Mississippi governor Haley Barbour, who assumed the chairmanship in 2009, the organization took full advantage of its unique legal status. Unlike other major party committees, the RGA and its Democratic counterpart are not subject to regulation by the Federal Election Commission. The only oversight comes via a patchwork of state laws, which are often lax—and in many states, court rulings have made it nearly impossible to regulate the associations at all. This means the governors associations can solicit unlimited donations, unlike the party national committees. Although the RGA and DGA must disclose donors to the IRS, the list is essentially meaningless, since they don't have to provide any information on where the money was spent or which races it was used to influence. As it happened, Barbour took charge at the RGA just before the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision sanctioned unlimited corporate spending in elections, as long as that spending is independent of campaigns. Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, an election law expert and associate professor at Stetson University, argues that both the RGA and DGA are functioning as giant dark money operations. They can basically funnel money to where there is the least enforcement of campaign finance law, she said. Pick your metaphor: daisy chains, Russian dolls, shell game ..."}
{"original": "The 2010 midterms were set to be a huge year for the RGA—Republicans were fielding 37 gubernatorial candidates, including rising stars such as Nikki Haley and Scott Walker. And so Barbour created a club of the country's wealthiest individual conservative donors, many of whom had been lackluster supporters of the RGA in the past. It was Ayers' job to convince them that they could get a better return on their investment through the RGA than any other party machine. In this mission, he could not have had a better tutor than Barbour, whose fundraising prowess is legendary. I think Nick would tell you he learned everything he knows from Haley, said a former RGA colleague, Lauren Lofstrom. She recalled an evening in Chicago when Ayers charmed a clatch of billionaires, including Sam Zell and Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel. Some of the guests actually moved toward the edge of their seats as Ayers talked. At the end I [thought,] 'My God, they are going to give him whatever he asks for,' Lofstrom said. According to Lofstrom, Griffin told Ayers that his talents were being wasted in politics and he should be working for his hedge fund. Nick made people pause for the first time and go, maybe there's more than just federal politics, a former colleague said. On Ayers' watch, the RGA moved vast sums of donor money all around the country. When he joined the organization, its budget for the 2005-2006 election cycle was $43 million."}
{"original": "By the end of the 2010 cycle, the budget had increased to $132 million. As for Ayers, he had amassed a Rolodex that would be the envy of his peers. Someone who knows him well said: I've just watched: He can pick up the phone and call 30 governors, and they'll all take his personal phone call. And he can pick up the phone and call the top 200 donors to give to governors in the country, and they'll all take his phone call. In all, it was an experience totally unlike those of his contemporaries, who were working their way up on candidate campaigns or through other party organs with far greater restrictions on raising and spending money. Barbour told me that Ayers matured beyond his age. When Ayers concluded his term in early 2011, he was being talked about as a successor to Karl Rove. He was expected to follow a well-trodden path: build up his own political consultancy, advise major candidates and help shape Republican politics. And so his friends were baffled when Ayers took a partnership at a media buying firm that was barely known in D.C. Target Enterprises was a company of about 15 people who worked out of an office tower in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. Its founder, a brash New Yorker named David Bienstock, was about as far away as you could get from the Washington establishment. Ayers was seen as a classy guy, said a friend, explaining the consternation at his career move."}
{"original": "And Target wasn't a classy company."}
{"original": "David Bienstock (left) and Adam Stoll, Ayers' former partners at Target Enterprises."}
{"original": "NO ONE HAS EVER MADE A FORTUNE in electoral politics merely by giving sound advice to candidates. The real money is in political advertising. Everybody sees the media budget as the golden ticket, said a senior executive at one of the five largest Republican media buying firms. Even the standard way of doing business is, frankly, dubious. There can be variations on the model, but usually a consultant hired by a campaign or political action committee chooses a creative firm to make its TV ads. The consultant also hires a media buying firm to negotiate with TV stations over distribution. A commission of up to 15 percent of the advertising expense is split in various combinations between the consultant, the creative firm and the media buyer. And this is where the dubiousness comes in: Neither the candidate nor the donors typically have any idea how the split is divided. Often, at the end of the election, the TV station will not have run the exact number of ads the media buyer purchased. So the stations rebate the media buyer, who—in theory—is supposed to return that money to the campaign. But only the media buyer knows the true amount of the rebate, said one veteran creative director. The sheer volume and speed of the transactions can obfuscate a lot of double-dealing. Campaigns are largely forced to trust that the media buyers pay the TV stations the contracted amount for the right ad spots."}
{"original": "Two buyers emphasized to me that they pride themselves on returning leftover funds, suggesting that such scrupulousness may be the exception rather than the rule. It is also not unusual, I was informed by a handful of industry insiders, for the consultant to privately negotiate a fee for bringing the media buyer the business. These sums can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars, far outstripping a consultant's typical monthly retainer of around $15,000 on a gubernatorial or senate race. All of which provides a powerful incentive for the consultant to use the media buyer who will give him the best deal, not the one who will deliver the most effective ads. That's what happens a lot, said one top buyer. Most political campaigns don't conduct even perfunctory oversight of their spending. There is no CFO on any campaign, said the buyer. There is a treasurer. The treasurer's job is to make sure that the reports get filed properly at the FEC. That's it. It's much easier for someone to pull the wool over the eyes of a political client than a consumer client. Until about a decade ago, Target Enterprises hardly had a presence in national political advertising. But in his West Coast milieu, David Bienstock was known as a consummate hustler. A flashy figure, he was the kind of man to carry cash, said a former colleague who remembers him being visited monthly at his offices by a banker who delivered envelopes of bills."}
{"original": "Bienstock, who did not comment for this article, has a taste for lavish real estate. [3] His properties include a Sherman Oaks home previously owned by movie director Brian de Palma and a $5.6 million house in San Diego. He changes cars often and used to drive a gullwing model with doors that opened upward. The former colleague recalls a framed photo in Target's hallway of Bienstock standing next to his favored private plane. He's known as both a charmer and a screamer who sometimes holds court at Shutters on the Beach in Santa Monica, dressed in a black T-shirt and blue jeans. When discussing pitches with colleagues, he talks a lot about the dangle—that is, what the client really wants. He might say, So, the dangle is ... In 2009, Bienstock acquired a right-hand man who could help him break into national politics. Adam Stoll, a former Goldman Sachs executive then in his mid-30s, had run New York governor George Pataki's 2002 reelection campaign. Quiet and preppy, Stoll is Bienstock's outward opposite. Someone who has worked with him remarked to me that he probably showers in his suit. Stoll was also a longtime friend of Ayers, who was then midway through his tenure at the RGA. The RGA had never used Target before 2009. That year, the firm was hired to work on, among other things, the Virginia gubernatorial race—a test run of sorts, said someone involved with discussions between Ayers and Target."}
{"original": "But Bienstock and Stoll wanted a much closer relationship with the RGA for 2010. So they invited Ayers and Bennecke to a retreat at the Wynn hotel in Las Vegas over the weekend of November 20 to cement a deal. The weekend has become legend, said one media consultant. Nobody could figure out why Nick and Paul would even go anywhere with Bienstock. You'd see why if you met him ... [he] makes my skin crawl. One of the items on Saturday's agenda was a talk by Bienstock: Media Buying: The Inside Story … A View from Behind the Curtain. I talked to four people who have heard Target's pitch. Their experiences were not identical, but two consultants gave very similar accounts of someone at Target proposing the following arrangement: Target would charge the campaign a much lower fee than its competitors. The Target representative would go on to explain that the company would later invoice for an amount that represented a payment for how much the firm had saved the campaign—with Target determining what the savings had been. This model might be described as performance-based pay, said an industry insider. A more accurate term, said one person who listened to the pitch, is fucking bullshit. However, most campaigns either lack the expertise to spot the catch in a highly technical pitch or are too focused on winning to closely monitor how their media budgets are spent."}
{"original": "It's much easier for someone to pull the wool over the eyes of a political client than a consumer client, said a veteran buyer in both spaces. Whatever Target's dangle to Ayers and Bennecke was, it seemed to be persuasive. David can be very charismatic, said the former colleague. In 2010, according to IRS filings, Target suddenly became the RGA's biggest vendor, receiving $31 million for buying ads—about 36 percent of the RGA's budget. (The next-highest-paid media buyer was Crossroads Media, which got $7 million.) Bennecke and Target did not respond to questions about Target, its business practices and its relationship with the RGA. I asked Haley Barbour why the RGA had chosen to give Target so much of its business. He told me he could not recall that one firm got an especially large [share] of the media buy."}

{"original": "AYERS HAD ONLY BEEN at Target for a few weeks when he made a startling announcement: He was taking a hiatus. I have prayed deeply about my purpose in life and how best to utilize the talents God has given me, he wrote in an email to friends in April 2011. I wanted my decision to be wholly about how best to serve Him, not what was most politically or financially expedient for my family and me. As He often does in walks of faith, He has called me to a higher purpose. The higher purpose, it turned out, was attempting to get Tim Pawlenty elected president. (After the email was leaked, Ben Smith, then of Politico, noted that Ayers' sounded a bit as though he's the one who will be running.) The Pawlenty campaign was a bust, fizzling in less than three months and somehow racking up a debt of half a million dollars. When I spoke to Pawlenty last fall, however, he told me he doesn't regret hiring Ayers. I think he did a terrific job, he said. The debt, he added, wasn't his fault. It was a campaign that was sort of a start-up operation that didn't have a good insight into how much financial trouble we were in, in real time. I was curious to hear what Pawlenty thought of the fact that his campaign had paid nearly $600,000 for media buys through Target, according to FEC records."}
{"original": "Ayers was not legally required to disclose his relationship with Target to the campaign, but various consultants I talked to argued that it would have been the ethically correct thing to do. Pawlenty paused. That part I wasn't as clear about, he said, as for what his status was relative to Target. After the campaign wound down, Ayers returned to Target and immediately resumed pitching the firm to his political friends. One recalled his firm receiving a classic Bienstock dangle: I've got this great buying company. Doesn't cost you anything. This person actually ran a model using Target's stated methodology and found that it would be more expensive than negotiating with the TV stations directly. And yet in the election cycle immediately following Ayers' departure from the RGA, the organization gave Target at least 63 percent of its media business. [4] IRS filings show that the RGA paid Target more than $18 million in 2012 and a similar sum in 2014. Ayers's influence at the RGA was—and remains—significant. Ayers and his replacement, Phil Cox, were sufficiently close that Ayers would become an investor in Cox's media business. The RGA's general counsel, Michael Adams, would go on to work on personal legal matters for Ayers, according to a person who saw documentation. And many of Ayers' team also stayed on after he left, according to a person who regularly deals with the RGA and remarked on their fierce loyalty to him."}
{"original": "In 2014, when it came time for the RGA to select Cox's successor, it named Ayers' longtime friend, Paul Bennecke. The RGA's reliance on Target would become controversial among consultants—encouraging competition among vendors is what helps to keep prices down. (In response to questions, a spokesperson said the organization has been managed with the utmost integrity.) It's not like sticking your hand in the cookie jar. It's as if he built a penthouse in the cookie jar and had everybody bring him cookies. And Target itself was attracting some scrutiny. Brian Baker is an attorney who runs a PAC affiliated with the Ricketts' family, who are major conservative donors and the owners of the Chicago Cubs. Baker has told three people that in the spring of 2012, he had gone to some effort to check out Target's practices. (Joe Ricketts intended to spend millions on Mitt Romney's presidential campaign and Baker wanted to be sure he was dealing with an honest media buyer, two of the people said.) Based on the accounts of those three people, a clear story emerges. Baker visited a cable station in New England to follow up on some ad buys he'd asked Target to place. This was not a straightforward task. The FCC mandates that every TV station must maintain a public file recording purchased airtime for political ads, but many records are still kept in paper form. It would have looked like a trash can, said one of Baker's confidantes."}
{"original": "According to the sources, Baker discovered a discrepancy between the services Target had promised to deliver and what actually ran on the air. Baker hit the roof, said one friend. Two of the sources recalled that he switched media buying firms. When I asked Baker about this episode, he told me that in no way, shape, or form, was there any irregularity. He added, When I began buying TV, radio and digital ads, Adam [Stoll]—a true pro—was a great help to me. While the groups I run work with a variety of media vendors, we have used Target since 2010 and continue to do to this day. (Stoll and Target did not comment.) One of Baker's confidantes told me, You're going to have a hard time getting people to screw with Pence and Nick Ayers. It was during this period that Ayers started aggressively working on races from multiple angles. He stayed on as a partner at Target, but also advised candidates and outside groups through his company, C5. In 2014, Ayers was working as the lead strategist for Bruce Rauner, the Chicago businessman who had launched a bid for governor of Illinois. Rauner's campaign chose Target as its media firm. By the end of the race, the campaign had paid Target $15 million to make media buys, while C5 received more than $500,000 for its services. These arrangements started to become conspicuously convoluted. In 2014, Target was working for David Perdue's campaign for the U.S. Senate in Georgia."}
{"original": "In that same race, C5 was retained by an outside group supporting Perdue (who is Ayers' distant relation by marriage). Under federal election law, a campaign and outside groups can't coordinate spending on any form of political communication, advertising included. To avoid allegations of coordination, vendors that work with both a campaign and outside groups typically create a firewall ensuring that no knowledge of the campaign's plans, projects, activities or needs is shared. After reporters commented on Ayers' role, he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Target had instituted a firewall. Both Rauner and Perdue won their races, which only served to burnish Ayers' reputation as a Republican wunderkind. But despite all the business he was bringing to Target, Ayers never fully immersed himself in the company's operations. It was very hard to even get Nick on the phone, someone who worked for the firm recalled. If you needed him, you might not be able to find him for two days. By early 2015, Ayers had left his partnership. Yet a relationship of sorts continued. On his White House disclosure form, which spans from 2015 to September 2017, he listed a business partnership with Target. And for every campaign he worked on after leaving the firm, Target served as a media buyer. IN THE RUNUP TO THE 2016 ELECTION, Ayers was busier than ever. His most high-profile assignment was an attempt to rescue Indiana governor Mike Pence's foundering reelection effort. [5] On March 29, 2015, Mike Pence gave an excruciating interview to ABC's George Stephanopoulos."}
{"original": "The Indiana governor repeatedly dodged the question of whether a new bill he'd just signed into law would enable discrimination against gay customers. As activists called for companies to avoid doing business in Indiana, Pence's poll numbers plummeted. Ayers had pitched Pence on Target back in 2011. Pence didn't use the firm, but had warmed to the young operative, not least because he was a fellow evangelical. Ayers is very religious and Mike liked that about him, said a Pence ally. Ayers also spent 2016 talking up a new media arbitrage fund that would purchase TV advertising slots and resell them for a profit to campaigns of both parties, according to two sources pitched on the idea. He used his extensive Rolodex to enlist potential investors, including Texan oil and gas magnate Toby Neugebauer. After Trump won the nomination, Ayers acted as a part-time, unpaid adviser for the Trump campaign but kept pitching the arbitrage fund. He assumed Trump was going to lose, said someone he confided in at the time. So he hedged himself. But perhaps his most ambitious venture was an effort to create his own political star—a candidate with the potential to one day go all the way to the White House. Eric Greitens, a candidate for governor of Missouri, was a GOP consultant's dream. The 41-year-old was an intensely ambitious, chisel-jawed former Navy SEAL and Rhodes scholar turned best-selling author. [6] He reserved the domain name EricGreitensFor"}
{"original": "President.com when he was only 34 years old. He had also been a lifelong Democrat until shortly before he entered the GOP primary. Greitens championed transparency in campaign finance. We've already seen other candidates set up these secretive super PACs where they don't take any responsibility for what they're funding, he said in a radio interview. Because that's how the game has always been played. After Ayers signed on as the campaign's lead strategist in the summer of 2015, his influence quickly became visible. Eric was a chalkboard, a very, very blank, black chalkboard. And Nick wrote in white chalk on the chalkboard whatever he wanted, said a former member of the campaign who'd observed them together. Greitens replaced his campaign manager with a 20-year-old from Georgia named Austin Chambers. A Republican consultant described Chambers to me as Ayers' place holder. Greitens with a semi-automatic weapon in one of his notorious campaign ads. Under Chambers' watch, the money flowed to some familiar names. Target was ultimately paid $21 million to buy media for the Greitens campaign. The digital team was replaced by a Target offshoot called BASK (the A stands for Ayers). And a C5 client called Something Else Strategies, a creative firm, was enlisted to produce ads, including one of Greitens firing a machine gun at Obama's Democrat machine. Meanwhile, Ayers talked up Greitens at RGA meetings and introduced him around to donors. We all thought Greitens was a golden boy, the Pence ally told me."}
{"original": "The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, however, would question Greitens' oddly national fundraising effort, which included sizable donations from people like Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and the now-disgraced Silicon Valley venture capitalist Michael Goguen: Why would scores of business tycoons from Manhattan to Silicon Valley lavish contributions … on a political novice running in a primary election for governor of a Midwestern state where none of them live? Ayers would later give The Missouri Times an insight into the campaign's strategy. It was important for Greitens not to peak early, he explained, or the other three contenders would have too much time to tear him down. As it happened, a dark money-funded super PAC would play a useful role. In the early summer of 2016, LG PAC started airing negative ads against two candidates in the GOP primary, seemingly on behalf of a third: Peter Kinder, the state's sitting lieutenant governor, or LG. But LG PAC had nothing to do with Kinder. Near the end of the primary, it would emerge that the group was actually backing Greitens. It was an extremely clever ploy. By giving the impression that Kinder was the source of the attacks, LG PAC made Kinder look sleazy. [7] Kinder has said he did not purchase any negative advertising. It also allowed Greitens to maintain a lower profile, not to mention his image as a campaign finance crusader. Kinder told people the episode was the dirtiest political trick he'd witnessed in his career."}
{"original": "After the negative ads started airing, reporters unearthed video footage that captured Greitens talking with the LG PAC treasurer, Hank Monsees, at a May 19 campaign event. People started raising the possibility of illegal coordination. A photograph posted on Facebook showed Monsees on a phone in Greitens' war room, apparently making calls for the campaign. (Monsees told The Associated Press that he was sitting down by the phones because he has a bad back. Asked why he had a phone to his ear in the photo, he said, I may have played with the phones or something, but I made no calls.) The chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party filed a complaint with the state ethics commission, which was dismissed. The Ethics Commission is formed to be weak and able to do very little, and in this case they did very little, said Scott Faughn, the publisher of The Missouri Times and a former politician. After Greitens won easily, the controversy over dark money died down. On January 9, 2017, he was sworn in with Ayers and Chambers at his side. Almost a year later, however, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group, discovered a financial connection between LG PAC and Ayers. LG PAC's sole funder was Freedom Frontier, a dark money nonprofit based outside Missouri that appears to have operated almost exclusively in the Greitens race that election cycle."}
{"original": "On Ayers' White House disclosure form, Freedom Frontier is listed as a client of C5 that he had personally worked for, during a very similar time frame. In national races governed by the Federal Election Commission, and in most states, it would be illegal for a campaign to coordinate with outside groups on ads. In Missouri, however, the laws on coordination are less explicit. Freedom Frontier is no small-time advocacy outfit. It is part of an influential network of dark money groups that funnels donor money into elections nationwide and is clustered around an Ohio lawyer named David Langdon. The network, by design, defies easy explanation—there are nonprofits that fund PACs that fund campaigns, a constellation of blandly named entities linked by the same few legal representatives. But what is clear is that such groups have become an invaluable weapon in elections. They enable candidates to keep a respectable distance from negative ads, which voters dislike. In addition, nonprofits like Freedom Frontier—so-called 501(c)(4)s—are permitted to conceal the identity of donors. Their primary purpose is supposed to be issue-oriented, rather than political, but violations are hard to prove and rarely penalized. Paul Ryan, the vice president of policy and litigation at Common Cause, a government accountability think tank, said that laws on both the state and federal level have not caught up with the explosion of dark money groups after Citizens United. Regulations on coordination, he said, are wholly inadequate."}
{"original": "Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, the election law expert, added, People using these opaque nonprofits are sort of making a calculated risk that no election regulator will stand in and stop them. Ayers' ties to the Langdon network go back years. [8] In 2012, C5 was paid to raise funds for two nonprofits in the Langdon network: Citizens for a Working America (CWA) and the Government Integrity Fund (GIF). Between 2015 and 2016, C5 received $60,000 from a super PAC called Maryland USA, which paid Langdon's law firm over the same period. Then, in 2016, a super PAC called SEALS for Truth donated nearly $2 million to the Greitens gubernatorial campaign, on which Ayers was the strategist. At the time this was a record-breaking donation in Missouri. The super PAC's only funder was a nonprofit called American Policy Coalition, whose secretary is Langdon. It would be considered highly unusual for a consultant of his caliber to simultaneously work on a campaign and for a dark money group supporting that campaign. One would think Ayers had enough business not to need income from both a campaign and the dark money group doing its independent expenditures, said former Missouri state senator Jeff Smith, who has the dubious distinction of being perhaps the only person in the state to do prison time for coordination with an independent group. Being paid by both entities certainly raises questions around coordination."}
{"original": "The link between Ayers and Freedom Frontier is precisely the kind of association that is nearly impossible to detect in real time under current campaign finance laws. The only reason CREW was able to make the connection was because Ayers had to list C5's clients on his White House financial disclosure—which chief investigator Matt Corley likened to a light being shined in the dark. And for once, this was a discovery that would not simply fade away."}

Under its terms, some $70,000 of Florida taxpayer money likely would have gone to Trump National Doral. Nonprofit groups, local governments and others attending the event that had been set for late May likely would have spent an additional $600,000."}
{"original": "If the state of Florida is paying money to the business that the president continues to own and profit from, then it would appear to be a pretty clear violation of the Constitution's domestic emoluments clause, said Jordan Libowitz with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group that has criticized federal payments flowing to Trump since he took office three years ago. This isn't some obscure local law, this is literally the Constitution. Everyone needs to follow it. A state's highest law enforcement official should know better."}

{"original": "Her assertion, however, is not correct. Trump Doral is owned by the Trump Organization, which in turn is owned by a revocable trust Trump set up just before taking office in 2017. Trump is the sole beneficiary of that trust, meaning he is the only one who reaps the profits from all of Trump Organization's income streams, including his various golf courses, his Mar-a-Lago country club in Palm Beach and Trump Tower in Manhattan."}
{"original": "Under the terms of the contract, obtained by the Democratic group American Bridge under Florida's public records laws, the state Attorney General's office had agreed to rent an average of 250 rooms at Doral each night for six nights, at a cost of $129 per night for the 2020 National Conference on Preventing Crime."}
{"original": "Meeting rooms are included in the contract, but meals are not — meaning the 1,500 expected guests would likely spend close to $100 per day each for food at the resort's restaurants."}

{"original": "Cassedy said that bids were solicited and accepted by the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, and that Moody's office chose the lowest bidder, which was Trump Doral. She did not respond, despite repeated queries, why the resort was allowed to bid at all, given its ownership and the U.S. Constitution's prohibition."}
{"original": "This would be first time since Trump bought the resort in 2012 that that conference would be held there. Previous conferences were held in Tampa, Jacksonville, Orlando and Miami — none at a Trump property."}
{"original": "Doral, like most of Trump's properties with the exception of Mar-a-Lago, his golf club in Bedminster and his hotel a few blocks from the White House, has reportedly suffered financially since Trump took office because of his unpopularity with most Americans."}

His latest financial disclosure statement claims he earned $75,962,848 from Mar-a-Lago in calendar year 2018, but Trump appears to conflate net profit with gross revenues, based on a HuffPost analysis of figures he has filed on the document compared to other official filings."}
{"original": "During the Republican National Committee meeting there in 2018, the property appeared to be skimping on maintenance costs. At least one of the guest buildings smelled of mildew, as did its guest rooms, while the restaurant on the lower floor in the main lodge had a mustiness mixed with the fraternity house odor of spilled alcohol."}
{"original": "Nearly two years later, at this January's RNC meeting, the mustiness appears to remain, at least in some areas. The downstairs restaurant, however, seems to have eliminated the stale beer odor."}
{"original": "Why do Republicans hate America? No, really. It's not a rhetorical question. Since consolidating its power in January 2017, the GOP has systematically set out to dismantle the economic strength of this nation, coddle predators, shield traitors, attack those who are working, and strip protections from the most vulnerable. Are these the actions of a party that loves the nation it has sworn to serve?"}
{"original": "Consider the GOP's attempts over the last year to blow up the U.S. economy and make life harder for its constituents. The Republicans' first try at demolishing the economy as if it were nothing but an old abandoned building was their reckless attempt to destroy the Affordable Care Act, which housed and protected millions of American citizens. The GOP's congressional leaders held no hearings, refused to even listen to expert testimony and were utterly unconcerned about the impact that dismantling a key component of the nation's health care system would have on one-sixth of the American economy."}
{"original": "When the button jammed on that detonator, Republicans tried another, more powerful type of explosive, and this one threatens to be much more successful. In December, they passed a tax bill that adds an estimated $1.5 trillion to the deficit — with no significant investment in infrastructure, education or health care to show for it. And now, as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) made clear, when the GOP-fueled deficit balloons, they're coming after the retirement and medical social programs that he has demeaned and mislabeled as entitlements. Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid, however, are hard-earned benefits funded, in large part, out of our paychecks. They provide much needed support to the elderly, the infirmed and those with disabilities."}
{"original": "For America's senior population alone, the Republicans' assault on the safety net is going to be destabilizing and, in many cases, lethal. Currently, 9 out of 10 Americans over 65 receive Social Security. Forty-nine million are on Medicare, estimated to increase to 64 million by 2020. Nearly one-third will require nursing home care, which costs three times the annual income of those over 65. Imagine what an aging America will look like just a few years into the future with no Social Security, no Medicare and no Medicaid."}
{"original": "Not satisfied with their own multi-pronged attack on the social fabric and safety net of the nation they claim to love, the Republicans have also let a foreign government attack the United States. Instead of repelling the invaders, strengthening our defenses and ferreting out the collaborators, the GOP has acted more like a fifth column shielding the saboteurs. In the fall of 2016, when confronted with the reports from 17 agencies in the intelligence community about Russian interference in the 2016 election, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) threatened then-President Barack Obama with partisan nuclear destruction and left the nation vulnerable to Russian leader Vladimir Putin's machinations. In March 2017, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) sabotaged his own committee's investigation into Russian interference, and for that unconscionable act, Ryan rewarded him by threatening to allow contempt of Congress proceedings against the Department of Justice unless Nunes could review the FBI files on the case. In January 2018, Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) sent a letter to the DOJ demanding an investigation of former U.K. intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who was so alarmed by what he was uncovering that he alerted the FBI that the Russians had cultivated a Trojan Horse in the form of Donald Trump. This was a national security issue, Steele said. For having more concern about the United States than the Americans involved had shown, the Republicans tried to sic the FBI on him."}
{"original": "Consider the myriad other ways that the Republicans have demonstrated their destructive contempt for America. They removed protections for students against predatory lenders and financially hobbled the capacity of the next generation of leaders to actually engage in anything but mere survival. In August 2017, they sheared off millions of acres from public parks and seem ready to sell them to the highest bidder."}
{"original": "The Republicans have also lit a short fuse under America's soft power ― our ideas, aspirations and strivings ― that makes the nation a world leader and not just any other one in the constellation. It only took a year under the GOP's stranglehold for the global respect in which the U.S. was held to plummet from No. 1 to No. 6 in a global reputation survey. Within that short space of time, the Republicans have abdicated America's international leadership on climate change; targeted, harassed, banned and deported immigrants of color with reckless abandon; and removed human rights and democracy as a goals of U.S. foreign policy."}
{"original": "The Republicans wear their patriotism and love of country like a badge of honor, but they have demonstrated neither. Instead, they have been contemptuous and complicit. They seem determined to recreate the civil rights and deregulated financial sector wilderness of the 1920s; a world where millions of American citizens could not vote, where women were separate and unequal and where Wall Street gambled so recklessly that the global economy imploded and ushered in more than a decade of double-digit unemployment and the Great Depression. That desire to strip us bare once again has revealed a deep, unrelenting disdain for this nation ― for its people, its hopes, its ideas, its lands and its institutions. Their lies about love of country put them in power. Their hatred ― if we recognize it for what it is ― will put them out."}

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) mounted a public push for a second round of $1,200 payments ― Americans received $1,200 checks from the CARES Act in March ― along with an additional $500 for every child. Their pressure campaign, backed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, helped ensure the addition of a $600 stimulus in the bill that Congress passed shortly before Christmas."}
{"original": "After President Donald Trump insisted at the last minute that a relief bill provide $2,000 checks, House Democrats immediately passed an amendment increasing the stimulus payment by $1,400 that then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blocked in the Senate. The issue would end up becoming a critical political cudgel for Warnock and Ossoff, the victorious Georgia Senate Democrats, to wield against their Republican opponents."}
{"original": "Running against a Republican Senate blocking popular relief payments was a powerful message, Shahid said. The basic multiracial populist approach of their campaigns is a great roadmap for Democrats across the ideological spectrum."}
{"original": "Beyond immediate COVID-19 relief, progressive divergences from Biden are likely to grow."}
{"original": "One reason is that Congress is limited to one budget reconciliation bill per fiscal year, restricting how much legislation it can pass with a simple majority and heightening competition for what takes precedence. Because Congress has not yet used a budget reconciliation bill in Fiscal Year 2021, which began in October, it can pass one such bill for FY2021 and another such bill for FY2022."}
{"original": "Green suggested that Biden use one of the reconciliation bills to pass the $2-trillion clean energy jobs plan, which the PCCC co-founder called the centerpiece of Biden's 'Build Back Better' agenda."}
{"original": "We should raise [the tax rates] because rich people should have less wealth and power. Marshall Steinbaum, economist, University of Utah"}
{"original": "Marshall Steinbaum, a progressive economist at the University of Utah, favors using one of the reconciliation bills to repeal all of the Trump tax cuts. Trump's 2017 tax cut bill lowered personal income tax rates, doubled the exemption for the estate tax on the assets of the super-rich and lowered the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%."}
{"original": "Corporations' decision to spend much of their tax savings on massive payouts to shareholders undercuts the idea that the tax cuts spur economic investment, according to Steinbaum."}
{"original": "The corporate tax rate is an effective tax on the people who own profitable corporations, which is to say, rich people, he said. We should raise [the tax rates] because rich people should have less wealth and power."}
{"original": "Thus far though, congressional Democrats have shown the most interest in removing the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, which mainly affects upper-middle-class homeowners in blue states. Biden has already promised not to raise taxes on households earning less than $400,000, and wants to restore the corporate tax rate to 28%, not its pre-Trump level of 35%."}
{"original": "Biden is more likely to take Steinbaum up on a more modest suggestion: that he use the Congressional Review Act, a law enabling passage of some regulatory changes with a simple majority, to rapidly undo the Trump administration's evisceration of Obama-era rules protecting workers and the environment."}
{"original": "When it comes to legislative priorities neither eligible for either budget reconciliation, nor the Congressional Review Act, Democrats are constrained by the threat of a Republican filibuster."}
{"original": "That makes the prospects for passing democracy reforms, another top progressive priority, seem bleak. Democracy reform refers to political process changes ranging from the adoption of public campaign financing and an end to partisan gerrymandering, which House Democrats have already approved, to more ambitious goals like bestowing statehood on the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico."}
{"original": "One process change that would create room for additional reforms would be the abolition of the filibuster, which only requires a simple Senate majority vote. Manchin already flatly declared his opposition to abolishing the filibuster after the November election."}
{"original": "But progressives want Biden, who has stopped short of outright opposition to the move, to press the matter with Manchin and other reluctant moderates."}
{"original": "Shahid of the Justice Democrats envisions the possibility of winning Manchin over with giveaways directed to West Virginia, where 16% of people live in poverty."}
{"original": "You can imagine that there might be something like the 'Cornhusker Kickback' ― or the 'Coal Miner's Kickback' in this instance, for Joe Manchin, said Shahid. (The Cornhusker Kickback was the nickname for a short-lived backroom deal that then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) cut with then-Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) in 2009 to secure Nelson's support for the Affordable Care Act.)"}
{"original": "Green predicted that Senate Republicans' excessive use of the filibuster against popular legislative priorities might eventually soften Manchin's opposition to getting rid of the tool ― or at least, dramatically curtailing its use."}
{"original": "Joe Manchin might not support filibuster reform on Day One, but if Republicans try to obstruct coronavirus relief on Week 3, he might support filibuster reform on Week 4, Green said. Make it less of a process issue and more of a substance issue. Give Republicans a rope to hang themselves with."}
{"original": "Candria Gray and her two children live in Worcester, Massachusetts, where they rely on city buses to get nearly everywhere: college classes, elementary school, the pediatrician's office. By 2017, when the Worcester Regional Transit Authority raised fares from $1.50 per ride to $1.75, Gray was spending as much as $12 a day on transit — a good chunk of her budget as a single mom. And the increased fare was not accompanied by improved service."}
{"original": "It's not just the cost, it's the waiting, Gray said. Nothing is changing, so why are we paying more? Some of her neighbors bought cars, she said, figuring that if transportation was going to be expensive, at least it could be reliable, too."}
{"original": "Gray, however, doubled down on public transit, helping to form a coalition to fight for better, more affordable bus service in New England's second-largest city. Now, they are on the cusp of a major victory."}
{"original": "In January, after the Worcester Regional Research Bureau, a local think tank, proposed the idea, the city council declared its support for eliminating fares altogether. It's a move that Gray and other local advocates believe will not only ease the financial burden on riders but also increase the number of people who choose to take transit, ultimately touching off a virtuous cycle that will lead to better bus service and fewer cars on the road."}
{"original": "SeanPavonePhoto via Getty Images Worcester at rush hour. Candria Gray has been fighting for a better public transit system in the Massachusetts city."}
{"original": "I know people who would love to give up their cars, Gray said. If we can increase ridership, we can push for the system to improve."}
{"original": "Free transit might seem far-fetched to riders who have long taken the farebox for granted, but more and more cities in the United States and around the world are now exploring the possibility."}
{"original": "Questions remain, including how to make up the lost revenue and if free transit even makes sense without simultaneous improvements in frequency and reliability. But if mobility is a human right, as many have argued, then this radical move may be a necessary step toward a world where everyone has equal access to jobs, services and recreation. Free rides could also prove a powerful tool against climate change if they can tempt people who would otherwise drive to try a greener mode of transportation."}
{"original": "The communities testing or considering free transit are diverse, ranging from major metropolises to small towns and from blue-collar to affluent. Just an hour's drive from Worcester is Lawrence, Massachusetts, a post-industrial city with a large immigrant population. It used a municipal budget surplus to make some bus service free on a trial basis last fall, and the city has seen ridership go up 20%."}
{"original": "In December, city council members in Kansas City, Missouri, passed a resolution that could make this municipality of 490,000 people the largest in the U.S. to eliminate bus fare. Mayor Quinton Lucas said he hopes the scheme, which the city estimates will cost $8 million, can help build up a culture of bus riding."}
{"original": "AP Photo/Orlin Wagner A bus in Kansas City, Missouri. In December 2019, a resolution was passed to eliminate bus fares across the city."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Olympia, Washington, went zero-fare in January, after the city calculated that the cost of upgrading fare collection systems would outweigh total ticket revenue."}
{"original": "Across the Atlantic, transit will be free throughout Luxembourg starting in March, as it already is in a few dozen municipalities in France and Poland. Tallinn, Estonia's largest city, has offered free transit for residents since 2013, and in 2018 the country added free intercity buses."}
{"original": "The equity impact of a free ride is obvious: Beyond a few big cities, it's the most marginalized people who are least likely to own cars and thus rely most on transit. And for those who count on it, transit is at least as vital as other services that cities are expected to fund entirely through tax revenue, from parks and libraries to schools and police forces."}
{"original": "All of those services were started in the private sector, and then at different moments we had a public conversation and we decided to make it public, said Jason Prince, an urban planner and professor at Concordia University in Montreal."}
{"original": "RAIGO PAJULA/AFP via Getty Images Buses driving across Tallinn, Estonia. On Jan. 1, 2013, the city became the first capital in the European Union to give its residents free public transport."}
{"original": "For the most part, only in the realm of transit — formerly the province of private trolley companies, bus operators and railways — did fees carry over when municipalities took on the job."}
{"original": "Why? The short answer is politics, said Prince, who co-edited 2018's Free Public Transit: And Why We Don't Pay to Ride Elevators, a compendium of case studies and policy analyses from transit researchers around the world. Unfortunately, rich people tend to have more political power. While transit systems are diverse at the local level, each with its own funding ratio and unique challenges, it remains the case everywhere that since the dawn of the automotive era the rich are far less likely to ride the bus."}
{"original": "Climate change, however, may finally tip that political calculation. In the United States, according to federal government data, transportation is responsible for 29% of greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars and light trucks emitting 59% of that. Putting a dent in those figures will require public transit to become more attractive than driving, and given the cost of fueling, parking and maintaining an automobile, the word free could have a certain appeal."}
{"original": "There is a climate catastrophe unfolding right in front of our eyes, said Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, who has called for free transit in her city (with lost revenue perhaps to be covered by her proposed Amazon tax on big businesses)."}
{"original": "The vast majority of people here are very clear on this, she said, citing the findings of regular Seattle Department of Transportation surveys, which show environmental concerns to be a priority for residents. Our transit system has been gutted and fares have gone up, and despite all that ridership has expanded dramatically. I have no doubt that if we made transit free, use would rise even further. It would be a big part of achieving a Green New Deal for our region."}
{"original": "Free transit is also a racial justice issue. Those arrested for fare evasion are more likely to be people of color ― more than 90% of fare evasion arrests last year in New York City, for example. The offense is often treated as criminal, in contrast to the civil penalties enacted against drivers for speeding and parking infractions."}
{"original": "There are people who can't afford to use transit and get on anyway and then are pursued by the police, said Joshua Malloy, a community organizer and transit advocate in Pittsburgh. It's an introduction to the criminal justice system that we think we could do without."}
{"original": "Despite growing enthusiasm for making transit free to ride, the potential impacts are less clear. One open question is how to compensate for the lost revenue."}
{"original": "Fares sometimes amount to only a small fraction of a system's funding — 14%, or about $3 million, in Worcester — which means lost revenues can often be made up for with federal and state grants, budget reallocations or special taxes. France uses a payroll tax on businesses to support urban and regional transit systems, allowing some of them to offer free rides. In the U.S., free transit in some college towns is made possible by a subsidy from the local university."}
{"original": "Other systems rely on the farebox. New York area transit users cover more than a third of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's $17 billion budget, paying as much as $2.75 for a single ride on the subway or local bus and $6.75 for express buses."}
{"original": "Tashka via Getty Images Canal Street station in the New York City subway system."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, some experts say there is not enough evidence that free transit can persuade people to leave their cars at home."}
{"original": "Increased ridership usually comes from people who would have walked or might not have made the trip otherwise, said Rosalie Ray, a Ph.D. student in urban planning at New York's Columbia University who has studied the issue. While she supports the idea of free transit, she noted that previous experiments in U.S. cities have had mixed results."}
{"original": "In the 1970s, Trenton, New Jersey, and Denver, Colorado, used federal grants to make some bus routes free during off-peak times. While ridership did increase by about 15% overall (and 45% during off-peak times), there was no appreciable reduction in auto traffic, according to a 1982 study, and the schemes were abandoned."}
{"original": "It's important to make a distinction between increasing ridership and getting people out of their cars, Ray said. It has to work in tandem with other efforts to improve the transit system — on its own, it doesn't really help reduce car trips."}
{"original": "A prime example of combined strategies was used in Bologna, Italy, which during a period under local communist rule in the 1970s made transit free at peak times, while banning private cars on 75% of its streets. Two years later, daily traffic had fallen by 20%. (Despite the program's success on that front at least, the free rides didn't last.)"}
{"original": "Meanwhile, in Tallinn, a 2016 report found that three years after free transit was implemented in the Estonian capital, ridership was up. But that study also found evidence of more cars on the road. By 2019, however, after bus lanes replaced more car lanes and the city hiked the price of on-street parking, the number of private vehicles in the central city was down 10%."}
{"original": "That carrot-and-stick approach may be a tall order in the United States, where being able to drive a car anywhere Americans want to go feels like a birthright. Still, New York last fall removed private cars from most of Manhattan's 14th Street, a major crosstown bus route, and San Francisco last month banned cars on Market Street, its main thoroughfare. These moves have created pain points for some commuters, which might be eased by eliminating fares on the buses that now run more smoothly along those routes, unimpeded by automobile traffic."}
{"original": "uschools via Getty Images San Francisco at night, with Market Street lit up. Private cars are now banned on the thoroughfare."}
{"original": "That sort of post-car future remains a long way off for Candria Gray and her Worcester neighbors. Ending fare collection is only a first step, Gray said. Worcester will also have to revise bus routes, increase frequency and improve infrastructure if the city is going to achieve transportation equity and offer a public system that's as appealing as the private car."}
{"original": "But steps forward do count. For Gray, a college student, transit advocacy has become the equivalent of a part-time job, and seeing her hard work pay off in the form of no fares will provide motivation to continue the campaign."}
{"original": "I believe that the demand is there, Gray said. Other cities have good transit. We should, too!"}

{"original": "White evangelical Protestants have long been some of President Donald Trump's most reliable supporters. They've remained loyal to him through allegations of sexual assault, racism and corruption ― driven in large part by his appointment of conservative judges and his defense of religious liberty issues that evangelicals hold dear. But a new survey shows small fissures in what is otherwise a rock-solid, symbiotic relationship."}
{"original": "A survey published by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research on Thursday affirmed what other researchers have long observed about white evangelicals: that they are unique among America's religious groups because of how strongly they support Trump."}
{"original": "However, the poll also suggested that there are a few policy areas ― taxing the wealthy, helping the poor, regulating carbon dioxide emissions and separating children from their parents at the border ― where white evangelicals' support for the Trump administration's goals appears to be tepid at best."}
{"original": "For example, the survey found that 59% of white evangelicals favored regulating the amount of carbon dioxide that power and industrial plants can emit. This is far lower than the number of Americans in general who support regulating carbon dioxide emissions (70%). But it's still a significant percentage for this particular religious group ― especially given the fact that the Trump administration has rolled back Obama-era federal regulations that sought to push energy companies toward renewable sources. Trump is also withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, an international treaty that seeks to fight climate change by curbing greenhouse gas emissions."}
{"original": "Over half of white evangelical Christians (56%) supported increasing taxes on wealthy Americans. Trump's 2017 tax overhaul gave middle-class taxpayers a small tax cut, but wealthier households were the prime beneficiaries."}
{"original": "A majority of white evangelicals also favored increasing government assistance for poor Americans, such as unemployment benefits, health insurance and food assistance (50%). About 62% of all the adults surveyed said the same. However, the Trump administration has proposed greater eligibility restrictions for a range of public benefits, including food stamps and Medicaid."}
{"original": "Most white evangelicals opposed policies that separate children from their parents when the parents are detained for entering the country illegally (54%). About 67% of all Americans surveyed said the same. The Trump administration's zero tolerance border enforcement policy, implemented during the spring of 2018, attracted criticism from prominent evangelical voices, including Franklin Graham, one of Trump's top evangelical allies. The American Civil Liberties Union has claimed that family separations have taken place even after Trump signed an executive order to end the policy in June 2018."}
{"original": "JIM WATSON via Getty Images President Donald Trump still receives strong support from white evangelicals -- 79% approved of his job performance in December."}
{"original": "Ultimately, it doesn't appear that these disagreements over policy goals are strong enough to sway white evangelicals' support for Trump. About 79% of white evangelicals approved of his job performance, while 60% of all Americans disapproved."}
{"original": "Due to an insufficient sample size, the AP-NORC survey was not able to separate out the views of non-white evangelicals. But among non-white Protestants in general, about 75% said they disapproved of Trump's job performance."}
{"original": "Last month, a popular evangelical magazine, Christianity Today, published an editorial calling for Trump to be removed from office, claiming that the House impeachment hearings illuminated the president's moral deficiencies for all to see. Its writer, the magazine's retiring editor-in-chief, Mark Galli, told The New York Times that he's received a positive response from evangelicals who felt alone in their disapproval of Trump."}
{"original": "But the viral piece also sparked strong backlash from Trump's evangelical allies. In a letter, a group of nearly 200 evangelical leaders condemned the editorial as offensive."}
{"original": "After its publication, the Trump campaign announced that it was starting a new coalition, Evangelicals for Trump, to unite evangelical supporters of the president. Trump is scheduled to speak at a South Florida megachurch on Friday afternoon to launch the coalition."}
{"original": "The AP-NORC poll was based on web, landline and cellphone interviews in early December with 1,053 participants across the country. The overall margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points."}

{"original": "Leading up to the federal government's 2017 budget, there was speculation about an increase in the tax on capital gains. The current tax exemption is disproportionately beneficial to the wealthy, and it has little in the way of general economic benefits."}
{"original": "Only half the value of capital gains is currently taxed. This costs $5 billion in annual tax revenue just for the federal government (and more for the provinces). About 50 per cent of the tax saving goes to the top one per cent of income earners, who earn the bulk of capital gains."}
{"original": "Nothing was done in this year's budget, but an increase in capital gains tax may still come in the future. In his speech, Finance Minister Morneau declared that going forward, we will close loopholes that result in unfair tax advantages for some at the expense of others. We will eliminate inefficient tax measures, especially those that disproportionately benefit the wealthy."}
{"original": "Proponents make two arguments in favour of the exemption for capital gains, but neither succeeds in justifying this tax giveaway."}
{"original": "One claim is that it encourages risk taking and investment. In fact, much of it goes to people who make money by speculation in real estate or foreign stock markets, neither of which is beneficial to the Canadian economy."}
{"original": "Capital gains tax is generally levied based on where you live, not where you invest. Therefore, the capital gains tax charged by the Canadian government has little effect on Canada's ability to compete for capital from foreign investors. A foreign investor who invests in Canadian companies listed on stock markets does not pay Canadian capital gains tax. A lower capital gains tax may be justified for investments in small, new enterprises that are financed locally. Those may deserve some special treatment, but it does not justify an across-the-board exemption."}
{"original": "The other argument for exempting capital gains is inflation. Some of the increase in the price of assets is due to general inflation, and it would be unfair to tax it. That is true, but the current regime is not a good way to deal with it. A capital gain earned from a thirty day speculation gets the same treatment as a long-term investment that has been held for thirty years. That is not fair to the long-term investor, who may in fact have no real capital gain at all once inflation is taken into account."}
{"original": "The cost in foregone tax revenue amounts to tens of billions of dollars per year."}
{"original": "The proper approach is to adjust the gains for inflation. Charge tax on the real increase, after inflation has been factored out."}
{"original": "Indexing to remove the effects of inflation before capital gains are calculated would be an important reform if the government goes ahead with an increase in the capital gains inclusion rate. Otherwise, it would lead to an unfair situation where people who have held property for a long time are taxed on illusory capital gains due to inflation. This is particularly significant when a person dies. At that time, the tax code deems all his property to have been sold, and capital gains tax has to be paid on it. This is a hazard for the middle class. The wealthy have access to tax planning tools such as trusts and estate freezes that help them avoid tax when they die."}
{"original": "The federal government has set up an expert panel to review a range of tax expenditures. The cost in foregone tax revenue amounts to tens of billions of dollars per year. Curtailing inefficient tax expenditures would free up money for spending on infrastructure, and for balanced reductions in the general tax rate, as I suggested in a recent paper for the Mowat Centre for Policy Innovation at the University of Toronto. It may not be politically easy, but it is the best way to significantly improve Canada's economy."}

{"original": "We all start a new year off optimistically, but too often we fall back into our old routines because our goals just weren't realistic. This year, I challenge you to add a simple resolution that won't take much time, but will have a significant impact on children across the country: Help me correct the misperceptions about foster care adoption."}
{"original": "The foster care system provides an indispensable refuge for the more than 400,000 children who've been removed from unsafe homes, abusive parents, and other unhealthy environments, more than 100,000 of whom are waiting to be adopted. But foster care isn't meant to be a permanent place for these children. Unfortunately, for some people who could provide loving and supportive homes as foster or adoptive parents to deserving children, a number of common myths and inaccuracies can make the prospect of foster care adoption more intimidating than it should be. We all have a role we can play to help correct these misperceptions and make foster care adoption less daunting."}
{"original": "So as we gather with friends and family during the new year, let's take a minute to correct some of these common misperceptions. You never know the lives it may change."}
{"original": "1.) Children end up in foster care because of their own juvenile delinquency."}
{"original": "Nearly half of Americans incorrectly believe that children end up in foster care because of their own juvenile delinquency - that they're not adopted because they're too bad or troublesome to deserve a loving family. In actuality, these children enter the system due to parental abuse or neglect, not through any fault of their own."}
{"original": "And for the thousands of children who age out of foster care every year, they're more likely to continue to face hardship, such as homelessness, difficulty paying bills or pregnancy at a young age. These children are also less likely to graduate from college, which has a lasting negative economic impact on their lives."}
{"original": "However, their greatest loss is missing out on a family who helps support them through tough times and who guides them as they grow. No child is unadoptable, they just aren't adopted. These children - whether they're 18 months old or 18 years old - all need loving and supportive families."}
{"original": "2.) Adoptive parents need to be heterosexual, married couples."}
{"original": "Families who adopt are as unique and diverse as the children in their care, and children in foster care don't need to wait for some specific notion of family. Families come in all shapes and sizes, with 28 percent of adoptive children living in single parent homes. You don't need to own your own home, have children already, be young, wealthy, or a stay-at-home parent. These children simply need loving individuals in their lives who are willing to meet the challenges of parenting, and are willing to make a lifetime commitment to caring for and nurturing them."}
{"original": "3.) Adoptive parents need to be under 50 years old."}
{"original": "There is no ideal age to become an adoptive parent. Almost one in four adopted children live with a parent who is 55 years or older. It doesn't matter if adoptive parents already have children, or have never had children. What matters is their willingness to commit to parenthood."}
{"original": "4.) A child's biological parent can reclaim them."}
{"original": "Almost half of people considering foster care adoption incorrectly believe that a child's biological parent can regain custody post-adoption. Biological parents have no way of regaining custody of a child once their parental rights are terminated. Adoptive parents have the same rights and responsibilities and protections as parents whose children were born to them. This also means children who have been adopted have all the emotional, social, legal, and familial benefits of biological children."}
{"original": "5.) Foster care adoption is expensive."}
{"original": "Foster care adoption is not expensive; in fact, it can cost little to nothing. Foster care adoption costs can range from $0 to $2,500, depending on the type of adoption; the agency through which you work; the state in which you adopt; travel fees; and attorney fees. While you do need to be financially stable to adopt, you do not need to be wealthy. Subsidies are often available when adopting, there are adoption tax benefits, and many employers also offer adoption benefits."}
{"original": "Children in foster care aren't unadoptable, they just aren't adopted. Every one of us can work to end the myth that some children are too troublesome to deserve a family, by helping correct some of these misperceptions that our friends, family and community members may have about foster care adoption."}
{"original": "This year, make the resolution to correct the myths about foster care adoption. A simple conversation could be all that it takes for a child to find a loving family and permanent home."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - We are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, President Donald Trump exhorted his screaming supporters before they marched on the U.S. Capitol last week, saying he'd go with them. He did not – and what unfolded was a deadly breach of the citadel of American democracy that has left Trump's world crumbling in the final days of his presidency."}
{"original": "Trump had wanted to join the thousands of hardcore followers who assembled at Capitol Hill on Jan. 6. He told aides in the days leading up to the rally that he planned to accompany them to demonstrate his ire at Congress as it moved to certify Democrat Joe Biden's November election victory."}
{"original": "But the Secret Service kept warning him that agents could not guarantee his safety if he went ahead, according to two people familiar with the matter. Trump relented and instead hunkered down at the White House to watch television images of the mob rioting he is accused of triggering."}
{"original": "The storming of the U.S. Capitol left five people dead, including a police officer, and threatened the lives of Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress, deeply wounding what remained of Trump's presidency ahead of Biden's swearing-in on Jan. 20."}
{"original": "Trump's fiery, grievance-filled speech from the Ellipse park on the southern outskirts of the White House was a central focus of this week's hastily arranged proceedings in the House of Representatives that led to his impeachment on a charge of inciting insurrection."}
{"original": "With Wednesday's vote, Trump became the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice, as 10 of his fellow Republicans joined Democrats in denouncing him. But it appears unlikely to lead to his ouster before his term ends since there are no plans to convene a vote in the Republican-led Senate, which alone has the power to remove him."}
{"original": "Even so, the House's unprecedented rebuke capped a week that has been perilously unstable even for a presidency where chaos has long reigned."}
{"original": "Trump's last days in the White House have been marked by rage and turmoil, multiple sources said. He watched some of the impeachment debate on TV and grew angry at the Republican defections, a source familiar with the situation said."}
{"original": "Trump has suffered a sudden rupture with his vice president, the departure of disgusted senior advisers, his abandonment by a small but growing number of Republican lawmakers, the loss of his cherished Twitter megaphone, and a rush by corporations and others to distance themselves from him and his businesses."}
{"original": "Reuters spoke to more than a dozen Trump administration officials with a window into the closing act of his presidency. They described a shrinking circle of loyal aides who are struggling to contain an increasingly fretful, angry and isolated president – one seemingly still clinging to unfounded claims of election fraud - and to keep the White House functioning until Biden assumes power."}
{"original": "Everybody feels like they're doing the best job they can to hold it all together until Biden takes over, one Trump adviser told Reuters on condition of anonymity."}
{"original": "The White House declined to comment for this story. The Secret Service declined to comment about Trump's purported desire to travel to the Capitol on Jan. 6."}
{"original": "Even as Trump has spent time venting to aides and confidantes, one tangible issue he has been focused on is how to apply his power to pardon before his term ends, three White House sources said."}
{"original": "The biggest question is whether he will issue an unprecedented pardon to himself, in addition to family members, before leaving office."}
{"original": "While Trump has not publicly signaled his intention to take a step that some legal analysts say could be unlawful, one White House official told Reuters: I've been expecting that."}
{"original": "The chances of Trump making such a contentious move may have multiplied due to the uproar over his Jan. 6 speech in which he repeatedly urged his supporters to fight for him. Some legal experts say this could open him up to lawsuits or even criminal charges."}
{"original": "Addressing the crowd, Trump suggested several times that he would join in their march to the Capitol and appealed at least six times to Pence to do the right thing and refuse to certify Biden's victory in the formal counting of the electoral vote in Congress that day. Trump and his surrogates had built up a false narrative that Pence, whose role in the certification process was mostly ceremonial, could somehow throw the election to his boss."}
{"original": "Trump's speech followed an exasperated conversation with his vice president, a longtime loyalist, earlier on Jan. 6 when Trump called Pence a pussy for not being willing to overturn the vote, a source briefed on the matter said. The exchange was reported earlier by The New York Times."}
{"original": "On the day of the rally, Trump once again expressed his desire to accompany his supporters to the Capitol. The Secret Service told Trump he couldn't go with the crowd – though presidents do have the power to overrule their security details."}
{"original": "They waved him off that day, a source familiar with the situation said of the Secret Service. They said it would be way too dangerous."}
{"original": "So when throngs of flag-waving followers drifted away from the speech site toward the Capitol, Trump retreated to the walled confines of the White House, where aides said he watched the ransacking of the landmark building on television with rapt attention."}
{"original": "Among the mob that battled police, shattered windows and invaded legislative chambers were individuals who waved Confederate flags and wore clothing carrying insignias and slogans espousing conspiracy theories and white supremacist beliefs."}
{"original": "It would be hours before Trump appeared in a video on social media in response to entreaties to say something to rein in his supporters. When he did, he told them he loved them and to go home while repeating his baseless claims of a rigged election."}
{"original": "Some of Trump's own aides were left stunned by his conduct."}
{"original": "When people are storming the Capitol, you walk to the press room and do a press conference and call on them to stop, instead of cutting a video eight hours later, said a long-time Trump adviser."}
{"original": "The riot of Jan. 6 followed a two-month campaign by Trump to delegitimize the November election with false claims of fraud. It began when what he had vowed would be a landslide victory over Biden turned into a defeat once all mail-in ballots, which skewed heavily Democratic, were counted."}
{"original": "Trump's focus on claims of voter fraud, egged on by personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, consumed most of his days. Two days after the election, said a source familiar with the meeting, daughter Ivanka Trump was in a meeting with senior White House staff and said words to the effect that, We accomplished so much and we had a great run. A representative for Ivanka Trump declined to comment."}
{"original": "But no one in Trump's orbit could convince him to explicitly acknowledge defeat and use his remaining weeks in office to hold events to tout accomplishments that he and his aides are proud of."}
{"original": "Advisers felt Trump could make himself a force in the Republican Party for years to come, a kingmaker, and possibly even win a second term in 2024."}
{"original": "His political future could now be in jeopardy as a result of the Capitol violence. If convicted by the Senate in a trial that would occur after he has left the White House, Trump could be banned from holding federal office again."}
{"original": "Trump watched Wednesday's rapid-fire impeachment proceedings on television from the White House, sources said, stepping away briefly to hand out National Medal of Arts awards to country music artists Toby Keith and Ricky Skaggs."}
{"original": "Even before the riot, Trump's mood had been darkening as dozens of court cases filed by his legal team and surrogates failed to overturn the voting results in key swing states, people familiar with the matter said."}
{"original": "Aides who would enjoy dropping by the Oval Office to check on Trump found themselves avoiding him lest he give them an assignment related to voter fraud that they knew was impossible, three sources said."}
{"original": "His mood has only worsened since the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol. He has fumed in private about the decision by Twitter, his favorite means of communication with his followers, to permanently suspend his account on the grounds that it was concerned he could incite further mayhem, two people familiar with the matter said."}
{"original": "With Trump scrambling to find an alternative platform, his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner helped head off an attempt by other aides to get him signed up on fringe, far-right social media sites, believing they were not the best format for the president, said an administration official. A representative for Kushner declined comment."}
{"original": "Pence and Trump did not speak for days after the Capitol riot. The vice president had to be spirited to safety in the Capitol basement after rioters, some chanting Hang Mike Pence, penetrated the building."}
{"original": "Current and former White House officials say they were aghast at how Trump treated Pence, who has been a steady and loyal lieutenant. They were stung by the president's criticism and false insistence that the vice president could intervene to overturn the Electoral College results. Trump also never called Pence to check on him during his ordeal, an aide said."}
{"original": "On Monday, the two men met alone in the Oval Office, likely following efforts and appeals by Ivanka Trump and Kushner, according to one White House official. The two men walked out of the meeting in good spirits, chuckling together about something. The body language was good, the official said."}
{"original": "The next day, Pence wrote to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he would not exercise the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to remove the president from office for incapacitation, despite pressure from Democrats."}
{"original": "Other aides have not been as forgiving."}
{"original": "Deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, a leading aide on Trump's China policy, quickly quit in what two sources said was an act of protest against the president's response to the rioting. Pottinger did not respond to requests for comment. He was followed by at least five other senior foreign policy aides. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos also resigned in protest."}
{"original": "Some other Trump officials say they have gritted their teeth and stayed put despite anger over Trump's perceived role in the violence."}
{"original": "National security adviser Robert O'Brien and White House counsel Pat Cipollone were among those convinced to remain by others, including lawmakers, former government officials and corporate executives, four sources familiar with the matter said. The White House declined comment."}
{"original": "Some who remain in the administration have seized the opportunity to push through significant policy shifts before leaving office, several administration sources said."}
{"original": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for instance, has pressed ahead with controversial international moves, sometimes, according to two people familiar with the matter, without coordinating fully with the White House."}
{"original": "The timing of one decision caught some National Security Council officials by surprise, the sources said: Pompeo's scrapping of longtime curbs on U.S. government interactions with Taiwan officials, which angered China. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment."}
{"original": "Other Pompeo actions over the past week have included returning Communist-ruled Cuba to the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, and designating Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement a terrorist organization."}
{"original": "While mostly disengaged from policymaking, Trump on Tuesday, at his aides' behest, paid a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border wall near Alamo, Texas. Erecting a barrier across the border was a signature promise of his winning 2016 campaign platform. Only portions got built."}
{"original": "Decisions on a final round of presidential pardons are expected to occupy much of Trump's few remaining days in office. He has stirred controversy in recent weeks by pardoning allies convicted in the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, security contractors convicted of killing Iraqi civilians, and Kushner's father, Charles, a real estate developer sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty in 2004 to tax evasion and other crimes."}
{"original": "Trump and his family have potential legal exposure of their own, including investigations in New York over tax and business dealings."}
{"original": "One White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested Trump's final act as president could be a preemptive pardon for family members and for himself just before Biden is sworn in. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not violations of state law."}
{"original": "A self-pardon would be an extraordinary use of power never before tried by a U.S. president, and constitutional lawyers say there is no definitive answer on whether it can be done lawfully."}
{"original": "One thing Trump's staff don't expect: a resignation. I would be floored if that were to happen, another White House official said."}

{"original": "My son is currently a freshman at a university in Iowa studying to be a teacher. He spent his winter break working with junior high choir students each morning at 7 a.m. and it made him more committed than ever to want to teach. He would ultimately like to teach right here in Iowa. It is becoming harder and harder to encourage him to stay in our home state to teach. Iowa has long had a tradition of caring about public education. Iowans also pride themselves on a certain civility (sometimes masking a thinly hidden stubbornness, made famous in the musical The Music Man)…but always doing our best to be Iowa Nice."}
{"original": "That dedication to public education and civility is being sorely tested this week. Without any warning last week, Republican legislators unveiled a legislative attack on collective bargaining rights for public employees. If passed, it will not allow public employees to bargain for health care, for due process, and retirement benefits. Republicans say that it isn't union busting because we will still have the right to bargain for compensation. Of course, we will be bargaining over the tiny amount of money that they have approved for us, because Iowa is giving away hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate tax breaks that don't seem to be finding their way into the pockets of middle-class Iowans (I wonder whose pockets those hundreds of millions of dollars end up in?)."}
{"original": "Republican legislators in Iowa didn't campaign on this issue. There were no rallies, stream of phone calls and letters, or organized campaign by Iowans that they wanted public workers to lose collective bargaining rights. The only outcry is a commercial running on local stations that is funded by out-of-state money. Republican legislators are doing this to punish unions. It really is that simple. They won't say that in public, because that's not Iowa Nice. I'll say it for them. So, while Republican legislators punish those of us who have dedicated our careers to public education, what will happen to our schools? If only we knew? Oh yeah, Wisconsin did this 5 years ago. The result is that rural schools are struggling to find teachers, fewer young people are entering the teaching profession, and there is no evidence that student achievement has increased (except the occasional cherry-picked statistic the governor trots out). Of course, Iowa is a state where we have watched Kansas plunge into economic crisis with massive corporate tax cuts and said, hey, why don't we try that? A case could be made that our Iowa legislators don't pay a lot of attention to the obvious consequences to their actions, even when those consequences are taking place in states all around us."}
{"original": "It is all about consequences. Elections have consequences. Iowans elected a Republican legislature and a Republican governor, and those politicians are going to do what the out-of-state conservative political cash cows tell them to do. We elected these people and we should have known that this was the agenda they would pursue (although not a one of them campaigned on destroying collective bargaining during November's election). But, actions have consequences and legislation has consequences. Much like the massive corporate tax breaks enacted since 2013 have created an artificial budget crisis, forcing us to cut millions of dollars from the state budget, busting up pubic sector unions will also have a consequence. Rural schools will find it hard to get teachers, fewer smart young people will want to enter public service, teachers will be forced to fight among themselves for salary dollars (won't it be fun to know that if your colleague gets a bonus of $10,000, the rest of the staff makes $10,000 less…yeah, that's how this will work), and teacher morale will be at an all-time low. Some of this seems to stem from the idea that our Republican legislators think we have had it too good for too long in education. They must believe that there is an army of people in our communities who would make better teachers and do the work for less money and fewer benefits? If so, where are they?"}
{"original": "Here is the thing. Teachers aren't going to be Iowa Nice for long. We'll continue to teach young people with all of our hearts because that is what we love to do, but our legislators better be ready. I've never seen teachers so demoralized, angry, and ready to take action. We teach, and we teach in Iowa, because we believed our state respected our work. We still believe our communities respect us, but our legislators don't. We get that. Our anger that this legislation has been thrust on us behind closed doors and is being rushed into law won't be without consequences. We're nice, but we're also Iowa Stubborn when it comes to doing what is best for the young people of Iowa. There are those that think that this is about protecting bad teachers or protecting our fantabulous lifestyles…as a famous politician regularly says, WRONG. This is about what is good for our schools and good for our young people. If Iowa's Republican legislators want to have a conversation with Iowans about collective bargaining, this isn't the way to do it, and that's not what Iowans want. Iowa's Republican legislators want to punish unions and in doing so will hurt public education in Iowa. Do it, but remember: consequences."}
{"original": "ROME (Reuters) - An Italian tribunal has lifted a ban on veteran center-right leader Silvio Berlusconi from holding public office, meaning he could run to be prime minister in the next national election."}
{"original": "However, the decision might have come just too late for the 81-year-old four-times premier, who only three days ago gave his blessing to his political ally the League to form a government without him in the wake of a disappointing election result."}
{"original": "Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud in 2013, triggering his expulsion from the upper house of parliament and a bar on holding any elected position for six years. However, in a decision made public on Saturday, a court in the northern city of Milan which oversees the application of sentences ruled that the bar could be lifted a year early because of good conduct."}
{"original": "Finally five years of injustice has come to end, Berlusconi's Forza Italia party said in a statement. Berlusconi can once again be a candidate."}
{"original": "Berlusconi campaigned actively ahead of a March 4 national election even though he was not a candidate. But Forza Italia did not perform as well as he had expected, slipping behind the League to lose its top spot in the center-right bloc."}
{"original": "Berlusconi blamed the poor showing on the fact that voters knew he could not be prime minister. The center-right emerged as the single largest force at the March vote, while the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement emerged as the biggest individual party."}
{"original": "Neither side won enough seats to govern alone and efforts to put together a coalition were complicated by 5-Star's refusal to work with Forza Italia, saying Berlusconi symbolized political corruption in Italy."}
{"original": "After more than nine weeks of stalemate, and with fresh elections looking increasingly likely, Berlusconi on Wednesday finally gave his blessing to the League to seek a coalition deal without Forza Italia."}
{"original": "Negotiations between the League and 5-Star are continuing, with President Sergio Mattarella giving them until Monday to strike an accord. Both parties say that if they fail to agree terms, the only solution would be a revote, perhaps in July. A political source, who declined to be named, said the fact Berlusconi was now free to run might make him less amenable to a League/5-Star government and could work to make life difficult for it in parliament, should it take office."}

{"original": "nicoletaionescu via Getty Images Compared with other full-time employee benefits, a holiday party invite may seem a small matter, but it's a difficult-to-avoid, public indication of contractors' second-class status."}
{"original": "The office holiday party is where employees gather to celebrate the past year and look forward to the next. It can be a time to gossip and bond with colleagues and bring home stories and swag. And at major tech companies that are notorious for both their lavish holiday parties and widespread use of contract employees, it's yet one more perk those employees don't get to share."}
{"original": "Compared with common full-time employee benefits like high-quality health insurance, paid family leave and retirement-plan employer contributions, a party invite may seem a small matter, but it's a difficult-to-avoid annual indication of contractors' second-class status. And it unfolds publicly."}
{"original": "In many cases, tech contractors work at the same buildings, work on the same projects and eat the same food as full-time employees, without getting the same perks and benefits. One Apple contractor said that he did not even know about the company's holiday party this year until after it took place. Jaime, a former Google contractor who asked that we not use her last name, said that contractors were not invited to the holiday party during her time at the company. She said the event, which took place in multiple rooms and multiple floors of a rented space, is one of the flashiest perks Google offers. Contractors could attend only if they were a direct employee's guest."}
{"original": "Asking and waiting for a willing and able employee to extend an invitation could make a contractor feel like a charity case, said Jaime, who was unable to score an invite."}
{"original": "Two Google contractors, who declined to be identified out of fear of jeopardizing their employment, said the party policy for contractors continues. Google's 2018 holiday parties in California's Bay Area took place at San Francisco City Hall, the Contemporary Jewish Museum, the Palace of Fine Arts, the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum and the Galleria at the San Francisco Design Center, among other locations, according to people who attended."}

{"original": "Once we were there, it was fine, said a Google contractor who works on site and scored a plus-one. But the whole getting of the ticket felt far more burdensome than it needed to be. It felt desperate [to ask]."}
{"original": "Contract workers outnumbered employees for the first time at Google last year, according to a Bloomberg report in July. One current Google contractor with access to the figures estimated that there are roughly 97,400 full-time employees and 97,300 contractors worldwide at Google's parent company, Alphabet, not counting workers in facilities, food service, security, transportation, travel and certain wellness services."}
{"original": "Such contracting is not a temporary annoyance; it can be a second-tier citizenship that can last for years. And members of this shadow workforce are growing increasingly disgruntled about their treatment, demanding better wages and access to all-staff communications, among other things."}
{"original": "For most [temps, vendors and contractors] here, it's not like we're a temp filling in for the week at the front desk. It feels like a regular job, one Google contractor said. But then there are everyday reminders ― like not getting invited to a company party ― that remind contractors theirs is not like a regular job with career development opportunities."}
{"original": "It's natural to feel like you have a foot in the door as a contractor, but TVCs are not seen as a pipeline to employment at Google, said a Google contractor."}
{"original": "Yana Calou is the director of training and engagement at nonprofit Coworker.org, which supports employees working toward improving employment conditions. Calou speaks with employees and contractors at Google, Apple, Facebook and others and said that employees may be discouraged from interacting with contractors."}
{"original": "At Google, for example, there are strict guidelines for how employees should treat contractors, The Guardian reported. Contractors may not get simple perks like company T-shirts. They may not be invited to team off-site events or all-hands meetings. And they must wear different-colored badges identifying them as contractors."}
{"original": "Nicole Sanchez, the CEO of Vaya Consulting, which works with companies on inclusion, outlined the hierarchal system that technology workers can get sorted into: At the top are salaried employees with full benefits, then professional-level contractors, then the service workers."}
{"original": "There are so many indications inside a company culture of where you stand in this caste system, and they are reinforced by things like the color of your badge, where you get to park, where you get to eat, and the holiday party is one of those things, Sanchez said."}
{"original": "Lilly Irani, a Google user experience designer from 2003 to 2007, said that even a decade ago, the contractor system created a hierarchical system where contractors were promised inclusion among the full-timers in exchange for taking depressed wages, strainingly competitive work circumstances and strict disciplinary structures. Full-time Google workers like me at the time were usually unaware of this tiered system unless we were friends with people on the other side."}
{"original": "I think that really limits the kind of interactions you have and the kind of friendships that you would make where you would even be in a position where someone would ask, 'Do you want to be my plus-one?' Calou said. I think there is a fear instilled on the side of employees that they might be putting themselves or that contractor at risk by engaging like they would another colleague."}
{"original": "Google declined to comment on whether contractors are invited to holiday parties. A Google spokesperson said, Temps, vendors and contractors are an important part of our extended workforce, but they are employed by other companies, not Google. Facebook and Apple — two other companies that reportedly rely on a large shadow workforce of contractors for their products — did not respond to questions about their holiday party policies."}

{"original": "You feel like there is this thing you should have access to. You are doing work for this company on site full time, and it feels kind of arbitrary and kind of cruel in its execution, Jaime said. I wish they would see that they have the same responsibility to their vendors and contractors that they do to their full-time employees."}
{"original": "The everyday slights and indignities that contractors experience can add up. Your company, should you decide not to include your contractors, is clearly indicating to your workforce who we value and who we don't, Sanchez said."}
{"original": "That demoralizing message could be delivered by design. Some legal experts suggest the rule may be borne of an extreme fear of misclassifying contractors as employees."}
{"original": "Generally, employers and contractors in the United States are distinguished by the amount of control and direction an employer exerts over the worker. In 2000, Microsoft found this out the hard way and had to pay $97 million in a settlement with the company's permatemps, who often worked more than two years at the company, doing work similar to employees' without getting the same benefits."}
{"original": "If Google was found to be a joint employer of its contractors, then the company could be held liable for them as employees. Silicon Valley companies may be trying to avoid this expensive obligation. Bob See, a former Google engineering recruiter, said as much in a 2015 Quora post. Contractors indeed aren't invited to company ski trips, the company holiday party, and other such company-funded social events ... to avoid co-employment misclassification that can have severe, negative legal, tax, and other financial implications on the company, he wrote."}
{"original": "Terri Gerstein, a fellow in the Harvard Law School Labor and Worklife Program, suggested that contractor exclusion from holiday parties may happen because these companies are extra cautious to take every opportunity to differentiate between employees and people working for contractors or staffing agencies."}
{"original": "For Veena Dubal, an associate professor of law at the University of California, Hastings, the reasons for exclusion could be more strategic."}
{"original": "More than a legal fear is a fear of collective action, she said. They don't want the contractors to feel like employees. They don't want them to be motivated to feel like they could have the same benefits as the regular employees."}

As employers increasingly outsource labor to cheaper contractors, temporary contractors working in purgatory arrangements are becoming a permanent part of work life. They could be working at your office too, as they are at mine. A spokesperson for Verizon Media Services, HuffPost's parent company, said in an email that only direct employees are invited to the company's holiday party, but they are each allowed a guest (so a contingent worker could attend as a guest if so invited)."}

{"original": "A retail politician who never misses a chance for small talk or schmooze, Biden has been penned in somewhat by the pandemic, which limits the face-to-face interactions on which he thrives. But there's still his peerless phone book, built over four decades of dealing with senators on both sides of the political divide."}
{"original": "When he decides to make one of those calls, he doesn't really require a call sheet, a sheet that tells him exactly what to say to a member of Congress and how to outline the bill, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an interview on MSNBC. He knows. He's known a lot of these people for decades."}

{"original": "Having spent 36 years in the Senate and eight as vice president, Biden made bipartisan outreach a central promise, even when many in his party argued that Republicans no longer were interested in working across the aisle."}
{"original": "Biden's most notable deal-making success came in the Obama-era fiscal showdowns during the rise of the tea party Republicans. The landmark agreements locked in tax and spending cuts for a decade ― and soured some progressive Democrats on Biden's brand of compromise."}
{"original": "As vice president, Biden was a trusted emissary to Capitol Hill for Obama, who had served just four years in the Senate."}
{"original": "Biden arrived as a presence in the halls of Congress at several critical junctures. He helped cut a 2010 deal to prevent the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts, then negotiated on the landmark Budget Control Act of 2011 that slashed spending and walked the country back from the 2012 fiscal cliff of looming tax increases and budget reductions."}
{"original": "Biden's chief virtue as a negotiator is the understanding that 'Look, you have politics on your side, I have politics on my side, we both have to live within our political constraints,' said Rohit Kumar, former deputy chief of staff to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

{"original": "Lott said Biden was not someone he recalls as often being in the room when Senate leadership was trying to work out a deal on major bills. But Lott pointed to two major instances when he was: the 1994 crime bill and the 2002 Iraq War resolution, a pair of measures for which Biden has since expressed regret."}
{"original": "Still, Lott said Biden's relationship with McConnell was real and could pay dividends again."}
{"original": "They worked out an agreement that basically is what they've been working off ever since, Lott said. Somebody in the media referred to Biden then as the McConnell whisperer."}
{"original": "Still, the Senate has changed markedly since Biden first joined decades ago, with different skills now in currency as senators gain status on social media, raise money beyond their home states and spend less time socializing with one another in Washington."}
{"original": "Biden's style of old-school, one-on-one cajoling may be less persuasive for senators from either party who cultivate their own brands and don't necessarily rely on proximity to presidential power to raise their profiles."}

{"original": "As Texas voters head to the polls in the Democratic primary on Tuesday, the second-largest stash of national convention delegates hangs in the balance."}
{"original": "But beyond the top of the ticket, where Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is battling a resurgent former Vice President Joe Biden for dominance, the state is also due to host the most closely watched Democratic House primary of the 2020 election cycle."}
{"original": "In South Texas's vast 28th Congressional District, progressive immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, 26, is hoping to unseat conservative Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, who is 64. Cuellar's history of opposition to abortion rights, gun regulation and tougher union protections, as well as his support for the fossil fuel industry and some of President Donald Trump's immigration policies, have earned him the enmity of an array of labor unions, reproductive rights and progressive groups."}
{"original": "Although Cisneros has raised more than any of Cuellar's challengers in recent memory and she enjoys the support of some of the country's leading progressives — including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sens. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — most observers maintain that she is in a tough fight."}
{"original": "Young Latino turnout is key. Terence Garrett, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley"}
{"original": "That's because Cuellar, an eight-term incumbent, leads a family that dominates politics in the border city of Laredo and benefits from the largesse of the national Democratic establishment as well as deep-pocketed corporate interests and ideologically conservative groups. He also holds power in a heavily Roman Catholic, Latino region where the typical voting population has more socially conservative leanings; the growing contingent of young Latinos with more liberal views, as well as more impoverished residents, are more likely to sit out elections."}
{"original": "Since Cisneros has generated more attention and resources than any of the left's congressional primary challengers this cycle, a loss would be disappointing. The region's conservative bent would make her win that much more transformational, however — and inspire fear in incumbent Democrats across the country."}
{"original": "A win for Cisneros would show that progressivism, as exhibited by Ocasio-Cortez, can even reach into the recesses of South Texas, said Texas politics expert Terence Garrett, who chairs the public affairs department at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. It would be a dramatic shift."}
{"original": "The race is also a bellwether for Democrats hoping to turn Texas blue, according to Garrett. Higher-than-normal participation from young people and other infrequent voters in the low-turnout region would benefit Cisneros and Sanders but also portend well for Democrats' chances of bringing the state into the party's column in November, he predicted."}
{"original": "Young Latino turnout is key, he said."}
{"original": "Thomas McKinless/Getty Images Progressive views helped win Jessica Cisneros high-profile national endorsements. Her success depends on convincing infrequent voters that she can improve their lives."}
{"original": "South Texas's AOC — Or Something Else Entirely?"}
{"original": "The parallels between the campaigns of Cisneros and Ocasio-Cortez are obvious. Cisneros, a native of Laredo, is the daughter of Mexican immigrants who transcended a childhood of modest means to obtain a law degree and serve a vulnerable immigrant population in New York City. She is taking on a far more conservative male incumbent more than twice her age with a powerful political machine at his disposal. And she was the first candidate that Justice Democrats, the left-wing group that recruited Ocasio-Cortez for the 2018 elections, enlisted this cycle to take out a Democrat they deemed out of step with his district."}
{"original": "Cuellar's conservative record in a host of key policy areas makes then-Rep. Joe Crowley, whom Ocasio-Cortez unseated, seem like a socialist by comparison. Cuellar served as secretary of state to then-Republican Gov. Rick Perry in 2000, and in 2018 he raised money for a House Republican from Texas whom Democrats were trying to unseat. Prior to his 2018 reelection, Cuellar had an A rating from the National Rifle Association for opposing new gun regulations and a 15% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America. The political statistics site FiveThirtyEight estimated that in the Congress prior to the current one, Cuellar voted with Trump nearly 69% of the time."}
{"original": "But despite modest adjustments, including a vote to close loopholes in the gun background check system, Cuellar has largely maintained his hawkish and corporate-friendly record as he seeks reelection. In January, Cuellar was the rare House Democrat to express unqualified approval of Trump's decision to kill Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in an airstrike in Iraq."}
{"original": "The following month, he was one of just seven House Democrats to vote against the PRO Act, which would make it easier for American workers to unionize. He specifically criticized the law's abolition of state-level right-to-work laws that allow workers to enjoy union representation without having to pay dues, claiming the law protects workers from mandates to pay dues to the union that represents them."}

He has demonstrated an allegiance not to the people in the district but to the elites in the district, said Rick Levy, president of the Texas AFL-CIO, the state's main labor umbrella group, which is backing Cisneros."}
{"original": "The parallels with Ocasio-Cortez have their limits. Unlike Crowley, Cuellar, the son of immigrant farmworkers from Mexico, is Latino, as is a majority of his constituents. He maintains a home in his district, leverages his seat on the Appropriations Committee to bring home a steady stream of federal funding and represents an electorate that is widely viewed as less progressive than residents of the Bronx and Queens."}
{"original": "State Rep. Richard Peña Raymond, a Cuellar ally who represents part of the 28th District in the Texas Legislature, rejected the parallel outright, arguing that progressives inspired by Ocasio-Cortez were targeting the wrong man."}
{"original": "Go find somebody who's not working hard, go find somebody who's not working in their district and challenge them in a primary, Raymond said. I just think he deserves reelection."}
{"original": "Raymond highlighted Cuellar's advocacy in the past year for a revised North American Free Trade Agreement that protected the international trade that is the economic lifeblood of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley.

{"original": "Regardless of his work in the district, a host of progressive groups sees in Cisneros's bid an opportunity to knock off an obstacle to their policy goals. They have steadily begun spending heavily to elect Cisneros, making her the rare progressive challenger with substantial outside support, including from abortion rights groups, such as EMILY's List, that are traditionally associated with the Democratic establishment. Several Texas labor unions, the progressive Working Families Party and EMILY's List have spent a combined sum of more than $600,000 in ads and other materials supporting Cisneros and nearly $1 million blasting Cuellar. The Texas Organizing Project, a progressive community organization affiliated with the Center for Popular Democracy, is helming a canvassing effort for Cisneros in San Antonio ― outside of Cuellar's political base in Laredo."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Cuellar has marshaled additional financial backing from groups that otherwise almost exclusively support Republicans. The United States Chamber of Commerce has spent about $200,000 on his behalf. The conservative billionaire Charles Koch's super PAC Americans for Prosperity Action, which is typically aligned with the right wing of the Republican Party, has spent nearly $80,000 to reelect Cuellar ― making him the first Democrat to receive the group's backing."}
{"original": "In addition, a dark money group of unknown origins, calling itself Allied Workers for Progress, began a $720,000 ad blitz for Cuellar in January. And a self-styled progressive super PAC funded by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus's PAC spent $250,000 on mailers characterizing Cisneros as an interloper from New York City. (Cisneros worked in legal aid there for low-income immigrant clients after law school before returning home to Laredo to run for office.)"}
{"original": "In a bid to shore up some of his more liberal constituents, Cuellar has welcomed the fundraising prowess and star power of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who is to Cuellar's left on major policy issues. Pelosi visited Cuellar's campaign headquarters in Laredo in late February, calling for a resounding victory for Cuellar."}
{"original": "The visit surprised Garrett, given the ideological gulf between Cuellar and the House leader. He must be worried, Garrett said. I was floored to see that."}
{"original": "At the same time, Cuellar has refused to debate Cisneros. And some of the outside support for Cuellar from more right-wing corners has provided fodder for Cuellar's adversaries. The support of a Koch-founded group is the subject of at least one pro-Cisneros television ad."}
{"original": "Why would a right-wing Republican billionaire be supporting a supposed Democrat like Henry Cuellar? the narrator asks in a 30-second spot that the WFP is spending $50,000 to air in the district. It's simple: Henry Cuellar votes with Donald Trump 70% of the time."}

{"original": "The youth-led climate group Sunrise Movement is calling on its army of activists to make calls and knock on doors for Sanders, Cisneros and two other Democrats competing in primaries to take on incumbent Texas Republicans in the House. Sunrise's calculation is that making electoral inroads in Texas, where the oil and gas industries are strongly influential, would be a major coup for the Green New Deal movement."}
{"original": "If we can show that running boldly on the Green New Deal without moderating or hedging is a path to victory for Democrats, we think it can transform the entire conversation in this nation, Sunrise's political director Evan Weber told HuffPost in February."}
{"original": "Cuellar, who has received more than $850,000 from the oil and gas industry over the course of his career ― and $116,000 from fossil fuel PACs this cycle alone ― has cast himself as a climate pragmatist capable of shepherding effective change without wiping out local jobs."}

{"original": "Asked to explain his lack of reservations about Cisneros's positions, the Texas AFL-CIO's Levy noted that the Green New Deal is still aspirational and that Cisneros assured the state's unions that labor would be at the table during the drafting of climate legislation."}

{"original": "It's possible that the high-profile progressive politicians backing Cisneros share Strother's apparent lack of confidence in her prospects since none of them ― Sanders, Warren or Ocasio-Cortez ― has visited the district to campaign for Cisneros in the final weeks and days before the election."}

{"original": "Rocha allowed, however, that the Sanders campaign had erected a ground game in more rural corners of the state later than it had hoped, opening a field office in McAllen ― a city in the Rio Grande Valley just outside the 28th District ― in mid-February."}

{"original": "To some extent, though, the lack of national celebrity may be a blessing for Cisneros, who has to find a way to translate progressive buzzwords into terms her often-apolitical, working-class constituents can understand. Even Kiersey concedes that ideas like Medicare for All resonate less at the doors than general appeals to boost wages, and to provide relief from rising health care and higher education costs. The Texas AFL-CIO's literature likewise touts Cisneros's commitment to universal health care rather than Medicare for All, which is occasionally a source of acrimony for unions that have fought hard for employer-supported health benefits."}
{"original": "It's a message that Cisneros is leaning in to in the final days before the campaign."}
{"original": "This race isn't about progressive versus conservative, liberal versus moderate ― this is about electing someone who will truly fight for and represent our communities, Cisneros said in a statement to HuffPost on Friday. We're tired of politicians and the status quo."}
{"original": "De-nationalizing the race can benefit Cisneros in other ways as well, opening a path for conservative landowners who don't feel the Bern but are angry about the construction of Trump's border wall, according to Garrett, who argues that it's an issue where Cuellar is vulnerable to charges that he has not sufficiently fought the wall."}
{"original": "Cuellar voted for a spending bill that funded the border wall in 2018. He ended up voting against a new round of funding this year. But along the way, he shaped the funding bill's development, including through the insertion of language allotting federal funding for a riverwalk area in Laredo alongside the wall that critics fear could institutionalize the wall by allowing much-coveted federal funding to be tied to the wall's completion."}

{"original": "OAKLAND, Calif. ― Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) formally launched her 2020 presidential campaign Sunday, framing her prosecutorial career as one defined by fighting for the people."}
{"original": "Speaking to a large crowd, which her press secretary estimated to be 20,000 people, Harris said her resume — which includes serving as district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California — was built on the profound impact law enforcement has on peoples' lives. She said she got into law to protect people, and that fighting for the people meant fighting for a more fair criminal justice system."}
{"original": "In my whole life, I've only had one client: the people, she said."}
{"original": "In the week since announcing her intention to run, Harris has faced intense scrutiny from the left."}
{"original": "A scathing New York Times op-ed published a few days ahead of Harris' announcement questioned the former prosecutor's reputation as a progressive, pointing to her role in wrongful convictions as well as her record on criminal justice issues such as police body cameras, sentencing reform and the death penalty. Harris' campaign disputed the characterization of her prosecutorial record."}
{"original": "She's also faced questions over whether she failed to go after Wall Street hard enough after the 2007-08 mortgage crisis, as well as criticism from sex workers and advocates who say Harris' efforts to fight sex trafficking has only hurt them."}

{"original": "If I have the honor of being your president, I will tell you this: I am not perfect. Lord knows, I am not perfect, she said. But I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect. I will lead with integrity. And I will speak the truth."}
{"original": "Harris' speech was also a forceful condemnation of the status quo under President Donald Trump. She outlined the ways in which America under his leadership isn't our America, listing examples including the separation of migrant children from their parents at the border, the killings of black men and women and the inaccessibility of health care."}
{"original": "America, we are better than this, she told the crowd. People in power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other. But that is not our story. That is not who we are. That's not our America."}

The public square, named for the civil rights leader who was the first Japanese-American to serve on Oakland's city council, has been the site of many protests, including 2011′s Occupy Oakland demonstrations. It's also where former President Barack Obama ― then the junior senator from Illinois ― drew 10,000 people in the early stages of his own presidential bid, in March 2007."}
{"original": "In addition to acknowledging Harris' roots, the campaign's decision to launch in Oakland also has political advantages. With California's primary moved up to March 2020, Golden State voters will have a large say in who becomes the Democratic nominee — a reversal from years past, when Californians were an afterthought in most presidential races. Harris, so far the only Californian in the race, could gain an early advantage with long-ignored voters there by making them central to her campaign."}

{"original": "Inside a container that served as his home in the Debaga refugee camp outside Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan, Ahmed Qusai scooped up his son from a mattress on the concrete floor and kissed him on the cheek. Qusai used to be an oil worker in Qayyarah, a once energy-rich town about 45 miles south of Mosul in Iraq. He also worked for years as a protector of both oil and gas in Iraqi Kurdistan for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) during the late 1990s and following the fall of Saddam Hussein."}
{"original": "It was August 2016. Ahmed had been living in the camp for several months. Black smoke from oilfield fires clouded the distant horizon. The Iraqi army and its allies had just recently freed Qayyarah from ISIS control. But victory came at a price. ISIS fighters dug in, setting fire to oil wells, pipelines, and a nearby sulfur plant."}
{"original": "Like thousands of men in this camp, Qusai once worked helping to protect Iraq's most valuable asset. Now, thanks to ISIS's own thirst for oil, Qusai spent his days cleaning his prefabricated shelter and walking the aisles of the camp, home to about 35,000 refugees."}
{"original": "He was angry, but not just at ISIS. He had previously worked as a specialist in deactivating improvised explosive devices and then as a firefighter. We weren't getting any of the benefits of the oil we were protecting, he said. The government just took the oil and didn't work with the local people."}
{"original": "Qusai had been trained by representatives of the foreign oil companies that arrived en masse after the toppling of Saddam's regime in 2003, as the West promised to help develop Iraqi Kurdistan's oil sector."}
{"original": "The oil revenue of that country could bring between $50 billion and $100 billion over the course of the next two or three years, then-Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told a congressional panel just days after the war began."}
{"original": "Qusai held so much hope, he said, that the economy in the KRG would improve as investment increased, and that his contribution to that process, even if small, would help."}
{"original": "But those days of optimism are long gone."}
{"original": "Now, what has transpired in the KRG seems a classic example of the resource curse. Oil is found, pumped, shipped, and sold (and sometimes stolen). Regimes, politicians, ministers, and companies come and go. And yet the average citizen benefits marginally or not all. If the generic chaos of war, terrorism, and political infighting explains some of this, it doesn't explain it all. Reporting for Pipe Dreams, a book I wrote about the oil sector in the KRG, reveals that greed and fraud, tolerated if not abetted by U.S. and multinational companies, lie at the center of the dashed oil dreams."}
{"original": "Estimates of the losses to fraud and mismanagement in Iraq as a whole are staggering — or perhaps not surprising for a country ranked 10th from the bottom (out of 176 nations) on Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index. According to a report by a former Brookings analyst, corruption and mismanagement could have cost Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan $20 billion just in 2013. Since the toppling of Saddam, estimates put the total number as high as $100 billion (same report)."}
{"original": "The corruption in Iraqi Kurdistan's oil sector starts within its ministries, particularly in the Ministry of Natural Resources, and is fueled by rivalries within the political system. Interviews with financial regulatory enforcement officers in the U.S. and the U.K., along with thousands of documents they gave me, showed the ministry and its political allies in the Kurdish leadership often sold off valuable oil assets to shell companies in the British Virgin Islands and other tax havens. Then the oil ministry quickly flipped these assets, giving huge profits to major international oil companies listed on stock exchanges in London, Canada, Oslo and New York. In other scenarios, subsidiaries of shell corporations paid the Kurdish government for oil blocks. The government then transferred some of that money to accounts earmarked for companies whose owners were members of the main political parties."}
{"original": "It must be noted, though, that much of what has unfolded in the KRG is a product, at least in part, to corruption in the central government in Baghdad, fueled by its relationship to the West. The power struggles manifest themselves in different ways there, but the outcomes are similar."}
{"original": "The regulatory enforcement officers said pay-to-play schemes in the KRG dated back to the late 1990s, clouding business dealings in the region and ultimately impacting the way the ministry handled its finances. Beyond the use of gifts in the oil sector, the KRG, like most countries across the world, included bonus payments in its contracts. What made the KRG bonuses different was a severe lack of transparency, investigators told me. The more money that came in, the harder it was to track."}
{"original": "Now, the Kurds are left with an economic nightmare, one that started long before the massively expensive war against ISIS started in 2014. The expenses from that war only worsened an already dire situation."}
{"original": "Before the war against ISIS, the KRG was already struggling to pay international oil companies ― a problem exacerbated by the pay-to-play system in the oil sector and the lack of accountability in top ministries. As a way to regain control of the economy, the KRG circumvented Baghdad and began selling its oil independently, holding onto the revenue from its sales. But when ISIS rose to power, taking over swaths of land and wells and refineries, the KRG had to fund the Kurdish military operations and pay for some services for internally displaced people."}

We cannot provide money for investment expenses because our [oil] production is so much less than our expenses. There are a lot of projects that have stopped."}
{"original": "The Kurds voted for independence in the fall of 2017 ― a move that if respected and institutionalized by Baghdad, would let the KRG officially control its own oil sales and revenue. But in the wake of the referendum, the Kurdish military clashed with the Iraqi army. The Iraqi forces took back oil fields the Kurds controlled. Now, the two governments are attempting to come to the negotiating table to work out a compromise on oil."}
{"original": "The Kurds need a cash lifeline, most likely in the form of regaining its share of the central government's operating budget that's being withheld during the independence dispute. But in order for that deal to go through, Baghdad has called for the KRG to release information about its oil sales and revenues. The KRG has pushed back, releasing only piecemeal information to the public."}
{"original": "The cycle of ever-dysfunctional politics in the KRG has generated a feeling among rank-and-file Kurds that something has to give."}
{"original": "But when it came to the vote for independence, the biggest push for change for in KRG since the fall of Saddam, the U.S. and other international powers refused to recognize the result, much less support it. The Kurdish political parties have fractured. Elections will be held in May, but ordinary Kurds say they expect more of the same ― more infighting, more protests and little change."}

{"original": "Those are two big takeaways from a new working paper by a group of researchers led by Stephen Zoepf, executive director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford University and a researcher at the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, which found that a substantial percentage of drivers for ride-hailing companies probably earn less than they think they do, though their wages are padded thanks to per-mile tax deductions."}
{"original": "As a working paper, it's important to note the figures haven't been peer-reviewed and are subject to change. Nevertheless, it offers interesting insight into an industry where driver pay has been the subject of much scrutiny."}
{"original": "Unlike previous economic analyses that report drivers' gross profits without factoring in operational costs, the MIT paper takes into account how much drivers spend on things like insurance, maintenance, repairs, fuel and the car's depreciation in value, using data from Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book and the Environmental Protection Agency."}
{"original": "Once those costs are accounted for, the working paper found, 74 percent of ride-hailing drivers make less than the minimum wage in their states, and 30 percent of drivers actually lose money for every mile they drive."}
{"original": "Zoepf et al. A graph shows revenue versus expenses per mile by drivers for ride-hailing services. Drivers above the line are losing money for every mile they drive."}
{"original": "In the survey of 1,121 drivers, the median driver earned $0.59 per mile and paid out $0.30 per mile in vehicle costs, leading to a median hourly profit of $3.37."}
{"original": "Notably, a choice few drivers with the most efficient vehicles and running the most profitable routes were able to turn out revenue of $1.50 per mile. Zoepf told HuffPost the Toyota Prius, a gas/electric hybrid, was drivers' vehicle of choice by a factor of two."}
{"original": "More than 80 percent of the drivers surveyed said they work less than 40 hours per week."}
{"original": "It isn't all bad news for drivers, however. The paper found nearly half of all drivers can declare a loss for tax purposes at the federal tax deduction rate of roughly $0.54 per mile. Per the researchers, that drastically decreases the amount of taxable income drivers need to report, to the extent that an estimated 74 percent of driver profit ― representing billions of dollars ― is going untaxed."}
{"original": "At an average of $661/month in net profit per driver and with hundreds of thousands of drivers in the U.S. alone, the standard mileage deduction facilitates billions of dollars of untaxed income, and hundreds of millions of unrealized tax revenue, the paper notes. This untaxed profit represents a social subsidy for the ride-hailing business model."}

{"original": "Lyft didn't respond to a request for comment from HuffPost, but a spokesman for Uber vigorously disputed the paper's methodology and findings."}
{"original": "While the paper is certainly attention grabbing, its methodology and findings are deeply flawed, the spokesman said. We've reached out to the paper's authors to share our concerns and suggest ways we might work together to refine their approach."}
{"original": "Zoepf didn't immediately respond to followup questions about his methodology."}
{"original": "Compared to other studies that used different methodology, the MIT paper is indeed an outlier. A National Bureau of Economic Research study in November 2016 found drivers in six major metropolitan areas earned around $18 an hour, not taking into account hourly costs varying from $2.94 to $6.46 per hour depending on the hours they worked and the vehicle they drove."}
{"original": "The paper also received some scrutiny from Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy, an industry blog. Campbell's 2017 Reader Survey provided the hard data the researchers used for their paper."}
{"original": "Using the same data, Campbell came up with an average hourly rate of around $16 an hour, not taking drivers' operational costs into account. But, he said, even if MIT's methodology needs to be tweaked ― which is possible, since it's a working paper ― its fundamental finding is spot on: Drivers aren't making enough money."}
{"original": "Many drivers are doing this job part time and really only looking to make a few hundred bucks a week, Campbell said, but figuring out how much they are actually earning can be quite challenging."}
{"original": "I think that's why we see such high turnover, and the No. 1 reason we hear from drivers as to why they're quitting is because of lower-than-expected earnings."}

{"original": "The CRFB, a coalition of former U.S. lawmakers, government officials and economists that has advocated for reducing deficits, said U.S. public debt by the Sept. 30 fiscal year-end would exceed 100% of U.S. GDP, from just under 80% prior to the coronavirus crisis."}
{"original": "These projections almost certainly underestimate deficits, since they assume no further legislation is enacted to address the crisis and that policymakers stick to current law when it comes to other tax and spending policies, the group said in a statement."}
{"original": "CRFB's projections also assume the economy experiences a strong recovery in 2021 and fully returns to its pre-crisis trajectory by 2025."}
{"original": "If that recovery is achieved, public debt would reach 107% of GDP that year, exceeding levels at the end of World War Two. A slower recovery could cause debt to reach 117% of GDP by 2025, the group said."}
{"original": "The record for a fiscal year deficit was $1.41 billion, set in 2009. Deficits exceeding $1 trillion followed for three subsequent years before subsiding as the economy recovered.

{"original": "Nearly two-thirds of low-income women in the St. Louis area reported that they were unable to afford pads, tampons or other menstrual hygiene products within the last year, according to a new study published in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology this week."}
{"original": "And though the study was relatively small, the numbers are likely similar elsewhere in the country, said study author Anne Sebert Kuhlmann."}
{"original": "This is an issue that has received an increasing amount of attention, particularly in developing countries.

{"original": "Without pads and tampons, women said they had to use rags, toilet paper or their children's diapers. Others said they ducked into public restrooms in order to take paper towels."}
{"original": "We had women tell us that they had gone to the emergency room for the sole purpose of getting a pad and the mesh postpartum underwear they provide, because they didn't have underwear and they didn't have period products — and they had nowhere else to go, Kuhlmann said. If you think about that as a use of our emergency departments in our major metropolitan areas ... we can do better for women."}
{"original": "In most of the U.S., tampons and pads are subject to sales tax because they're not classified as products that fill a basic, essential need. Only a handful of states have abolished the so-called tampon tax."}
{"original": "Food assistance funding like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) cannot be used for menstrual products, nor can Medicaid."}
{"original": "Women's advocates say there is a pressing need to make menstrual hygiene products more accessible to all women, regardless of their economic situation."}
{"original": "If a girl is in the classroom and gets her period unexpectedly, and she doesn't have a period product on her — and she can't afford one — she might go to the restroom to check. But if there's no period product there, she might not feel comfortable going to the office and ask for one, said Nadya Okamoto, founder of the nonprofit PERIOD, which delivers menstrual health products to women in need and calls for repeal of tampon taxes."}
{"original": "So she'll put a wad of toilet paper in and go back to the classroom, Okamoto continued. But then she might be distracted and worried about bleeding through her clothes, or what the smell is like, or she might be uncomfortable. In that timespan, the fact that she had that burden because she couldn't access period products — even small moments like that are unfair. That could be 10 to 15 minutes of her being disrupted in class and missing her curriculum. That makes a difference."}
{"original": "In the absence of national programs to help women afford pads, tampons and menstrual cups, nonprofits and community health centers have tried to step in."}
{"original": "Kuhlmann noted that the new study would have to be replicated elsewhere in order to come up with national estimates for the problem, but she said there's no reason to believe that other major U.S. metropolitan areas do not have similar levels of need."}
{"original": "Most women can identify with having to 'make do.' You know, you're caught off guard, you're out in public and your period starts — you make do with some toilet paper or you borrow from a friend, Kuhlmann said. But to have to do that every month, and to have to do that when you may have only one pair of underwear yourself — that affects your dignity and your sense of self and your sense of being able to care for yourself."}

{"original": "This past week the historic blizzard of 2016 completely shut down Washington, D.C., but work continued for those who could work from home. Moody's Analytics estimated the Federal Government's output loss at approximately $310.56 million. That number would be significantly higher but for the government telework program, allowing people to continue to work from home. Government agencies are realizing the cost benefits telework policies provide and according to Global Workplace Analytics the Federal Government's telework program has increased by an impressive 424.3%."}
{"original": "The driving force behind providing a telework policy is different for the employer and employee. Employers move to telework policies because it saves tens of thousands of dollars every year and employees embrace teleworking because it provides a greater work-life balance. It's a win-win for both parties. Both the private sector and public sector are providing telework programs to support operational needs because they realize the benefits these programs provide. When a blizzard shuts down the entire Eastern Seaboard of the United States the benefits of teleworking are obvious. The key is transferring the benefits realized out of an emergency into everyday operational opportunity."}
{"original": "There will always be those who are against telework citing the inability to properly manage work product output but in truth you know when a project is or is not getting done. Businesses lose billions every year through employee distractions. We all know the employee who jumps from office to office just to chat, wasting valuable time. Clearly that is not the person you want teleworking because no matter where they are, they aren't going to work. That is the beauty of at-will work arrangements."}
{"original": "Since the inception of the world wide web in 1990 our lives have dramatically changed. Even five years ago, meeting your doctor from the comfort of your home may not have sounded like a plausible idea but today companies like Doctor on Demand are leading the way. You can get online counseling services from companies like In Your Corner. States are recognizing this virtual shift and are beginning to provide businesses with additional benefits for offering telework opportunities. Virginia, for example, offers a teleworking tax credit for businesses that offer telework programs. The purpose of the credit is to encourage teleworking programs and reduce traffic and employee commuting time. The web has given us opportunity beyond belief. It is up to us to use these opportunities wisely and take advantage of the technology at our fingertips."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― After quashing a small revolt in her own caucus around Thanksgiving, Nancy Pelosi reclaimed the House speakership Thursday, becoming the first politician in 58 years to take back the gavel."}
{"original": "Pelosi was elected 220-192, with 12 Democrats voting for someone other than the California Democrat and three voting simply present."}
{"original": "In remarks just after her election, Pelosi said she was particularly proud to be speaker of the House for the 116th Congress, which marks the 100th year of women having the right to vote, and that we all have the ability and the privilege to serve with over 100 women members of Congress, the largest number in history."}
{"original": "Pelosi's path back to House speaker wasn't easy. Part of the reason Republicans were able to win back the House majority in 2010 was through a Fire Pelosi campaign that made her toxic in some Republican-leaning districts, and Republicans have run on a similar playbook for every election since, including in 2018."}
{"original": "A number of freshman Democrats made promises during the campaign to not support Pelosi if they were elected to Congress, and 10 stood by that vow, voting either present or for someone else."}
{"original": "But Pelosi was able to quell a revolt from about a dozen and a half Democrats who were already in Congress. She was able to frame the opposition as misogynist. (Her supporters started the hashtag #FiveWhiteGuys to describe the opposition, even though it wasn't only white men opposing her and there were more than five.)"}
{"original": "She picked off individual members through small promises. (She got the vote of Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio by promising to bring back a subcommittee on elections and make her the chairwoman, and she got Rep. Brian Higgins of New York simply by publishing a statement supporting his Medicare buy-in idea.)"}
{"original": "And she swung a large chunk of detractors through a deal where she stated her support of term limits for leadership roles and committee chairmen. (The deal set up Pelosi to not only serve this term as speaker but to serve next term as speaker if Democrats hold onto the House.)"}
{"original": "It was a classic demonstration of her skill as a legislator. She outworked her opponents. She wore them down, made it uncomfortable to oppose her, and then offered a carrot for their support. And by giving the smallest concession, Pelosi actually solidified her future position. If she serves the next two terms as the No. 1 Democrat in the House, she will have spent 20 years in that position and practically assured through rule changes that no one else could ever do the same."}
{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS The House elected Nancy Pelosi as speaker on Thursday."}
{"original": "Pelosi takes the speakership from Republican Paul Ryan, who exited the building entirely in deciding not to run for re-election, during a partial government shutdown. The fitting end to Ryan's speakership is a political gift to Pelosi, as Democrats are able to unify around her opposition to President Donald Trump and his border wall. The first order of business for Democrats is to pass legislation reopening those closed agencies."}
{"original": "Pelosi has already shown her mettle with Trump during this shutdown. She has been resolute that Democrats won't approve any money for Trump's border wall, and she's positioned Democrats to hammer the president and Senate Republicans for their refusal to take up a bill that passed the Senate unanimously weeks before."}
{"original": "During an Oval Office meeting with Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), she and Schumer were able to goad Trump into taking the blame for a shutdown ― a sound bite that continues to haunt Trump as the shutdown stretches into its second week."}
{"original": "As House Democrats address legislation to end the shutdown, they are also set to take up unifying anti-corruption legislation before facing any of the real fault lines in their caucus. Democrats don't plan to immediately demand Trump's tax returns, as they could in the Ways and Means Committee. They don't have any plans to impeach the president, though some members plan to offer articles of impeachment on Day One. And they won't be taking up contentious health care legislation any time soon. Pelosi was able to head off a small revolt on the rules package. Some progressive members didn't want pay as you go rules enacted in Congress, for hope of passing a Medicare-for-all bill, but the rules package is expected to easily be adopted later Thursday."}
{"original": "Pelosi, the only woman to ever serve as speaker, takes the gavel after serving eight years as minority leader, with four years as speaker before that and another four years ― from 2003 to 2007 ― as the minority leader previously. She's been in Congress since 1987."}

{"original": "The Washington Post via Getty Images Donald Trump, then president-elect, and Andy Puzder walk out the clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster Township, N.J., on Nov. 19."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump's pick to be the next labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, has serious conflicts of interest due to his work for an industry lobby that sued to stop overtime reforms, Senate Democrats said Thursday."}
{"original": "In a letter sent to the nominee and obtained by The Huffington Post, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) told Puzder that the committee overseeing his nomination still had not received his ethics paperwork, and that she expected a detailed account of what steps he'd take to avoid conflicts related to overtime regulation."}
{"original": "If you are confirmed, wrote Murray, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, your participation in any decisions, meetings, or conversations regarding the overtime litigation may put you in violation of legal ethics restrictions and prohibitions against conflicts of interest, raising questions about your ability to manage a key part of the responsibilities of the Secretary of Labor."}
{"original": "Puzder is the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. burger chains. Until recently, he served on the board of the International Franchise Association, an industry group that has opposed workplace regulations pursued by the Obama administration. After former President Barack Obama reformed overtime rules to make them more generous to workers, the IFA joined other groups in suing to stop those rules from going into effect. So far, they have been successful."}
{"original": "According to the IFA, Puzder stepped down from the board earlier this month, weeks after Trump nominated him to be the next labor secretary. According to the most recent tax filings available, Puzder's work for the nonprofit was unpaid."}
{"original": "Nothing about having served on IFA's board should forbid Puzder from becoming labor secretary. But having been a board member of a lobby that sued to stop the overtime changes, Puzder showed a vested interest in whether the reforms survive, said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit ethics watchdog."}
{"original": "CREW believes that, if Puzder is confirmed, he should recuse himself from any work on the overtime issue for the duration of the lawsuit. Under the letter of the law, Libowitz said, the recusal should last a year from his board resignation; but under the spirit of the law, it should last as long as the matter is in the courts, he argued."}
{"original": "He was on the board and had a duty to the board to represent their interests, Libowitz said. You have to wonder whose interests is he representing. If he really wants to be clear here, he should recuse himself for the entire lifetime of the litigation. Things can take a long time in the courts."}
{"original": "Bloomberg via Getty Images Andrew Puzder, chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants, has argued publicly against Obama's proposed overtime rules."}
{"original": "The IFA does not agree there could be a conflict."}
{"original": "This is laughable and complete hyperbole by the Democrats trying to further muddy the waters and delay the process, said Matt Haller, a spokesman for the group."}
{"original": "Puzder's nomination hearing has been pushed back several times, but the holdup doesn't appear to be the fault of Democrats. Murray's office says they still have not received paperwork on Puzder's potential conflicts from the Office of Government Ethics, and Republicans, who hold the majority and set the Senate's calendars, have announced numerous delays to Puzder's hearing. It is now set for Feb. 7; it was originally slated for earlier this month."}
{"original": "Regardless of his work for IFA, Puzder's stance on the overtime reforms has been clear: He has argued publicly that the new system would force employers to cut jobs."}
{"original": "Under the reforms pursued by the Obama administration, millions more salaried workers would be entitled to time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week. The changes would have hit the fast-food industry hard, since many restaurant managers work long hours for low salaries, but are currently exempted from overtime pay because they're classified as managers."}
{"original": "Those are just the kind of workers the Obama administration had in mind when it developed the changes. By entitling more salaried workers to overtime pay, the new system would force employers to either limit their workload to 40 hours or start paying a premium for all the overtime."}
{"original": "The rules were slated to go into effect on Dec. 1, leading employers around the country to start implementing changes. But a federal judge in Texas agreed with the IFA and its allies that the administration overstepped its bounds with the rule, blocking it from going into effect. That ruling is currently on appeal. It will be up to the new Trump administration to defend the rule in court, leaving backers of the reform with little hope it will survive."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― There are no signs of a deal to end the partial government shutdown, but one thing is changing on Capitol Hill: the House majority."}
{"original": "On Thursday, Democrats will officially take over the House, and their first order of business ― after they've elected their speaker ― will be passing legislation extending funding to all the shuttered agencies, pressuring Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump to let go of the border wall fight and end the shutdown."}
{"original": "House Democrats plan to pass a combined six spending bills funding all the closed government agencies through September, with a separate stopgap bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security through February."}
{"original": "It is time to end this unnecessary shutdown and put the federal government fully back to work serving the American people, incoming Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said in a statement."}
{"original": "But House passage of the bill is unlikely to change much. Even though the Senate unanimously passed a clean continuing resolution at the end of December ― a stopgap spending bill extending operations without border wall money ― Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has vowed not to bring up another bill in this new Congress until there's agreement from Trump."}
{"original": "House Democrats will be able to argue that McConnell and Trump are standing in the way of paychecks for an estimated 800,000 federal workers ― more than half of whom are simply working without pay. Typically, Congress approves back pay for those furloughed workers, but government contractors will likely get nothing."}
{"original": "As Washington ― and the rest of the United States ― comes back from its holiday break, pressure to end the shutdown may grow. Americans already blame Trump more for the shutdown than Democrats, by a margin of 47 percent to 33 percent. And if the shutdown stretches on so long that Americans start feeling the effects ― like delayed tax refunds because of a shuttered IRS, or missed flights because of TSA workers striking ― Trump and other Republicans may start getting desperate."}
{"original": "NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he wouldn't accept just $2.5 billion in border wall funding."}
{"original": "Trump said Wednesday that it could be a long time before the closed government agencies are reopened."}
{"original": "The president vows to keep the shutdown going as long as Democrats don't give him money for his border wall, but he's shown no willingness to negotiate on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program, and Democrats have shown little willingness to give Trump even one dollar."}
{"original": "The distance between the two sides seems to be growing, as Trump reneged on a deal Vice President Mike Pence offered last week that would have delivered $2.5 billion for the wall, instead of the $5.6 billion Trump wants. Trump said Wednesday that he wouldn't accept just $2.5 billion."}
{"original": "Trump met with Democratic leaders on Wednesday at the White House, but there was once again no real movement."}
{"original": "Instead of cutting a hasty deal, Democrats seem more satisfied to demonstrate that it's Trump and Republicans standing in the way of a funded government."}
{"original": "Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who represents many federal employees in northern Virginia, said he was confident Democrats could wait the president out."}
{"original": "I don't know what leverage he has that he can exercise, Connolly told HuffPost on Wednesday. They started off with $5.5 billion or else. And we're now down to anything with a 2."}
{"original": "In the spending bills Democrats plan to pass on Thursday, the February date for DHS funding would serve to continue negotiations. Some Republicans in the House may end up voting for the bill, and there's a possibility that if the shutdown drags on for long enough, Senate Republicans could pass the bill and both chambers could override Trump's veto."}
{"original": "Democrats initially planned to make their first legislation in the majority a package of anti-corruption, campaign finance and democracy reform bills. That will now be the second item on their agenda, after funding the government, though they are still calling the anti-corruption package H.R. 1 and plan to pass that bill later on Thursday."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday joked that she had a new theory about what Fox News was really doing: elaborate, postmodern performance art."}

{"original": "In addition, the congresswoman had said it was immoral for billionaires to exist alongside extreme poverty and people who lack health care."}
{"original": "I do think that a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don't have access to public health is wrong, Ocasio-Cortez said per MarketWatch. She later clarified that she meant to say hookworm."}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez, who favors using higher marginal tax rates of up to 70 percent on earnings over $10 million to help fund a Green New Deal to tackle the climate crisis, also said that not all billionaires are immoral."}

{"original": "No one saw this coming. Not me, and therefore, I assume, no one else. In our defense, the teaser for Harry and Meghan: A Royal Romance provided no evidence — or even much justification for optimism — that the movie itself would be low-key amazing."}
{"original": "The brief trailer captured all the most cookie-cutter Lifetime moments (like Harry telling Meghan, I don't need my life to be this perfect royal picture. I just need you) and passionate bedroom interludes. This had a haunting appeal of its own, to be sure. It's ghoulish, but if Lifetime wants to show us fake Harry and fake Meghan smooching topless in bed, I will not turn away."}
{"original": "But approximately every third Lifetime rom-com features a prince going down on one knee in front of a comely American. What makes Harry and Meghan different from the usual offering of handsome-ish barista from Wisconsin portraying the crown prince of Mendavia woos onetime network sitcom child star playing an aspiring fashion designer — aside from how much wine I drank while watching (about half a bottle)?"}
{"original": "The script, for one thing, which hopscotches wildly from schmaltz to snark. After Princess Diana's funeral, Prince Charles takes his sons to Botswana, where he begins lecturing them on the importance of reflecting on the broader sweep of history by visiting the birthplace of mankind."}
{"original": "You're not going to start quoting 'Lion King' again, are you? Prince William says with a sigh. Yes! William's first line in the movie is a crack about the 1994 Disney movie The Lion King. Reader, I was done for."}
{"original": "And that's before we even meet the grown-up William, portrayed by Burgess Abernethy. How striking the resemblance — to your 43-year-old tax accountant. Grown-up William says things like I'm just having a giggle and uses a coffee mug that reads World's Best Dad."}
{"original": "Not every royal fares well in the script. The fake Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge (Laura Mitchell), takes on the tough but necessary job of making married life look miserable (Marriage isn't so bad, is it, Will? she asks her husband pointedly, as he evades her gaze), and the members of the royal family look calculating and cold. She doesn't like that Americans are so loud, and sniffs her doubts that this upstart actress could handle the rigors of royal life. By the time we see her assuring Meghan that us commoners have to stick together and confiding in her about feeling like a baby-making machine, it's too late: I hate Kate now."}
{"original": "It wasn't all sunshine and English tea roses for the real Harry and Meghan Markle either. I feared that Lifetime would gloss over the racist reaction Markle faced when their relationship became known and superimpose a more palatable, standard-issue rom-com conflict. But instead of giving us a lame storyline about Meghan — I don't know — seeing Harry kiss an ex-girlfriend's cheek and fleeing to Toronto in tears, Lifetime gave us some real talk about race."}
{"original": "OK, sometimes this real talk feels … not so real. At the end of the movie, Queen Elizabeth shows Harry and Meghan a portrait of her ancestor Queen Charlotte, a German princess with Portuguese roots who may have had African heritage. Oh, yes, you're of mixed race, Harry, says Elizabeth. And so am I! A very sweet scene that also seems a tad out of character for the matriarch of the royal family, which has long been cool about research into Charlotte's racial background."}
{"original": "Other moments feel more painfully honest. After a royal hanger-on at a tea makes a snide comment about Meghan's hair, then tries to touch it, Harry becomes righteously incensed. This is just how things are, she tells him. Let's fight how things are! he exclaims. If anyone can, it's you and me. She replies, calmly, You have never seen how ugly people can get about this. To enlighten him, she relates a painful story from her childhood about being out with her mother, who is black, and seeing a white man call her the N-word."}
{"original": "But fake Meghan does not say the N-word. She fully drops the word, in the middle of this primetime, soft-filter Sunday romance. Jesus, Lifetime, I hope you plan to pay the dry-cleaning bill for my wine-stained couch."}
{"original": "This could all have gone wildly awry; a script is only as good as the actors who bring it to life. Often Lifetime movies are fronted by former teen soap stars who check only one acting skill box, like sexy squinting or natural-seeming laugh or looks like she's really drinking coffee even though it's an empty cup."}
{"original": "But Parisa Fitz-Henley, as Meghan, and Murray Fraser, as Harry, are top-shelf Lifetime talents."}
{"original": "(Fun aside: Fraser is only 23, just a couple of years out of the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Fitz-Henley is 41! Talk about goddamn female empowerment. Let's cast more movies in which the woman is decades older than her male costar.)"}
{"original": "When Harry and Meghan engage in first-date banter about his showing up 40 minutes late, it could easily have been a cringingly wooden exchange of quips. I mean, It would really hurt my street cred to be seen in public with a guy who can't tell time is barely even a joke. But Fraser and Fitz-Henley deliver their lines like two people actually trying to impress each other on a date, not like two community theater actors doing a first table read, and I ate up every second of it. When they laughed, I laughed. When they caught their breath and leaned in for a kiss, I caught my breath and leaned toward the TV, which was unreceptive to my advances."}
{"original": "Or maybe it was the wine."}
{"original": "Look, Harry and Meghan: A Royal Romance is the type of movie best enjoyed with basement-level expectations. Do not cue this up on your DVR and head in expecting a special episode of The Crown. This is, as promised, just for the real monarchy trash out there. Only cornballs welcome here! An entire subplot of the film follows Harry's mystical lion sightings in Botswana, which may or may not be visitations from his late mother. Or, in my mind, Aslan. It's bonkers!"}
{"original": "The edges are rough, production-wise. Who can blame them? A top-quality movie doesn't get made and released in the six months between a royal couple's public engagement and their nuptials. At one memorable moment, the two's first blind date is interrupted by sunrise, which arrives with the abruptness of a powerful lamp being switched on offstage. At another, the film noticeably cuts to news footage of a car going into the real Buckingham Palace. Hey, they tried their best."}
{"original": "The movie, in general, leans heavily on their target audience's knowing the general arc and milestones of Harry and Markle's relationship, which relieves its creators of the obligation to transition smoothly from scene to scene. Why not just jam in a scene in which Harry confronts a crusty old British lady wearing a racist Blackamoor brooch at Pippa Middleton's wedding? Princess Michael of Kent did once wear a Blackamoor brooch at a lunch with Markle, and royal fans will be excited to see that tidbit pop up in the fictionalization."}
{"original": "The movie takes certain liberties with the timeline and the actual events in order to squeeze it into a rom-com template, but mostly it's just a checklist of aww-able moments: The engagement chicken! The public statement from Harry defending his new girlfriend! Meghan bonding with Elizabeth's corgis! Botswana!"}
{"original": "I thought Harry and Meghan: A Royal Romance would be terrible as well as intoxicating, but instead it was perfect as well as intoxicating. I loved the weird spirit lions. I loved the no-holds-barred approach to race and Meghan's feminist activism. I loved our new accountant uncle, William. I loved Kate's rebirth as the British Regina George. I loved when fake Harry told his family that he wouldn't make Meghan shut down her blog, The Tig, because that blog is part of her identity. (Anyway, she totally did shut down the blog, but I appreciate the sentiment.)"}

{"original": "This past November, students rallied on college campuses around the U.S. in the Million Student March to advocate for a minimum wage hike, free tuition and the cancellation of all student debt. We can all be encouraged by this revolution and hope more people will take up the cause."}
{"original": "The total U.S outstanding student loan debt is now at $1.2 trillion compared to $600 billion in 2006 (which, although half of today's level, is still outrageous). Students now pay more for public university education than state governments do; and that is a definite shift from the past. In 2012, states paid for 23% of tuition costs, down from 32% in 2003 and 75% in the 1970s."}
{"original": "Students, like so many others, have been hit by the new breed of economic hit men (EHMs) I describe in The New Confessions of an Economic Hit Man (out February 2016, pre-order now). The cost of education is going up, and to a large degree it is about enslavement through debt and fear."}
{"original": "Students burdened with debt are forced to work for the corporatocracy; they do not dare take any sort of independent stance or strike out on their own. The business world is not conducive to risk-taking like that. In fact, during the 1980s and 1990s, corporate influence on public policy caused a shift to encourage deregulation instead of entrepreneurship. Independents were scooped up by big corporations. Recent graduates who seek to be entrepreneurs can't take on new-business debt when they're already saddled with huge student loans and big corporations that employ tactics to destroy competition. Those same big corporations were bailed out after the last recession while students and small businesses were hit with increased costs and skyrocketing debt. The actions of modern EHMs in the U.S. are similar to those in the countries I exploited during the 1970s. Although many of those schemes were covert, this attack on education is overt."}
{"original": "It is time for us--you and me--to strike back. We must replace debt with generosity and fear with the courage to stand up to oppression."}
{"original": "One of the proposed ways to fund free tuition is through a speculation tax on Wall Street. Instead of bailing out big banks, let us bail out our intellectual capital, our students."}
{"original": "The Million Student March and other demonstrations on campuses show that our young people are recognizing the threats we all face to a just society and that they are marshaling the courage to resist those who would repress them. Revolutions happen because people come together and act. Young people are taking action and standing up against rising tuition costs. These are all powerful indicators that we can change things. For students to realize this and commit to action at a formative age gives me continued hope for the future that they (and all of us) can be empowered and that we will work toward a sustainable and regenerative world. It is time for a Life Economy that does not rely on debt and fear."}
{"original": "In my new book, I outline actions people of all ages can take to bring about a better world, including many ideas for students. Just one example: Speak out and question authority. The idea that you have to pay so much in tuition and the state is off the hook isn't an idea you have to accept. Challenge that regressive proposition."}

Whether it is a sign of allegiance to the returned warlord or a sign of respect to the so-called Warrior of God, remains to be determined."}
{"original": "So why is this Canada's problem?"}
{"original": "Well for starters, since 2001, from his hideout in Pakistan, Hekmatyar has guided his own legion of wannabe Warriors of God to the path to heaven, by sending them to Afghanistan to indiscriminately inflict maximum damage. Many of our fallen Canadians have likely been the victims of these heaven-bound passengers."}
{"original": "In early September 2016, the failing regime of Afghanistan signed a truce with Hekmatyar, granting him and his party the Hizb-i-Islami -- which ironically translates to Party of Islam -- full immunity, a Warrior of God`s welcome and financial compensation for ...his years of struggle for the peace and freedom of Afghanistan..."}

{"original": "In July 2016, the Trudeau government extended this country's financial aid to Afghanistan by another 150 million dollars per year until 2020. That is a little over half a billion dollars of Canadian tax payer's money to a country that has already received exponentially more funds than the U.S. Marshall Plan, which resuscitated Europe after World War II."}
{"original": "In their 2016 report, SIGAR unveiled an elaborate scheme nicknamed Ghost Soldiers in which scores of non-existent soldier names were listed on official Afghan government paper trails to collect higher funding. According to SIGAR, Afghanistan, a country the size of Texas, has more generals than the entire United States military, with over a thousand generals. Most of whom bought their stripes through ethnic or family patronage ...an insidious combination of poor leadership and corruption is the reason for the Afghan military's failure..."}

Both men have been conveniently and swiftly relocated to ambassadorial roles to Jordan and Kazakhstan, effectively avoiding any formal judicial inquiry or accountability."}
{"original": "The moral of the story is that no amount of wealth in the universe will fix the incompetence of the Afghan regime. In their failure to defeat the enemy and maintain its territorial sovereignty -- it sought to mask its shortcomings by bribing them with foreign aid, land and honorary titles."}
{"original": "Canadians should make no mistake that their tax dollars has/is and will be paying for Hekmatyar's lavish retirement."}
{"original": "If our American neighbour's longest military engagement has taught anyone anything -- it is that until the Afghan regime and those in position of power in Afghanistan are not held accountable and meticulously monitored, not only will there not be any gains, but both the Afghan people and the international community will suffer great losses, Hekmatyar being one of those incomprehensible failures."}

Wray has defended the bureau from Trump's attacks, but he's been quiet post-election as Trump has made broad, sweeping claims about mass voter fraud, which law enforcement officials say could inspire attacks by right-wing extremists convinced that the election was illegitimate."}
{"original": "The vast majority of town halls will put up council tax and hike charges as 80% fear for their financial survival, according to a new survey. An astounding 95% of English authority bosses plan a council tax hike while 93% said they will increase charges to make ends meet, the LGiU think tank discovered. The greatest immediate pressure on budgets came in children's services (32% of councils) followed by adult social care (28%), and housing and homelessness (19%), the report found. Adult social care was the greatest long-term pressure (38%), the survey said. Lord Porter, Local Government Association Chairman, said councils had been warning a cliff-edge was looming for council at the end of the decade. Some councils continue to be pushed perilously close to the financial edge, Porter said. Many will have to make tough decisions about which services have to be scaled back or stopped altogether to plug funding gaps. Extra council tax raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face. This means many councils face having to ask residents to pay more council tax while offering fewer services as a result."}

One source told me that, in a meeting with Sheldon Adelson and Robert Mercer a few years ago, the casino mogul asked Robert if he was familiar with certain big Republican players. According to the source, Robert shut him down. I don't know any of your fancy friends, he replied, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. And so it seemed almost inevitable that their paths converged with Bannon's when he took over Breitbart in 2012. The Mercers recognized Bannon as an ideological ally. They also appreciated how quickly he improved the website's finances. Unlike many people in their orbit, Bannon wasn't obsequious: According to one person who often spends time with them, he made zero effort to dress up around his benefactors, often appearing in sweatpants and looking almost like a homeless person. Bannon was respectful around Robert, says this person, but with Rebekah he was more apt to say precisely what he thought: He worked for Bob; he worked with Rebekah. Although the Mercers had initially been persuaded to back Texas senator Ted Cruz in the Republican primary, Bannon preferred Trump, and by the time of the Republican National Convention the Mercers were with him. Rebekah made her move last August, at a fundraiser at the East Hampton estate of Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets."}

It's simply not acceptable that we don't know how local government will work post 2020. Councils are calling for assurances around funding for the next three years and for a fundamental redesign of the finance system. At present government is offering neither. That has to change. Andrew Gwynne, Labour's Shadow Communities Secretary, added: These findings show that after almost eight years of cuts, councils are facing unprecedented pressures to balance their books. When faced with choices; of where to cut, and where to invest - the government has failed to show that they understood the real life, human challenges facing this country. There's now a widespread consensus, across the political divide, that how we fund local public services desperately needs reform, but the Government does not appear to be listening to the sector."}

Rebekah Mercer saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology.

Still, Robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various Hanley homes.

The temptation will be to incorporate a variety of long-term investment transactions and short-term credit transactions into underwriting portfolios, based on the many lessons learned as a result of previous claims. That temptation will be tempered, however, by the realization that history is no longer the teacher it once was.

{"original": "Almost everyone interviewed for this article, supporters and detractors alike, described her style as far more forceful than that of other powerful donors. Rebekah Mercer is rarely photographed. However, occasionally she can be found in the background of news photos, uncredited in the captions. Here she is arriving at Trump Tower on December 8, with Nick Ayers and Kellyanne Conway. DREW ANGERER/GETTY IMAGES But then the Mercers aren't typical donors in most senses beyond their extreme wealth. (The exact number of their billions is unknown.) Robert Mercer is a youthful-looking 70. As a boy growing up in New Mexico, he carried around a notebook filled with computer programs he had written. It's very unlikely that any of them actually worked, he has said. I didn't get to use a real computer until after high school. Robert went on to work for decades at IBM, where he had a reputation as a brilliant computer scientist. He made his vast fortune in his 50s, after his work on predicting financial markets led to his becoming co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world's most successful quantitative hedge funds. A longtime colleague, David Magerman, recalls that when Robert began working at Renaissance in 1993, he and his wife, Diana, were grounded, sweet people. (Magerman was suspended from Renaissance in February after making critical comments about Robert in The Wall Street Journal.) But money changed all that, he says. Diana started jetting off to Europe and flying to their yacht on weekends."}

He said that, by definition, teachers are not worth much because they aren't paid much. His beliefs were well-known at the firm, according to Magerman. But since Robert was so averse to publicity, his ideology wasn't seen as a cause for concern. None of us ever thought he would get his views out, because he only talked to his cats, Magerman told me. Robert's middle daughter Rebekah shares similar political beliefs, but she is also very articulate and, therefore, able to act as her father's mouthpiece. (Neither Rebekah nor Robert responded to detailed lists of questions for this article.) Under Rebekah's leadership, the family foundation poured some $70 million into conservative causes between 2009 and 2014. [1] 1. According to The Washington Post, the family donated $35 million to conservative think tanks and at least to $36.5 million to individual GOP races. The first candidate they threw their financial weight behind was Arthur Robinson, a chemist from Oregon who was running for Congress. He was best known in his district for co-founding an organization that is collecting thousands of vials of urine as part of an effort it says will revolutionize the evaluation of personal chemistry. Robinson didn't win, but he got closer than expected, and the Mercers got a taste of what their money could do."}

Remember a few paragraphs above where we said that the goal of environmental finance was to produce the lowest cost. Well it was a stroke of genius on the part of Mark Kim, DC Water's CFO, and Eric Letsinger, the CEO of Quantified Ventures, that they realized that lowest cost didn't necessarily mean lowest interest rate. So they built into the EIB a unique and brilliant feature: if the flow reduction exceeds 41.3%, DC Water will pay the investors an additional $3.3 million. BUT, if the flow reduction is less than 18.6%, then the investors will get $3.3 million less interest."}

For example, Apple has priced its new iPad Air and iPad Pro starting at $499 and $799 respectively. Apple is using a MSD strategy in addition to a WTMWB strategy because the iPhone has uniqueness built-in since Apple controls the platform. It also aims for a GPMT, which is not officially published, but which is in the 30 to 50% GPM range of well-positioned products in competitive markets. When Johnson & Johnson launched a margarine developed in Finland that lowers cholesterol, it priced a tub of this margarine at between $5.79 and $5.99. At the same time, a tub of regular margarine sold for 99¢. Based on this pricing, which used MSD and WTMWB strategies, many speculated that J&J priced the product at 8C, which gave it a GPMT of roughly 87.5%."}

Even a cursory examination of most of Warren's proposals shows that she is proposing just that, to remove tax subsidies for those who can afford to hire lobbyists and attend expensive fund raisers. Ryan, on the other hand, has been proposing tax subsidies or tax cuts for the very rich in the hope that, once digested by them, some of the remains might benefit the rest of us. Ryan, in short, is a plutocrat enabler, not a conservative and the media has an obligation to inform the public about what he is really proposing."}

Once your company knows the cost of sales (cost of goods and services sold) of a particular product and the Gross Profit Margin Target it wants, it can easily employ a GPMT strategy. Gross Profit Margin is defined by the formula (P-C)/P, where P=Price and C=Cost of Sales. Anybody can put this formula into a spreadsheet program, and as costs change, recalculate the price that will produce the targeted Gross Profit Margin. Most companies know the GPMT they want. If you don't, there are some common guidelines you can follow."}

She started attending Koch events and donating to the Goldwater Institute, a right-wing think tank based in Arizona. The family's political advocacy accelerated rapidly. It was in 2012 that she really attracted attention in GOP circles when, not long after Mitt Romney lost the presidential race, she stood up before a crowd of Romney supporters at the University Club of New York and delivered a scathing but detailed diatribe about his inadequate data and canvassing operation. Who is that woman? people in attendance asked. With SCL, Rebekah finally had the chance to prove she could do better. The company's American branch was renamed Cambridge Analytica, to emphasize the pedigree of its behavioral scientists. And Rebekah started flying Alexander Nix, the firm's Old Etonian CEO, around the country to introduce him to her contacts. Nix, 41, is not a data scientist (his background is in financial services), but he is a showy salesman. Dressed in impeccably tailored suits, he is in his element on stage making presentations at large conferences. He can, however, come across as arrogant.

In response to an extensive set of questions, Nix disputed this account of the meeting. He denied that Cambridge Analytica had obtained any data via Facebook—a source of controversy for the firm ever since The Guardian reported in 2015 that CA based its data on research spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission. Nix also claimed that it was the Cruz team that didn't have access to the RNC's Data Trust for much of the cycle and that all data used for the majority of the campaign was provided by Cambridge Analytica. However, Mike Shields, then the RNC's chief of staff and Data Trust's senior adviser, told me the Cruz campaign was in fact the second to sign an agreement with Data Trust, in 2014. Meanwhile, the red flags kept coming. Wilson found the data scientists that CA sent to Houston to be highly efficient at the day-to-day work of his research operation. But according to Cruz staffers, when he began to test CA's specialized models, he found that they were notably off, with, for example, some male voters miscategorized as women."}

{"original": "(From left to right) Patrick Caddell, Stephen Bannon, Lee and Alice Hanley On July Fourth weekend in 2014, members of the Mercer clan (Robert, Rebekah and her husband, Sylvain Mirochnikoff) went to visit some new friends. They traveled on Robert's 203-foot luxury superyacht, the Sea Owl, and anchored just off the WASP enclave of Fishers Island in New York's Long Island Sound. Their destination, a medieval-style granite castle called White Caps, towered over the shoreline. This was the summer home of Lee and Alice Hanley, Reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in Texas oil and gas but lived mostly between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. Like the Mercers, the Hanleys were convinced that the American political establishment was rotten to its foundations. Unlike the Mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider. It didn't matter whether the candidate came from the left or the right; voters just wanted somebody different. They had lost all faith in the ruling class—the government, the media, Wall Street."}

And, if you sell your product in a consumer market, it would be a good idea to also employ an MSD pricing strategy. For example, if you are a manufacturer that is targeting a GPM of 50% and your cost of sales is $15, you might consider selling the product for $29.99 - a penny less than the price of 2C.

Subsequently, Cruz proposed a 180-day suspension on all H1-B visas. Meanwhile, even though the Cruz staffers generally got along well with their CA counterparts—they sometimes took the visitors country-western dancing —the firm remained a source of friction. In retrospect, Wilson told people, he believed that Nix resented the campaign for allocating work through a competitive bidding process, rather than favoring CA. Two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Wilson assigned a contract to a firm called Targeted Victory. CA then locked its data in the cloud so it couldn't be accessed by Roe's team. The data remained unavailable until, a Cruz campaign source said, it was pretty much too late to be useful. Cruz won the Iowa caucuses anyway. The Cruz operation became so fed up with Nix that they pushed back, hard, on CA's bill for its second six-month contract. Wilson was able to negotiate the fees down after, as Cruz staffers recalled, a CA representative accidentally emailed him a spreadsheet documenting the Houston team's salaries. (Nix said CA had intended to send the spreadsheet.) Still, the campaign wound up paying nearly $6 million to CA—which represented almost half of the money the Mercers had pledged to spend on Cruz's behalf. The acrimony lingered long after Cruz exited the race in May. When he decided not to endorse Trump at the GOP convention, the Mercers publicly rebuked him."}

The political veterans were skeptical. I didn't understand what Nix was talking about, Perkins told me bluntly. Caddell says he was perplexed when Nix wouldn't show him the instruments CA used to predict voter behavior. He also thought the firm didn't grasp the seismic shift underway in American politics. And yet to his great surprise, Bannon vouched for CA, telling Caddell its scientists were geniuses. Caddell knew that Bannon was beholden to the Mercers—they were, after all, Breitbart's part-owners. According to The New York Times, however, Bannon was also vice president of CA's board. Even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist. After he learned of Bannon's involvement, Caddell stopped asking Bannon questions about CA. In the end, Bannon helped seal the deal between the Mercers and Cruz, with CA as the glue."}

So, they picked out 25 acres and installed flow meters to see what the pre-project runoff was."}
{"original": "According to two sources, one who strategized with the Mercers and another who worked closely with Trump, Rebekah insisted on a 30-minute face-to-face meeting with Trump, in which she informed him that his campaign was a disaster. (Her family had pledged $2 million to the effort about a month earlier, so she felt comfortable being frank.) Trump, who knew her slightly, was willing to listen. He had been disturbed by recent stories detailing disorganization in his campaign and alleging ties between Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and pro-Russia officials in Ukraine. Rebekah knew of this and arrived at her meeting with props, says the source who strategized with the Mercers: printouts of news articles about Manafort and Russia that she brandished as evidence that he had to go. And she also had a solution in mind: Trump should put Bannon in charge of the campaign and hire the pollster Kellyanne Conway. [3] 3. Conway had worked for the Mercers' super PAC. By the following morning, Rebekah was breakfasting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with the two people he trusts most, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to talk through the proposal in more detail. Within four days, Trump did exactly as Rebekah had advised. Manafort was out. Bannon was in charge. Trump also brought on David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, with whom the Mercers and Bannon had been close for years. Less than four months later, Mercer's handpicked team had pulled off one of the greatest upsets in American politics."}

Doing so allowed him to build 453 miles of new steel fencing along the 2,000-mile Mexican border, although only about 80 miles are in stretches where no previous barrier existed. (Trump had promised hundreds of times during his 2016 campaign that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, but in four years he never made that request even once, and Mexico never paid a dime.)"}

But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. Last December, about a month before Donald Trump's inauguration, Rebekah Mercer arrived at Stephen Bannon's office in Trump Tower, wearing a cape over a fur-trimmed dress and her distinctive diamond-studded glasses. Tall and imposing, Rebekah, known to close friends as Bekah, is the 43-year-old daughter of the reclusive billionaire Robert Mercer. If Trump was an unexpected victor, the Mercers were unexpected kingmakers. More established names in Republican politics, such as the Kochs and Paul Singer, had sat out the general election. But the Mercers had committed millions of dollars to a campaign that often seemed beyond salvaging. That support partly explains how Rebekah secured a spot on the executive committee of the Trump transition team. She was the only megadonor to frequent Bannon's sanctum, a characteristically bare-bones space containing little more than a whiteboard, a refrigerator and a conference table. Unlike the other offices, it also had a curtain so no one could see what was happening inside."}

In the summer of 2015, according to two sources, Rebekah reprimanded Cruz for an April article he'd co-authored with House Speaker Paul Ryan in The Wall Street Journal in support of free trade. She and Bannon told Cruz that he should adopt the positions of Jeff Sessions, whose views on trade and immigration were more in line with the conservative base. By this time, Cruz and his team were becoming increasingly concerned about Bannon's relationship with Rebekah. Bannon (who declined to comment for this article) was now blatantly pro-Trump.

Robert himself, by all accounts, is extremely introverted. Rarely seen in public, he likes to spend his free time with his wife and three daughters. When, in 2014, Robert accepted an award from the Association for Computational Linguistics, he recalled, in a soft voice and with quiet humor, his consternation at being informed that he was expected to give an oration on some topic or another for an hour, which, by the way, is more than I typically talk in a month. Sebastian Mallaby's account of the hedge-fund elite, More Money Than God, describes him as an icy cold poker player who doesn't remember having a nightmare. He likes model trains, having once purchased a set for $2.7 million, and has acquired one of the country's largest collections of machine guns. For years, Robert has embraced a supercharged libertarianism with idiosyncratic variations. He is reportedly pro-death penalty, pro-life and pro-gold standard. He has contributed to an ad campaign opposing the construction of the ground zero mosque; Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, a group that is associated with fringe scientific claims; and Black Americans for a Better Future—a vehicle, the Intercept discovered, for an African-American political consultant who has accused Barack Obama of relentless pandering to homosexuals."}

I don't know any of your fancy friends, Robert Mercer told Sheldon Adelson, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. That the family gravitated toward Andrew Breitbart's upstart website was no accident. The Mercers are purists, says Pat Caddell, a former aide to Jimmy Carter who has shifted to the right over the years. They believe Republican elites are too cozy with Wall Street and too soft on immigration, and that American free enterprise and competition are in mortal danger. Bekah Mercer might be prepared to put a Democrat in Susan Collins' seat simply to rid the party of Susan Collins, a family friend joked by way of illustrating her thinking. So intensely do the Mercers want to unseat Republican senator John McCain[2] 2. Some have speculated that McCain may have angered the Mercers in 2014, when the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which McCain was the ranking member at the time, asserted that Renaissance had used complex financial methods to underestimate its taxes by $6 billion.

{"original": "In markets where there is little or no competition, companies can employ a pricing strategy that optimizes profits. It is often called a What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB) price. This strategy sets the price based on the maximum price the market will pay for the product. On the one hand, the company wants to realize the highest profits possible in the shortest amount of time to help recoup high start-up costs, such R&D (research and development), production, and marketing costs. On the other, it may not want its profits to be so attractive as to entice cutthroat competition to enter the market within the time window it needs to build market share and establish a leadership position. This strategy typically works because those likely to buy a new product -- the Innovators and Early Adopters -- are not particularly price sensitive. If there is considerable uniqueness and desirability built into the product brand, your company can employ a WTMWB strategy. If not, you might consider other effective pricing strategies."}
