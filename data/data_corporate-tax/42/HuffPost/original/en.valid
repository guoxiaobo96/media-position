ROBYN BECK/Getty Images Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, right, did not get a chance to litigate his criticism of former Vice President Joe Biden's Social Security record at a debate this past Tuesday.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is finally firing back at Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' depiction of him as a longtime proponent of Social Security cuts, following a Tuesday debate in Des Moines, Iowa, that omitted the issue entirely.\n\nBut in seeking to reassure voters about his commitment to protecting Social Security, Biden is mischaracterizing Sanders' tactics.\n\nBiden inaccurately claimed on Saturday that a video circulated by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign had been doctored to make him seem more supportive of Social Security cuts than he really is.\n\nThe Sanders campaign has circulated video of part of a speech Biden delivered to the Brookings Institution in April 2018 in which he discusses his views about Social Security and appears to credit then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) for zeroing in on the program's financial problems. Below is a version of the clip that Sanders advisor Warren Gunnels shared.\n\nEver since Paul Ryan 1st proposed paying for Trump's tax breaks to the top 1% by cutting Social Security & Medicare, I've been proud to be by @BernieSanders side fighting against it.\n\n\n\nTo hear Biden say Ryan was correct to go after Social Security & Medicare is soul-wrenching. https://t.co/kfZz9qlqJd — Warren Gunnels (@GunnelsWarren) January 2, 2020\n\nHere is the clip with more context. Watch the full speech at C-SPAN.\n\nSanders adviser David Sirota has also referenced the speech in the Jan. 7 edition of his email newsletter, Bern Notice, claiming that Biden had lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare.\n\nPaul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code. What's the first thing he decided we had to go after? Social Security and Medicare, Biden said at the time. That's the only way you can find room to pay for it.\n\nWe need a pro-growth, progressive tax code that treats workers as job creators, as well, not just investors; that gets rid of un-protective loopholes like stepped-up basis; and it raises enough revenue to make sure that the Social Security and Medicare can stay, it still needs adjustments, but can stay; and pay for the things we all acknowledge will grow the country, he added.\n\nA voter asked Biden at a campaign event in Indianola, Iowa, on Saturday about claims she had heard in phone calls that Biden supports Social Security cuts.\n\nPolitifacts [sic] looked at it and they doctored the photo, they doctored the piece and it's acknowledged that it's a fake, Biden responded. What we're doing is we're putting out what the actual exchange between [former House Speaker] Paul Ryan and I were. And I have been a gigantic supporter of Social Security from the beginning.\n\nThe fact-checking site PolitiFact indeed rated Sirota's claims in his newsletter false, because Sirota omitted some words from Biden's speech to Brookings. Sirota, and a video that PolitiFact does not directly address, do not include Biden's insistence that a progressive tax code must raise enough revenue to make sure that the Social Security and Medicare can stay though those programs still needs adjustments.\n\nBut doctoring a video such that it could be considered a fake, generally refers to footage that is fabricated or tampered with, rather than a video excerpt that is simply lacking the full context.\n\nWhat's more, Biden's uses the term adjustments in reference to Social Security after going on a riff about whether affluent Americans actually need their benefits, making it sound as if he implicitly is interested in some form of means-testing or income-based benefit reductions.\n\nBiden's campaign maintains that the plan on his campaign website, which would increase benefits, is what he meant by adjustments. Biden would not so much as consider cutting Social Security benefits in any way, according to the campaign.\n\nNow, I don't know a whole lot of people in the top one-tenth of 1 percent or the top 1 percent who are relying on Social Security when they retire. I don't know a lot of them. Maybe you guys do, he said in his speech to Brookings, before launching into his plans for a pro-growth, progressive tax code.\n\nAs Biden notes in his conversation with the voter on Saturday, his Social Security plan would increase benefits and extend the program's solvency by lifting the cap on taxable income for Social Security purposes. The benefit increases he proposes include the creation of a minimum benefit at 125% of the federal poverty level, tackling poverty in late old age through a benefit bump-up for people collecting benefits for 20 years or more, and a change allowing surviving spouses to keep a larger share of benefits.\n\nBut in the past, some proposals to reform the program that have included at least one of these benefit increases also cut benefits in other ways.\n\nJoe Biden has a 40-year history of trying to cut Social Security, and he is doing everything he can to hide that record from voters. You can see Biden's record right here for yourself in 3 videos:\n\n\n\n1. https://t.co/HAJGvAjKMe\n\n\n\n2. https://t.co/ixQattKIXy\n\n\n\n3. https://t.co/k5G0fI5iXc https://t.co/kKMsRjbOVI — David Sirota (@davidsirota) January 18, 2020\n\nAnd as the Sanders campaign is fond of noting, Biden has a long history of endorsing Social Security benefit cuts dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nAs then-President Barack Obama's vice president, Biden served as Obama's liaison to Senate Republicans at a time when Obama had put a cut to Social Security cost-of-living adjustment on the table in pursuit of grand bargain that would also increase tax revenue. Obama would make that technical change, the chained consumer price index, part of his 2013 budget resolution, prompting a White House protest where Sanders spoke.\n\nJoe Biden should be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security. The facts are very clear: Biden not only pushed to cut Social Security ― he is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement on Saturday evening. The vice president must stop dodging questions about his record, and start explaining why he has so aggressively pushed to slash one of the most significant and successful social programs in American history, which millions of Americans rely on for survival.\n\nWhen asked for comment, Biden campaign staffer Andrew Bates said, As Bernie Sanders himself said in 2015: 'Joe Biden is a man who has devoted his entire life to public service and to the wellbeing of working families and the middle class.'
The New York attorney whose verbal harassment of two Spanish-speaking women went viral last week is now attempting to make amends for the racist rant.\n\nAaron Schlossberg posted an apology on Twitter on Tuesday for his behavior and insisted the manner in which I expressed myself is unacceptable and not the person I am.\n\nIn the rant, which was posted on Facebook by Edward Suazo, Schlossberg angrily confronted a restaurant employee for speaking Spanish in America.\n\nHe then threatened to get non-English speakers in the restaurant deported:\n\nMy guess is, they're not documented, so my next call is to ICE to have each one of [them] kicked out of my country. They have the balls to come here and live off of my money. I pay for their welfare, I pay for their ability to be here. The least they could do, the least they could do is speak English.\n\nSince the rant went public, the Trump-supporting Schlossberg has become a social pariah in multicultural New York.\n\nNot only was he evicted from his law offices, named in a disciplinary complaint and chased by reporters, but he was also trashed on Yelp and singled out for a mariachi band serenade.\n\nAs a result, many people speculated that Schlossberg's apology may come from a place of damage control and not sincere regret ― especially since a video from last year showed him yelling You are not a Jew at Jewish people supporting Palestinian rights, according to APlus.com.\n\n. Translation: I'm sorry people who know what a racist dick I am were able to ID me. I got booted from my office and I'm afraid to go home. I want you to THINK I'm sorry and hope you won't read between the lines to see that I'm not sorry for what I said, just that I got caught. — Diane Pavia (@diane_pavia) May 22, 2018\n\nYou're only apologizing because your career is being impacted.\n\n\n\nLet's see what the New York attorney disciplinary board thinks about your years-long pattern of harassment and bigotry... — Pé Resists (@4everNeverTrump) May 22, 2018\n\nYou suggest you don't want your money paying for their welfare. I don't want my tax dollars protecting you. Find a rock and hide beneath it until you have a sincere change of heart. I hope you see and hear Mariachi bands in your dreams. — Adrienne Nicodemus (@NicoEdCoach) May 22, 2018\n\nActually you are a racist (there are MULTIPLE videos confirming this) You're also a disgusting piece of shit who deserves no praise for this fake apology. Look deep inside yourself and work on the obvious issues you have with privilege, entitlement, and blind hatred. — Tacos Are Tasty (@JessicaSiler) May 22, 2018\n\nIf you aren't racist, why do you consistently go on huge racist rants? Why do you consistently harass people and call them racist names?\n\n\n\nIf this is an apology, it's shit and it's not accepted. You massive racist! 🌂 😡 — Jo Phillips (@joglasg) May 22, 2018\n\nHuffPost reached out to Schlossberg and to Suazo, the man who posted the video, neither of whom immediately responded.
WASHINGTON ― Live by the Sharpie. Die by the ballpoint.\n\nFrom the border wall with Mexico to the ban on transgender people in the military to travel prohibitions on majority-Muslim countries to the withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, many of former President Donald Trump's proudest accomplishments have been undone in just the first days of successor Joe Biden's administration.\n\nTrump's failure to codify his preferred policies through legislation, relying instead on a black Sharpie marker to scrawl his signature onto executive actions and then show them off for the cameras, left them vulnerable to Biden's signature on countermanding orders. And so far, the new president has signed dozens of them ― albeit with a ballpoint pen and less flourish, but every bit as effective ― wiping out much of Trump's legacy in a matter of days.\n\nElections have consequences, said a former Trump adviser on condition of anonymity.\n\nAP Photo/Susan Walsh President Donald Trump signs an executive order during a news conference at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Aug. 8, 2020.\n\nBiden took office at noon last Wednesday and did not arrive at the White House until nearly 4 p.m. Yet within two hours, he had signed 17 executive actions, including orders reentering the United States into the Paris agreement to combat climate change, ending the national emergency that Trump had declared to let him raid money for his border wall from the military construction budget, suspending Trump's ban on travel from a group of majority-Muslim nations, revoking Trump's order blocking the counting of undocumented immigrants in the 2020 census, and reinstating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that halts deportation of many immigrants who came into the country illegally as young children.\n\nIn the following days, Biden restored collective bargaining power for federal employees and ordered the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to find ways to keep workers across a range of industries safe from COVID-19.\n\nAnd on Monday, the new president rescinded the ban that Trump had imposed on transgender people serving in the military.\n\nIt's simple: America is safer when everyone qualified to serve can do so openly and with pride, Biden said in an Oval Office ceremony.\n\nThe rapid-fire reversals highlight Trump's reliance on implementing change on his own rather than building support for his ideas in Congress in order to pass laws.\n\nOn his promise to build a wall along the southern border, for example, Trump neglected it entirely during the two years Republicans controlled both the House and Senate, then triggered a monthlong government shutdown to try to coerce Congress into giving him funds to construct it, and finally declared a national emergency that provided a justification for him to raid military construction budgets ― taking money that otherwise would have gone for such things as schools and on-base housing for service members and their families. Doing so allowed him to build 453 miles of new steel fencing along the 2,000-mile Mexican border, although only about 80 miles are in stretches where no previous barrier existed. (Trump had promised hundreds of times during his 2016 campaign that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, but in four years he never made that request even once, and Mexico never paid a dime.)\n\nOne former White House official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that in Trump's first year, after failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the White House focused on passing the tax cut bill. They got it through while he had both houses of Congress, the former official said.\n\nCutting taxes, though, is a perennial priority for Republicans and almost certainly would have passed a GOP-controlled Congress with or without Trump's backing. Legislation pushing Trump's own agenda, on the other hand, was almost nonexistent.\n\nIndeed, the one notable exception was in 2018, when Trump's proposal to severely restrict immigration ― long a priority of top policy aide Stephen Miller ― was given a vote on the Senate floor and received just 41 yeas, the fewest of any of the plans under consideration that day.\n\nThe former White House aide said that vote pretty much ended Trump's interest in immigration legislation. That ship sailed after that first effort, he said.\n\nBiden, for his part, acknowledged that executive orders and memorandums can only get him so far.\n\nI'm proud of today's executive actions, and I'm going to start by keeping the promises I made to the American people, he said in the Oval Office on Inauguration Day, a tall brown stack of binders on his desk awaiting his signature. These are just executive actions. They are important, but we're going to need legislation for a lot of the things we're going to do.
After supporting trillions of dollars in new federal spending under President Donald Trump, Republicans in Congress are now worried about the national debt.\n\nCoincidentally, a Democrat is about to occupy the White House.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion worth of new spending on things like direct payments to households, unemployment benefits and a national program for vaccinating people against COVID-19. The Biden plan would support the economy at a time when employers are shedding jobs and an out-of-control pandemic is still killing more than 3,000 Americans daily.\n\nRepublicans supported trillions in pandemic relief spending last year, but at a confirmation hearing for Biden's Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen, Republicans prodded the former chair of the Federal Reserve about how much spending is too much.\n\nThe one thing that concerns me that nobody seems to be talking about anymore is the massive amount of debt that we continue to rack up as a nation and in fact, the president-elect has proposed a couple trillion dollars fiscal plan on top of that which we've already done, said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). Nobody seems to care much about it.\n\nYellen said that while the federal budget ought to be on a path that's sustainable, now is not the time to cut back.\n\nThe most important thing in my view that we can do today to put us on a path of fiscal sustainability is to defeat the pandemic, to provide relief to American people, Yellen said. To avoid doing what we need to do now to address the pandemic and the economic damage that it is causing would likely leave us in a worse place fiscally with respect to our debt situation.\n\nThe national debt is the sum of the federal government's past budget deficits, which result from the government spending more money than it raises through taxes in a given year. Economists have said that too much government borrowing could hurt the economy at some point or limit the government's ability to respond to a crisis, but the ever-widening deficits of the Trump years, which have pushed the national debt to historic levels, do not appear to have caused any problems ― or that much concern among Republicans.\n\nEven before the pandemic, with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, and no recession or national emergency, Republicans abandoned their prior calls for fiscal discipline and added nearly $4 trillion to the national debt through tax cuts and new spending.\n\nIn response to a question from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) about what economic metric might offer a clue that the government is borrowing too much, Yellen pointed to the amount that the government spends on interest on the debt. As a percentage of the U.S. economy, interest costs have risen much more slowly than the debt itself, reflecting the continued willingness of financial institutions to loan money to the government. Net interest outlays actually declined last year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, despite a surge of pandemic borrowing.\n\nLankford seemed unimpressed.\n\nI would submit that we have to find an earlier warning sign because once interest rates start kicking up, in some ways it is too late, Lankford said.\n\nRepublicans sometimes dislike federal spending for other reasons that are less theoretical than the debt burden. Business owners complain that federal unemployment benefits put upward pressure on wages, and a booming economy will make it harder for Republicans to retake the White House in 2024.\n\nDuring Barack Obama's presidency, Republicans often insisted that any spending on relief for workers be offset by cuts to other parts of the budget, even though the sums at stake typically represented a tiny fraction of what Republicans approved in the Trump years.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) warned low interest rates could rise, that the federal budget deficit is frightening and that Yellen should be a voice of fiscal sanity within the administration.\n\nYellen pledged to be that voice, but said fiscal restraint is for later. Right now, short-term, I feel that we can afford what it takes to get the economy back on its feet, to get us through the pandemic, and to relieve the burdens that it is placing on households and small businesses, she said, adding that helping a weak economy can result in a lower debt burden long-term.\n\nThe debt threat is relatively remote stacked against the threat of plague-related job loss and poverty facing millions of Americans. In her prepared testimony, Yellen anticipated the debt concerns but said they were not a good reason for lawmakers not to mitigate pointless human suffering.\n\nThe smartest thing we can do is act big, she said. In the long run, I believe the benefits will far outweigh the costs, especially if we care about helping people who have been struggling for a very long time.
The Director of Windows Business Group Vineet Durani speaks during the launch of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 tablet in the Indian capital New Delhi on January 7, 2016. AFP PHOTO / CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP / Chandan Khanna (Photo credit should read CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella will be sitting in the House gallery as an honored guest at the State of the Union (SOTU) address tonight. By all rights, he be should sitting before a Congressional committee instead, answering for his company's blatant tax avoidance.\n\nMicrosoft is playing a game called Global Tax Dodge. But don't look for it on the company's Xbox video system. It's only available to Microsoft's accountants and high-priced lawyers. Even though the rest of us can't play, we all foot the company's $34 billion price tag.\n\nThat's about the amount of tax revenue Microsoft is not paying because it has stashed $108 billion in profits offshore. As revealed in a Seattle Times report last month, Microsoft uses a web of overseas subsidiaries to dodge U.S. taxes, knocking its tax rate down to a minuscule 4.5 per cent on its offshore profits. That's lower than most working families pay.\n\nThe money you fork over for that Xbox or Office suite at the local mall takes a circuitous route to Microsoft's bottom line, stopping in tax havens (Bermuda twice) just long enough to shake off tax liability.\n\nMicrosoft began building this tax avoidance maze more than 20 years ago when it shifted software royalty rights to a dummy corporation in Nevada to avoid a levy in its home state of Washington. That first domestic dodge eventually grew into the company's current system of tax avoidance based in tax havens around the world.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the biggest offshore tax dodgers, but a handful of other huge companies play the same game. American corporations have more than $2 trillion in untaxed earnings packed away overseas. Altogether, they owe us some $600 billion.\n\nImagine the items we could check off our list of public needs if we collected all those unpaid corporate taxes: shortening commutes by improving highways and transit systems; easing overcrowding in schools; finding the next big medical cure.\n\nPresident Obama may well outline plans to address some of those public challenges in his SOTU speech. The audience, including the Congressional leadership and Microsoft CEO Nadella, will doubtless applaud.\n\nBut if Nadella really wanted to show his support, he'd stop his company's tax dodging. And Congressional leaders would make true corporate tax reform a priority, forcing big corporations to finally start paying their fair share.\n\nUnfortunately, most tax reform talk these days focuses on the supposed need to lower America's official corporate tax rate of 35 per cent. But as the example of Microsoft proves, that rate is easily sidestepped. Numerous studies have found that, after all their deductions, credits and other breaks, corporations actually pay only about half the official rate. And all those profits stashed offshore have only been taxed at 6 per cent, because they are mostly in tax havens. A huge loophole lets U.S. corporations avoid income taxes on those profits until they are brought home--which may never happen.\n\nSome companies zero out their tax obligation altogether. Boeing, General Electric and PriceLine.com are among two dozen profitable U.S. firms that went five years without paying a nickel in federal income taxes, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.\n\nAnd yet big corporations like Microsoft still want more. They are fighting for legislation in Congress that would exempt all of their offshore profits from any U.S. taxes. Known as a territorial tax system, this will create even more incentives to shift profits--and jobs -offshore. Instead, U.S. corporations should pay the same tax rate on profits no matter where they are earned.\n\nIf Nadella ever does take that seat at a committee witness table, he'd be following the Microsoft tax executive who testified about the company's offshore tax dodging before the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations three years ago. That panel outlined Microsoft's offshore tax dodging maze back in 2012; the recent newspaper report added important details, but the basic structure was already known.\n\nThe Subcommittee, using Microsoft as Exhibit 1 of corporate tax abuse, called for real reforms. But nothing happened because corporate lobbyists control the agenda. Reform that makes corporations pay their fair share might get a needed boost if President Obama endorsed it in his speech--even if one of the invited guests doesn't clap.\n\n\n\nFrank Clemente is executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness.
Nope. His core promise was that Mexico would pay for the wall. Now he has shut down the government for 29 days because he cannot get us to pay for it. More than 800,000 people are without a paycheck. When you lie for him, you are killing the Republican Party.
WASHINGTON (AP) — After days out of sight following the Capitol siege, President Donald Trump travels to Texas to trumpet one of the pillars of his presidency: his campaign against illegal immigration.\n\nTrump will be flying Tuesday to Alamo, Texas, a city in the Rio Grande Valley near the U.S-Mexican border. The city is named after the San Antonio mission where a small group of Texan independence-fighters fended off Mexican forces during a 13-day siege. Most of them died but the mission became a symbol of resistance for Texans, who eventually defeated the Mexican army.\n\nTrump's visit — no doubt a symbol of the president's defiance — comes as he spends the final days of his presidency isolated, aggrieved and staring down the prospect of a second impeachment after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol last week in an effort to halt the peaceful transition of power.\n\nAides have been urging the president to instead use the days he has left in office to highlight what they see as the chief accomplishments of his presidency: a massive tax cut, his efforts to roll back federal regulations and the transformation of federal courts with the appointment of conservative judges. But Trump has repeatedly resisted their efforts as he has remained ensconced in the White House, behind closed doors, consumed by baseless allegations of voter fraud and conspiracies.\n\nIndeed, the trip will mark the first time Trump has been seen in public since the speech he delivered to his supporters Wednesday, egging them on to fight before the Capitol violence.\n\nTrump is expected to deliver remarks highlighting his administration's efforts to curb illegal immigration and the progress made on his signature 2016 campaign promise: building a big, beautiful wall across the length of the southern border — an imposing structure made of concrete and reinforced steel. Over time, Trump demanded modifications that have been largely rejected: He wanted it painted black to burn the hands of those who touched it; he wanted it adorned with deadly spikes; he even wanted to surround it with an alligator-filled moat.\n\nIn the end, his administration has overseen the construction of roughly 450 miles of border wall construction — likely reaching 475 miles by Inauguration Day. The vast majority of that wall replaces smaller barriers that had already existed, though the new wall is considerably more difficult to bypass.\n\nOver the last four years, Trump and his administration have taken extreme — and often unlawful — action to try to curb both illegal and legal immigration. Their efforts were aided in his final year by the coronavirus pandemic, which ground international travel to a halt. But the number of people stopped trying to cross the southern border illegally has been creeping back up in recent months. Figures from December show nearly 74,000 encounters at the southwest border, up 3% from November and up 81% from a year earlier.\n\nMark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has warned the next administration that easing Trump administration policies, including a halt to wall construction, would lead to a surge of people seeking to cross the border, creating an unmitigated crisis in the first few weeks.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has said he'd halt construction of the border wall and take executive action where possible to reverse some of Trump's restrictions on legal immigration and asylum seekers. But Biden and his aides have acknowledged the possibility of a new crisis at the border if they act too quickly, and Biden has said it could take six months for his administration to secure funding and put in place the necessary infrastructure to loosen Trump-era restrictions.\n\nMissing from the trip will be Chad Wolf, Trump's acting Department of Homeland Security secretary. He abruptly resigned Monday, days after he pledged to serve out Trump's full term.\n\nAfter the Capitol violence, groups including the Southern Poverty Law Center urged Trump to call off his visit.\n\nThe violence Trump incited last week, and the violence his anti-immigrant policies cause stem from the alarming mainstreaming of white nationalist ideology that our country must reckon with and fight to uproot, said Efrén Olivares, deputy legal director of the center's Immigrant Justice Project. The president's planned trip to the border will only further the harm and beget more violence.\n\n___ Associated Press writers Ben Fox and Alexandra Jaffe in Washington and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.
Sean Hannity is losing it over progressive Democrats' Green New Deal, a policy proposal that would push the country toward 100 percent renewable energy over about a decade.\n\nHe is particularly upset about an idea from freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to finance the plan by introducing a marginal tax rate of up to 70 percent for the nation's wealthiest people. Doing so would have dreadful effects on the very rich, Hannity said Tuesday in an at-times nonsensical rant on his radio program.\n\nIf wealthy Americans were taxed more ― or, in Hannity's words, if their wealth were confiscated ― rich people are not going to remodel their homes, they're not going to build new homes, he claimed.\n\nThe contractor, the electrician, the plumber, the carpenters ― they're the ones that benefit when rich people spend money on their homes, continued Hannity, who has been linked to shell companies that spent tens of millions investing in residential real estate over the last decade.\n\nThe idea that wealth trickles down from the richest to those less privileged has been bashed by none other than billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has argued that people like him should pay more in taxes.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has floated the tax hike only on income in excess of $10 million. Hannity earned $36 million last year, according to Forbes.\n\nCar manufacturers, the host said, would also hurt if multimillionaires were asked to contribute more to benefit social programs.\n\nHe continued, bizarrely: All of a sudden, 'Well, maybe I'm going to hang on to that old clunker for another five years because I can't afford another new home because the government's taking a bigger portion of my income every year.'\n\nThe Fox News personality made similar claims on his radio show last week, when he said that Ocasio-Cortez would prevent wealthy people from buying boats that they like recreationally.\n\nOn Tuesday, he doubled down.\n\nPeople got mad at me, they said, 'Hannity, you were talking about, well, rich people won't buy boats.' No, rich people won't go to restaurants, because they won't have the money, he claimed without evidence. Rich people won't invest in companies, that means they're not going to hire people.\n\nOcasio-Cortez and other proponents of the Green New Deal have argued that the program would help alleviate inequality through public spending on sustainable energy sources aimed at curbing the devastating effects of climate change on low-income communities. Precisely how much the plan would cost, however, has not yet been hashed out.
Last week, we all watched the ultimate David vs. Goliath battle play out. Members of the subreddit r/WallStreetBets drove up the stock prices for a handful of dying companies, including GameStop, BlackBerry and AMC, thwarting a hedge fund's plans to short sell these stocks for massive profits.\n\nThe short-squeeze of GameStop in particular caused shares to shoot up nearly 2,000% from the beginning of January, though it has since dropped significantly. Some of the young day traders of Reddit were made millionaires overnight ― on paper, anyway. Short sellers, well, lost their shorts.\n\nClearly, both sides are playing a giant game, with the stock market as the game board, said Pam Krueger, founder and CEO of Wealthramp, a referral service for financial advisers.\n\nHedge funds have been gambling like this with leverage forever, unfettered, she said, adding that Robinhood, the commission-free trading app favored by many Redditors, has been inciting these day traders to play the game.\n\nFor the average investor, however, it's a dangerous world to get involved in.\n\nSo many younger people who are betting their 401(k)s and house down payments on GameStop will not have a seat at the table when the music finally stops, Krueger said. The truth is that Main Street investors shouldn't get swept up in headlines and worry about what a handful people are doing in the stock market. After all, this type of market speculation isn't investing, it's gambling.\n\nSo if you've been feeling some serious FOMO amid the GameStop market hype, here's why you should let it go and focus on a long-term ― and boring ― investment strategy.\n\nDon't Try This At Home\n\nIt's easy to get swept up in the GameStop success stories. One Redditor claimed to use his stock market profits to pay off his student loans. Another paid for his dog's lifesaving surgery. But that doesn't mean anyone with a Reddit account and some cash to burn should get into the same kind of day trading activity.\n\nHistory shows that timing the market is extremely difficult to do, said Brittney Castro, in-house certified financial planner for the personal finance company Mint. It's a high risk for potential high return, but you can think of it like gambling in the sense that most of the time, you'll probably lose.\n\nIn fact, only 1% of investors who attempt to time the market do so successfully.\n\nLike we saw last week with GameStop and AMC, at any given point, there are a number of factors that can come in and completely change the direction of any given stock or market index that may be completely irrelevant to the fundamentals of investing, such as investing in companies with strong balance sheets, Castro said. Those types of curveballs make successfully timing the market on a consistent basis nearly impossible.\n\nThe investors who manipulated the market and made money off a few stocks got lucky, to say the least. But plenty more missed the mark, including YouTuber David Dobrik, who lost $85,000 trying to ride the GameStop wave.\n\nThere are also a few financial considerations when it comes to day trading that newbie traders might not think about. Taxes, for example, are a big one.\n\nWhen you sell investments in a nonretirement account at a profit, you have to pay a capital gains tax. In 2020, the capital gains rate is either 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on your income and filing status ― that is, unless you held the asset for less than a year. In that case, your earnings are taxed as ordinary income according to current tax brackets. And keep in mind that your stock market earnings could bump you into a higher bracket.\n\nSo what does make sense as an investment strategy?\n\nIf you want to pick stocks, ask yourself what companies are poised for long-term growth, said Trevor Ward, a certified public accountant and financial planner at Kinetic Financial. Consider what competitive edge that company has and how it is changing its industry. Ward also recommended looking at its finances ― compare debt to assets and stock price to earnings. You should also understand who makes up the management team.\n\nIf You Must Engage In High-Risk Trading …\n\nIf you are going to dabble in high-risk trading, Castro said you should have a few other things in order first.\n\nWell-funded emergency savings: Before you start investing too heavily, it's important to have an emergency fund to fall back on. After all, you should never invest money you might need to pay bills or cover an unexpected expense. Having those emergency savings set aside can help you avoid falling into debt if the rest of your cash is tied up in the market.\n\nAdequate insurance: You should also make sure you have insurance in place, such as health, life, home, etc., before getting involved in the complexities of day trading. Make sure you have ways to protect your money, your assets and yourself, Castro said.
As a result of profit declines three quarters in a row, Bloomberg claims that the US is slipping into a profit recession. Some believe this is a result of a slump in crude oil prices and a sharp rise of the dollar. Of course, it is easy to point to those or even a slowdown of the Chinese economy. Instead of looking at the glass is half empty, some argue that these might be good things. There are definitely trade-offs. To increase profits, too many businesses focus on cutting expenses. That's the easier thing to do, and is one way to greater profits if there is not a corresponding decline in quality. Unfortunately, too many expense cuts come with quality declines -- especially when inferior materials are substituted or labor cuts cause drops in customer service.\n\nLower expenses financed by those that work for a living\n\nSince the financial meltdown, salaried employees have financed the cutting of expenses. Too many jobs and profits have gone bye bye. According to Bloomberg, US companies are keeping $2.1 trillion overseas to avoid taxes. Some pay less income tax than you and I. When consumers have less money to spend, this creates a vicious cycle, which hurts these companies too. To help avoid these problems, many believe it is preferably to focus on revenue to increase profits because that can produce more win-win situations where all boats rise. Where does revenue come from? It's the result of price times quantity (Revenue = Price x Quantity).\n\nPricing\n\nPricing is one of the fundamental building blocks of marketing. Many believe price is easy to understand when, in fact, it is one of the most difficult. McKinsey points out in an article entitled Shedding the commodity mind-set, too many companies leave large amounts of money on the table. Pricing experts know that setting the right price is difficult because, in addition to the physical factors of cost and profit, price is subject to psychological factors. The best companies can do to have control over these psychological factors is to do a great job of branding. And to get the branding right, companies have to know how to develop the right underlying corporate image and positioning strategies. In short, creating a brand image of the product that is impossible, or extremely difficult, to copy is the key to having control over your pricing strategies. If you are able to do that, you will be able to employ the most powerful and effective of all pricing strategies -- What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB).\n\nWhat the Market Will Bear\n\nIn markets where there is little or no competition, companies can employ a pricing strategy that optimizes profits. It is often called a What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB) price. This strategy sets the price based on the maximum price the market will pay for the product. On the one hand, the company wants to realize the highest profits possible in the shortest amount of time to help recoup high start-up costs, such R&D (research and development), production, and marketing costs. On the other, it may not want its profits to be so attractive as to entice cutthroat competition to enter the market within the time window it needs to build market share and establish a leadership position. This strategy typically works because those likely to buy a new product -- the Innovators and Early Adopters -- are not particularly price sensitive. If there is considerable uniqueness and desirability built into the product brand, your company can employ a WTMWB strategy. If not, you might consider other effective pricing strategies.\n\nGross Profit Margin Target\n\nIn almost all cases, pricing strategies should begin with a Gross Profit Margin Target (GPMT) strategy. Companies typically know the gross profit margin they need to pay back their expenses and generate positive net income and cash flow. Once your company knows the cost of sales (cost of goods and services sold) of a particular product and the Gross Profit Margin Target it wants, it can easily employ a GPMT strategy. Gross Profit Margin is defined by the formula (P-C)/P, where P=Price and C=Cost of Sales. Anybody can put this formula into a spreadsheet program, and as costs change, recalculate the price that will produce the targeted Gross Profit Margin. Most companies know the GPMT they want. If you don't, there are some common guidelines you can follow.\n\nManufacturers typically aim for a GPMT of 50%\n\nDistributors (Wholesalers) usually need a GPM of 10 to 15%\n\nDealers (Retailers) require a GPM of 30 to 50% (the higher percentage is for retailers that have to train people (customers and employees) to use the product and the lower margin is for retailers that are selling a product that does not require after-sale support.\n\nThe price, or marked-up cost, to achieve these target GPMs is as follows:\n\nManufacturers P=2C so the formula is (2C-C)/2C = 0.5, yielding a GPM of 50%\n\nDistributors P=1.18C so the formula is (1.18C-C)/1.18, which will give them a 15% GPM\n\nDealers P=1.5C so the formula is (1.5C-C)/1.5C, for a 33% GPM.\n\nWhen I develop pricing strategies for a client that is a manufacturer, I always start with a GPMT pricing strategy that is twice their cost, or 2C, since that is an easy calculation that will give them their GPMT of 50%.\n\nMost Significant Digit Pricing\n\nFor products that will be sold to consumers, most companies employ a Most Significant Digit (MSD) pricing strategy. Why? Studies and experience show that sales will be significantly higher if a product is priced at say $29.95 or $29.99 instead of $30. Most humans focus on the most significant digit - the 2 in this case. To them $29.95 or $29.99 seems a lot less than $30 even though it is only 1 to 5¢ less. Even expensive homes in Beverly Hills might sell for $7,995,000 rather than $8 million. There are exceptions. In upscale restaurants, it is usually a mistake to price an entrée at $31.95. Instead it will be priced at $32-. For some reason, people do not think the food is as good if MSD pricing is used in a high-end restaurant.\n\nCombining all three\n\nIf a product is positioned as unique, smart marketing companies will typically use all three of these strategies in combination. For example, Apple has priced its new iPad Air and iPad Pro starting at $499 and $799 respectively. Apple is using a MSD strategy in addition to a WTMWB strategy because the iPhone has uniqueness built-in since Apple controls the platform. It also aims for a GPMT, which is not officially published, but which is in the 30 to 50% GPM range of well-positioned products in competitive markets. When Johnson & Johnson launched a margarine developed in Finland that lowers cholesterol, it priced a tub of this margarine at between $5.79 and $5.99. At the same time, a tub of regular margarine sold for 99¢. Based on this pricing, which used MSD and WTMWB strategies, many speculated that J&J priced the product at 8C, which gave it a GPMT of roughly 87.5%.\n\nPricing your products\n\nWhen you are pricing your products, what gives you control over the price is the uniqueness built into your positioning, or branding, strategy. If you have created a product image that is impossible, or very difficult, to copy, you can employ a WTMWB price that will give you a good GPM that enables you to achieve your desired GPMT. And, if you sell your product in a consumer market, it would be a good idea to also employ an MSD pricing strategy. For example, if you are a manufacturer that is targeting a GPM of 50% and your cost of sales is $15, you might consider selling the product for $29.99 - a penny less than the price of 2C. Best of luck.
Just weeks before the severity of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the United States became unmistakable, President Donald Trump's administration offered states a way to make significant cuts to their Medicaid programs, which provide health care coverage for just over 20% of the population.\n\nThe rapid spread of the disease is now making a clear case for why this initiative would be harmful to vulnerable Americans. According to one estimate, the cost of COVID-19 treatment can exceed $20,000.\n\nThe policy, which the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services calls Healthy Adult Opportunity, is the Trump administration's attempt to accomplish a long-held Republican goal: to shrink Medicaid by establishing annual caps on how much federal money goes to state Medicaid programs.\n\nThat would be a massive change from how the program currently works, with federal and state governments together spending whatever it costs to treat beneficiaries. This setup allows Medicaid funding to expand during economic downturns and public health emergencies.\n\nProponents of the new policy tout the flexibility it provides states to remake their health care programs for low-income people, but the reality is that flexibility would translate into states cutting enrollment, cutting benefits or both.\n\nIt is code for doing less, said John Holahan, a health policy researcher and fellow at the Urban Institute. It would be literally cuts, of one form or another, if they couldn't live within the caps that they agreed to, which in this situation where we are today, they clearly couldn't. Holahan published a policy brief on Wednesday outlining the negative effects of limiting federal Medicaid spending during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nRepublicans generally favor reducing government spending and enrollment in safety net programs. But kicking people off benefits is unpopular, so it's politically easier to push reforms that sound bureaucratic and benign. The new policy's block grants, for instance, are an administrative maneuver masking a clear goal: reduced spending and fewer people getting benefits. In the 1990s, the Republican Congress and Democratic President Bill Clinton converted cash welfare into block grants, resulting in significantly less aid being provided to low-income families.\n\nMore than 70 million people in the United States were covered by Medicaid as of December, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. About 30 million potentially could be subject to the new Trump limits on the program's funding, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and the recession that's very likely to hit the U.S. economy offer a case study in how this kind of financing scheme puts Americans who earn very little at risk of getting sick or losing a job ― or both ― during a crisis.\n\nA Poorly Timed Bad Idea\n\nThe concept behind block grants and similar proposals for Medicaid is simple: Instead of open-ended federal funding to cover whatever costs the state's Medicaid beneficiaries require, the state gets a flat amount of money it must stretch over the year. And that amount is less than states get now.\n\nThe Trump initiative would allow states to choose between receiving a block grant ― a flat dollar amount per year ― that increases slightly faster than medical price inflation or a per-capita cap based on the number of current Medicaid enrollees that rises at the same rate as medical inflation. The per-capita cap option is less problematic than the block grants and offers states more financial leeway, but both would result in benefit and enrollment cuts, Holahan said.\n\nAs the Urban Institute policy brief illustrates, this financing mechanism wouldn't be adequate to cover current costs, let alone higher expenses associated with growth in the number of people using Medicaid or the costs of COVID-19 treatments. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected last year that Medicaid spending would increase 6% annually between 2019 and 2027. By contrast, medical inflation has risen less than 3% in recent years, according to the brief.\n\nWhile states that participate may request additional federal Medicaid funds during an emergency, those funds are not guaranteed and would require swift approval to be useful to states during crises. Under traditional Medicaid, the funding would automatically flow.\n\nUnder the Trump policy, announced in January, a state facing increasing Medicaid enrollment or higher spending on medical care for enrollees could choose to jettison people from the program or eliminate covered benefits. The alternative would be for the state to increase its own spending to maintain coverage and benefits, which would be significantly challenging because nearly all states must balance their budgets and can't turn to deficit spending. And given that this proposal is designed to appeal to Republican state officials, tax increases to finance additional spending would be unlikely.\n\nIt would put [states] in a horrendous position if they have a significant outbreak, Holahan said. It would either be bad for them fiscally if they decide to serve everybody or it would be bad for people if they decide that they couldn't because they agreed to this capped amount of federal money.\n\nNevertheless, the Republican governors of Oklahoma and Tennessee are still seeking federal approval to accept more limited federal funding for their Medicaid programs, respectively known as SoonerCare and TennCare.\n\nThe Anticipated Rise In Medicaid Enrollment\n\nTimes of rising unemployment and shrinking incomes tend to lead to large increases in Medicaid enrollment as people find themselves with less or no earnings and become eligible for the program. That leads to higher Medicaid spending. And a nationwide outbreak of a highly contagious virus that can lead to tens of thousands of dollars in medical costs will drive spending even higher this time. During the recession that began at the end of the last decade, millions of Americans enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nIn fact, Congress has already recognized these realities. The first coronavirus emergency bill that Trump signed includes additional Medicaid funding for states as a means of shoring up their budgets. That law also forbids states from cutting enrollment or benefits as a condition for receiving the temporary bonus funds. Extra Medicaid funding is a common form of helping state budgets and providing economic stimulus during recessions.\n\nAnd even as the Trump administration continues to support its Healthy Adult Opportunity initiative, federal authorities are taking other steps to shore up the Medicaid program amid the outbreak. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is swiftly approving states' requests to relax Medicaid enrollment rules to make it easier for qualified individuals to sign up.\n\nBut a catastrophic epidemic is unlikely to dissuade Republicans who have been clamoring to substantially curtail Medicaid. The GOP's failed Obamacare replacement bill in 2017 included a similar block grants proposal and the party has been trying to impose one since the 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan backed a version of the policy.\n\nThe Trump administration's new Medicaid funding plan is based on the same principles as those previous versions.\n\nToday, Medicaid is an entitlement program, like Medicare and Social Security, meaning that spending automatically rises to cover the costs incurred for medical care. The federal government finances more than half of Medicaid expenses, with states picking up the remaining share, which eases the fiscal burden on states, especially when the economy is poor. But states that adopt the Healthy Adult Opportunity program would give up that open-ended guarantee of federal funding.\n\nIn exchange for accepting less federal money, these states would gain new authorities to alter their Medicaid programs without seeking further federal approval. Depending on a state's specific plan, it could impose eligibility and benefit cuts, cost-sharing and other burdens on a subset of adult Medicaid enrollees.\n\nThat includes parents, pregnant women who earn just over the poverty level, and adults who live in states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The lowest-income pregnant women are exempt, as are people over 65, patients in long-term care, and individuals who receive federal disability benefits.\n\nMedicaid enrollees in states that adopt a block grant or per-capita cap could face new barriers to care, including monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and they could be kicked off the program for failing to pay.\n\nStates could also limit access to certain medications, or eliminate Medicaid's retroactive eligibility standard that covers recent medical expenses accumulated by new enrollees prior to signing up, or impose asset tests that block benefits for people who own homes or cars or other property, regardless how low their incomes are. That would be especially burdensome on newly jobless people, who still possess their assets but no longer have incomes.\n\nArthur Delaney contributed reporting.
Habitual smoking in China is set to kill more than 200 million people this century, a new report from the World Health Organization and United Nations Development Program said.\n\nThe deaths will come from primarily poor areas of the country, unless critical steps are taken to reduce China's dependency on tobacco, the report, released Friday, said.\n\nThose steps could be difficult in a country that is also the world's largest producer and consumer of tobacco, according to WHO. Forty-four percent of the world's cigarettes are smoked in China, and the profits show. In 2015, the smoking industry in China recorded $160 billion in revenue, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nCarlos Barria / Reuters A girl stands on a sidewalk after putting an unlit cigarette in her mouth, which she picked up from the ground, in Shanghai July 31, 2014.\n\nDr. Bernhard Schwartländer, China's WHO representative, said there needs to be more smoke-free policies across the country.\n\nIf nothing is done to reduce these numbers and introduce more progressive policies, the consequences could be devastating not just for the health of people across the country, but also for China's economy as a whole, Schwartländer said.\n\nCigarettes have become increasingly more affordable, according to the report. A 50 percent tax increase on cigarettes could see 47 million fewer male smokers and 20 million fewer premature deaths over 50 years.\n\nRaising tobacco taxes is one of the most cost-effective measures to reduce tobacco consumption, while also generating substantial revenue for health and other essential programs – investments that ultimately benefit the entire population, said Bert Hofman, World Bank Country Director for China, Mongolia and Korea, in the WHO press release.
You've heard all about pre-existing conditions, and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance policies. But if you want to understand what Republican plans to replace the Affordable Care Act would mean for the country, and perhaps for you individually, pay close attention to the money.\n\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, the federal government now spends tens of billions of dollars each year providing financial assistance to people who buy insurance through HealthCare.gov or one of the exchanges (like Covered California) that some states run on their own. The financial assistance takes two forms ― tax credits that discount premiums, and direct subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs.\n\nMost of the Republican schemes under consideration, including a working draft of House legislation that Politico obtained last week, envision the federal government continuing to provide assistance to people who buy coverage on their own. But the assistance would take a different form ― with a new formula for the tax credits, and no special assistance for out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe result would be some fairly dramatic shifts in who gets insurance, how much they pay for it, and, eventually, what kind of insurance they have. This isn't accidental. The decision to restructure financial assistance for insurance flows directly from the very different way Republicans and Democrats think about health care.\n\nBasically, Democrats believe there should be a right to decent, affordable insurance. They wrote the Affordable Care Act with that principle in mind. Democrats didn't achieve their goal ― millions of Americans remain uninsured, while millions more with coverage still face high costs. But something like 20 million people now have comprehensive policies they didn't have before. Overall, financial security and access to health care have improved.\n\nRepublicans take a different view. They are willing to give people a tax break to defray health insurance costs, and some Republicans are even willing to extend assistance to lower-income people who don't make enough money to owe income taxes. But Republicans reject the idea of government guaranteeing coverage, and their proposals to replace Obamacare wouldn't even attempt to provide such a guarantee.\n\nIt's a big reason why the mainstream Republican plans would likely result in more uninsured, weaker coverage, or some combination of the two.\n\nHow Obamacare Assistance Works\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, if you buy insurance through HealthCare.gov or one of the state-run exchanges, you can get tax credits that help offset the cost of premiums. These are special tax credits, in that they go straight to the insurance companies at the beginning of each month, so you don't have to wait until tax-filing season to get the money.\n\nThe tax credits are also refundable, which means that if your income tax liability is smaller than the value of the credit, or if you have no liability at all, you still get the full value. This is very important in health care because a large number of people buying through exchanges are working in low-paying jobs. They are hotel housekeepers and clerks at big-box stores, home health aides and security guards. If the credits weren't refundable, they wouldn't get much or any assistance, even though they are the ones who need it most.\n\nThe formula for calculating these tax credits is important. It varies based on income, so that you'll get a bigger tax credit if you make less money. The value also varies depending on how much insurance costs in your area ― in particular, the price of the second-cheapest silver plan, which the law treats as a benchmark. (Silver plans, which are less generous than typical employer plans, cover roughly 70 percent of the typical person's medical expenses.)\n\nThen there is the assistance on cost-sharing. It is available only to consumers who buy silver policies and whose incomes are below 250 percent of the poverty line ― about $30,000 for an an individual and $61,000 for a family of four this year. It gets very little attention because even most of the people who get the money don't realize it. (The exchanges factor in the assistance automatically, so that policies simply appear to have lower deductibles and co-payments.) But for the millions who get it, it's the difference between insurance that works and insurance that doesn't.\n\nYes, the whole scheme is awfully complicated. But put it all together and what you have is a system in which, generally speaking, people who need more financial assistance get it.\n\nHow GOP Tax Credits Would Work\n\nSo what would Republicans do instead? At the moment, nobody can say for sure, because they are still arguing among themselves over some pretty basic design questions. Moderates talk of repair as much as replace, while conservatives are determined to tear the law down entirely ― and then put little or nothing in its stead.\n\nJust this week, for example, several conservative Republicans in Congress said they would vote against any bill with refundable credits, because they would consider giving money to people with no income tax liability akin to creating a new entitlement. Of course, a bill with no refundable credits would, by definition, leave out a huge chunk of the population now getting coverage through Obamacare.\n\nThis approach ... would make it impossible for most lower-income people to purchase adequate health insurance coverage Linda Blumberg, The Urban Institute\n\nRepublican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) haven't gone that far, at least not yet. The draft legislation that leaked last week still had refundable credits, and looked a lot like the plan that Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price had proposed when he was in Congress last year. The Better Way proposal, a set of reform principles that Ryan released over the summer, also had refundable credits. President Donald Trump also endorsed tax credits during his speech to Congress on Tuesday night, although he didn't specify what kind.\n\nBut the tax credits in the Republican bills are different from the Affordable Care Act's. Instead of adjusting the value to account for premiums and income, as the law does today, the Republican plans envision tax credits whose value would vary based only on age. In the leaked bill, for instance, 25-year-olds would get $2,000 a year, while 55-year-olds would get $3,500. It wouldn't matter how much these people make, or what insurance costs in their communities.\n\nThe federal government would still be spending a lot of money on tax breaks for people getting health care. But it wouldn't steer that money in the way that the Affordable Care Act does ― in other words, it wouldn't target people who struggle the most with medical bills.\n\nWhy The Difference In Tax Credits Matters So Much\n\nSeveral recent studies, including two that were released on Wednesday morning, examined what the Republican approach would mean in practice.\n\nResearchers at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation looked exclusively at the premium tax credits and how they'd affect different groups of people. The results were predictably complex, with lots of variation from person to person, but the general pattern was clear. Lower income and older people and those who live in high-premium communities tend to get less help, Larry Levitt, senior vice president at Kaiser, told the Huffington Post. Those who are higher income and younger and live in low-premium areas tend to do better.\n\nLinda Blumberg, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, decided to take into account how changes to financial assistance would interact with other changes that Republicans propose, like allowing insurers new flexibility over what to cover and how much they could charge. If such a plan became law, Blumberg concluded, it would be impossible for most lower-income people to purchase adequate health insurance coverage, given their limited financial resources and potential medical needs.\n\nThree health care experts broke down the original Price bill, to see how it would affect total costs for enrollees ― in other words, not just premiums, but also out-of-pocket costs. They published their results in Vox last week: Although premiums would be lower under the Republican plan, this decrease would be offset by an increase in cost sharing. Once the differences in tax credits are accounted for, the Republican plan would increase total costs for every age group except for those under 25.\n\nMcKinsey & Co. ran a rough analysis on the leaked House bill, and presented its findings to a meeting of the nation's governors over the weekend. Some presently uninsured young people would get coverage, McKinsey's analysts predicted, because the GOP's tax credits would make insurance more financially attractive. But those gains would be more than offset by older people dropping insurance as it suddenly became a lot more expensive. Overall, McKinsey's researchers said, non-group insurance ― that is, coverage for people buying on their own ― would decline by 30 percent to 50 percent.\n\nNone of this should be surprising. The architects of the Affordable Care Act were trying to make sure everybody could get decent insurance, regardless of income, and they were willing to adjust financial assistance in order to make that possible. The Republicans who would replace the Affordable Care Act aren't trying to put insurance within everybody's reach. They are simply trying to offer a tax break that would available to people buying health insurance, and even then only under some circumstances.\n\nThe Republican approach would be a lot more straightforward, and it would likely mean a lot less federal spending. But it would also mean many fewer people buying insurance, much weaker coverage for those who have it, or both.\n\nThat's an alternative to the Affordable Care Act ― not a replacement.\n\nSign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

NEWARK, N.J. ― Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who announced his presidential candidacy on Friday morning, defended his record against criticism from the left later in the day during a news conference outside of his home.\n\nBooker calmly fielded questions about how he would respond to hypothetical attacks from President Donald Trump about Booker's ties to Wall Street, the perception that he is too corporate and his support for public charter schools at a moment of resurgent teachers union militancy.\n\nRather than adopt the populist rhetoric of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Booker defended his work combating predatory financial practices, including exploitative lending to low-income homeowners in Newark, and vowed that he would continue to stand up to bad actors in corporate America whose practices harm ordinary people.\n\nAnyone who knows my history knows my history of standing up for people who have been hurt by bad actors, he said.\n\nBooker did not deny supporting public charter schools. It would have been difficult for him to do so: He spoke at a rally co-sponsored by a charter school system in New Orleans on Jan. 18, at a time when Los Angeles schoolteachers were on strike in part over the growth of charter schools there.\n\nWithout once saying the word charter, Booker affirmed, We shouldn't have one-size-fits-all education. Local leaders should be able to decide what works best for them.\n\nInstead, he cast himself as a champion of higher public school teacher pay and better school funding that would enable more hiring of teachers, counselors and mental health professionals. One way he suggested to address the issue is by reforming the tax code so young stockbrokers, who may benefit from the carried-interest loophole or the lower tax rate on capital gains, don't pay a lower tax rate than teachers.\n\nOur teachers are ridiculously underpaid in America, he said. If you look at this in an economic analysis, they are the professionals who contribute the most to a thriving American economy. And we cannot continue to devalue one of the greatest professions in our country, which is public school teachers.\n\nI'm going to run the boldest pro-public school teacher campaign there is, which is how I ran the city of Newark, he added.\n\nIn addition, during a discussion of health care, Booker avoided a pitfall encountered by a fellow presidential contender, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), earlier this week.\n\nHarris declared at a CNN town hall in Iowa on Monday that she supported a Medicare-for-all system that included get[ting] rid of private health insurance. But by Tuesday, under fire from Republicans, Harris' staff was clarifying that while Medicare for all was her preferred policy, she was open to multiple paths to universal coverage.\n\nBooker, like Harris, is a co-sponsor of Sanders' September 2017 legislation replacing all but supplemental private insurance with one public federal program.\n\nOn Friday, however, when a reporter asked Booker if he would eliminate private health care ― seemingly referring to insurance, not the actual medical care ― the New Jersey senator took a different tack.\n\nWithout elaborating further, he responded, Even countries that have vast access to publicly offered health care still have private health care.\n\nNotwithstanding the below-freezing temperatures, Booker's decision to address reporters outside his Newark home in a working-class neighborhood provided an opportunity to showcase his status as a hometown favorite. (Booker served as mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013, before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014.)\n\nWhen Narcissa Quito, a neighbor of Booker's from across the street, noticed the news conference, she opened up her window, waved and called out to him frantically.\n\nBooker, who was in the middle of his answer to the question on charter schools and public education, smiled, calling back, Hermana!\n\nHola! Como estas? he continued in Spanish. A la victoria!\n\nYes! she replied in English. (In a follow-up interview, Quito, who immigrated from Ecuador more than 30 years ago, confirmed that she is already an enthusiastic backer of his bid.)\n\nBooker had ample opportunity to showcase his facility with policy details, including on criminal justice and immigration reform, causes he has long championed.\n\nHe previewed a presidential run that is likely to focus on uplift, appealing to American decency and goodness to overcome the divisiveness that has consumed the country under Trump.\n\nPressed on whether he was up for the task of taking on Trump, given his focus on love as a driving force in American politics, Booker expounded on the compassion of white lawyers who helped his parents overcome discrimination in the housing market and other civil rights advocates who helped move the country forward.\n\nThe people I admire are the people who lead by calling out the best in who we are and not the worst, he said. So I'm running for president because I believe in us, I believe in these values, I'm going to put them before the American people ― hey, and if that's not what they want, then I won't be the next president of the United States.
Pool via Getty Images President Joe Biden took to the podium on Friday to make remarks on the state of the economy amid the pandemic and the need for his ambitious American Rescue Plan.\n\nIn his much-celebrated memoir A Promised Land, former President Barack Obama described his 2009 stimulus bill in sweeping terms. By any conventional yardstick, I was about to sign historic legislation: a recovery effort comparable in size to FDR's New Deal, Obama wrote.\n\nIt was a middle-class tax cut bigger than anything since Reagan and an infrastructure program bigger than anything since the Eisenhower administration Obama proclaimed, adding that in his first month in office, he had secured the successful work of an entire first term.\n\nLittle of this description is accurate. Obama's $800 billion bill was equivalent to about 5.5% of U.S. economic output in 2008; New Deal spending amounted to around 70% of the economy the year before Franklin D. Roosevelt took office. There is no doubt the Great Recession would have been worse without Obama's bill, but it was not transformational legislation.\n\nEvery president wants to look on the bright side of his achievements, of course, and people will debate whether a bigger bill was politically possible until the end of time. But Obama's optimistic assessment of the 2009 Recovery Act rings hollow today not only for its statistical muddles. Over the past few years, a new intellectual consensus has emerged about how the economy works and what the government's proper role in managing it should be.\n\nBack in 2009, many if not most mainstream economists believed that excessive government budget deficits were a bigger threat to society than weak growth or prolonged unemployment. Going too big wouldn't just risk overheating ― it raised the prospect of a second financial crisis that could bring down the dollar and even American political hegemony.\n\nToday, by contrast, economists increasingly accept the idea that deficits are not inherently destabilizing, but a normal part of economic management. The price of going too big isn't a crash, but a little unwanted inflation ― something that can be reined in through Federal Reserve policymaking or some tax increases from Congress. These may be unpleasant when they come, but it will be much worse for people to lose jobs, incomes and homes in the meantime. When the costs of going too small are shattered families and broken faith in a shared national project, the choice is not difficult.\n\nAs conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks put it on Friday, When your great nation is facing decline because of rising inequality, insecurity, distrust and alienation, you don't just sit there. You try something big.\n\nOne of the few dissents from this new consensus is Larry Summers, the principal economic architect of the Obama stimulus who only a few months ago was among the chorus of economists urging President Joe Biden to go big. But Summers abruptly changed course on Thursday, arguing in The Washington Post that Biden's agenda risked inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, along with consequences for the dollar and financial stability ― in other words, another crash.\n\nPolitico's Washington-insider newsletter Playbook amplified the Summers analysis, and it was blasted across cable news for much of Friday morning … and slapped down repeatedly by the Biden administration.\n\nWe can't do too much here. We can do too little. We can do too little and sputter. President Joe Biden\n\nJared Bernstein, a member of Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN that Summers' analysis was profoundly wrong, while other administration officials spent the day trashing Summers across the media landscape.\n\nBiden himself shows no sign of changing course. Every signal from the president and his top economists has been consistent and clear since his election victory in November: He will not roll the dice on the country or his presidency with a skimpy bill. On Friday, after the Senate approved an early version of his proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, the president told a meeting of House Democrats: We can't do too much here. We can do too little. We can do too little and sputter.\n\nIt is not merely the left pushing back against Summers. Mainline party brass Democrats are convinced that the cost of going too small is a broken Democratic Party. On Friday, over 200 former Obama administration officials ― including recently departed Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez ― signed a letter saying the undersized 2009 stimulus bill ended up prolonging the economic pain and inhibited our ability to bounce back quickly. They urgee the Biden administration to learn the lessons from the last economic crisis and pass a large stimulus package.\n\nDemocrats will, of course, still listen to Obama; he will remain a revered figure within the party, whatever intellectual paradigm we are now living in. But Summers is going out with the tide. By declining to hire Summers and nominating Janet Yellen to be Treasury secretary, Biden demonstrated that he does not share Obama's admiration for Summers. Back in 2013, Obama had hoped to make Summers chairman of the Federal Reserve, but was forced to settle for Yellen when Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee blocked his man.\n\nBiden's $1.9 trillion relief package is welcome and robust, but like Obama's Recovery Act, it is not transformative lawmaking. It will enable the country to weather a difficult year, but it will not update the antiquated American economic infrastructure for the 21st century. Biden's payments to families will be welcome and its support for small business is urgently needed. The crises of inequality, climate change, and post-COVID-19 globalization will remain.\n\nIn his op-ed, Summers charged that Biden would burn up all of his political and economic space to address those issues by supporting American families.\n\nThe opposite is true. Republicans made clear this week they will not support even emergency economic relief from a Democratic president. Democrats will have no choice but to go it alone, and passing a popular bill will not hurt their ability to pass additional popular measures in the coming months. The economic growth enabled by Biden's COVID-19-relief bill will not crowd out other investments, but produce an expanding economy in which more investments are possible. His next bill to reform the mangled international trade system and update American infrastructure must be every bit as ambitious as his COVID-19 relief legislation, and Biden stated emphatically last month that it would be.\n\nThe Larry Summers Age is over; the Biden era begins.
Photo courtesy of Flickr.\n\nI agree with the glowing reviews of The Big Short. The film does a wonderful job of exposing the mendacity of the financial industry and the role it played in almost causing a worldwide economic collapse.\n\nIts depiction of Wall Street as infested with greed, devoid of ethics and indifferent to the real-life consequences of its conduct on Main Street Americans was spot on.\n\nLessons learned\n\nNevertheless, I felt a profound sadness as I exited the theater. I agree with The New York Times reviewer who noted the film offers no solutions, and no comfort. The best it can do is put down a marker.\n\nIt's not for lack of effort. At the end, the film raises the ominous possibility that this sordid history is about to repeat itself. An article in Bloomberg notes that Goldman Sachs, together with other banks, is selling a new investment it calls a bespoke tranche opportunity. The article explains that these investments are essentially a CDO backed by single-name credit-default swaps, customized based on investors' wishes. The pools of derivatives are cut into varying slices of risk that are sold to investors such as hedge funds.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nThis investment has much in common with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which fell into disrepute as a primary cause of the financial crisis. Bespoke tranche opportunities appear to be similar in concept. The change in name is simply a marketing ploy.\n\nThese new investments will no doubt be sold successfully to gullible investors, pension plans and endowments who believe this pitch in a Goldman Sachs email cited by Bloomberg: A tranche of a bespoke portfolio of credits can offer exposure to diversified risk with the possibility of leverage, credit enhancement and enhanced returns. Really?\n\nWhether or not that rosy assessment turns out to be correct remains to be seen. What is certain is that Wall Street will profit handsomely from the sale of these investments, regardless of how they actually perform.\n\nObscuring conflicts of interest\n\nI worry that focusing on the cause of the financial crisis and Wall Street's seemingly endless proclivity to create complex investments will obscure the larger issue. It's that the underlying premise is fatally flawed. Many investors believe their stockbrokers have a legal obligation to put the interest of the investor first. They don't understand the inherent conflict of interest that comes with permitting stockbrokers to sell investment products that generate higher fees as long as those investments are deemed suitable. Stockbrokers are under no obligation to advise their clients that lower-fee investments, with higher expected returns, are available.\n\nInvesting in Congress\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nIn my view, the goal of Wall Street -- under the guise of managing your money -- is to maximize the transfer of your assets to itself and to avoid regulation that would hinder its attempt to do so. It succeeds in these efforts through massive contributions to congressional campaigns. In 2014, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), a securities industry trade group, was the top contributor on Wall Street to these campaigns, investing more than $7.4 million.\n\nWhatever you may think of the ethics of Wall Street, no one disputes its ability to understand how to get a return (for itself) on its investments. Politicians know what is expected of them. If they fail to deliver, they can expect their opponents to receive this funding in the next election.\n\nThe biggest lie\n\nWhether or not new shenanigans by Wall Street will precipitate another financial crisis is an open question. It certainly doesn't appear that lessons have been learned from the last go-around.\n\nWhat is certain is this: Wall Street will continue to perpetuate the myth that it has the ability to beat the market through stock picking, market timing and fund manager selection.\n\nHere's what Wall Street doesn't want you to know and is terrified you will find out. Only about 2 percent of active fund managers generate statistically significant alpha (excess returns over their risk-adjusted benchmark). There's no reliable way to identify these fund managers prospectively. Even if you could do so, once the impact of taxes is taken into account, it is unlikely even these funds would beat the after-tax returns of low-management-fee index funds.\n\nAs my colleague, Larry Swedroe, noted, active management is the triumph of hype, hope and marketing over wisdom and experience.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nNo objective person who reads my books and those written by authors like Larry Swedroe, John Bogle, Burton Malkiel, William Bernstein and many others would continue to be seduced by the marketing hype of Wall Street. Movies like The Big Short do a great job of exposing the underlying greed that pervades the industry. But don't be fooled. While the financial crisis dealt a devastating blow to the retirement dreams of many, it pales in comparison to the daily plundering of assets that occurs when investors listen to the recommendations of those who claim an ability to beat the market.\n\nThere is a way to win as an investor. It starts with the realization that doing business with market-beating stockbrokers and advisors is designed to enhance their retirement at your expense.\n\n--\n\nDan Solin is a New York Times bestselling author of the Smartest series of books, including The Smartest Investment Book You'll Ever Read, The Smartest Retirement Book You'll Ever Read and his latest, The Smartest Sales Book You'll Ever Read.\n\nThe views of the author are his alone and may not represent the views of his affiliated firms.

Martin Lobel is Chairman of the Board of Tax Analysts, but the opinions expressed here are his and are not necessarily those of Tax Analysts\n\nBelieve it or not, Senator Elizabeth Warren is closer to Milton Friedman's description of a conservative than Speaker Paul Ryan. But you'd never know it because the mainstream media has tagged Warren as a Progressive and Ryan as a Conservative. Milton Friedman, the godfather of free market conservatism, believed the market worked best when the government didn't pick winners and losers. Even a cursory examination of most of Warren's proposals shows that she is proposing just that, to remove tax subsidies for those who can afford to hire lobbyists and attend expensive fund raisers. Ryan, on the other hand, has been proposing tax subsidies or tax cuts for the very rich in the hope that, once digested by them, some of the remains might benefit the rest of us. Ryan, in short, is a plutocrat enabler, not a conservative and the media has an obligation to inform the public about what he is really proposing.\n\nIt is an open secret that the best political reward is a tax subsidy because it continues indefinitely, is hidden from the public, and never has to be justified once its on the books. That is why the plutocrats have made our tax code so complicated and irrational. As my old boss, Senator Proxmire once said the more complicated a tax provision is, the less justification there is likely to be for it. Everyone, who isn't benefiting from it, agrees that carried interest, for example, should be taxed as ordinary income. Just as everyone, who isn't benefiting from it, agrees it is irrational to encourage the export of jobs and profits by deferring taxes on so-called foreign income. But they remain as part of our tax code because those who benefit from them are willing to spend whatever it takes to defend them while the ordinary citizen, who may know about them, isn't organized enough to mount a campaign against them or those who support them.\n\nThe solution to our complex business tax code is to follow Milton Friedman's lead and eliminate all tax subsidies and lower rates so the free market can work without the government picking winners and losers. That's a true conservative's position. Speaker Ryan's proposals, on the other hand, pick the rich as winners and the rest of us as losers. That's a plutocrat's proposal and should be identified as such. We need to remember that the real function of the government is to protect the public from those who would abuse the system to enhance their power.\n\nIf the public understood that Senator Warren is, in truth, a free market conservative and Speaker Ryan is a plutocratic proponent and not a free market conservative, don't you think that it might have an impact? Its time to end he said she said reporting. Its time for the media to analyze the various tax proposals and reveal them for what they are. Fortunately, Tax Notes provides a forum for experts to do just that. The real question is whether the New York Times and the rest of the general media will translate that information we provide into terms that the public can understand so they have the information they need to make rational decisions.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) slammed as resentful a Washington Post op-ed that compared her to former presidential candidate Sarah Palin.\n\nNaturally, the same week we kick-start a nat'l convo on marginal tax rates endorsed by Nobel-Prize winning economists, I'm being described as 'vacuous,' tweeted Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday.\n\nIf you're allowed to characterize female politicians as 'unlikeable,' are we allowed to describe takes like these [as] 'resentful?'\n\nNaturally, the same week we kick-start a nat'l convo on marginal tax rates endorsed by Nobel-Prize winning economists, I'm being described as vacuous.\n\n\n\nIf you're allowed to characterize female politicians as unlikeable, are we allowed to describe takes like these resentful? https://t.co/cMikVKcJ5U — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 8, 2019\n\nThe 29-year-old lawmaker was referencing a column written by Max Boot titled, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shouldn't approach her facts the way Trump does.\n\nThe piece opens by saying that the new congresswoman has already gotten more publicity than she deserves and that the former bartender is a person of little significance — one of the most junior members of the House, she can expect to wait decades before exercising any real power in this hierarchical institution.\n\nBoot praises Ocasio-Cortez as down-to-earth and quick-witted, but criticizes her for caring more about ideological correctness than factual correctness. Then he ends with a comparison to Palin that neither woman will appreciate.\n\nPalin was another talented young communicator who made a big splash in national politics before having her lack of knowledge painfully exposed. Instead of studying up, Palin gave up any pretense of seriousness and has now disappeared from the debate. This is a cautionary tale for Ocasio-Cortez, Boot writes.\n\nA few minutes after snapping back at Boot's column, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted another missive that said: Let's refocus our energy and coverage to policies instead of personality.\n\nLet's refocus our energy and coverage to policies instead of personality.\n\n\n\nRight now, 800,000 workers are without a paycheck.\n\n\n\nThe President is holding gov operations hostage so that he can build a monument to himself on the southern border that the maj of Americans don't want. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 8, 2019\n\nOcasio-Cortez has been an outspoken proponent for reopening the government, as the partial shutdown hits its 18th day.\n\nOn Tuesday, she later tweeted, The American people did not organize the biggest midterm election in ~100 years so their new leaders could sit back as the nation waits in crisis.

The White House is considering tax breaks for travel and tourism businesses amid the coronavirus outbreak, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe news comes a day after President Donald Trump said at a Fox News town hall meeting that he's also looking to cut so-called entitlement programs for Americans that include Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nThe Post, citing unnamed sources, said that talks about deferring taxes for airlines, hotels and cruise businesses are fluid and haven't been determined. It wasn't immediately clear if Trump's own hotels would be beneficiaries of tax breaks under consideration.\n\nPerhaps on a large scale, some of the sectors might need some temporary assistance, Kudlow said on Fox Business.\n\nThe travel and tourism industry is suffering its worst downturn since the 9/11 terror attacks, the Post noted.\n\nThe break for business is in stark contrast to Trump's statement Thursday about cutting social programs for Americans.\n\nFox News host Martha MacCallum told the president that if you don't cut something in entitlements, you will never really deal with the debt. Trump responded: Oh, we'll be cutting. He then pivoted to the U.S. economy, noting its strong growth.\n\nHe has raised that point previously concerning program cuts, perhaps suggesting that people are so much wealthier in a strong economy that they can pay for their own retirement income and health insurance.\n\n🚨 Trump says we'll be cutting entitlements like Medicare and Social Security 🚨 pic.twitter.com/6XRKE9joYz — Pod Save America (@PodSaveAmerica) March 6, 2020\n\nTrump promised when he was campaigning in 2016 not to cut Medicare and Social Security. But he also indicated in a CNBC interview in January that he was ready to shave benefits. He also said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January that he would do so at some point.\n\nPut he backpedaled with a tweet Friday, vowing to protect your Social Security and Medicare. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway claimed he was talking about cutting the federal debt he has blown up through massive tax cuts, and not social programs.\n\nTrump promised to balance the budget when he was campaigning to be president, but the national debt has now reached an all-time American record of more than $23 trillion. (Who the hell cares about the budget? Trump asked donors at a fundraiser in January.)\n\nI will protect your Social Security and Medicare, just as I have for the past 3 years.

In 2008, the World Bank issued its first green bond. This security differed from other World Bank bonds in that the Bank pledged to bondholders that the proceeds of the bond would be invested in environmentally beneficial projects. Clean water. Clean air. Rapid transit that gets people out of thousands of polluting cars and motorbikes. These are the type of projects that the bank was going to invest the green bond buyers' money in.\n\nNow the rule of thumb in environmental finance is that the lower the payments, the more projects will get done. Is a farmer going to build a fence to keep his cattle from fouling a stream? If it costs $500, probably yes. If it costs $5,000, maybe. If it costs $50,000, definitely not. Are you going to put solar panels on your roof? If the payment is $20 a month, probably. If its $200 a month, maybe. If its $2,000 a month, definitely not.\n\nSo, in 2008, everybody thought that the World Bank's green bonds would have a lower rate of interest than its traditional bonds. The bank would then pass the lower payments on to its developing country borrowers, who, in turn, would be more likely to do more environmentally beneficial projects. Socially Responsible Investors would be willing to accept a lower rate of interest in return for the satisfaction of knowing that their money was creating environmental benefits. What a neat system!\n\nOnly it didn't work.\n\nThe World Bank's green bonds carried the exact same interest rate as did the Bank's other bonds. In other words, if investors wanted the Bank to invest in water pollution reduction projects, they could buy a green bond with, say, a 4% rate of interest. On the other hand, if they wanted to buy one of the Bank's other bonds that were financing, say, a coalmine, an urban highway or some other environmentally atrocious project, they could buy a regular World Bank bond that was also paying 4%. So, what is different about green bonds? Well, they assuage the conscience of sensitive investors. They make them feel good. They are Feel Good Bonds.\n\nThis situation may be changing thanks to DC Water and its advisors at Quantified Ventures.\n\nAs even casual visitors to Washington D.C. can attest, there are no multi-thousand acre tracts of active farmland or forests in the Nation's Capital. These features perform an invaluable environmental function in that they absorb rainwater and prevent it from gushing into - and polluting - lakes and streams. And so, rainwater, especially its virulent form, called stormwater, is a major nightmare for the District. So much so that the District, specifically its water/wastewater utility, called DC Water, has been working through a 25+ year solutioning process with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over what to do with the billions of gallons of stormwater that the District must deal with whenever there is a major rainstorm.\n\nThe upshot of this struggle is a consent order under which DC Water must dig enormous caverns - right under downtown DC - to trap the stormwater before it can get to, and overwhelm, their sewage treatment plant. Over the last few years, DC Water has been looking at green infrastructure to see if it offers a cost-effective and more environmentally friendly alternative. Green infrastructure is basically vegetation that absorbs rain. Think of rain gardens instead of cement patios. Think green roofs instead of tiles or sheeting.\n\nConcluding that it was definitely worth a shot, DC Water, the District, the US Department of Justice and the EPA agreed to amend their consent order. The agreement was that DC Water would build about 300 acres of green infrastructure. Before jumping into a massive 300+/- acre project that might cost hundreds of millions of dollars, DC Water decided to experiment with 25 acres first to see what the green infrastructure would actually cost and, second, how much water flow it would actually reduce. So, they picked out 25 acres and installed flow meters to see what the pre-project runoff was.\n\nDC Water's engineers told them that the project was likely to reduce flows between 18.6% and 41.3%. They said there was a 95% confidence interval that these goals would be reached. On the other hand, there was a 2.5% probability that the flow reduction would be below 18.6% AND a 2.5% probability that the flows would be reduced by more than 41.3%. The project was slated to cost about $25 million.\n\nSo, here's what DC Water and its advisors at Quantified Ventures did.\n\nThey put together a tax-exempt municipal bond that DC Water would issue. They called it an Environmental Impact Bond (EIB). And it is, indeed just that: an environmental impact bond! Remember a few paragraphs above where we said that the goal of environmental finance was to produce the lowest cost. Well it was a stroke of genius on the part of Mark Kim, DC Water's CFO, and Eric Letsinger, the CEO of Quantified Ventures, that they realized that lowest cost didn't necessarily mean lowest interest rate. So they built into the EIB a unique and brilliant feature: if the flow reduction exceeds 41.3%, DC Water will pay the investors an additional $3.3 million. BUT, if the flow reduction is less than 18.6%, then the investors will get $3.3 million less interest.\n\nThis looks like it's backwards. With this Environmental Impact Bond if more environmental benefits are created, the bondholders get MORE money, not less. Not only do they get the satisfaction of improving the environment, but they get an extra cash bonus too.\n\nSo, the question now arises: why would DC Water pay more for success? Well, let us say that the project exceeds its goals by 100%. That could mean that DC Water doesn't need to spend a possible $300 million on 300 acres of green infrastructure. They might be able to spend half of that to achieve their targets. That's could translate to enormous savings. So, why would DC Water pay its EIB investors an extra $3.3 million? The answer is simple: they are happy to pay out $3.3 million because they might save millions more!\n\nIn other words, DC Water and QV want to motivate investors to support investments that can develop environmentally positive results - motivating by paying for performance - encouraging environmentally minded investors to underwrite the likelihood of success for the project and get paid according to its riskiness - as one does with the rest of the investment market - thus mainstreaming environmentally beneficial projects into the investment community.\n\nWhat did the investment world think of this Environmental Impact Bond? What did the market think about Quantified Ventures' proven Pay for Success type of bond? Well, the venerable bible of the municipal bond industry, The Bond Buyer, named the issue the 2016 Non Traditional Deal Of The Year!\n\nDoes this mean the end of the type of green bonds discussed above? No. They will still be issued. There may be no financial implications to such bonds, but they do, after all, create good will. They do let investors know that the bond issuers are doing the right thing for the environment with the investors' money. As a matter of fact, DC Water is planning on issuing at least $100 million of green bonds in the near future. The proceeds of these bonds will go for stormwater reduction projects and other projects with direct environmental benefits, just like the World Bank bonds described above. And, soon DC Water will also issue a couple hundred million dollars of regular (non-green) bonds to pay for their other projects.\n\nSo, DC Water's Environmental Impact Bond is, indeed, just that. It is having a major, positive environmental impact!
Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images Are you considering a completely new kind of career right now because of COVID-19? You're not alone.\n\nA lot of workers have been job hunting in entirely new directions after the coronavirus pandemic upended their lives and careers.\n\nIn fact, 63% of workers who lost jobs because of COVID-19 have changed industries, according to a Harris Poll survey of more than 1,970 Americans conducted in October. The top reasons people gave for making a career switch were being laid off or fearing a layoff, needing more money, and feeling like there was no room for growth in their field.\n\nIf these reasons resonate with you, it's never too late to launch a new career ― but landing on the other side of the transition can be easier with some preparation and research.\n\n\n\nHere's what you can start doing now while you prepare to make the leap:\n\n\n\n1. Identify which of your skills can transfer over to your new field.\n\nIf you're sitting at your desk right now longing for change, know that you may have more tools than you think to get the career you want.\n\nFirst, identify which of your core functions can carry over into your new field.\n\nMarketing, general management, finance, consulting, sales — that is the function that's going to carry through, whether you're in tech or biotech or manufacturing, said Kristen Fitzpatrick, the managing director of alumni, career and professional development at Harvard Business School.\n\nYou are looking for professional, academic and technical skills that can be easily translated to that other industry, Jessica Hernandez, a career development coach, told HuffPost.\n\nShe gave the example of someone switching from the hospitality industry to logistics. If you're in hospitality and you had to work with suppliers and vendors and plan shipments or anything like that ― even though it was under that hospitality industry, those things are still transferable to new industries, Hernandez said.\n\nIf you don't have any of these transferable skills, Hernandez recommends educating yourself and taking online courses in the skills you need to get certifications that you can put on your résumé.\n\nYou should also read up on the basic technical skills and concepts you'll need to have to survive in your new field, Fitzpatrick added.\n\nIf you're going into finance, you should be able to read a 10-K [filing], you should be able to understand how the stock market works. There are basics in every industry that you should know, and then you're able to create a more compelling story for why you are worth a little bit of a risk as a career-switcher, she said.\n\n2. Rewrite your résumé to highlight how you're making career moves in that new direction.\n\nView your résumé as an explanation of where you want to go in your career, not a summary of what you have previously done.\n\nIf you are making a radical pivot that is not reflected in your formal education, career experts advise putting your self-studies, such as LinkedIn learning courses and digital bootcamps you have taken, at the top of your résumé. That way, a recruiter skimming the page can easily understand your reasons for a career leap and how you're working toward it.\n\nIf experience isn't super solid for whatever reason, but then [applicants] are showing that they've gone to hackathons on the weekends ... or things on their own, that shows determination, that shows focus, it's self-motivation, and those kind of candidates are definitely highlighted in my experience, Alison Daley, the founder of a tech recruiting and training platform called Recruiting Innovation, previously told HuffPost. Moxie and determination sure compensate for certain education pedigrees.\n\nAsk someone who has no idea what you do to look at your résumé so they can help you see what isn't clear and what industry vernacular from your old career you may still be using, Fitzpatrick said.\n\nThe amount of abbreviation and jargon I see when it's just how you've always talked for years ― you forget that other people don't know, she said.\n\n3. Network with people whose careers you want.\n\nTo expand your network, reach out to people who have the type of jobs you want and ask them for informational interviews.\n\nFind out what made them so successful, what they did before they got to the position or industry that they were in, Hernandez said.\n\nShe suggests framing your request with language like, Hey, I saw that you work for this company. I really admire your career path. I would like to transition into that industry one day. I was just wondering if you wouldn't mind sharing one or two steps that helped you get to where you are.\n\nIt's important not to make this transactional and ask them for a job, which may turn people off in a first encounter. Rather, you're asking them for information and actionable advice. Once you have a lot of these conversations, you'll start to notice patterns in these career paths, and in the meantime, you'll build relationships that could eventually lead to a referral, Hernandez said.\n\n4. Figure out your level of risk and budget the money you need during the transition.\n\nf I was someone who was more risk-averse, I would probably take eight months before I leave my job to prepare. - Ramona Ortega, founder of My Money My Future\n\nYou don't want the stress of money coming up as you transition. The transition is already hard enough, said Ramona Ortega, founder of the personal finance platform My Money My Future. When you're making a big career switch, you need to have a pot of money that is going to hold you over, whether you're just starting a new job [and] it's going to be another three to four weeks before you actually get paid, or you're looking for a job, which can take an indefinite amount of time, she said.\n\nBefore you switch, Ortega recommends looking at your bills holistically, consolidating accounts so you can see a full picture of where your money is going and coming from, and saving enough to cover fixed costs such as rent, mortgage, or car payments for three to six months. If you're taking money out of a 401(k), consider timing that action to when you are making less money and in a lower tax bracket, she said.\n\nIf you're switching from full-time employment to not knowing when your paycheck will be coming, Ortega suggests getting a side gig to ease that transition.\n\nThis could be something really random, she said. You want income coming in, especially if you're leaving a job that you've been with for 10 years and you're used to having that every-two-weeks-a check-is-coming-in [situation]. It's a very hard transition for a lot of people, she said.\n\nExactly how much money you will need for your move depends on your comfort with risk. Ortega said some people fall into the Screw it, I'm leaving camp, while others who are risk-averse may need a longer period of time to plan and build a bigger emergency fund.
The Internal Revenue Service unveiled a new website Friday where people who don't normally file tax returns can enter bank account information so they can receive coronavirus payments.\n\nThe new site is on IRS.gov. There's a big blue button that says Non Filers: Enter Payment Info Here.\n\n\n\nSince Congress passed a law calling for cash payments to most households in the U.S., people with low incomes haven't had a simple way to deal with the requirement that they file a tax return to get the benefit.\n\nThose who don't owe federal income taxes are not normally required to file returns, so the requirement presented a new hassle to the 15 million households that didn't file in 2019 ― and volunteer tax clinics are currently shut down.\n\nCongress created the one-time coronavirus rebate payments in order to help people get through the social distancing measures ordered by state and local governments to slow the spread of the virus. More than 16,000 Americans have died from it as of Friday morning, and more than 16 million have lost their jobs and filed unemployment claims.\n\nFor people who filed tax returns for 2018 or already filed for 2019, and who have bank information on file with the IRS, the rebate checks should hit their accounts soon. Individuals earning less than $75,000 are eligible for $1,200 and couples earning less than $150,000 are eligible for $2,400, plus $500 per child younger than 17.\n\nThe new IRS portal ― which the agency created with help from tax preparation companies like Intuit, the maker of TurboTax ― will hopefully resolve two weeks of chaos for non tax filers, some of whom discovered that existing free online tax filing software rejected returns from people with no taxable income.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin described the new site as a tool for Americans who are not required to file tax returns to make sure they receive their payment as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nAfter initially saying it would require everyone to file a tax return, the IRS said it would use Social Security data to deliver the payments to people receiving Social Security retirement or disability insurance. But people who don't receive those particular benefits still have to file.\n\nDemocrats have demanded that the IRS automatically send payments to people receiving Supplemental Security Income or Veterans Affairs benefits, since the government should have their bank account info.\n\nDean Webley, a 53-year-old former health care administrator in Philadelphia, said the payment would be extremely helpful to her. She said she's been getting by on savings since getting laid off two years ago.\n\nWith a 12-year-old son at home, Webley is eligible for $1,700 ― but the free tax sites wouldn't let her file, and she didn't have any luck with a separate new TurboTax program that is supposed to work better than existing free software.\n\nI haven't paid this month's rent yet, Webley said. Thank God all the bills are on moratorium right now, but a moratorium is not cancellation.
All right, I don't got long. I'm a dad, so I got a kid to take care of. What's up, bootlickers?\n\nI haven't seen ya'll since the campout. I've got something to say, right? I'm tired of this fucking shit. I'm a father, I'm a veteran, and I'm an anarchist. Those are three people you don't want to piss off, all right? I'm tired of children getting attacked in the streets. I'm tired of them sleeping in the fucking streets. I'm tired of seeing the very people that I swore to defend get attacked by the state.\n\nSo like I said out there, y'all need to close your fucking beaks and start moving your feet and get shit done. Take resources and put them in the hands of people who need them, all right? Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with y'all?\n\nWho the fuck are y'all to justify letting people die in the streets with your policies and your laws and your legislation. How do you justify that, killing people? I swore to give my life to defend the people from all forms of oppression. Eventually, the shit's gonna stop. Because when it's our turn, we won't make excuses for the terror. Marx.
The federal government is reopening for at least three weeks, but the prospect of a repeat looms. A second shutdown threatens to kick in Feb. 15 if Congress can't cut a deal on President Donald Trump's demand for money to build a border wall.\n\nHowever, labor advocates think they have the answer on how to end government shutdowns.\n\nDuring the final week of the shutdown, sickouts spiked among federal employees who refused to show up for work, leaving staffing shortages, triggering airport delays and raising concerns over whether tax refunds would be processed on time.\n\nMeanwhile, there were indications of growing support for coordinated absences even as thousands of staffers were being encouraged to work without pay.\n\nLast week, former Clinton-era Secretary of Labor Robert Reich who was also temporarily an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, publicly urged employees to stop showing up to their jobs in protest.\n\nAs a former secretary of labor, I urge federal workers who continue to toil without pay to stop working and those who are furloughed to picket their workplaces. Trump's callous disregard for all of you and for the public welfare must end. He must reopen the U.S. government. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) January 22, 2019\n\nJoseph McCartin, a professor and director of Georgetown University's Kalmanovitz Institute for Labor and the Working Poor, told Voice of America, a government-financed news outlet, that the strategy could work.\n\nIt would be about getting public attention, and even more important, causing the government to focus on this problem, he said. And hopefully, to delink the payment of wages to federal workers from the dispute that exists over the border.\n\nIn an American Prospect Op-Ed published less than two weeks before, McCartin had pushed for workers to act, writing, A sickout by unpaid federal employees could bring the impasse — and their status as hostages to the president's whim — to an end.\n\nDocumentarian Michael Moore promoted the tactic in his Friday appearance on Stephen Colbert's Late Show.\n\nThere's an easy way to end it, he said of the shutdown. Federal workers ― don't go to work without pay.\n\nMoore stressed that we shouldn't be supporting anything that requires someone who's not paid working for us, telling the audience to avoid flying and filing tax returns, suggesting they opt for extensions instead so as to avoid the need for workers.\n\nThe day after Moore's appearance, the agreement to reopen the government was announced.\n\nWhile the future of government operations and Trump's border wall remain unclear, Democrats and Republicans have until Feb. 15 to find a solution before key parts of the government could again grind to a halt.
NASHUA, N.H. ― Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was wrapping up a town hall here in New Hampshire's second-largest city when a voter asked how she planned to defeat Donald Trump and win the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe way I'm going to win is I'm going to unite our party, because we have to have a united party, Warren said Tuesday, one week before the second contest of the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. We can't have a repeat of 2016.\n\nIt's a point the Warren campaign has been hammering over the past month, downplaying her history of challenging other Democrats and arguing she's uniquely qualified to bridge the party's ideological, age, gender and racial divides. Some allies have gone further and argued it positions her well for a potential contested convention.\n\nBut as Warren stumbles out of a third-place finish in Iowa and seeks the game-changing result in New Hampshire that she failed to get in the Midwest, her pitch has a problem: Many of the voters she needs to win over aren't Democrats at all. Public polling here has shown Warren running strong with registered Democrats but performing poorly with the independents who plan to cast ballots in the Democratic race and often play a crucial role in Granite State politics.\n\nA Monmouth University poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters released Thursday illustrates her problem. Warren earns 13% of the vote overall, good for fourth place, behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's 24%, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 20% and former Vice President Joe Biden's 17%. But Warren earns the support of 21% of registered Democrats, trailing only Sanders. Her standing is hurt because just 5% of independents plan to back her. (Other polls in New Hampshire, including ones by Marist College, WBUR and Suffolk University, find similar gaps.)\n\nPatrick Murray, the Monmouth pollster who conducted the survey, noted the lack of a competitive Republican primary and said it meant more moderate and even some conservative voters would cast ballots on the Democratic side, causing problems for a progressive like Warren, who supports a wealth tax, mass student debt forgiveness and the decriminalization of border crossings.\n\nWarren's support is coming from traditionally liberal Democratic women, Murray said. When you only have one primary, you're going to get more independent voters who are further from the ideological extreme of the party. In this case, you're getting more voters from the center, or either more towards the right.\n\nMatt Rourke/ASSOCIATED PRESS Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren at a campaign event Thursday in Derry, N.H.\n\nBut ideology can't explain all of Warren's struggles with independents. Sanders, who is to her left, actually does better with independents than with registered Democrats in the Monmouth survey. That's partially because Sanders, who has long refused to officially join the Democratic Party, is seen as a less partisan figure. Warren, who rocketed to liberal fame in part because of her willingness to take on other Democrats, has downplayed her past criticisms in an attempt to become a consensus, unifying figure.\n\nThey're very much antiestablishment, Murray said of the independent voters who are backing Sanders. If she had done that, she might've been able to dig into some of Bernie's independents.\n\nThe Warren campaign declined to comment on the record for this story.\n\nWe Need To Pull This Party Together\n\nSince the start of January, Warren has sought to capitalize on escalating intra-party tensions caused by Sanders's rise in the polls by offering herself as a way to satiate both of the party's ideological wings while remaining acceptable to Black and Latino voters. (This is intended to separate her from Buttigieg, who has also positioned himself as the middle ground but struggles with voters of color.)\n\nHer allies routinely cite polling showing a wide swath of Democratic voters are still considering backing her and that she is the nominee who would disappoint the smallest portion of Democrat voters.\n\nAt the Nashua event, unifying the party seemed to be her major message. Aides handed out Unite the party signs to attendees, and Warren took time to note she had won support from elected officials and organizers who had previously backed candidates who have dropped out of the contest.\n\nWe now have a campaign that, sure, it's got a lot of Elizabeth Warren originals, she told a crowd Wednesday in Nashua, but it's also got a lot of [Sen. Kamala Harris] folks in it. It's got a lot of [former Housing Secretary Julián Castro] folks in it. It's got a lot of [former Rep. Beto O'Rourke] folks in it. It's got a lot of [Sen. Cory Booker] folks in it, because they all had good ideas, and they all care about our country.\n\nThe Warren campaign is driving the point home with television ads featuring people who supported Hillary Clinton, Sanders and Trump in 2016 and are now backing Warren. (The campaign aired a similar spot in Iowa.)\n\nAt events in Nashua and in Derry on Thursday, it seemed to be working. I was honestly leaning toward Bernie, but today clinched it for Warren, said Tara Picciano, a registered Democrat and stay-at-home mom from nearby Wyndham. I want the fighter. I want somebody who's going to unite the party.\n\nAsked if she worried that Sanders couldn't bring the party together, Picciano was diplomatic: What I worry about is the soundbite of bully-ism, she said. I feel like, unfortunately, that's where Bernie is right now.\n\nBut not everyone was sold or even agreed that party unity was a major problem.\n\nLorrie Belinsky, a retired school administrator and independent, said she was still considering Warren, Buttigieg and Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.). I don't know. That's one thing I maybe worry about. I'm not sure at this point, she said when asked if Warren could unite anti-Trump forces.\n\nAnd state Rep. Erika Connors, who said she was pretty sure she planned to endorse Warren after vacillating between her and Buttigieg, downplayed party unity as an issue.\n\nI don't really see the party as divided as people are making it out to be. I think people are either going to vote for Donald Trump, or they're going to vote for the alternative, whoever it is, she said.\n\nShe Was There To Hold Me Accountable As A Democrat\n\nA day earlier, Castro ― the only defeated rival of Warren's to directly endorse her so far ― was in downtown Nashua for a meet-and-greet at Warren's office here.\n\nDuring a brief speech to the gathered supporters, Castro discussed the first time he met Warren. As a member of a Senate committee with oversight of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Warren invited Castro to lunch in the Senate dining room. What Castro thought would be a casual get-to-know-you visit quickly turned serious and wonky.\n\nShe wanted to know what I was going to do to hold Wall Street accountable as people were losing their mortgages, she wanted to know how we are going to keep people in their homes, Castro said. She was there to hold me accountable, from a friendly administration, because it wasn't the party or the position that mattered most to her, it was the people that she was supposed to be there representing.\n\nCastro's anecdote stood out. Though it fits into a larger pattern of Warren holding the feet of her fellow Democrats to the fire, it broke against the Warren campaign's tendency to downplay that pattern.\n\nDuring her rise to political fame during the Great Recession, Warren was a vociferous critic of how the Obama administration's Treasury Department responded to the financial and housing crises. In the Senate, she continued to aggravate her Democratic colleagues by lambasting them for their support of laws progressives pointed to as giveaways to the banking and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nWarren has always balanced her criticisms of other Democrats with a team player attitude, hosting fundraisers for Senate candidates and using her robust email list to help other Democrats raise money. But throughout the 2020 campaign, Warren has often declined to engage in critiques of other Democrats, and her campaign has positioned her as the pragmatic progressive in contrast to Sanders's willingness to declare war on the establishment.\n\nShe has repeatedly declined to repeat her recession-era critiques of the Obama administration and has largely refrained from relitigating the fight that brought her into politics: her battles with Biden over his push for bankruptcy legislation she said would sell out consumers. In general, with the exception of her now-famous wine cave attack on Buttigieg, Warren has avoided going on the attack against the other candidates.\n\nWarren's campaign is now airing an ad in both New Hampshire and South Carolina featuring her work during the recession, but it doesn't show her sharply questioning Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner or Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White, two Obama officials Warren regularly scorned. It shows President Barack Obama lavishing praise on her.\n\nCastro, in an interview after his speech, punted when asked if Warren needed to place more emphasis on her past intra-party clashes: I'll leave the political analysis to the campaign.\n\nThe event also had a distinctly left-wing feel that could contribute to the skepticism some independents feel toward Warren: As Jordan Thompson, a former Harris organizer who later endorsed Castro and was now backing Warren, talked about how any movement for big structural change must be diverse and intersectional, other young people snapped their figures in approval.\n\nIn an interview after the event, Thompson praised Warren: She understands intersectionality. For too long, marginalized people have been placed on the back burner. But he also said he was under no illusion about how much demand voters in New Hampshire, the third-whitest state in the union, might have for racial justice.\n\nI would give some of those voters a little bit more credit, he said. But maybe that's just me being optimistic.\n\nWhere Warren Goes From Here\n\nWarren arrived in the Granite State in a steady position after a third-place finish in Iowa, receiving neither the boost granted to Sanders and Buttigieg nor the preemptive postmortems delivered to Biden. Polling in New Hampshire generally places her fourth, but she remains in third in national polling and in position to pick up a significant share of delegates on Super Tuesday on March 3.\n\nWe're in the top three in Iowa, and now we've landed in New Hampshire, and now we're out there fighting for everyone in New Hampshire, and then after that we have 55 more states and territories, Warren said during a short meeting with reporters Tuesday, indicating that there's little chance she would alter her campaign's long-game-focused, organizing-heavy strategy.\n\nBut it's unclear how the Warren team plans to jumpstart her campaign into actually winning the nomination, particularly as Sanders continues to raise gargantuan sums ― his campaign announced Thursday morning he raised more than $25 million in January ― and seemingly consolidates his hold on the left-leaning voters they once battled over.\n\nIf Warren can't get a boost in New Hampshire, she'll need to look to Nevada for a boost. But there are signs of trouble there: She's cut more than $300,000 from her television ad buys in the state, Advertising Analytics reported. And on Thursday, Politico reported that six women of color left Warren's Nevada staff in recent months, frustrated by a campaign culture they felt didn't value their input. At the Derry event, Warren issued an apology.\n\nI believe these women, completely and without reservation. And I apologize that they have had a bad experience on this campaign, she told reporters. I take personal responsibility for this. And I'm working with my team to address these concerns.\n\nBut as the field remains fractured ― not a single candidate dropped out after Monday night's caucuses in Iowa ― and the entrance of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg starting on Super Tuesday is set to throw the race into further chaos, some Warren allies have begun suggesting the candidate who consistently emphasizes her ability to unify the party could do just that from a contested Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee in July.\n\nA brokered convention has previously been more of a plot device than an active political reality, but I think it's an extremely live possibility in 2020, said Jeff Hauser, a Democratic strategist who supports Warren. In the context of a president who scares a party so much, and with the memory of 2016 divisions so sharp, I think the candidate who is disliked by the fewest members of the party is going to make a compelling choice.\n\nAmanda Terkel contributed reporting from Derry, New Hampshire.
The Democratic presidential candidates didn't come to the debate Wednesday in Las Vegas to be nice.\n\nThe feistiest debate of the 2020 presidential election cycle came three days before the Nevada caucuses, and it's understandable why. The first two contests of the primary race, in Iowa and New Hampshire, were a wash. And in two weeks, a third of all the delegates in the Democratic primary will be decided in one day, likely sealing the fate of most of the candidates in the race.\n\nThere were six presidential candidates on the debate stage in Nevada: former Vice President Joe Biden, billionaire media mogul Michael Bloomberg, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Each one still sees a path to the White House, but the clock is ticking.\n\nIt was Bloomberg's first Democratic debate. The former Republican New York City mayor made it on the debate stage after the Democratic Party changed the qualification rules to focus more on poll numbers instead of grassroots donations (Bloomberg is self-funding). From the get-go, the other Democrats on the stage made it clear Bloomberg wasn't getting a first-timer's free pass.\n\nSo I'd like to talk about who we're running against: a billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians' — and, no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg, Warren said in her first remark of the night.\n\nBut then again, the candidates weren't giving any of their fellow competitors a free pass either. Warren went after just about everyone on stage — twice over. Buttigieg seemed to have it out for Sanders and Klobuchar. And Biden and Sanders took their turns punching at Bloomberg, like the rest of them.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Wednesday's debate:\n\nJohn Locher/ASSOCIATED PRESS Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) try to get in their time at the Democratic presidential primary debate Wednesday in Las Vegas.\n\nBloomberg took a punch. And another punch. And then another one. And another one.\n\nPeople of color, women and his exorbitant wealth: the three areas of Bloomberg's record that came under attack Wednesday night. And the attacks were unrelenting and from every direction.\n\nSanders got to take the first swing at Bloomberg: He went after Bloomberg's record on police policy when he was New York mayor. Namely, the stop-and-frisk policy, the directive to police to stop, question and search suspicious people that disproportionately targeted Black and brown teenagers. It increased sevenfold under Bloomberg's tenure from 2002 to 2013.\n\nMr. Bloomberg had policies in New York City of stop-and-frisk that [targeted] African American and Latino people in an outrageous way, Sanders said. That is not how you're going to grow voter turnout.\n\nWarren and Biden took their turns. They hit Bloomberg on stop-and-frisk and his record with women. Over the past several decades, 64 women have brought forward nearly 40 sex discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuits against Bloomberg and his company. Women at Bloomberg LP have reportedly been bound by nondisclosure agreements (NDAs), which Bloomberg refused to break when pressed on the debate stage.\n\nHe has gotten some number of women ― dozens, who knows ― to sign nondisclosure agreements, both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace, Warren said. So, Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements, so we can hear their side of the story?\n\nBiden pressed on the NDA issue further.\n\nLook, let's get something straight here. It's easy. All the mayor has to do is say, You are released from the nondisclosure agreement, period, Biden said. You think the women, in fact, were ready to say I don't want anybody to know about what you did to me? That's not how it works. The way it works is they say, look, this is what you did to me, and the mayor comes along and his attorneys said, I will give you this amount of money if you promise you will never say anything. That's how it works.\n\nBloomberg should have expected these hits. His record with communities of color, his wealth, and his record with women have all come under intense scrutiny in the last week. Yet he appeared unprepared on all fronts. He was muted in his defense of stop-and-frisk policies. He chalked up the harassment complaints to maybe they didn't like a joke I told, refusing to free the women at his companies from the NDAs they'd signed, and didn't have an answer for why he has yet to release his tax returns other than to say he's working on it.\n\nRemember, I only entered this race 10 weeks ago, Bloomberg said. All of my associates here have been at this for a couple of years.\n\nThat only opened him up to further attack.\n\nThat's right, we have, Buttigieg jumped back. Engaging with voters and humbling ourselves to the backyards and diners.\n\nElizabeth Warren came ready to fight.\n\nJohn Locher/ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wasn't the only one to take a jab at debate stage newcomer Mike Bloomberg, but she hit him early and hard.\n\nNo one was holding back, but Warren was in a particular fighting mood, and it was a notable shift from past debates.\n\nHer hits on Bloomberg were numerous and incisive, but on multiple occasions, Warren literally went down the line of competitors alongside her on stage, picking apart their campaigning styles, records and policy platforms.\n\nMayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their health care, Warren said of his so-called Medicare for All Who Want It public option plan. It's not a plan; it's a PowerPoint. And Amy's plan is even less. It's like a Post-it note, insert plan here.\n\nWarren later added Klobuchar's plan was only two paragraphs to really drive the point home.\n\nShe even took a jab — albeit a smaller one — at Sanders, whom she has often buddied up with on the debate stage.\n\nBernie has started very much — has a good start. But instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work. And then his own advisers say, eh, probably won't happen anyway.\n\nWarren has had a hard time finding her footing in the race. She had an epic rise in early fall of 2019, when her brand as the woman with the plans made her look like a favorite for the early contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. Then her support fled to other candidates, such as Buttigieg and Klobuchar. And her third- and fourth-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, respectively, stifled any momentum she had in earlier months of campaigning.\n\nWarren's campaign made it clear that they see this primary process in the long term, and Warren herself made it clear that she's not standing down.\n\nButtigieg and Klobuchar really don't seem to like each other.\n\nIt's been clear for a couple of debates that Klobuchar and Buttigieg have some sourness toward each other. Early on, Klobuchar questioned whether Buttigieg had the experience to hold the nation's highest office.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Buttigieg seemed to imply Klobuchar didn't have the intelligence, highlighting a moment last week when the senator couldn't name the president of Mexico.\n\nYou're staking your candidacy on your Washington experience, Buttigieg said. You're on the committee that oversees border security. You're on the committee that does trade. You're literally in part of the committee that's overseeing these things and were not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south.\n\nAre you trying to say that I'm dumb? Or are you mocking me here, Pete? Klobuchar retorted.\n\nAnd that wasn't the only tense moment between the two.\n\nJohn Locher/ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) got into a dust-up with Pete Buttigieg over a gaffe last week about the name of Mexico's president.\n\nThe Medicare For All fight you have definitely heard before isn't going anywhere.\n\nLike at every Democratic debate, the health care fight Wednesday was about Medicare for All, and, drum roll please, how the country can pay for it.\n\nButtigieg seemed most eager to pick this fight with Sanders, especially in light of recent news about the Culinary Workers Union — a powerful organizing force in Nevada that said it received harassing messages from Sanders supporters after signaling to its members that Medicare for All would be bad for them.\n\nWe can actually deliver health care without taking it away from anyone, Buttigieg said. And we can build a movement without having legions of our supporters online and in person attacking Democratic figures and union leaders alike.\n\nButtigieg brought up the subject again later in the debate, focusing on the cost of Medicare for All.\n\nHe's said that it's impossible to even know how much it's going to cost, and even after raising taxes on everybody making $29,000, there is still a multitrillion-dollar hole, Buttigieg said.\n\nFor close watchers of the debate, Buttigieg is repeating an attack that Sanders, and Warren, have confronted before. As proposed, Sanders' Medicare for All plan, which would move all Americans to a single government-run health insurance program, is more generous than most private-sector plans. He has not identified a payment plan but instead cites a list of possible taxes he supports. And for unions with even stronger health care plans, Sanders has since said he would include a provision mandating companies with union-negotiated health plans to enter contract negotiations under the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nDemocrats have been in a seemingly never-ending debate about the appropriate future of health care in the United States. That fight doesn't seem to be going anywhere.\n\nBernie Sanders isn't going anywhere either.\n\nSanders is a leading candidate. He's rising in the polls. He looks poised to win the caucuses in Nevada and have a strong showing on Super Tuesday, March 3.\n\nSanders faced some difficult subjects. He was met with familiar attacks on his health care plan and his self-proclaimed democratic socialism. And he was asked yet again to answer for angry online supporters.\n\nWe have over 10.6 million people on Twitter, and 99.9% of them are decent human beings, are working people, are people who believe in justice, compassion and love, Sanders said. And if there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people. They are not part of our movement.\n\nBut Sanders was doing just as much of the attacking Wednesday. He came to the debate already a winner of a primary contest and with the momentum behind him.\n\nSeeing how feisty the rest of the field was, it's clear that some of the other candidates got that message, too: If things continue as they are, the race could consolidate around Sanders in a couple of weeks.\n\nOr it could be completely up for grabs.
Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) closed out 2020 by expunging nearly 500,000 non-felony cannabis-related records, an action mandated by Illinois' marijuana legalization law that went into effect a year ago.\n\nAs part of the action, the governor also pardoned 9,219 low-level cannabis conviction records, part of the state's efforts to repair the damage inflicted by the war on drugs ― primarily on residents of color.\n\nWe will never be able to fully remedy the depth of the damage in communities of color, who have disproportionately shouldered this burden, Pritzker said Thursday in a statement announcing the expungements. But we can govern with the courage to admit the mistakes of our past — and the decency to set a better path forward.\n\nIllinois' Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which legalized cannabis in the state, required the government to expunge 47,000 cannabis-related arrest records created between 2013 and 2019 by Jan. 1, 2021.\n\nIn a unique twist, the law also created a program that reinvests 25% of cannabis tax revenue into a fund for youth development, anti-violence programs, re-entry programs, economic development and civil legal aid services for R3 communities ― those dealing with high rates of gun violence, child poverty and incarceration rates.\n\nWith Thursday's action, the state also met a separate January 2025 deadline to expunge all 492,192 state-level records.\n\nHowever, only nine of the state's 102 counties have finished clearing their own non-felony cannabis-related arrest records.\n\nIn a statement to the Chicago Sun-Times, state Sen. Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford (D) said the expungements are encouraging, yet ultimately incremental.\n\nDismantling decades' worth of criminal justice atrocities will take years. That's evidenced by how this country handles cannabis, she said. We must never stop chipping away at that painful history. I'm proud of these critical first steps.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly stated Illinois has 201 counties. It has 102.
Political risk exists everywhere, as does uncertainty about how, when, or whether it will manifest itself in ways detrimental to international traders, investors, and lenders. For decades, conventional wisdom dictated that developing and emerging countries were the greatest sources of such risk, due to the absence of meaningful and enforceable laws, the prevalence of corruption, lack of financial resources, and security concerns. That of course remains the case, but as has been proven as a result of the Great Recession, the global war on terror, corruption scandals and growing income disparity, developed countries contribute every bit as much as those 'other' countries to the rising risks associated with cross-border transactions.\n\nThis has become a source of great concern to many global businesses, which are scrambling to stay ahead of the headlines. Some of the things that used to be taken for granted - such as that Europe will always be a source of stability and growth, or that China is an investment destination that must be included in an investment portfolio - simply are no longer the case. Europe's rolling recession -- complete with anemic growth and security concerns - will mean the continent will be a source of instability for many years to come. China's incessant bubble economy, declining long-term growth rates, and increasingly unfriendly policies toward foreign investors have given many companies pause for many years now. There are plenty of other examples of how conventional wisdom has been turned upside down.\n\nAs the U.S. enters a period of unprecedented post-war political instability, many businesses are wondering how to plan for the near and medium-term future. Decision makers in business sometimes have short memories; a preoccupation with making profit will continue to cloud the judgement of some of them. Recent headlines have stated how optimistic some business leaders are about America's future, believing that the pro-business platform about to be implemented is a stairway to heaven. It may well be. A significant reduction in corporate tax rates combined with an orientation toward America First could indeed propel the U.S. economy to heights unseen in decades -- at least, in the short-term.\n\nThe alternative argument is that the U.S. is about to lead the world into a wave of destructive economic nationalism that threatens to undermine the core of the post-war global trade and investment regime. In a zero-sum world where my gain must come at your loss, everyone stands to lose, of course. Imposing unilateral tariffs simply results in more of the same. Protectionism implies less competition, higher prices, rising inflation, and higher interest rates. Some of those foreign companies that previously couldn't wait to earn tax breaks by investing in the U.S. and hiring American workers are about to become a thing of the past.\n\nWhile global businesses have become accustomed to finding new markets and identifying ways to hedge risk, they are less adept at fundamentally altering their business models. Some U.S. businesses are already canceling plans to build foreign production facilities abroad. Some foreign businesses are already purchasing insurance in the event their U.S. investment proposals are not approved in the coming months. There is great unease about what the trade and investment regime will turn out to be 6 or 12 months from now, and with good reason. The paradigm shift that voters in the U.S., UK, the Philippines and elsewhere have ushered in is about to start sending shock waves around the world.\n\nIn 1990 I published an article entitled Why Political Risk Insurance Will Grow in the 1990s. At that time, the former Soviet Union had recently disintegrated, the Gulf War was about to commence, and there was general uncertainty about where the world was headed. I predicted at that time that political risk insurance (PRI) would grow dramatically because of enhanced demand. Indeed, it did. The PRI industry stands at a similar precipice today. With the looming possibility of trade wars, a deterioration in investment climates, and ever tightening lending standards, there is every reason to believe that, as much as the industry has grown - and that growth has been dramatic over the past 25 years - it also stands to grow dramatically in the coming 5-10 years.\n\nThis is both an opportunity and a challenge for the PRI industry, as well as those traders, investors and lenders who will utilize PRI to reduce their cost of capital and expand their business operations around the world. For the PRI industry, the challenge will be how to delicately balance a desire to underwrite more transactions with the need to impose even tighter underwriting standards. The temptation will be to incorporate a variety of long-term investment transactions and short-term credit transactions into underwriting portfolios, based on the many lessons learned as a result of previous claims. That temptation will be tempered, however, by the realization that history is no longer the teacher it once was. When paradigms shift, meaningfully predicting the future will become an even greater challenge.\n\nFor businesses, the desire to rely on PRI to strip out non-commercial risk from transactions will become greater than ever, for the same reason - to grow and generate ever greater revenue, deals must be done, even when the ground shifts beneath them. There will be ever greater competition for the product, but only those transactions with the best story to tell, and having the right combination of quality, tenor, size, and location, will receive coverage. Revenue in coming years will become increasingly associated with thought leadership and bravado, combined with deployment of the right risk management tools.\n\nIn ordinary times, PRI has proven to be an indispensable tool for many businesses that operate internationally in order to maintain growth and profitability. But this is no ordinary time; The winds of change are about to hit us like a hurricane. As the global trade and investment climate deteriorates, and becomes more unpredictable, demand for PRI should soar. The ability to manage cross-border risk through PRI -- and other insurance products -- will ultimately make the difference between those businesses that find a way to thrive in this era of disruption, or merely survive.\n\n*Daniel Wagner is Managing Director of Risk Cooperative and co-author of the new book Global Risk Agility and Decision Making.
Lou Dobbs guest Ed Rollins refers to sitting congresswoman @AOC as the little girl pic.twitter.com/pJyjaBGX91\n\nRepublican political strategist and campaign consultant Ed Rollins dismissively referred to 29-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) as the little girl with a big mouth.\n\nThat triggered a trademark zinger from the congresswoman, who called Rollins a walking argument for a 100 percent tax on misogyny.\n\nRollins told Fox News' Lou Dobbs on Friday: If you're going to put her out front with her mouth ... the little girl who wants pre-Reagan economics of 70 percent taxes, the Democratic women are basically going to be damaged.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said in a tweet that such attacks on women are apparently the best argument Republicans have in policy debates.\n\nGOP loves to insult my intelligence, yet offers *this* as their best + most seasoned opposition to my policy proposals.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this dude is a walking argument to tax misogyny at 100% 😉\n\n\n\nRepublicans rob everyone the opportunity of real policy debate by resorting to this. https://t.co/Yk3BTHbtxv — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 5, 2019\n\nBut what does Ocasio-Cortez know about tax policy? A lot, said the headline of an opinion piece Saturday in The New York Times by Nobel economics laureate Paul Krugman. A similar tax rate was imposed in the U.S. for 35 years after World War II, which included some of the most successful periods of economic growth in history, Krugman wrote.\n\nTax cuts for the ultra wealthy mean far less to them than cuts for people with modest incomes, Krugman noted. And extra money in millions of hands boosts spending.\n\nA policy that makes the rich a bit poorer will affect only a handful of people, and will barely affect their life satisfaction, since they will still be able to buy whatever they want, Krugman wrote.\n\nNobel economics laureate Peter Diamond — arguably the world's leading expert in public finance, according to Krugman — has calculated the optimum top tax rate at 73 percent. Several other experts back that up.\n\nSo Ocasio-Cortez, far from showing her craziness, is fully in line with serious economic research, Krugman added. Republican policy to keep taxes on the wealthy low, on the other hand, rests on research by … well, nobody, he added.\n\nKrugman's conclusion: Ocasio-Cortez definitely knows more economics than almost everyone in the GOP caucus.
The mooted GOP tax plan has drawn some positive attention from trade reformers because it's the first tax plan in decades to make serious moves designed to reduce America's trade deficit.\n\nUnfortunately, unless I'm totally missing something, it's also a seriously crazy document.\n\nSo crazy, in fact, that despite not being an ultra-partisan fanatic, I am forced to the conclusion that either the GOP leadership is even stupider than ordinary political cynicism would assume, or the plan is simply not meant in earnest. (Is it a trap for Trump, to discredit him if he's foolish enough to buy into it? Dunno. A trap for the idea of tax-based trade reform? Ditto. But either of these hypotheses would make more sense than the idea that they actually mean it.)\n\nNow it has many aspects, most of which I won't go into because its trade aspects alone are sufficient to rule it out as serious policy.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe GOP blueprint is basically a so-called border adjustable cash flow tax, a/k/a a territorial cash flow tax, a/k/a destination based cash flow tax (Twitter hashtag #DBCFT). Export sales are excluded from income, and imported products, services, and labor are not deductible.\n\nThe problem is that this results in a comically extreme disparity between the treatment of imported, domestic, and exported goods. Some examples:\n\n1. Domestic goods: ACME, Inc. sells $100K domestically, with $80K costs procured domestically - result is $20K taxable income. Results same as now.\n\n2. Imported goods: ACME sells $100K domestically, with $80K costs all imported - result is $100K taxable income because the imported inputs are not deductible.\n\n3. Exported goods: ACME sells $100K to foreign buyers, with $80K costs all domestic - result is $80K tax loss.\n\nSo it's a hyper-aggressive subsidy for exports. Boeing can sell a $100 million airplane to Air France, make $20 million in profit, and yet book it as an $80 million tax loss. It's the biggest corporate giveaway I've ever heard of.\n\nThis is so aggressive it will prompt corporations to do transactions that make no sense, simply to capture the tax loss. Profitable companies will buy up any exporting company, just to harvest their tax losses.\n\nIt's actually not so bad on the import side. Basically, it would force companies to pay their effective corporate tax rate on the value of imported goods. The average corporate tax rate is about 13%, so this would imply approximately a tariff of that amount. (To be fair, the average tax rate on importers is considerably higher, because importing doesn't offer as many loopholes as, say, running a hedge fund, so the de facto tariff would be more.)\n\nFundamentally, if you want to do something about the trade balance, it's problematic to focus on profits, rather than imports and exports themselves.\n\nFor example, what happens when Delta buys the plane Air France just bought in the example above? Because Air France is making the profit on the sale of the plane, and outside U.S. jurisdiction, there's nothing to discourage this. So Boeing will launder all its sales this way. And why shouldn't Delta just buy from Airbus, which is similarly outside U.S. jurisdiction? This tax only has leverage against imports done by American middlemen with profits to grab.\n\nSo what would happen? Here's a real-life case that occurred to me the other day:\n\n1. If I buy a pair of Chinese-made sunglasses from a stand on the Santa Monica Promenade, the landed cost of the glasses is not deductible to the guy who sells them to me, so he pays a very stiff tax for doing so.\n\n2. If I buy the same pair over EBay from a guy in Hong Kong, there's no U.S. middleman to take a tax hit, so there's no disincentive to buy imported glasses.\n\nImplication: a mad rush by consumers and businesses to establish direct import relationships with foreign suppliers. But this a) evades the tax and spoils the incentive, and b) has no rational economic purpose, so it undermines economic efficiency.\n\nSo put me on record this thing is probably too crazy to be real. It's quite likely House Speaker Paul Ryan is just using the public's current attention to the trade deficit as an excuse to get this plan in circulation with the real intention of dialing it back to something less kooky but still lavishly rewarding to his corporate sponsors.
NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images Elon Musk listens to President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, DC, on January 23, 2017.\n\nElon Musk spent the last decade building an electric car and solar panel company into a $41.7 billion empire aimed at loosening fossil fuels' grip on the global economy.\n\nBut the billionaire Tesla chief executive said he now supports former Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Rex Tillerson becoming secretary of state. Senators narrowly voted along party lines on Monday to confirm Tillerson's nomination.\n\nOn Tuesday, Musk tweeted a December editorial from The Economist arguing that Tillerson had the integrity to talk sense to his boss, President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese and threatened to pull out of the Paris climate accord.\n\nThis may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State, Musk wrote in the tweet.\n\nRex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team, he added. His team is now the USA.\n\nHe then said: I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise.\n\nUnder Tillerson, Exxon Mobil shifted away from its scorched-earth disinformation campaign denying the existence of global warming. During his confirmation hearings this month, Tillerson said he believes in climate change, though he rejected the overwhelming scientific consensus that emissions from burning fossil fuels are the chief cause. Still, in 2009, he publicly backed putting a tax on carbon, albeit as his preference to the cap-and-trade system then being debated in Congress.\n\nRex Tillerson supports a carbon tax. This is what is really needed to move the needle. https://t.co/6ne01TOzs1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 25, 2017\n\nMusk, by contrast, may be one of the strongest advocates for climate science in the Fortune 500. His companies depend on it. In November, shareholders gave Musk the green light to merge Tesla, known for its luxury electric vehicles, with SolarCity, the solar energy firm he ran with his cousins. Musk envisions the combined company as a one-stop shop for zero-emissions vehicles, and home electricity and heating systems.\n\nHis support for Tillerson may be more political than personal. Musk joined Trump's economic advisory team last month, along with the chief executives of General Motors, Uber Technologies and other big firms. He met with the newly sworn-in president on Monday to discuss the future of U.S. manufacturing, of which Tesla aims to be a big part. The company is building factories in Nevada and New York.\n\nSigh — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 25, 2017
WASHINGTON — It's Friday night, and rapper Too Short's Blow the Whistle is blaring inside of the only black-owned bar in D.C.'s predominantly white Dupont Circle neighborhood. Its patrons, drinks in hand, are enjoying various items from its Southern-influenced menu, like chicken and waffles and shrimp 'n' grits.\n\nBut this bar wants to be known for more than just another late-night spot in a city replete with them. It wants to be a space where black people can come together to freely express their whole selves, in a city where such spaces seem to be disappearing.\n\nThe Caged Bird, which opened its doors in July, is the newest bar that seeks to cater to black millennials in a city that was sued for discriminatory practices that promoted gentrification earlier this year.\n\nWashington, D.C., one of the blackest cities in America, has been experiencing an economic renaissance for nearly two decades — but that renaissance is considered nothing more than gentrification by longtime residents. According to the D.C. Chamber of Commerce's State of the Business Report, whiter and richer families are increasingly displacing low- and middle-income families. As affluent families move in, higher rents push out black residents, and black businesses leave with them.\n\nDerek S. Hyra, a public affairs professor at American University and author of Race, Class, and Politics in the Cappuccino City, says the District's redevelopment is disproportionately affecting communities of color.\n\nWith this economic boom, the tax base in Washington, D.C., has grown, but so has racial inequality, Hyra told HuffPost. There's a study by the Urban Institute that shows that white household wealth is 81 times that of black family wealth. There's immense inequality in the city.\n\nDupont Circle has been known as Washington's central neighborhood for gay life and business for decades. It is a trendy area filled with art galleries, bars, nightclubs and shops. Black business owners weren't seeing themselves represented in this vibrant area, prompting some entrepreneurs to plant roots in the neighborhood to try and attract black customers.\n\nTosin F/The Caged Bird The Caged Bird in Washington, D.C.\n\nBrandon Rule, one of the co-owners of The Caged Bird, knows how important it is to have a space for black people, by black people.\n\nWe wanted to combine the power of food, culture and community to foster an environment that welcomes and encourages artistic expression, cultural exploration and diverse experiences in hopes that, together, we can reimagine what's possible for our culture and community in D.C. and beyond, Rule told HuffPost.\n\nRule, 30, founded the bar with seven others who combined their resources to create a space, named in honor of Maya Angelou's famed memoir, that is 100 percent owned, operated, staffed and financed specifically by black millennials. It joined the roughly 2.6 million black-owned businesses in the United States, according to the United States Census Bureau.\n\nOn this night, the people inside The Caged Bird are choosing from the specially crafted menu at the venue for DMV Black Restaurant Week, the first of its kind celebrating the best black restaurants in the nation's capital.\n\nAndra AJ Johnson, a co-founder of the inaugural restaurant week, is a consultant for The Caged Bird.\n\nOur mission is about setting businesses to succeed by being able to reach the customers they need to reach, Johnson said, explaining the thought process behind creating restaurant week. Representation from an ethnic standpoint is low, and from a black standpoint, it's even lower. It's all about inclusivity.\n\nThat's partly why Kimberly Smith and Amaya Smith, founders of the Brown Beauty Co-Op, decided to open their business in Dupont Circle. The duo recently celebrated the grand opening of their store in December and chose the neighborhood because of the lack of representation in the area.\n\nIt was important to me that if I started a business, I want it to be in the District. Not outside on the outskirts or the suburbs, but be here, Kimberly Smith, 38, said.\n\nErin Martin/@bagladies The Brown Beauty Co-Op in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe pair wants the co-op to be known as more than just a shop to purchase beauty supplies. They hope the Brown Beauty Co-Op will also be a safe space for all women of color and a hub that provides mentorship for emerging black entrepreneurs and businesses.\n\nThey plan to provide newer brands shelf space to showcase their products and provide feedback from consumers and industry professionals to help them thrive in the market.\n\nWe want to help other businesses, Kimberly Smith said. Not every beauty business can be in a Bloomingdale's or Target, but there are so many people that are making really great products, and we want to give that retail experience to other small, emerging brands.\n\nWe wanted to show other people that we can have a successful business here in Dupont Circle that is catered to us. We chose this space, not only because it was needed, but to show that we can still be successful even when we target ourselves.
Lord Porter Lord Porter, chairman of the LGA, said council chiefs have repeatedly sounded the alarm on funding\n\nThe vast majority of town halls will put up council tax and hike charges as 80% fear for their financial survival, according to a new survey. An astounding 95% of English authority bosses plan a council tax hike while 93% said they will increase charges to make ends meet, the LGiU think tank discovered. The greatest immediate pressure on budgets came in children's services (32% of councils) followed by adult social care (28%), and housing and homelessness (19%), the report found. Adult social care was the greatest long-term pressure (38%), the survey said. Lord Porter, Local Government Association Chairman, said councils had been warning a cliff-edge was looming for council at the end of the decade. Some councils continue to be pushed perilously close to the financial edge, Porter said. Many will have to make tough decisions about which services have to be scaled back or stopped altogether to plug funding gaps. Extra council tax raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face. This means many councils face having to ask residents to pay more council tax while offering fewer services as a result.\n\nFunding pressures\n\nIt came as Labour announced the party will help councils bring services back in house, set up new energy companies and develop local economies using a team of experts. Speaking in Preston Thursday, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell will unveil the new 'Community Wealth Building Unit'. Preston City Council is reported to have returned almost £200m to the local economy and supported more than 1,600 jobs by using the town's anchor institutions and council contracts to and develop cooperatives. Tory austerity has blighted our communities and forced councils to cut and privatise many public services that we all rely on, he will say. The next Labour government will end austerity and properly fund local authorities, instead of cutting back and passing the buck like the Conservatives are doing. But we cannot afford to wait until we are in power nationally. Tory peer Lord Porter said local authorities face a funding gap of more than £5bn by 2020, but children's services was the area most in need of urgent attention. He said: The LGA has warned about the urgent need to address the £2bn funding gap facing children's services. A child is being referred to council children's services every 49 seconds on a daily basis and councils started more than 500 child protection investigations every day last year - up from 200 a decade ago. This unprecedented surge in demand shows no sign of abating. Council tax can be hiked by up to 3% this year, in line with inflation, before a referendum is triggered, while authorities can also levy an additional precept to raise money for spending on social care. The majority of the councils who responded to the survey (59%) were Tory-run authorities.\n\nPA Archive/PA Images Labour's Andrew Gwynne says there is a cross-party consensus for reform of local government funding\n\nJonathan Carr-West, chief executive of LGiU, said: Councils are on the edge. They are for the most part holding services together (though a significant minority are not). But they can only do this this by raising council tax, increasing charging and draining their reserves. The system is unsustainable and needs far more fundamental reform than is presently on offer. It's simply not acceptable that we don't know how local government will work post 2020. Councils are calling for assurances around funding for the next three years and for a fundamental redesign of the finance system. At present government is offering neither. That has to change. Andrew Gwynne, Labour's Shadow Communities Secretary, added: These findings show that after almost eight years of cuts, councils are facing unprecedented pressures to balance their books. When faced with choices; of where to cut, and where to invest - the government has failed to show that they understood the real life, human challenges facing this country. There's now a widespread consensus, across the political divide, that how we fund local public services desperately needs reform, but the Government does not appear to be listening to the sector.\n\nPA Wire/PA Images Communities Secretary Sajid Javid
LAS VEGAS ― President Donald Trump's choice to stay at his own Las Vegas hotel each night during the western states swing that wraps up Friday likely cost taxpayers a million extra dollars as well as diverted thousands of them into his own cash registers.\n\nPrevious presidents on extended trips away from the White House typically stayed in the city of each day's final event, or traveled to the city of the following day's first event. Trump, instead, traveled back to Las Vegas each night from California, Arizona and Colorado to overnight at his Trump International Hotel ― requiring several extra hours' flying time on Air Force One, a plane that costs taxpayers about a quarter-million dollars per hour in the air.\n\nAt this point in his presidency, there's no way to look at it other than Donald Trump is using his position and taxpayer dollars to make money for his businesses, said Jordan Libowitz with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. This is beyond a conflict of interest. This is corruption, plain and simple.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about his decision to return to Las Vegas each night just before he left for California, he claimed he had nothing to do with it.\n\nLargely, the schedule is set by the Secret Service. We do what they want us to, he told reporters at Joint Base Andrews just before the plane's departure. I don't set the schedule. I have nothing to do with it.\n\nIt's unclear, however, what Trump meant. Previous presidents visited the same western states numerous times, for example, and never once stayed in a Trump property.\n\nA Secret Service spokesperson told HuffPost: The U.S. Secret Service works in conjunction with the administration on all presidential and First Family visits as our primary concern is the safety and security of those that we protect.\n\nTrump's White House did not try to defend the accuracy of Trump's claim, and instead argued that the decision to use Trump International Hotel Las Vegas as a base actually saved taxpayers' money.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump pumps his fist as he arrives at McCarran International Airport on Feb. 18 in Las Vegas.\n\nIf the president had stayed in three different cities over three different nights that would mean three different advance teams traveling out ahead, three different USSS teams traveling ahead, it would mean impacting traffic with road closures in three different cities, taking rooms for security and communications at three different hotels, and various other necessities for presidential travel in three different cities, said a senior White House official on condition of anonymity. The hotel the president is in is well known to USSS in terms of security and the footprint needed. In short, doing it the way we're doing it saved money for the government and Las Vegas is most central to all the stops. Only a small contingent of required staff with specific roles stay at the hotel with the president. The majority of staff stay at a different hotel. All hotel stays are at the government rate.\n\nThat analysis, though, ignores the single biggest driver of presidential costs: the use of Air Force One.\n\nAccording to a report by the Government Accountability Office last year, the Air Force unit that operates the modified Boeing 747 normally used as the presidential aircraft spent $4.4 million for four round trips from Andrews to Palm Beach in early 2017 ― which works out to $273,063 for each hour of flight time.\n\nHad Trump held the same events but done so in a geographically logical order ― starting in Beverly Hills and finishing in Colorado Springs, but overnighting each day in the city where he would begin the following morning ― Trump would have spent four fewer hours aboard Air Force One, thereby saving taxpayers about $1.1 million.\n\nThe anonymous White House official's claim that more motorcades would have been required also does not tell the whole story. A full motorcade ― including the presidential limousine, staff vans and various specialized trucks ― is needed in any city where Trump is traveling, regardless of whether it will be used to move him from an airport to an event site and back, or to an overnight hotel and then to the event site the next day.\n\nWhat's more, advance teams scout out a city and motorcade routes are closed to traffic on any presidential visit, regardless of whether it is for a brief visit or an overnight stay.\n\nIndeed, the repeated overnight trips to Las Vegas may have forced the Secret Service and other support personnel to keep a motorcade there for a full four days, rather than move it to the site of an upcoming presidential trip.\n\nThis week is not the first time Trump used presidential trips to spend time at his own properties, even though it added considerable travel and security costs for taxpayers. In 2018, for example, he spent two days between official meetings in London and a Helsinki summit with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin at his own resort in Scotland, rather than waiting in London. And last summer, he insisted on staying at his resort on the west coast of Ireland on the days surrounding his visit to Normandy, France, even though it required several additional hours on Air Force One.\n\nPrecisely how many taxpayer dollars wind up in Trump's pocket from these stays cannot be determined. The White House, despite numerous queries from HuffPost over a period of months, refuses to disclose how many executive branch employees stay with Trump when he visits his own properties and how much it is costing taxpayers. And how much of that revenue winds up as profit flowing to Trump also is not known because Trump reneged on a campaign promise ― and decades of precedent ― by refusing to disclose his tax returns.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Trump's business charged Secret Service agents as much as $650 a night for rooms at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and $17,000 a month for a cottage at Trump's golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nBased on these and other invoices obtained by various groups using lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act, Trump has likely funneled at least several million dollars of taxpayer dollars into his own cash registers in his first three years in office.
WASHINGTON ― There's a way for the Trump administration to continue food assistance during the government shutdown ― at least according to one legal theory.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that because the agency overseeing food aid is shut down, benefits for 38 million Americans may disappear after February. President Donald Trump has said the shutdown could continue for months or a year.\n\nThe people who get food benefits will go hungry if this happens. The late 20th century expansion of the food stamp program helped eradicate starvation in the U.S.\n\nBut Professor David Super, an expert on administrative and welfare law at Georgetown University Law School, argues that the conventional wisdom misreads the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program's underlying statute.\n\nSuper points to the text of the Food and Nutrition Act, which indicates more than once that anyone who is poor enough to qualify for benefits is supposed to get them. Assistance under this program shall be furnished to all eligible households who make application for such participation, the law says.\n\nWhile it may seem obvious that people should get benefits for which they're eligible, the wording is significant. It echoes the entitlement language in the Social Security Act that preserves health and retirement benefits for seniors even if the federal government is partially shuttered.\n\nSuper is not alone in his analysis.\n\nWe have long agreed with some legal experts that SNAP's authorizing law requires SNAP benefits continue during a shutdown, Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in an email. The CBPP is an influential liberal think tank.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, did not respond to requests for comment. The agency has been mostly silent about what will happen to food assistance during a prolonged shutdown, except for a late December press release that only indicated it had funds for January's benefits. It's not clear what would happen in February if the government remains closed.\n\nIf the USDA reversed itself and said benefits would continue despite a prolonged shutdown, it would be in good company. The Internal Revenue Service had said it would collect tax revenue but not issue refunds ― until Monday, when officials said the agency would dish out refunds after all.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Past actions by Congress on food stamps could authorize the government to continue to offer food stamps even during a shutdown, according to legal experts.\n\nIf the shutdown continues and USDA determines it does not have the authority to extend SNAP in the absence of congressional action, many low-income households would be at risk of serious hunger and hardship, Rosenbaum wrote in a blog post, adding that food banks would see dramatic increases in needy families.\n\nEnding SNAP would not only cause material hardship for the program's beneficiaries ― most of whom are very young, elderly or disabled ― it would also rattle the economy.\n\nJoe Brusuelas, an economist with the accounting firm RSM, estimated a full year without SNAP benefits would reduce gross domestic product by as much as 1 percent. (For comparison, most analyses of the new Republican tax law said it would boost GDP by less than 1 percent in its early years.)\n\nA spokesman for House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) declined to say whether the chairman agreed that food aid could continue to operate despite the shutdown.\n\nIt's not just the entitlement language that should protect SNAP benefits. Though lawmakers have appropriated money for SNAP annually, Super argues they have also amended the statute over the years to make SNAP less contingent on appropriations.\n\nThe conventional wisdom, that SNAP must terminate benefits absent an appropriation, was correct under the statute as it once existed, Super said in an email. But, as often happens, the conventional wisdom failed to update as Congress repeatedly amended the statute.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of President Donald Trump's failed presidential campaign played key roles in orchestrating the Washington rally that spawned a deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol, according to an Associated Press review of records, undercutting claims the event was the brainchild of the president's grassroots supporters.\n\nA pro-Trump nonprofit group called Women for America First hosted the Save America Rally on Jan. 6 at the Ellipse, an oval-shaped, federally owned patch of land near the White House. But an attachment to the National Park Service public gathering permit granted to the group lists more than half a dozen people in staff positions for the event who just weeks earlier had been paid thousands of dollars by Trump's 2020 reelection campaign. Other staff scheduled to be on site during the demonstration have close ties to the White House.\n\nSince the siege, several of them have scrambled to distance themselves from the rally.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Jan. 6, 2021 file photo, Trump supporters participate in a rally in Washington.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\nThe riot at the Capitol, incited by Trump's comments before and during his speech at the Ellipse, has led to a reckoning unprecedented in American history. The president told the crowd to march to the Capitol and that you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.\n\nA week after the rally, Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the first U.S. president ever to be impeached twice. But the political and legal fallout may stretch well beyond Trump, who will exit the White House on Wednesday before Democrat Joe Biden takes the oath of office. Trump had refused for nearly two months to accept his loss in the 2020 election to the former vice president.\n\nWomen for America First, which applied for and received the Park Service permit, did not respond to messages seeking comment about how the event was financed and about the Trump campaign's involvement. The rally drew tens of thousands of people.\n\nIn a statement, the president's reelection campaign said it did not organize, operate or finance the event. No campaign staff members were involved in the organization or operation of the rally, according to the statement. It said that if any former employees or independent contractors for the campaign took part, they did not do so at the direction of the Trump campaign.\n\nAt least one was working for the Trump campaign this month. Megan Powers was listed as one of two operations managers for the Jan. 6 event, and her LinkedIn profile says she was the Trump campaign's director of operations into January 2021. She did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Jan. 6, 2021 file photo people arrive to attend a rally in support of President Donald Trump.

They deactivated or locked down their social media profiles, removed tweets that referenced the rally and blocked a reporter who asked questions.\n\nCaroline Wren, a veteran GOP fundraiser, is named as a VIP Advisor on an attachment to the permit that Women for America First provided to the agency. Between mid-March and mid-November, Donald J. Trump for President Inc. paid Wren $20,000 a month, according to Federal Election Commission records. During the campaign, she was a national finance consultant for Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee between the president's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nWren was involved in at least one call before the pro-Trump rally with members of several groups listed as rally participants to organize credentials for VIP attendees, according to Kimberly Fletcher, the president of one of those groups, Moms for America.\n\nWren retweeted messages about the event ahead of time, but a cache of her account on Google shows at least eight of those tweets disappeared from her timeline. She apparently removed some herself, and others were sent from accounts that Twitter suspended.\n\nOne of the messages Wren retweeted was from Stop the Steal, another group identified as a rally participant on a website promoting the event. The Jan. 2 message thanked Republican senators who said they would vote to overturn Biden's election victory, including Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas. She also retweeted a Jan. 1 message from the president promoting the event, as well as promotional messages from one of the president's son, Eric Trump, and Katrina Pierson, a Tea Party activist and a spokesperson for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nWren did not return messages seeking comment, and locked her Twitter account after the AP reached out to her last Monday to ask her about her involvement in the Trump rally and the tweets she had removed. Several days later, she blocked the AP reporter.\n\nMaggie Mulvaney, a niece of former top Trump aide Mick Mulvaney, is listed on the permit attachment as the VIP Lead. She worked as director of finance operations for the Trump campaign, according to her LinkedIn profile. FEC records show Maggie Mulvaney was earning $5,000 every two weeks from Trump's reelection campaign, with the most recent payment reported on Nov. 13.\n\nMaggie Mulvaney had taken down her Twitter account as of last Monday, although it reappeared after an AP reporter asked her about the account's removal. On Sunday, the same day the AP published this report, she blocked that AP reporter on Twitter.\n\nMaggie Mulvaney retweeted several messages on Jan. 6, including one from the president that urged support for the Capitol Police. Trump's Twitter account has been suspended, but the message could be seen in a cache of her Twitter account captured by Google. She also retweeted a message from her uncle, urging Trump to address the nation.\n\nMaggie Mulvaney did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nThe insurrection at the Capitol prompted Mick Mulvaney to quit his position as Trump's special envoy to Northern Ireland. He told CNBC a day after the assault that remaining in the post would prompt people to say 'Oh yeah, you work for the guy who tried to overtake the government.'\n\nThe leaders of Women for America First aren't new to politics.\n\nAmy Kremer, listed as the group's president on records filed with Virginia's state corporation commission, is one of the founding mothers of the modern day tea party movement, according to her website. Her daughter, Kylie Jane Kremer, is the organization's treasurer, according to the records.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Jan. 6, 2021 file photo Amy Kremer, Chairwoman of Women for America First, speaks in Washington, at a rally in support of President Donald Trump.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nThe IRS granted Women for America First tax-exempt status as a social welfare organization a year ago, with the exemption retroactive to February 2019. The AP requested that the group provide any tax records it may have filed since then, but received no response.\n\nIn a statement issued the same day rioters attacked the Capitol, Amy Kremer denounced the assault and said it was instigated after the rally by a handful of bad actors, while seeming to blame Democrats and news organizations for the riot.\n\nUnfortunately, for months the left and the mainstream media told the American people that violence was an acceptable political tool, she said. They were wrong. It is not.\n\nThe AP reviewed social media posts, voter registrations, court files and other public records for more than 120 people either facing criminal charges related to the Jan. 6 unrest or who, going maskless during the pandemic, were later identified through photographs and videos taken during the melee.\n\nThe review found the crowd was overwhelmingly made up of longtime Trump supporters, including Republican Party officials, GOP political donors, far-right militants, white supremacists, off-duty police, members of the military and adherents of the QAnon myth that the government is secretly controlled by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophile cannibals.\n\nVideos posted on social media in the days following the Capitol attack shows that thousands of people stormed the Capitol. A Capitol Police officer died after he was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher as rioters descended on the building and many other officers were injured. A woman from California was shot to death by Capitol Police and three other people died after medical emergencies during the chaos.\n\nTrump's incendiary remarks at the Jan. 6 rally culminated a two-day series of events in Washington, organized by a coalition of the president's supporters who echoed his baseless accusations that the election had been stolen from him. A website, MarchtoSaveAmerica.com, sprung up to promote the pro-Trump events and alerted followers, At 1 PM, we protest at US Capitol. The website has been deactivated.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Donald Trump Jr. arrives on stage as Kimberly Guilfoyle speaks Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington, at a rally in support of President Donald Trump called the Save America Rally.

While she didn't work directly with the campaign, Fletcher did notice a shift in who was involved in the rally and who would be speaking.\n\nWhen I got there and I saw the size of the stage and everything, I'm like, 'Wow, we couldn't possibly have afforded that,' she said. It was a big stage. It was a very professional stage. I don't know who was in the background or who put it together or anything.\n\nIn addition to the large stage, the rally on the Ellipse featured a sophisticated sound system and at least three Jumbotron-style screens projecting the president's image to the crowd. Videos posted online show Trump and his family in a nearby private tent watching the rally on several monitors as music blared in the background.\n\nMoms for America held a more modest Save the Republic rally on Jan. 5 near the U.S. Capitol, an event that drew about 500 people and cost between $13,000 to $14,000, according to Fletcher.\n\nJustin Caporale is listed on the Women for America First paperwork as the event's project manager. He's identified as a partner with Event Strategies Inc., a management and production company. Caporale, formerly a top aide to first lady Melania Trump, was on the Trump campaign payroll for most of 2020, according to the FEC records, and he most recently was being paid $7,500 every two weeks. Caporale didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nTim Unes, the founder and president of Event Strategies, was the stage manager for the Jan. 6 rally, according to the permit paperwork. Unes has longstanding ties to Trump, a connection he highlights on his company's website. Trump's presidential campaign paid Event Strategies $1.3 million in 2020 for audio visual services, according to the campaign finance records. The company declined to comment for this story.\n\nAnother person with close ties to the Trump administration, Hannah Salem, was the rally's operations manager for logistics and communications, according to the permit paperwork. In 2017, she took a hiatus from the consulting firm she founded and spent three years as senior White House press aide, executing the media strategy for President Trump's most high-profile events, according to her company bio and LinkedIn profile.\n\nLast week, within minutes of an AP reporter sending her a LinkedIn message asking about her involvement in and understanding of what happened on Jan. 6, Salem blocked the reporter and did not respond to questions.\n\n___\n\nSmith reported from Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York and Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report.
We've all be there, in the beginning, you make your first Facebook Business page or Twitter account, you fill out your profile, and then upload your company logo (calling it branding), then... you become lost.\n\nYou aren't sure what to do, or how to make it work for your small business. So you schedule some posts about some killer advantages your company has and... nothing.\n\nThen you try to be more personable, so you share pictures of your cat fluffy.\n\nThe internet likes cats right? So that should work.\n\nSilence.\n\nWhat could you be doing wrong?\n\nStarting in the social media space can be daunting when you don't know what you are doing, but you can easily tackle it when keeping a few key things in mind.\n\nYour customers aren't thinking about you or your business.\n\nSocial media is a quick moving space, and users are typically on there to kill time or connect with friends or family.\n\nThis means that the last thing they want is to be sold too or hear a pitch about how awesome you or your business is.\n\nOn the flip side, how do you use social to grow your business if you aren't supposed to sell to them?\n\nWhat's the middle ground?\n\nGo where you are wanted, and make it about your customers instead of you.\n\nDon't force yourself into conversations on Twitter simply because there is a hashtag used that's related to your business. Instead, join a conversation that's already active talking about your industry. You can also answer someone's question that they put out there, without the alterer motive of driving them to your website, or getting them on the phone to have them become a client.\n\nSocial media is all about building relationships over time, and you can't build a relationship with someone if all you are doing is thinking of yourself and your bottom line.\n\nHave fun with it, but keep it relevant.\n\nPart of the value of social media is to be entertaining.\n\nThis might sound like the exact opposite of what you want as a company, but it's a perfect opportunity to build true customer loyalty.\n\nSocial media gives you the opportunity to get in front of your clients without them being defensive about you selling to them. Which means you have to give them something more than a way to join your newsletter or how to use one of your products.\n\nMaking your posts fun, inspiring, or entertaining is how you can do that.\n\nIf you're a realtor that brings their dog everywhere, incorporate that, share pictures of your puppy being your assistant to your business. But if your adorable pet has nothing whatsoever to do with your company, then it doesn't belong on social.\n\nEven if Fluffy gets more shares and likes than anything else you are posting, it's not relevant, and you will only gain a follow of people interested in animal posts instead your business, which doesn't help you grow as a company.\n\nDon't have an adorable pet-related to your business, or have a business about a topic most people aren't too crazy about?

It doesn't have to be all fun and games, but it should add to their day.\n\nAt the end of the day, social media is about building connections and fostering relationships. It's like any good friendship; it takes time.\n\nBut if you take that time you will build a following of lifetime customers, which really should be the end goal.\n\nIt takes a while to gain that traction, you almost have to prove yourself against all the noise of everyone else.\n\nBut if you keep the focus on others, and have fun with it at the same time, they will come.
A business partner of U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in investigations, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.\n\nEvgeny Freidman, a Russian immigrant who is known as the Taxi King, will avoid jail time and will assist government prosecutors in state or federal investigations, the newspaper report said, citing a person briefed on the matter.\n\nThe New York State Attorney General's Office said in a press release that Freidman had pleaded guilty to a criminal charge on Tuesday in an Albany, New York, courtroom, but it made no mention of whether he was cooperating with prosecutors.\n\nFreidman has been Cohen's partner in the taxi business for years, even after New York City regulators barred Freidman last year from continuing to manage taxi medallions, the New York Times said.\n\nFreidman, when asked by Reuters about the report, declined in a text message to answer any questions about cooperating with prosecutors or the terms of his agreement.\n\nThis is me taking responsibility for my actions! ... Michael is a dear dear personal friend and a passive client! That's it! ...I hate that I have been grouped in this runaway train that I am not a part of! Freidman said by text.\n\nFreidman's lawyer, Patrick Egan, declined to comment on the Times report.\n\nFreidman had been accused of failing to pay more than $5 million in taxes and five other criminal counts each carrying maximum prison sentences of up to 25 years. In pleading guilty to a single count of criminal tax fraud, Freidman will be sentenced to five years' probation, the attorney general's office said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the New York state attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York are investigating Cohen for possible bank and tax fraud, possible campaign law violations and perhaps other matters related to Trump's presidential campaign, a person familiar with the probe has said.\n\nThe investigation into Cohen arose in part from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into possible collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia, something that Trump has repeatedly denied.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Florida launched an investigation Wednesday into an upscale nursing home amid reports that it administered coronavirus vaccines to wealthy donors and members of a country club along with its residents and employees.\n\nThe Washington Post and New York Post both reported that MorseLife Health System, a nonprofit that operates a nursing home and assisted living facility in West Palm Beach, has given vaccinations to donors and members of the Palm Beach Country Club, whose foundation has donated at least $75,000 to MorseLife since 2015, tax records show.\n\nThe newspapers reported that the vaccinations were organized by MorseLife CEO Keith Myers and New Jersey-based developer David Mack, who is a member of various MorseLife boards and chairman of the country club foundation's board. The vaccines were distributed at the Joseph L. Morse Health Center, which is on David S. Mack Drive.\n\nMeredith Beatrice, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis, said in an email to The Associated Press that the governor has been extremely clear that vaccine should only be administered to Florida's seniors 65 and older, frontline health care workers, and long-term care facility residents and staff.\n\nWe are investigating this situation and will hold any bad actors accountable, she wrote.\n\nGeorge Shea, a spokesman for David Mack and his brother, Bill Mack, said in a statement Wednesday that the Macks were helping MorseLife in its efforts to distribute the vaccine and did nothing wrong. He said the vaccinations followed state protocols by limiting those given to non-employees to people who are 65 and older.\n\nHe denied that the distribution was targeted at Palm Beach Country Club members. Shea did not respond to reports that the Macks were among those getting vaccinated. The brothers are both about 80 years old.\n\nMyers did not respond to a phone message left Wednesday at his MorseLife office. The company on its website says, our goal is to ensure that older adults enjoy full, rewarding lives in an atmosphere of luxury, outstanding service, and compassionate care.\n\nFlorida state Rep. Omari Hardy, a Democrat whose district includes the MorseLife compound, said it's appalling that the wealthy were given exclusive access to the vaccine while older residents of his district and throughout Florida have been struggling to get shots. Phone systems for scheduling appointments have crashed and older residents of some counties where the vaccine has been distributed on a first-come, first-served basis have been forced to camp out overnight to get inoculated.\n\nHardy said the situation is emblematic of how many wealthy people have gotten richer during the pandemic, while many poor and middle class Americans have lost jobs and sometimes even their homes. He said many of his constituents have contacted him to get access to the vaccine for themselves, a parent or grandparent, but there is nothing he can do.\n\nI am a constitutional officer of the state of Florida, but I can't pull any strings to help them — nor should I be able to, Hardy said. But these people can buy themselves a place at the front of the line.

ollinka via Getty Images Yes, these are still taxed.\n\nThanks to five men in the state Senate, women in Tennessee are likely going to have to keep paying higher taxes when they go to the store to buy tampons than they pay on their other groceries.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the state Senate Finance Ways and Means Revenue Subcommittee voted against a Democratic bill (SB 2285) to lower sales taxes on tampons, diapers and over-the-counter drugs from 7 percent to 5 percent, which is the amount charged on food.\n\nState Sens. Steve Dickerson (R), Ferrell Haile (R) and Thelma Harper (D) voted for the measure. Sens. Doug Overbey (R) and John Stevens (R) voted no, while Sens. Joey Hensley (R) and Bill Ketron (R) abstained. The four members who did not support it did not return requests for comment.\n\nThat same morning, the subcommittee also voted unanimously on SB 1610 to exempt gold and silver coins and bullion from sales taxes.\n\nIn other words, women have to pay taxes on necessary hygiene products, but people can buy all the gold bars they want tax-free.\n\nSimon Critchley/Getty Images State legislators want to make sure these are exempt from sales taxes.\n\nThe subcommittee vote doesn't necessarily mean that the tampon tax bill is dead. The legislators voted to give it a negative rating when it advances to the full committee, while SB 1610 received a positive rating. So in theory, the full 11-member committee could decide to buck the subcommittee members.\n\nHarper is the only woman on the subcommittee. She is also the only woman on the full committee. From a screenshot of the Senate Finance, Ways and Means website:\n\nTennessee General Assembly\n\nState Sen. Sara Kyle (D), one of the sponsors of SB 2285, said the state should not tax a woman for having a menstrual cycle, according to The Tennessean. She ultimately would like to see the tax eliminated altogether.\n\nWe are shy to talk about periods, but they are a fact of life for 1 in 2 people, and feminine hygiene products are required for human dignity, added state Rep. Sherry Jones (D), the other sponsor of the bill. We shouldn't tax a woman to have her dignity, especially considering the gender wage gap. With this bill, we at least recognize the necessity with a lower rate equal to the sales tax on food.\n\nThe vast majority of states require people to pay sales tax on feminine hygiene products -- even though they often allow exemptions for necessities -- and there is a movement nationwide to change some of the laws.\n\nPresident Barack Obama recently weighed in on the issue, saying that while he didn't know exactly why tampons were so often taxed as luxury items, he had a hunch.\n\nI suspect, he said, it's because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed.\n\n\n\nWant more updates from Amanda?

President-elect Joe Biden named Merrick Garland as his nominee for attorney general, the transition team said Thursday. If confirmed, Garland will take over a demoralized Justice Department that has abandoned bedrock principles and priorities, and come under withering attack from President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nGarland, a former federal prosector who lead the investigation into the Oklahoma City bomber, was nominated to the Supreme Court by former President Barack Obama following Antonin Scalia's 2016 death. The Republican-controlled Senate refused to hold a hearing on his nomination for months, citing the presidential election. His pending nomination died in early 2017, after 293 days.\n\nThe transition team announced other Justice Department nominees: Lisa Monaco for deputy attorney general, Vanita Gupta for associate attorney general and Kristen Clarke for assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. They said the nominees will be introduced at an event Thursday afternoon.\n\nGarland will take over a Justice Department that Trump sought to weaponize against his political opponents and use as his personal law firm. Trump has fired or pushed out a number of key department officials, most famously former FBI Director James Comey. Trump appointees have used the Justice Department's power in an overtly political fashion, even if they've resisted Trump's desire to wield the department's prosecutorial power as a blunt political weapon.\n\nThe nominee will face the challenge of determining how the Justice Department will approach potential criminal investigations into Trump and members of his administration. They will also face the prospect of rebuilding components like the Civil Rights Division, which abandoned key issues like police reform and focused on controversial religious liberty cases and attacks on college affirmative action programs. They'll also have to deal with the long-term consequences of Trump's attacks on the FBI, which has gutted Republicans' confidence in the nation's premier law enforcement organization. Biden's nominee may also have to figure out how to combat a rise in right-wing domestic terrorism cases, some of which have been directly inspired by the outgoing president's rhetoric against his political enemies and Muslims.\n\nIn addition, Biden's nominee will have to deal with the delicate question of how to handle the ongoing tax investigation into the new president's son, Hunter Biden, which is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware. The nominee will have to reassure the American public that there won't be political interference in the probe, perhaps by walling off the investigation. Republicans, the vast majority of whom were unconcerned with Trump's repeated attempts to improperly interfere in Justice Department matters, might even call for a special counsel to assure the probe's independence.\n\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder, who had to rebuild the Justice Department after controversies during the George W. Bush administration, told HuffPost that Biden understands that he needs to give the attorney general the space that he or she needs to restore integrity and the independence of the Justice Department.\n\nThe department has been taken off a road that I think it's basically been on since the Nixon administration, where there's been that separation of the Justice Department from the White House, Holder told HuffPost ahead of the election. You really need to look at the department as a whole. The people there, both in the field and at Main Justice, their motives have been called into question, their patriotism has been called into question, and all of that has to be dealt with. The department has got to be restored to what it was and what it must always be and clearly not what it is now.\n\nAttorney General William Barr, who replaced former Attorney General Jeff Sessions after he was forced out following the 2018 midterm elections, went to bat for Trump during Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, releasing a misleading summary of the Mueller report which controlled public opinion about the report's findings about Trump's actions for weeks. Barr, who holds strong views of executive power, was also accused of covering up Trump's actions in the Ukraine scandal that led to the president's impeachment by attempting to hide from Congress a whistleblower complaint about Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president. Barr announced he would leave the Justice Department on Dec. 23.\n\nMany career Justice Department employees who held on for four years of the Trump administration were likely to depart had Trump been reelected and able to mold the department into an even more overtly political organization.\n\nBiden, according to The New York Times, plans to keep FBI Director Chris Wray unless he's fired by Trump before the president leaves office. Wray, a Republican who once said he'd quit before breaking the law for the president, has upset Trump with his descriptions of the loosely organized anti-fascist movement known as antifa, his description of the limited impact of voter fraud, his discussion of Russian election interference, and his refusal to provide Trump's campaign with a last-minute boost by violating DOJ standards and publicly announcing some sort of politically advantageous investigation. Wray has defended the bureau from Trump's attacks, but he's been quiet post-election as Trump has made broad, sweeping claims about mass voter fraud, which law enforcement officials say could inspire attacks by right-wing extremists convinced that the election was illegitimate.\n\nAnother major question facing Biden and his attorney general is the fate of the nation's 94 U.S. attorneys across the country, most of whom are Trump appointees. Those officials, who serve as the nation's top federal prosecutors in federal districts, have sometimes been allowed to stick around until their replacements are confirmed. Trump's decision to ask the presidentially appointed holdover U.S. attorneys to resign set off some controversy in March 2017, not long before Comey's firing.\n\nUntil the Trump administration, modern attorney general nominees had typically received strong bipartisan support. Even Sessions voted for Holder back in 2009, when Holder was confirmed 75-21.\n\nHolder told HuffPost that Biden's attorney general pick has to come prepared with a targeted approach to handle the most egregious misconduct to come out of the Trump administration and hold people accountable but not get bogged down in a way that could derail the entire administration.\n\nThere's such a wealth of inappropriate conduct coming from the Trump administration that I think that they're actually going to have to prioritize what they'll look at, Holder said. If you looked at all the negative things, all the inappropriate things, you would spend an inordinate amount of time focusing on the inappropriate conduct by Cabinet members, White House officials, the president himself, and that could inhibit the ability of the new administration to focus on what the American people want them to focus on. But, Holder added, You can't simply let it go. People need to be held accountable.\n\nLiza Hearon contributed to this article.

On a recent flight from Boston to Atlanta, the woman sitting next to me introduced herself and asked me what I do for a living. I told her I work for a company that helps universities internationalize, and helps international students succeed at those universities.\n\nWhy on earth would you want to do that? she asked. Those international kids are taking seats away from American students.\n\nI explained to her that across America, college enrollment rates have been gradually declining after peaking in 2011. Last year alone, enrollment dropped 1.4 percent. This, coupled with a continued decline in state expenditures, has resulted in many colleges and universities scrambling to fill seats. International students not only provide a positive cultural impact, but provide a compelling economic benefit to the campuses and communities in which they reside.\n\nI was able to change my seatmate's mind, but overall there remains a lack of knowledge on the broader impact these international students provide. Like any industry facing rising costs and falling income, colleges and universities have been looking for ways to grow revenue. In 2012, I co-authored a paper with Jeff Denneen called The Sustainable University. In it, we argued that in order to address the unsustainable financial models that many colleges and universities face, we need to focus on new programs and innovations that unlock real value.\n\nIn the five short years since then, the risks we wrote about – rising tuition costs, decreased public funding and the financial shortfalls – have all worsened. But we have also seen that strategic and thoughtfully implemented programs that appeal to international students not only improve the educational experience of domestic students, but also provide much needed revenue for universities.\n\nRecent research supports this thesis. For example, a working paper published last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research reports that increases in the enrollment of foreign students generate substantial gains in university tuition revenues, which partially offset the loss in appropriations [from state funding cuts]. The report concludes that in the absence of the pool of foreign students, many universities would have faced larger cuts to expenditures and potentially greater increases in in-state tuition charges.\n\nThe economic impact on the national level is significant as well. Across the U.S., the more than 1 million international students who studied in the U.S. last year generated over $35 billion for the U.S. economy. This represents a direct inflow of foreign capital to support U.S. universities and state and local economies. Looking at job creation, the numbers are equally compelling – international students were found to support over 400,000 jobs nationally. This equates to three U.S. jobs created or supported for every seven enrolled international students.\n\nEven more encouraging, the financial benefits of enrolling international students extend beyond the campus itself. A research study just released by the Brookings Institution analyzed 16 regions and concluded that in areas that would otherwise likely face economic hardship as a result of industrial job loss, colleges and universities act as an antidote, anchoring tax revenue, a wide variety of jobs, and often supporting industries that benefit from an educated and young workforce.\n\nWhen skeptics like my seatmate hear these facts, support for international study programs rises dramatically. At a time of great concern over the fiscal health of our colleges and universities, examples of win-win solutions are hard to come by. And this economic story goes hand-in-hand with the powerful societal benefits of international education programs. American students benefit from attending schools with a greater diversity of ideas and perspectives from their international peers, while international students return to their home countries with a world class education and a better understanding of America and our values.\n\nThe economic and cultural benefits of international education are overwhelming and only getting better. For the future of our education system and our economy, this is one secret that needs to get out.\n\nTom Dretler is Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Shorelight Education.
Sean Kilpatrick/CP Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer stands during question period on Parliament Hill on Feb. 28, 2018.\n\nFederal Conservatives wasted no time blaming Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for Kinder Morgan's decision to suspend work on its Trans Mountain pipeline, even as the company lauds federal support for the project.\n\nTory Leader Andrew Scheer released a statement Sunday targeting Liberals — and not the British Columbia NDP government of John Horgan — for what he called devastating news for the energy sector.\n\nThe blame for this development rests squarely on the shoulders of Justin Trudeau. He has failed to take a single concrete step to ensure this project is completed. All he has done is give us empty words with no action, Scheer said.\n\nThe Tory leader argued Trudeau did not champion the Trans Mountain pipeline and suggested the federal plan to phase in a price on carbon pollution only makes such projects harder. Scheer noted that Trudeau said the oilsands need to be phased out, remarks for which the prime minister said he misspoke last year.\n\nScheer also criticized Trudeau for refusing to greenlight the Northern Gateway pipeline and said the prime minister killed the Energy East pipeline with last minute rule changes and regulations.\n\nTories similarly hammered Trudeau after TransCanada cancelled the Energy East project last year, in part because the federal government wanted regulators to consider the potential greenhouse gas emissions of producing and processing the oil that the pipeline would carry.\n\nConsidering the Prime Minister's track record of failure, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Kinder Morgan is now suspending work on the Trans Mountain Expansion project, he said.\n\nCanadians deserve a government that will actually get the job done.\n\nKinder Morgan appreciates 'support shown by the federal government'\n\nYet when Kinder Morgan announced the decision to halt non-essential activities on the project Sunday, the company cited B.C.'s continued active opposition and legal challenges to the project.\n\nWe appreciate the support shown by the Federal Government and the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and are grateful for the strong endorsements among the majority of communities along the route and 43 Indigenous communities, as well as customers, contractors and unions, Kinder Morgan Canada's CEO Steve Kean said in a release.\n\nThe fact remains that a substantial portion of the Project must be constructed through British Columbia, and since the change in government in June 2017, that government has been clear and public in its intention to use 'every tool in the toolbox' to stop the Project.\n\nThe uncertainty created by BC has not been resolved but instead has escalated into an inter-governmental dispute.\n\nHuffPost Canada reached out to Trudeau's office to respond to Scheer's claim.\n\nThe Liberal government approved the project, which would triple the amount of oil flowing from Alberta to Burnaby, B.C., in 2016. The prime minister has repeatedly said the pipeline will be built but has faced calls from Tory MPs to be more vocal in advocating for the project.\n\nLast week, hundreds of anti-pipeline protesters demonstrated outside a Trudeau fundraising event in Vancouver. A young Indigenous leader interrupted the prime minister's speech to accuse Trudeau of lying to his people.\n\nA day later in Fort McMurray, Alta., Trudeau promoted his government's efforts to get pipelines built and reiterated that the Kinder Morgan project would go forward.\n\nMoving our resources to greater markets is a greater priority, not just for Albertans, but for Canadians, and we are going to do that in a responsible way, he said.\n\nTrudeau is facing pressure from Alberta Premier Rachel Notley to take concrete action to resolve the dispute.\n\nA federal approval of a project must be worth more than the paper it's written on,'' Notley said Sunday.\n\nJason Kenney, the former Tory minister who now leads Alberta's United Conservative Party, is calling on the feds to withhold transfer payments to B.C.\n\nIf Justin Trudeau is going to punish Saskatchewan by withholding transfers b/c it doesn't want to punish its citizens with a carbon tax, then why isn't the fed govt also withholding transfer payments to BC to demonstrate that Ottawa means business? #ableg#UCP#cdnpoli#CPC — Jason Kenney (@jkenney) April 9, 2018\n\nAfter Kinder Morgan announced its decision Sunday, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr released a statement calling on the B.C. government to end all threats to delay the Trans Mountain expansion.\n\nAt a press conference on Parliament Hill, Carr said it was no time for any province to be reckless with the financial well-being of Canadians and for the fabric of the federation itself.\n\nYet when asked what steps the federal government could take to break the impasse, Carr merely said all options are on the table.
A private buyer in the U.S. has purchased a historical letter in which Indian independence leader Mohandas K. Gandhi muses about his personal relationship with Jesus and Christianity.\n\nThe typed document, which contains Gandhi's handwritten signature, sold to a buyer in the Northeast for $50,000 on Friday, according to Nathan Raab, president of the historical document dealer Raab Collection in Ardmore, Pa. The company told HuffPost it does not disclose the identity of its buyers or sellers.\n\nIn 1926, an American Christian religious elder, Milton Newberry Frantz, wrote to Gandhi, inviting the Hindu leader to read an article Frantz had written about Christianity. On April 6 of that year, Gandhi wrote back to Frantz from an ashram in Gujarat.\n\nGandhi wrote that he felt Jesus was one of the great teachers of mankind. However, he couldn't subscribe to the Christian belief that Jesus was more than that.\n\nNathan Raab / Raab Collection The letter from Mohandas K. Gandhi to Milton Newberry Frantz, dated April 6, 1926.\n\nGandhi tells Frantz:\n\nDear Friend, I have your letter. I am afraid it is not possible for me to subscribe to the creed you have sent me. The subscriber is made to believe that the highest manifestation of the unseen reality was Jesus Christ. In spite of all my efforts, I have not been able to feel the truth of that statement. I have not been able to move beyond the belief that Jesus was one of the great teachers of mankind.\n\nGandhi goes on to state that it's important to respect all people's faith traditions, since all religions are based on a common thread of love and mutual esteem.\n\nHe writes:\n\nDo you not think that religious unity is to be had not by a mechanical subscription to a common creed but by all respecting the creed of each? In my opinion, difference in creed there must be so long as there are different brains. But who does it matter if all these are hung upon the common thread of love and mutual esteem?\n\nGandhi grew up in a Hindu family that was primarily devoted to the worship of the god Vishnu. He was also introduced at a young age to Jainism, a religion that emphasizes nonviolence.\n\nFor much of his adult life, Gandhi earnestly studied the religions of the world. He read the Quran, Jesus's Sermon on the Mount and the writings of Leo Tolstoy on Christianity. He was deeply influenced by the Bhagavad Gita, one of the core religious texts in Hinduism, and remained a committed Hindu for the rest of his life.\n\nBy the time he wrote the letter to Frantz, Gandhi had already emerged as a leading figure in India's movement for independence from British rule. He had inspired thousands of followers to boycott British institutions and encouraged many to replace imported British goods with items produced in India.\n\nBettmann via Getty Images Mahatma Gandhi marches to a coastal village in 1930 to collect salt, in violation of British law in India.\n\nAfter being arrested and jailed for sedition in 1922, Gandhi retreated from political prominence for a few years. The letter to Frantz was written during this time.\n\nGandhi reemerged as a political leader by late 1928 and in 1930 launched the Salt March, a massive nonviolent protest against the British salt tax.\n\nWhen India achieved independence in 1947, Gandhi strongly opposed the country's partition into India and Pakistan, and he urged Hindus and Muslims to live together peacefully. He was killed on Jan. 30, 1948, by a Hindu fanatic who was angry about Gandhi's efforts to negotiate with Muslims.
In November 2013, I found out that a handful of my New York condo neighbors were renting out their units through Airbnb. This was unacceptable and I wrote an article in a major New York newspaper that helped fan a movement.\n\nWe made presentations to city council and the legislature and, three years later, the State of New York has essentially banned short-term rentals by Airbnb or others.\n\nI've also kept Airbnb out of my Toronto building and have written about the so-called sharing economy (which includes Uber) and the public concerns they raise.\n\nMany others ― San Francisco, Berlin, Barcelona, to name a few ― have followed New York by restricting or banning both Airbnb and often Uber too.\n\nThe central issue is not economic. It's that these platforms enable users to get lower cost services by bypassing laws, zoning, regulatory, insurance, taxation and safety requirements. Such restrictions are there for good reason, notably those involving safety.\n\nIn Canada, the conversation about this business model is just beginning. This week, the Institute for Hospital and Tourism Research at Ryerson U's Ted Rogers School of Management held a symposium about Airbnb. Its figures show that 1,121 units and 1,305 units each night are booked in Vancouver and Toronto respectively, according to Assistant Professor Chris Gibbs.\n\nThe potential is enormous. In Toronto, some 28% of dwellings are condos, up from 5% a few years ago.\n\nThe discussion involved pro and con but everyone agreed that all levels of government and condo boards plus landlords must address the issues. This doesn't mean a ban necessarily, but better financial and legal arrangements can be forged as is the case in some cities.\n\nMost importantly, however, both companies as constituted represent public safety threats. Strangers in buildings are a hazard because of access to residents, children, corridors, stairwells, gyms, pools, playgrounds, garages, storage areas, and lounges.\n\nSome unscrupulous owners have rented space out short-term to prostitutes, for orgies and noisy parties. In Toronto, about three years ago, a meth lab blew up in a condo building in Liberty Village due to the activities of someone who shared an apartment. Other egregious examples of damages or bad behavior have occurred.\n\nBut Airbnb doesn't protect guests either by not vetting hosts. Recently, Las Vegas police arrested a host for filming with hidden cameras the bedrooms of his Airbnb rental for purposes unknown, possibly blackmail or pornography. Guests also have no knowledge as to who else has keys to their space.\n\nThen there's Uber. In Toronto, it poses a safety risk because drivers are not thoroughly vetted nor are their cars routinely subjected to safety checks. It is nothing more than digitized hitchhiking and in Toronto recently one of its drivers was charged with sexually assaulting a passenger. There have been multiple incidents around the world, including assaults and rapes.\n\nAnother concern is tax evasion.\n\nThe Canadian Revenue Agency should force Airbnb, Uber and others to issue T4 income slips to all Airbnb hosts or Uber drivers so they pay taxes on their income. These T4s should also be sent to landlords or condo boards so they know what's going on as well as with other levels of government.\n\nOther obligations are dodged. Airbnb hosts commercialize their units and, as such, should pay higher mortgage rates, condo fees, and property taxes. (In New York, longer-term tenants must be approved and are assessed at least 25% more in condo fees for wear and tear to the building caused by their rentals. Insurance and mortgages are more expensive for rental units too.)\n\nAnother issue is that about 52% of the Airbnb rentals in Toronto are hosts who are doing this for multiple units, said Ryerson's Professor Gibbs.\n\nThis points out that they are simply running illegal hotels and, as a result, San Francisco and other cities have demanded that Airbnb impose a one home, one host rule.\n\nThen there are the rights of other owners or neighbors in multiple unit dwellings where short-term rentals occur. Condo boards that allow or don't deal with short-term stays endanger or inconvenience other residents due to noise, pet, smoking or other violations.\n\nThen there are squatters' rights. In one New York case, one guest refused to leave the apartment on the basis he was disabled. Eviction was almost impossible. The same could happen in Canada.\n\nOntario is reviewing its Condominium Act and should insist that condo boards have tools to deal with this problem. A board should be forced to have a policy on short-term rents, stipulate conditions, and levy higher fees, but only if 80% of owners approve. Conversely, they should be allowed to ban Airbnb and their competitors and enforce that.\n\nAs for Uber, cities should require drivers to meet identical taxation, licensing, insurance, maintenance and training requirements as must traditional taxi and limo drivers.\n\nPeople have a right to rent out their residence (apartment), but not to afflict their neighbors, the public, or to bypass laws. People have a right to hire someone to drive them around, but not if those people are untrained, untaxed and uninspected and can harm the public.\n\nGovernments must catch up to these proliferating websites to stop abuses.\n\nFirst published National Post March 11, 2017
Charlie Riedel/The Associated Press States across the country are attempting to raise the minimum age to buy a handgun. Gun control advocates are looking to capitalize on the momentum after the Parkland school shooting last year.\n\nBy Matt Vasilogambros\n\nAfter a significant year for the gun control movement in 2018, momentum for stricter firearms laws in states across the country likely will accelerate this year.\n\nIn states where Democrats made big gains in the November elections, lawmakers are quickly moving legislation to raise the buying age for guns and to ban assault-style weapons. Other measures, including bills to limit gun access for domestic abusers and people who may harm themselves or others, have increasing bipartisan support.\n\nThe national conversation about guns is changing, said Robert Spitzer, a professor of political science at the State University of New York College at Cortland and the author of five books on gun control.\n\nThere's been a flood of new legislation, he said. With more state legislatures in Democratic hands, with the sense you can enforce new gun laws and it not be a stigma, there's not only momentum but concrete evidence that those who want to see stronger gun laws are making headway.\n\nAlready this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states have introduced at least 50 major gun control bills, including measures to expand background checks and ban lethal accessories like bump stocks, according to a count by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun control organization co-founded by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the Arizona Democrat who survived a 2011 shooting.\n\nTo be sure, Republicans who still control most state legislatures likely will pass gun rights legislation. At least 26 state bills would significantly expand gun access, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nNorth Dakota, for example, is moving a bill to boost school security using armed guards, and several other states are following suit.\n\nThe Parkland impact\n\nStudent survivors of the February 2018 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead helped galvanize a national movement for stricter gun laws. In 2018, 27 state legislatures passed 67 new laws aimed at restricting access to guns.\n\nIn the six years prior, states had enacted nearly 600 gun laws, and nearly two-thirds of those were backed by the National Rifle Association, according to data compiled by Stateline.\n\nThat shift played out in the November midterms, when federal and statewide candidates promising gun control won in red and blue states. Lawmakers will carry that momentum into the new legislative session.\n\nGun industry officials, who generally oppose efforts to restrict firearm access, recognize the changing political landscape. Larry Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an advocacy group representing the firearms and ammunition industry, said the next year of gun-related legislation will be a mixed bag.\n\nIt comes as a surprise to no one that Democrat-controlled statehouses are less advantageous to the firearms industry, he said. We'll see more restrictive gun laws, but we might see improvement to right-to-carry laws in other states in the country.\n\nKeane later added, People have been writing about the demise of the Second Amendment for a long time. Politics ebbs and flows.\n\nNew gun control targets\n\nNew York hadn't passed a comprehensive gun control package since the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in neighboring Connecticut. The legislature in 2013 passed a law that limited high-capacity magazines, implemented universal background checks and revoked the gun licenses and weapons of the severely mentally ill.\n\nDemocrats, after winning control of the state Senate in November, immediately started work to approve more bills.\n\nThe legislature in January passed six measures that ban bump stocks, extend waiting periods for gun purchases, prevent teachers from carrying guns in schools and allow law enforcement to remove guns from people judged to pose a danger to themselves or others. The bills passed largely along party lines and were signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.\n\nIn California, newly elected Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters he would support limiting the number of guns Californians can purchase in a month, among other gun control proposals.\n\nAs one of his first acts as Illinois' newly elected governor, Democrat J.B. Pritzker signed legislation Jan. 17 that further regulates gun stores throughout the state by requiring certifications.\n\nDuring the signing ceremony, Pritzker said he wanted to tackle more gun control legislation, including a ban on bump stocks and trigger cranks — devices that allow a semi-automatic weapon to fire automatically.\n\nWhile several states are moving forward with their bans, the Trump administration has made the possession of the devices illegal starting in late March.\n\nThe Illinois State Rifle Association is preparing a lawsuit against the state over the new store regulation law. Richard Pearson, the group's executive director, said with Democrats in charge of the legislature and the governorship, it's difficult for gun rights groups to block regulation efforts.\n\nThe legislature went very anti-gun, and the governor is very anti-gun, he said. It's going to be a tough fight, there's no question about it.\n\nLast year showed that Democrats could run on gun control and win despite opposition from the National Rifle Association, said Nico Bocour, the state legislative director at the Giffords Law Center.\n\nAt the national level, Giffords' political action committee endorsed 95 winning U.S. House candidates, some of them in deep red states such as Kansas and Georgia. Gun control groups outspent the NRA by nearly $2 million in congressional elections, according to records compiled by Open Secrets.\n\nThe NRA did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDemocrats now have a majority in the U.S. House, and they are looking to pass universal background checks in the coming months. But such restrictions are highly unlikely to pass in the upper chamber, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.\n\nThe Senate also blocked President Barack Obama's gun control package in 2013, following the Sandy Hook shooting. Significant legislative action on gun control remains in the states.\n\nNow, state lawmakers are introducing gun control legislation even in states that have not taken up such measures in the past, Bocour said: 2019 is looking like it will be as successful, if not more successful than 2018.\n\nWe will be working with lawmakers in more states and more legislation than we have ever done before, she said. We're certainly seeing an increase in interest.\n\nBipartisan groups of lawmakers in Arizona, Kentucky, Oregon and Texas are seeking to pass measures to ban people convicted of domestic abuse from purchasing and possessing firearms. Just last year, 12 states passed similar laws.\n\nLawmakers in Nevada are considering bans on bump stocks, attempting to join the eight states that passed similar measures last year. States such as Maryland, New Mexico and Pennsylvania are considering strengthening background checks.\n\nAnd efforts to ban untraceable ghost guns, like those that are 3D-printed, are moving forward in Delaware, Maryland and Oregon.\n\nPushing 'Red flag' laws\n\nState efforts to pass red flag laws this year are especially likely to succeed, Bocour said. Such measures allow family, household members, or local law enforcement officials to petition for a court order allowing police to seize weapons from people who they think might harm themselves or others.\n\nLast year, eight states enacted such laws. Five of those were signed by Republican governors. Now, lawmakers of both parties in nearly a dozen states, including Colorado, Maine, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Pennsylvania, are considering similar legislation.\n\nSince Maryland's red-flag law took effect Oct. 1, state law enforcement has received at least 360 requests to remove firearms from residents considered to pose a risk, said Montgomery County Sheriff Darren Popkin, who led state sheriffs in implementing the law through new trainings and rewriting of forms.\n\nFive of those requests involved potential school shootings, he said. Maryland judges approved around half of the requested seizures after evidentiary hearings, Popkin said.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind this is saving lives, he said. Gun-safety laws are really a priority for law enforcement when we know somebody has made a threat to themselves or a threat to someone else, and they have access to firearms.\n\nGun rights advocates, like Keane at the National Shooting Sports Foundation, say they may support red-flag laws, but have concerns about due process.\n\nWe think it's a good idea to give law enforcement more tools, Keane said. We have no problem with the concept of these laws, but we think they should be written carefully since this is a fundamental constitutional right.\n\nAmong critics of red-flag legislation is Arkansas state Sen. Trent Garner. The Republican said that in his state, such a bill has almost zero chance of getting out of committee and zero chance of passing into law.\n\nI have strong reservations against them, he said, explaining his concern about regulating guns generally. I don't think there's much support. Even the Democrats in Arkansas are conservative.\n\nGarner supports legislation that wouldn't require a permit to carry a concealed weapon and has authored a bill that would make the shotgun the official gun of Arkansas.\n\nWe have a state gem: the diamond, a state bird: the mockingbird — so I wanted to make the shotgun the state gun, he told Stateline in an interview. Arkansas, he said, is famous for its duck hunting.\n\nIn Virginia, the legislature's slim Republican majority quickly blocked an attempt by Democratic lawmakers last month to pass red-flag legislation, along with several other pieces of gun control legislation pushed by Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.\n\nOne Republican lawmaker, state Sen. Amanda Chase, stood on the floor of the chamber armed with a .38 special on her hip during recent a debate. Gun rights advocates in Virginia called the bill a slippery slope, possibly leading to future bills that would allow law enforcement to seize guns of people who aren't mentally ill.\n\nNRA flexes its power\n\nGun rights advocates have improved chances in some states this year. The NRA helped defeat moderate Democrats in the U.S. Senate, including Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. The Parkland students also faced a disappointing loss in their home state with the victory of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nConservative states are eager to loosen gun restrictions, said Spitzer of SUNY Cortland.\n\nIn late January, South Dakota became the latest state to allow its residents to carry handguns without a permit. Republican lawmakers in states such as Iowa, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia are considering similar measures.\n\nTo combat school shootings, states including Kentucky are weighing measures to arm teachers and increase the number of armed school guards.\n\nLast month, the North Dakota state Senate passed a bill that would allow school districts to fund safety measures, including armed guards, by collecting additional property taxes. The bill now heads to the state House.\n\nIn South Carolina, a proposal to add a 7 percent sales tax on guns to fund school resource officers was quickly dismissed by the state's Republican governor.\n\nGun rights activists also see hope in the U.S. Supreme Court, which will review a New York City law that prevents residents from carrying their guns outside their homes.\n\nThe court likely will strike down the law, Spitzer said, with the addition of conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe majority is going to use it as an opportunity to expand gun rights, Spitzer said, and use it as a legal basis to strike down more gun laws in the future.\n\nIn Connecticut, the gun industry advocacy group National Shooting Sports Foundation's Mark Oliva, a public affairs manager, said he was encouraged by the court's decision to take up the case. It was its first major Second Amendment case since the court upheld the right to possess firearms, striking down a strict Washington, D.C., gun law in 2008, Oliva said.\n\nThey've been treating the Second Amendment like a second-class right for too long.
The rise in inequality is widening at an alarming rate. Top 1 percent controlling 95 percent of the overall wealth is causing the rest of Americans to head to the poor house. America's financial elite has put a stranglehold on American citizens to the point of determining the quality of their life (or lack of it). They are effectively controlling the country's economic and political agenda through their powerful lobbies and monetary contributions to politicians and decision makers of their choice.\n\nMillions of workers struggling to make a living by working on minimum wages are turning the country into something akin to a modern day slavery. There are 62% of citizens that have less than $1,000 in savings and are one paycheck away from the street; the American dream has come to an end; the progression of inequality is rapidly eroding America's middle-class into impoverished masses. It may not be long before the rise of discontent will give rise to social unrest potentially causing destabilization of the very foundation upon which the American society was conceived and built. A recent Gallup survey showing 47% of Americans would vote for a President who was a socialist. This should be seen as a wake up call.\n\nA noted economist, Joseph E. Stiglitz, wrote recently: America is becoming a more divided society - divided not only between whites and African Americans, but also between the 1% and the rest, and between the highly educated and the less educated, regardless of race.\n\nIt's high time to realize what may lie ahead. People with decision making power should realize, that necessary economic reforms must be implemented as soon as possible. Mitigating citizens' economic inequality should be top of the list.\n\nHere are five suggestions to mitigate the challenges:\n\nEnd Federal Reserve Monopoly\n\nAfter 7 years of post-recession slow growth, numerous quantitative easing (QE) stimuli, and a doubling of U.S. federal debt, the economy is barely limping on at a stall speed. According to industry experts such as Lacy Hunt, since the introduction of unconventional and untested monetary policy operations like QE, an impressive amount of empirical evidence has emerged that casts considerable doubt on their efficacy. Ex-voting member of the Federal Reserve, Richard Fisher went even further. He told a rare bit of truth-ness in a CNBC interview last year; What the Fed did, and I was part of it, was front-loaded an enormous market rally in order to create a wealth effect...and an uncomfortable digestion period is likely now. The wealth effect did not benefit an average American. In fact, America's middle-class lost nearly 30% of its wealth.\n\nEver since its inception, privately controlled Fed's monetary policies have been benefiting mostly the rich elite enabling them to widen the gap of inequality to historical levels. The Fed's time has passed. By admitting their own mistakes, it is becoming clear that the present day economy is dictating the Feds' policies and not the other way around. The Fed should be abolished and the monetary policies of America put into hands of elected politicians who must find a way to lessen inequality amongst its citizens.\n\nIncome and Assets Taxation of Rich Americans\n\nIntroducing steep taxes on short-term stock market trading and/or outright prohibition on high frequency trading would be a good start, but a serious way to combat inequality is progressive taxation of the super-rich income and their assets, both at home and abroad. Two or three percent increase would bring hundreds of billions of dollars into the public purse, the money that could be used to rebuild or improve municipal infrastructures, create quality jobs, help young Americans get an affordable education, and lower the national debt.\n\nRestrict Overseas Inversions\n\n\n\nTax avoidance by some of the richest and biggest corporations, which are using various loopholes to move their headquarters to various off-shore locations in order not to pay taxes, should be banned and declared illegal. Over the last decades, billions of dollars supposed to be paid on account of taxes, were successfully moved out of the country and pocketed by directors of such corporations. The theory that such untaxed money is used to start new enterprises and create jobs for Americans proved to be totally flawed. Rich are not starting new businesses that create more jobs. Instead, by-and-large, they end up hoarding their tax-avoided funds in their offshore accounts ... or ... buying out small start-ups to stifle the entrepreneurship that might compete with their hegemony. Morally and justly speaking, this money is tax payers' money that should be returned to the public purse for the benefit of the country.\n\nBring Jobs Back to America\n\nAmericans should no longer support overseas economies such as China and others by buying their products that can be made just as inexpensive and more efficient in America. For example, the advent of 3D copier and other robotic technology should be used to entice millions of unemployed Americans to start their own businesses by producing goods now imported from overseas. Days of mega-size ships, loaded with containers up to their chimneys, pulling into American ports should come to an end.\n\nTax Offshore Buyers of Residential Real Estate\n\nJudging by the extraordinary appreciating values of some urban centers such as San Francisco, LA, San Diego, Denver, Miami and Atlanta, foreign nationals that are able to (in many cases illegally) smuggle monies out of their own countries, mostly from China, Russia, Malaysia and others, are now out-bidding Americans with ease, driving real estate prices to higher levels than the pre-crash prices of 2007. If America does not curtail the foreign buying of American residential real estate, which has tripled since 2005, there may not be another cyclical correction to provide Americans with a chance of purchasing their homes. Charging any non-American citizen duty stamp on the purchase of residential property, is the only way to put a damper to rich foreigners snatching homes away from Americans.
This year, Americans will be asked to participate in the 2020 census, a process that occurs every 10 years. While you should expect to be contacted by the U.S. Census Bureau in the coming weeks (and maybe you already have), it's also a time to watch out for scammers pretending to represent the census.\n\nThe Census Bureau will be contacting Americans in a variety of ways, including phone calls, letters and even Census Bureau workers who will come to your home, said Steven Weisman, a lawyer, professor, author and expert in identity theft and cybersecurity. And as a part of the census, you will be asked for certain types of personal information.\n\nThat makes the census a perfect vehicle for identity thieves to pose as census workers in an effort to lure you into providing personal information that will be used to make you a victim of identity theft, said Weisman.\n\nIn a recent example, 92-year-old Dallas resident Robert Cooper received an authentic-looking census package in the mail in December. The form asked for personal details, such as age, education and who else lived with him. It also asked for his and his wife's Medicare numbers, the Dallas Morning News reported.\n\nBelieving he was responding to official census mail, Cooper provided those numbers and mailed back the form. Unfortunately, he fell victim to a scam.\n\nSince it is mandatory for all households to participate in the census and since the census collects very detailed and sensitive personal information, it makes for quite an attractive target for scammers to take advantage of, said Attila Tomaschek, a data privacy expert with ProPrivacy.com. The good news, he said, is that if you know what to look out for, you can significantly reduce your chances of becoming a victim and having your sensitive information or identity stolen.\n\n1. Census Mail Scams\n\nBecause the Census Bureau's first contact is usually through the mail, scammers will try and beat them to the punch and send out faux census documents to unsuspecting recipients.\n\nYou may receive false census documents meant to coax personal information from you, as Cooper did. Similarly, you could receive forms that are designed to look like official census mail, but are intended to confuse you and lead to inaccurate census counts. For example, Republicans were caught last month sending out mailers titled 2020 Congressional District Census, in envelopes labeled Do not destroy, official document, which mirrored the look of the official census form. However, these forms were not related to the census at all.\n\nAnd though there's plenty of paper-based fraud going on, criminals are also taking mail scams high-tech.\n\nOne trick for collecting personal information through the mail is sending postcards with a QR code and asking recipients to scan the code with their smartphones in order to access the census survey on a webpage, according to Rachel Willson, investigative coordinator in client relations for The Smith Investigation Agency. When the code is scanned, it loads malware onto the recipient's device.\n\nOne easy way to tell if your census mail is a scam? The return address is for a city other than Jeffersonville, Indiana, where all official census forms are mailed, according to Census.gov.\n\n2. Door-To-Door Census Scams\n\nIf you don't fill out a form or self-report your census information by web, phone or mail, a census taker will come to your door to interview you some time in the next couple of months. If you aren't around, they'll come back a few times, or they may resort to asking neighbors for information about your household. This is all perfectly normal and legal.\n\nHowever, you should be wary of answering the door for anyone you don't know. That person could be a scammer posing as an official census taker.\n\nIf someone knocks on your door claiming to be a census taker, ask them to present their official Census Bureau-issued photo ID to ensure they are legitimate, Tomaschek said. That ID will include a Department of Commerce watermark and expiration date.\n\nYou can then verify the agent's name in the Census Bureau's staff directory online, Tomaschek said. If the person at your door can't produce a valid ID or isn't listed in the directory, they are likely a scammer and should be turned away and reported.\n\nThe Census Bureau urges people with suspicions to call 844-330-2020, and to contact local police if they learn a home visitor doesn't work for the census.\n\n3. Census Phone Scams\n\nAnother way scammers may try to extract personal information from you is by calling and asking you to report your household information over the phone (as well as sensitive data that the actual census would never ask for).\n\nOne of the ways scammers trick you into thinking you're talking with an official representative of the U.S. Census Bureau is through call spoofing. This involves manipulating Caller ID so that your phone displays the call as coming from the census, when it's really a robocaller or other kind of scammer.\n\nThe Census Bureau does sometimes initiate phone calls to people in order to collect census data, but you can always independently verify that you're talking to a real census rep. You can call the Census Bureau's National Processing Center to confirm the identity of the census agent. If the caller cannot be identified, do not under any circumstances provide the caller with any information Tomaschek said.\n\n4. Online Census Scams\n\nWhen it comes to scams, the web is the Wild West. There are a multitude of ways criminals can trick you into sharing personal information ― even when you think you are not.\n\nPhishing emails, for example, have long been a tool used by scammers to collect personal information or install malware on the user's device. The census is no exception; a popular phishing tactic for census scammers is sending an email requesting that you take a survey. However, the Census Bureau will never contact you via email to complete a survey.\n\nIf you do receive an unsolicited email purporting to be from the Census Bureau and requesting you to complete a survey, you can bet that you're dealing with a scam artist, Tomaschek said. The best thing to do in such a case is to delete the email.\n\nBy no means should you click on any links or download any attachments in the email. The links will undoubtedly lead to a phishing site designed to harvest your personal information and any attachments will likely contain malware, Tomaschek said.\n\nSocial media is another place online where census scams can pop up. Earlier this month, for instance, Donald Trump's reelection campaign ran a series of Facebook ads directing users to fill out the Official 2020 Congressional District Census. Those ads did not link to the official census form, however, and instead sent users to a Trump campaign website. People were prompted to submit personal information and donate to the campaign.\n\nIf you are directed to the Census Bureau website from an email, social media post or another website, always check the web address to verify that you are indeed on https://www.census.gov/. There should also be a padlock icon in the address bar, which indicates that the site is secure.\n\nIf the web address doesn't end in '.gov' and if the address doesn't start with 'https' or the padlock icon doesn't appear in the address bar, regardless of how official it may appear to be, you're likely dealing with a census scam website designed to harvest your data and steal your information, Tomaschek said. If you end up on a site like this, leave immediately.\n\n5. Census Job Scams\n\nFinally, if you're job hunting, keep an eye out for scams related to census jobs. Scammers are posting job applications for people interested in temporary positions with the Census Bureau.\n\nAs with so many scams, this scam exploits a kernel of truth, which is that the Census Bureau is looking for people to fill thousands of temporary positions, Weisman said. However, the scammers are using this as an opportunity to make you a victim of identity theft or steal your money.\n\nIn one version of these scams, you might be asked to pay an application fee in order to apply for a job. The truth is that no federal agency, including the Census Bureau, charges an application fee, Weisman said.\n\nOther census job scams ask you for your bank account information in order to set up a direct deposit for your wages, only to use that information to steal directly from your bank account. Or you may be asked for your Social Security number for purposes of tax withholding. Although legitimate employers need this information, it's not required until well into the hiring process, after you've spoken with other employees in person.\n\nIn order to make sure that you are actually applying for a real job with the Census Bureau, you should go exclusively to the Census Bureau's official website and job application page, Weisman said.\n\nSpotting A Scam: What The Census Bureau Will And Won't Do\n\nIt's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the census process so you understand how and when you'll be contacted. Knowing the means by which the Census Bureau does and does not collect information is ultimately the key to being able to spot ― and evade ― a potential census scam, Tomaschek said.\n\nRegardless of how you're contacted by the Census Bureau, however, there are a few pieces of information the census will never ask for.\n\nFirst, the Census Bureau will never ask you to provide financial details such as your credit card numbers, Social Security number, bank account numbers, banking passwords or your mother's maiden name.\n\nThough participating in the census is important and technically mandatory, you can't be fined or jailed for not completing your census survey. If someone claiming to be a census agent requests such information from you and/or threatens you with fines or jail time for not complying, you will know that you are dealing with a scammer, Tomaschek said.

When politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. (From left to right) Rebekah Mercer, Robert Mercer, Stephen Bannon When politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. Last December, about a month before Donald Trump's inauguration, Rebekah Mercer arrived at Stephen Bannon's office in Trump Tower, wearing a cape over a fur-trimmed dress and her distinctive diamond-studded glasses. Tall and imposing, Rebekah, known to close friends as Bekah, is the 43-year-old daughter of the reclusive billionaire Robert Mercer. If Trump was an unexpected victor, the Mercers were unexpected kingmakers. More established names in Republican politics, such as the Kochs and Paul Singer, had sat out the general election. But the Mercers had committed millions of dollars to a campaign that often seemed beyond salvaging. That support partly explains how Rebekah secured a spot on the executive committee of the Trump transition team. She was the only megadonor to frequent Bannon's sanctum, a characteristically bare-bones space containing little more than a whiteboard, a refrigerator and a conference table. Unlike the other offices, it also had a curtain so no one could see what was happening inside. Before this point, Rebekah's resume had consisted of a brief run trading stocks and bonds (including at her father's hedge fund), a longer stint running her family's foundation and, along with her two sisters, the management of an online gourmet cookie shop called Ruby et Violette. Now, she was compiling lists of potential candidates for a host of official positions, the foot soldiers who would remake (or unmake) the United States government in Trump's image. Rebekah wasn't a regular presence at Trump Tower. She preferred working from her apartment in Trump Place, which was in fact six separate apartments that she and her husband had combined into an opulent property more than twice the size of Gracie Mansion. Still, it quickly became clear to her new colleagues that she wasn't content just to chip in with ideas. She wanted decision-making power. To her peers on the executive committee, she supported Alabama senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general and General Michael Flynn for national security adviser, but argued against naming Mitt Romney secretary of state. Her views on these matters were heard, according to several people on and close to the transition leadership. Rebekah was less successful when she lobbied hard for John Bolton, the famously hawkish former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, to be deputy secretary of state. And when Bolton was not named to any position, she made her displeasure known. I know it sounds sexist, but she was whiny as hell, says one person who watched her operate. Almost everyone interviewed for this article, supporters and detractors alike, described her style as far more forceful than that of other powerful donors. Rebekah Mercer is rarely photographed. However, occasionally she can be found in the background of news photos, uncredited in the captions. Here she is arriving at Trump Tower on December 8, with Nick Ayers and Kellyanne Conway. DREW ANGERER/GETTY IMAGES But then the Mercers aren't typical donors in most senses beyond their extreme wealth. (The exact number of their billions is unknown.) Robert Mercer is a youthful-looking 70. As a boy growing up in New Mexico, he carried around a notebook filled with computer programs he had written. It's very unlikely that any of them actually worked, he has said. I didn't get to use a real computer until after high school. Robert went on to work for decades at IBM, where he had a reputation as a brilliant computer scientist. He made his vast fortune in his 50s, after his work on predicting financial markets led to his becoming co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world's most successful quantitative hedge funds. A longtime colleague, David Magerman, recalls that when Robert began working at Renaissance in 1993, he and his wife, Diana, were grounded, sweet people. (Magerman was suspended from Renaissance in February after making critical comments about Robert in The Wall Street Journal.) But money changed all that, he says. Diana started jetting off to Europe and flying to their yacht on weekends. The girls were used to getting what they wanted. At Renaissance, Robert was an eccentric among eccentrics. The firm is legendary for shunning people with Wall Street or even conventional finance backgrounds, instead favoring scientists and original thinkers. Robert himself, by all accounts, is extremely introverted. Rarely seen in public, he likes to spend his free time with his wife and three daughters. When, in 2014, Robert accepted an award from the Association for Computational Linguistics, he recalled, in a soft voice and with quiet humor, his consternation at being informed that he was expected to give an oration on some topic or another for an hour, which, by the way, is more than I typically talk in a month. Sebastian Mallaby's account of the hedge-fund elite, More Money Than God, describes him as an icy cold poker player who doesn't remember having a nightmare. He likes model trains, having once purchased a set for $2.7 million, and has acquired one of the country's largest collections of machine guns. For years, Robert has embraced a supercharged libertarianism with idiosyncratic variations. He is reportedly pro-death penalty, pro-life and pro-gold standard. He has contributed to an ad campaign opposing the construction of the ground zero mosque; Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, a group that is associated with fringe scientific claims; and Black Americans for a Better Future—a vehicle, the Intercept discovered, for an African-American political consultant who has accused Barack Obama of relentless pandering to homosexuals. Magerman, Robert's former colleague at Renaissance, recalls him saying, in front of coworkers, words to the effect that your value as a human being is equivalent to what you are paid. ... He said that, by definition, teachers are not worth much because they aren't paid much. His beliefs were well-known at the firm, according to Magerman. But since Robert was so averse to publicity, his ideology wasn't seen as a cause for concern. None of us ever thought he would get his views out, because he only talked to his cats, Magerman told me. Robert's middle daughter Rebekah shares similar political beliefs, but she is also very articulate and, therefore, able to act as her father's mouthpiece. (Neither Rebekah nor Robert responded to detailed lists of questions for this article.) Under Rebekah's leadership, the family foundation poured some $70 million into conservative causes between 2009 and 2014.[1] 1. According to The Washington Post, the family donated $35 million to conservative think tanks and at least to $36.5 million to individual GOP races. The first candidate they threw their financial weight behind was Arthur Robinson, a chemist from Oregon who was running for Congress. He was best known in his district for co-founding an organization that is collecting thousands of vials of urine as part of an effort it says will revolutionize the evaluation of personal chemistry. Robinson didn't win, but he got closer than expected, and the Mercers got a taste of what their money could do. In 2011, they made one of their most consequential investments: a reported $10 million in a new right-wing media operation called Breitbart. I don't know any of your fancy friends, Robert Mercer told Sheldon Adelson, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. That the family gravitated toward Andrew Breitbart's upstart website was no accident. The Mercers are purists, says Pat Caddell, a former aide to Jimmy Carter who has shifted to the right over the years. They believe Republican elites are too cozy with Wall Street and too soft on immigration, and that American free enterprise and competition are in mortal danger. Bekah Mercer might be prepared to put a Democrat in Susan Collins' seat simply to rid the party of Susan Collins, a family friend joked by way of illustrating her thinking. So intensely do the Mercers want to unseat Republican senator John McCain[2] 2. Some have speculated that McCain may have angered the Mercers in 2014, when the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which McCain was the ranking member at the time, asserted that Renaissance had used complex financial methods to underestimate its taxes by $6 billion. Renaissance has told The New York Times its tax practices are lawful. that they gave $200,000 to support an opposing candidate who once held a town hall meeting to discuss chemtrails—chemicals, according to a long-standing conspiracy theory, that the federal government is spraying on the public without its knowledge. In short, unlike other donors, the Mercers are not merely angling to influence the Republican establishment—they want to obliterate it. One source told me that, in a meeting with Sheldon Adelson and Robert Mercer a few years ago, the casino mogul asked Robert if he was familiar with certain big Republican players. According to the source, Robert shut him down. I don't know any of your fancy friends, he replied, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. And so it seemed almost inevitable that their paths converged with Bannon's when he took over Breitbart in 2012. The Mercers recognized Bannon as an ideological ally. They also appreciated how quickly he improved the website's finances. Unlike many people in their orbit, Bannon wasn't obsequious: According to one person who often spends time with them, he made zero effort to dress up around his benefactors, often appearing in sweatpants and looking almost like a homeless person. Bannon was respectful around Robert, says this person, but with Rebekah he was more apt to say precisely what he thought: He worked for Bob; he worked with Rebekah. Although the Mercers had initially been persuaded to back Texas senator Ted Cruz in the Republican primary, Bannon preferred Trump, and by the time of the Republican National Convention the Mercers were with him. Rebekah made her move last August, at a fundraiser at the East Hampton estate of Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets. According to two sources, one who strategized with the Mercers and another who worked closely with Trump, Rebekah insisted on a 30-minute face-to-face meeting with Trump, in which she informed him that his campaign was a disaster. (Her family had pledged $2 million to the effort about a month earlier, so she felt comfortable being frank.) Trump, who knew her slightly, was willing to listen. He had been disturbed by recent stories detailing disorganization in his campaign and alleging ties between Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and pro-Russia officials in Ukraine. Rebekah knew of this and arrived at her meeting with props, says the source who strategized with the Mercers: printouts of news articles about Manafort and Russia that she brandished as evidence that he had to go. And she also had a solution in mind: Trump should put Bannon in charge of the campaign and hire the pollster Kellyanne Conway.[3] 3. Conway had worked for the Mercers' super PAC. By the following morning, Rebekah was breakfasting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with the two people he trusts most, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to talk through the proposal in more detail. Within four days, Trump did exactly as Rebekah had advised. Manafort was out. Bannon was in charge. Trump also brought on David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, with whom the Mercers and Bannon had been close for years. Less than four months later, Mercer's handpicked team had pulled off one of the greatest upsets in American politics. Through a bizarre combination of daring and luck, the insurgents had won. Now, they were Trump's version of the establishment—which is to say, a very volatile one.\n\n(From left to right) Patrick Caddell, Stephen Bannon, Lee and Alice Hanley On July Fourth weekend in 2014, members of the Mercer clan (Robert, Rebekah and her husband, Sylvain Mirochnikoff) went to visit some new friends. They traveled on Robert's 203-foot luxury superyacht, the Sea Owl, and anchored just off the WASP enclave of Fishers Island in New York's Long Island Sound. Their destination, a medieval-style granite castle called White Caps, towered over the shoreline. This was the summer home of Lee and Alice Hanley, Reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in Texas oil and gas but lived mostly between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. Like the Mercers, the Hanleys were convinced that the American political establishment was rotten to its foundations. Unlike the Mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider. It didn't matter whether the candidate came from the left or the right; voters just wanted somebody different. They had lost all faith in the ruling class—the government, the media, Wall Street. It showed the entire blow-up of the country coming, Caddell told me. A whole new paradigm developing. No Republican had yet emerged as a front-runner in the 2016 primary, but the Hanleys believed Ted Cruz could take Caddell's insights and ride them all the way to the White House. They saw Cruz as a unicorn: a dedicated fiscal and social conservative who had broken with his party repeatedly. They were dismissive of Trump. He doesn't understand politics or geopolitics or anything about the running of the government, Alice Hanley told me recently. Rebekah Mercer saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology. Robert Mercer and Cruz had met before during a conference in February 2014, when Lee Hanley had invited them to the five-diamond Breakers resort in Palm Beach for a grilling session. Robert was impressed by Cruz's intellect, according to a person at the meeting, but worried that the 43-year-old senator was too young and might struggle to capture voters' imaginations. Still, Robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various Hanley homes. Apparently, Cruz can hold his alcohol (his preference is cabernet), which is a prized attribute in the Hanleys' circle. As the Mercers weighed whether to get involved in a presidential race, their calculus was quite different from that of other megadonors, most of whom run massive corporate empires. Various people who have worked with the Mercers on campaigns told me they didn't pressure their candidates to adopt policies that would benefit the family's financial interests, such as favorable regulations for hedge funds. Instead, their mission was a systemic one. Steve Hantler, a friend of Rebekah's, says she was determined to disrupt the consultant class, which she saw as wasteful and self-serving. She wanted to disrupt the conservative movement, too. Rebekah saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a mechanism to promote a more hard-line ideology. According to Politico and other sources, she was frustrated at the time that no one was taking her seriously. As it happened, however, the family owned what seemed to be an ideal vehicle for achieving her goals. Around 2012, Robert Mercer reportedly invested $5 million in a British data science company named SCL Group. Most political campaigns run highly sophisticated micro-targeting efforts to locate voters. SCL promised much more, claiming to be able to manipulate voter behavior through something called psychographic modeling. This was precisely the kind of work Robert valued. There's no data like more data, he likes to say. Robert had made his money by accumulating piles of data on human behavior (markets might move in a certain direction when it rains in Paris, for instance), in order to make extremely precise and lucrative financial bets. Similarly, SCL claimed to be able to formulate complex psychological profiles of voters. These, it said, would be used to tailor the most persuasive possible message, acting on that voter's personality traits, hopes or fears. The firm has worked on campaigns in Argentina, Kenya, Ghana, Indonesia and Thailand; the Pentagon has used it to conduct surveys in Iran and Afghanistan. Best of all, from the Mercers' perspective, SCL operated entirely outside the GOP apparatus. (A source close to Rebekah said she wanted a results-oriented consultant.) As Rebekah saw it, SCL would allow the Mercers to control the data operation of any campaign they supported, giving the family enormous influence over messaging and strategy.

Robert preferred to focus on his work at Renaissance, often operating from his Long Island mansion, Owl's Nest. He wouldn't look under the hood, because that's not what he does, says Bob Perkins, one of Caddell's associates who worked on the Smith Project. Besides, Rebekah was the political animal in the family. (Her older sister Jenji has practiced law; her younger sister Heather Sue is, like Robert, a competitive poker player). This was a relatively new phenomenon. Rebekah isn't known to have been particularly political earlier in adulthood, while gaining a master's degree in management science and engineering from Stanford, or in early motherhood. (She has four children with her French-born husband, who became an investment banker at Morgan Stanley.) But, after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, which significantly loosened restrictions on political spending, Rebekah decided it was time to save America from becoming like socialist Europe, as she has put it to several people. She started attending Koch events and donating to the Goldwater Institute, a right-wing think tank based in Arizona. The family's political advocacy accelerated rapidly. It was in 2012 that she really attracted attention in GOP circles when, not long after Mitt Romney lost the presidential race, she stood up before a crowd of Romney supporters at the University Club of New York and delivered a scathing but detailed diatribe about his inadequate data and canvassing operation. Who is that woman? people in attendance asked. With SCL, Rebekah finally had the chance to prove she could do better. The company's American branch was renamed Cambridge Analytica, to emphasize the pedigree of its behavioral scientists. And Rebekah started flying Alexander Nix, the firm's Old Etonian CEO, around the country to introduce him to her contacts. Nix, 41, is not a data scientist (his background is in financial services), but he is a showy salesman. Dressed in impeccably tailored suits, he is in his element on stage making presentations at large conferences. He can, however, come across as arrogant. (I love the fact that you're telling your story, but I'm the one giving the interview, he told me in a conversation.) Alexander Nix at Cambridge Analytica's New York office. Rebekah Mercer was impressed by Nix's command of data and artistry on the polo field. JOSHUA BRIGHT/THE WASHINGTON POST/GETTY IMAGES According to Perkins and Caddell, Rebekah and Nix met with them a few times to discuss how CA could use the Smith Project. Rebekah was clearly impressed by Nix. In one meeting, according to Perkins, she gushed about his polo prowess and asked him to show off cellphone photos of himself on horseback. (Nix says he doesn't recall this meeting or others with the three. He also doesn't remember displaying such a picture and can think of no good reason why Bob or Pat would be interested in horses.) The political veterans were skeptical. I didn't understand what Nix was talking about, Perkins told me bluntly. Caddell says he was perplexed when Nix wouldn't show him the instruments CA used to predict voter behavior. He also thought the firm didn't grasp the seismic shift underway in American politics. And yet to his great surprise, Bannon vouched for CA, telling Caddell its scientists were geniuses. Caddell knew that Bannon was beholden to the Mercers—they were, after all, Breitbart's part-owners. According to The New York Times, however, Bannon was also vice president of CA's board. Even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist. After he learned of Bannon's involvement, Caddell stopped asking Bannon questions about CA. In the end, Bannon helped seal the deal between the Mercers and Cruz, with CA as the glue. In the fall of 2014, Toby Neugebauer, a garrulous oil-and-gas billionaire from Texas, took Cruz and his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, to the Breitbart Embassy, the website's Washington headquarters near the Capitol. Bannon flitted in and out. Nix, as usual, did most of the talking. After Neugebauer and Roe visited SCL's London headquarters, the Cruz team agreed that CA could play a key role in their operation, running models and helping with research. However, it was made clear to Rebekah and Nix that the entire data analytics operation would be supervised by Chris Wilson, CEO of the research firm WPA. A source close to Cruz told me that Wilson's operation had played a crucial role when Cruz ran for the Senate with only 2 percent name recognition in Texas and defeated a far better-known opponent. Why, then, was CA necessary at all? No one ever said directly that the quid pro quo for hiring CA was that the Mercers would support Cruz, says someone close to Roe. Nevertheless, after CA was engaged, Neugebauer took a private jet to the Bahamas to meet Robert Mercer on the Sea Owl. When Neugebauer asked him to donate to Cruz's bid, Robert was matter-of-fact. The family would start with $11 million.\n\n(Clockwise, starting top right) Jeff Roe, Ted Cruz, Alexander Nix All modern political campaigns have to balance their need for exorbitant sums of money with the obsessions of the people who want to give them that money. Roe, the straight-talking manager of the Cruz operation, has observed that running a campaign is like trying to solve a Rubik's cube of complicated personalities and uncomfortable dependencies. He has also told people that he is careful not to get too close to the donors who make his campaigns possible, because they can be so easily annoyed by the most trivial of things—his laugh, for instance, or the way he eats a bread roll. In the case of the Cruz campaign, the donor obsession in question was Cambridge Analytica. And it wasn't long before Roe and his team suspected that Nix had promised them a more impressive product than he could deliver. On March 4, 2015, Cruz, Roe, Wilson and others gathered in the Hyatt in Washington D.C. for an all-day meeting with Nix and a group of CA senior executives. Wilson took notes on his computer. According to multiple members of the Cruz team, Wilson was dismayed to learn that CA's models weren't fully ready for his focus groups the following week. As far as the team could tell, the only data CA possessed that the campaign didn't already have appeared to be culled from Facebook. In addition, they recalled, CA hadn't set itself up with Data Trust, the Republican National Committee's repository of voter information. At one point, they recall, Nix explained that the National Rifle Association's database of members would be a valuable way to target donors. Wilson typed an emoji with rolling eyes next to the statement because it was so obvious. He told people that he came away thinking, Red flag, red flag, red flag. In response to an extensive set of questions, Nix disputed this account of the meeting. He denied that Cambridge Analytica had obtained any data via Facebook—a source of controversy for the firm ever since The Guardian reported in 2015 that CA based its data on research spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission. Nix also claimed that it was the Cruz team that didn't have access to the RNC's Data Trust for much of the cycle and that all data used for the majority of the campaign was provided by Cambridge Analytica. However, Mike Shields, then the RNC's chief of staff and Data Trust's senior adviser, told me the Cruz campaign was in fact the second to sign an agreement with Data Trust, in 2014. Meanwhile, the red flags kept coming. Wilson found the data scientists that CA sent to Houston to be highly efficient at the day-to-day work of his research operation. But according to Cruz staffers, when he began to test CA's specialized models, he found that they were notably off, with, for example, some male voters miscategorized as women. In phone surveys, staffers said, CA's predictions fell short of the 85 percent accuracy the campaign expected. (Different models have differing levels of accuracy, Nix said in his response. I suspect these numbers have been taken out of context to make us look bad. In many previous articles the Cruz campaign have highly rated the quality of our data scientists.) By September, CA's first six-month contract was up. A CA employee in the campaign's Houston office accidentally left the invoice in the photocopier, and Wilson happened to fish it out. The invoice totaled an eye-popping $3,119,052 for work that Wilson estimated to be worth $600,000 at most. I can't fucking believe it, Wilson told Roe, who concurred. Jeff Roe (left) with Ted Cruz (right), who ultimately fell out of Rebekah Mercer's favor. We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon, a Cruz adviser said. ETHAN MILLER/GETTY IMAGES Nix disputed this account too, noting that the firm's fee was clearly stated in our statement of work and contract. However, a former consultant for the campaign, Tommy Sears, attended budget meetings for two if not three days over the matter. There was an understanding between both parties that the totality of the contract through March 2016 would be $5.5 million, he says. The heartburn felt by the Cruz team was that over $3 million had already been spent by September 1, 2015. When the Cruz team decided not to pay the full $3 million, bedlam ensued. A phone call was scheduled with Rebekah, Bannon and CA's attorney. I understand she's a nice lady, Wilson says politely of Rebekah. According to multiple people on the call, she accused Wilson of undermining CA. Bannon, meanwhile, unleashed a torrent of profanities at the Cruz team. Someone on the call gave me a censored version of his outburst: The only reason this campaign is where it is right now is because of our people and I. My recommendation to the Mercers is just to pull them out of there and we'll have them on another campaign by Monday. Bannon's language was so foul it was difficult to listen to, says one person on the call who had never met him before. Another of the political pros, who knew Bannon well, wasn't shocked. That's Steve doing business, he says. The Cruz team was taken aback by Rebekah's reaction. Some even wondered if she'd been given all the facts. One person who was close to the campaign says, She is somewhere between the daughter of a brilliant hedge fund manager and mathematician and somebody who runs a bakery in New York. She clearly has a skill set, but the skill set we're discussing here regarding the understanding of the value of data and analytics doesn't fall into that area. She is operating under the information she's been given. If Rebekah Mercer was broke and wasn't a major donor in the Republican party, says a Cruz adviser, nobody would spend two seconds trying to know her… She's not fun. She's just like a series of amoeba cells. The two sides were also diverging ideologically. In the summer of 2015, according to two sources, Rebekah reprimanded Cruz for an April article he'd co-authored with House Speaker Paul Ryan in The Wall Street Journal in support of free trade. She and Bannon told Cruz that he should adopt the positions of Jeff Sessions, whose views on trade and immigration were more in line with the conservative base. By this time, Cruz and his team were becoming increasingly concerned about Bannon's relationship with Rebekah. Bannon (who declined to comment for this article) was now blatantly pro-Trump. Over the course of the primary, Breitbart would publish around 60 pieces disputing that Cruz was eligible to be president because he had been born in Canada. Cruz repeatedly called Rebekah to complain, but she insisted that she had to be fair and impartial. One of his advisers says, We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon. A person close to Bannon counters: There's absolutely no way anyone could manipulate Rebekah Mercer. After the first debate in South Carolina, Rebekah gave Cruz a dressing down on his performance, according to three sources. Given what was going on around him—and what he must have truly felt—he behaved like an absolute gentleman, says a person close to Cruz. Rebekah was incensed that Trump had a tougher immigration policy than Cruz did—she particularly liked Trump's idea for a total ban on Muslims. Subsequently, Cruz proposed a 180-day suspension on all H1-B visas. Meanwhile, even though the Cruz staffers generally got along well with their CA counterparts—they sometimes took the visitors country-western dancing —the firm remained a source of friction. In retrospect, Wilson told people, he believed that Nix resented the campaign for allocating work through a competitive bidding process, rather than favoring CA. Two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Wilson assigned a contract to a firm called Targeted Victory. CA then locked its data in the cloud so it couldn't be accessed by Roe's team. The data remained unavailable until, a Cruz campaign source said, it was pretty much too late to be useful. Cruz won the Iowa caucuses anyway. The Cruz operation became so fed up with Nix that they pushed back, hard, on CA's bill for its second six-month contract. Wilson was able to negotiate the fees down after, as Cruz staffers recalled, a CA representative accidentally emailed him a spreadsheet documenting the Houston team's salaries. (Nix said CA had intended to send the spreadsheet.) Still, the campaign wound up paying nearly $6 million to CA—which represented almost half of the money the Mercers had pledged to spend on Cruz's behalf. The acrimony lingered long after Cruz exited the race in May. When he decided not to endorse Trump at the GOP convention, the Mercers publicly rebuked him. In a statement, Cruz was diplomatic: We were delighted to work with Cambridge Analytica, they were a valuable asset to my campaign, and any rumors to the contrary are completely unfounded. (The source close to Rebekah added, I was with Rebekah the other day and Ted Cruz was falling all over her. It's not fair to blame CA's methodology for Cruz's loss.) Others from Cruz's team, however, remain bitter about the whole experience. If Rebekah Mercer was broke and wasn't a major donor in the Republican Party, says one, nobody would spend two seconds trying to know her. … She's not fun. She's just like a series of amoeba cells.
Article illustrated by Abbie Winters\n\nIt's possibly the most exhausted easy money-saving tip of all time: Cut back on those coffeeshop lattes, and you'll save enough to buy a home! Sounds straightforward enough, but also too good to be true. Besides, are we really spending that much on coffee? According to a new study, we apparently are. SurveyMonkey says that 44 percent of millennial women put less money into their retirement accounts this year than into their coffee funds. (Um, guilty.)\n\nThis is not a statistic to scoff at. But what do those numbers — and that shocking savings vs. caffeine spending discrepancy — look like on a day-to-day level? We spoke with 13 women* who were willing to share the breakdown of their monthly spending in both categories. These women span a wide range of industries, cities, salaries, and budgeting-app approaches, but they're all doing their damndest to reconcile their current coffee habits with their plans to, you know, be able to enjoy that morning brew in blissful retirement someday.\n\nThe verdict? Overall, these women are doing a startlingly good job of budgeting. Maybe I should ask them to talk me out of the cortado I just ordered.\n\n*Some names and identifiers have been changed.\n\nWorks as: Marketing Manager Annual Salary: $65K-$100K Monthly Coffee Spend: $40-50, because I mostly drink shitty bodega coffee or make decaf at home. Monthly Retirement Deposit: $350 pre-tax, which Fidelity is always telling me is not enough.\n\nWorks in: Web Development Annual Salary: $100-$150K Monthly Coffee Spend: $50-69 Monthly Retirement Deposit: $1K I don't actually have a 401k through my job, but I do put $1K a month into a brokerage account; I'm allowed to cash in at any time, but the plan is that I won't. I'm pretty good about making coffee at home and buying K-cups.\n\nWorks as: Stay-at-home mom Annual salary: $0, husband's salary is $30K Monthly Coffee Spend: $6.50 Monthly Retirement Deposit: $0 I buy one 30-oz Folger's coffee jug for $6.50 (I keep coupons) and that usually lasts me two months-ish. I used to drink SO MUCH more coffee but I'm breast-feeding so now I have one cup a day.\n\nWorks as: Government Attorney Annual Salary: $100K-$150K Monthly Coffee Spend: $50, including coffee made at home as well as Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts on-the-go purchases. Monthly Retirement Deposit: $620. This does not include payments made towards Social Security (that's about $500).\n\nWorks in: Advertising Annual Salary: $100K-150K Monthly Coffee Spend: $80-100 Monthly Retirement Deposit: 6% of salary to an IRA. OMG. I am a $5 latte, four to five days a week kind of gal. The funny thing is that I don't even think it's about the caffeine so much as that I am a total creature of habit, and I love the habit of starting my day at my favorite coffee shop, saying hi to the baristas, and having a moment to myself to just be before I dive into the work day. As for my retirement-savings percentage, I have been telling myself that I need to up it to 7% (I'd love to get to 10%) but I have yet to actually do it.\n\nFor the rest of the article, click here.
WASHINGTON ― As Congress begins working on a huge fiscal package to prop up the economy and soften the blow for people who are suffering from the coronavirus epidemic and its effects on their livelihoods, Democrats are demanding that any taxpayer bailout to major industries include restrictions on corporate bonuses and stock buybacks.\n\nThe issue of corporate accountability remains fresh in many lawmakers' minds. In 2009, amid the Great Recession, the insurance company American International Group (AIG) handed out millions in bonuses after receiving a bailout from the federal government. The move prompted widespread criticism from both parties on Capitol Hill and further soured the public on the idea of taxpayer-funded bailouts, especially to Wall Street.\n\nTo address the severe economic shock currently gripping the country, the Trump administration is working on an emergency stimulus proposal of at least $1 trillion that includes $50 billion in loans for the airline industry, which has been hit hard by the crisis. The package calls for an additional $150 billion in loans for unnamed severely distressed sectors of the economy. According to The Washington Post, those might include hotels, casinos, cruise lines, and the oil and gas industry. Other groups are also lining up for a lifeline, including restaurant chains, the nation's mayors, and nonprofit groups.\n\nCertainly, the hotel industry, the cruise ship industry, the airlines, those are all prime candidates, absolutely, Trump told reporters on Wednesday when asked about the administration's plans for targeted relief to businesses.\n\nAccording to the Post, the administration's fiscal proposal for certain industries does include limits on increases in executive compensation until repayment of the loans.\n\nBut Democrats are calling on the Treasury Department to go even further, urging them to set specific conditions — that will apply beyond the coronavirus crisis — on taxpayer funds that go to corporations.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who recently dropped out of the 2020 presidential race, laid out what she called a progressive litmus test for the bailouts on Tuesday. The eight-point plan calls for companies who receive taxpayer funds to provide a $15 minimum wage, keep people on their payrolls, maintain collective bargaining agreements, and permanently ban stock buybacks, among other steps.\n\nFunds must come with strings attached to ensure that the money goes to maintain payroll, not to enrich shareholders or pay executive bonuses, Warren said in an op-ed this week. Giant corporations that receive substantial loans from taxpayers should be required to set aside one or more board seats for a representative elected by the company's workers. Violations should trigger criminal penalties and clawbacks.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, noted that many airline companies repurchased their own stocks to reward their investors when times were good.\n\nLet's not forget that the reason many airlines are so short on cash right now is that they have spent billions on stock buybacks ― money they had to send out when they should have been saving it for a rainy day, for their customers and workers, Schumer said in a floor speech on Wednesday. That issue should be addressed.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) added on Twitter: There is no straight-face justification to give no-strings-attached cash to an industry that had the chance to use massive profits and tax cuts to build a rainy day fund, but instead used the money to pad investor returns and executive pay.\n\nCorporate stock buybacks skyrocketed after Trump signed the 2017 Republican tax cut into law. In fact, over the last five years, 50 of the largest U.S. corporations repurchased a staggering $1.1 trillion of their own stock, according to a Wednesday memo from the advocacy group Economic Liberties Project.\n\nBut Democrats aren't the only ones who are calling for conditions to bailouts for major industries that are severely affected by the economic crisis. Keith Anderson, co-founder of investment firm BlackRock, suggested in a letter to The New York Times this week that stock warrants should be attached to any loans given by the federal government, similar to what a private investor would require when bailing out a troubled company.\n\nThe vast majority of these entities, Anderson wrote, have spent the last decade of unprecedented economic expansion buying back their outstanding shares — as Royal Caribbean Cruises and Delta and American Airlines have done — in an effort to increase their per-share earnings and their share prices.\n\nWhile I hope that the citizens of our country who are most in need and the small businesses that have no access to capital markets are in the front of the line for assistance, when it does come time to lend a hand to these public companies, any loan or bailout should also provide a reward to the citizens of our country who are lending them money, he added.
Illustration By Isabella Carapella for HuffPost/Getty Images\n\nEvery month since the coronavirus pandemic began, Sydney, a 20-year-old college student in Bloomington, Indiana, has dreaded getting her period.\n\nShe lost her job in March and has been relying on financial aid, scholarship money and the income she earns from nannying full time to pay her bills. At the end of the month, that leaves very little cash for items such as tampons, pantyliners and over-the-counter pain relievers for menstrual cramps.\n\nI know that $30 a month may not feel like a big deal to most people, but when you are living paycheck-to-paycheck that is a decent chunk of change to have to set aside each month, said Sydney, who asked to go by only her first name to protect her privacy.\n\nI have to factor this cost into my already tight budget and I find myself filled with dread when my period comes around and I have to fork up that fee, she told HuffPost.\n\nSydney's experiences aren't uncommon. Period poverty, or inadequate access to menstrual hygiene tools and education, is a problem across the globe affecting girls, women and nonbinary and transgender people who menstruate.\n\nA 2019 study of low-income U.S. women found that nearly two-thirds of the women surveyed struggled to afford period products, leading many to resort to using paper towels, rags, or even diapers as alternatives.\n\nOne in five teenagers have struggled to afford pads and tampons, and one in four have missed class because they did not have access to period products.\n\nIn most of the U.S., tampons and pads are subject to sales tax because they're not classified as products that fill a basic, essential need. Only a handful of states have succeeded in abolishing the so-called tampon tax. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, does not cover tampons or pads. Neither does Medicaid.\n\nIt's not like your period is going to be nice and say, 'Hey, I see you're unemployed, let's hold off for a spell.' - Dana Marlowe, founder of the national service organization I Support the Girls\n\nThe scourge of COVID-19 has only exacerbated the problem. Many public places that supply free tampons and pads in bathrooms― school campuses, rec centers, libraries ― are closed.\n\nOne survey found that one in four people between the ages of 13 and 35 reported having a more difficult time managing their periods because of financial strain during the pandemic.\n\nAs with toilet paper and medicine, those who could afford to hoard maxi-pads and tampons did just that, leaving women with lower incomes without basic essentials.\n\nDana Marlowe, founder of the national service organization I Support the Girls, said her group has been flooded with requests for feminine hygiene products. In the spring of 2020, the group experienced a 38% increase in requests for products from both individuals and organizations.\n\nOur staff received communications from people in March, April, and May saying things like, 'I can afford to buy products, but the stores don't have any in stock and I'm getting my period soon. Is there any way to get some from you? I will donate when I can!' Marlowe told HuffPost.\n\nAs more and more women lost their jobs, people who used to be donors began to request products themselves.\n\nOne in five women in the U.S. have left the labor force since the beginning of the pandemic; Marlowe is anticipating the high level of need will last at least another 18 months.\n\nThe sudden lack of income has just resulted in an overwhelming number of requests to food banks, day centers, and organizations like us, Marlowe said. It's not like your period is going to be nice and say, 'Hey, I see you're unemployed, let's hold off for a spell.'\n\nUnfortunately, inadequate access to period products is rarely discussed even in the best of times.\n\nBefore period poverty can be addressed in a significant way, people need to be made aware it's even a problem, said Eiko La Boria, the founder of The Flow Initiative, a non-profit that addresses period poverty and gender equity in Jersey City.\n\nThere are so many women that have never heard of terms like period poverty or menstrual equity, yet once they do, it's as though a veil is lifted and they become allies, spokespeople, advocates in the fight to end it, she said. When we discuss it, we open the door to eradicating the shame and stigma associated with periods and period poverty, which will lead to a more menstrual equitable society.\n\nzoranm via Getty Images Pads, tampons, cups and similar products often have been hard to come by during the pandemic.\n\nPart of the problem may lie in semantics. Period poverty can be a marginalizing phrase, which is why many prefer to talk about menstrual equity, Among them is Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, a vice president for development at the New York University law school's Brennan Center for Justice and author of Periods Gone Public: Taking a Stand for Menstrual Equity.\n\nI think it is more accurate to refer to the problem — and the solution — as one of 'menstrual equity,' she said. That means ensuring that menstruation — and the inability to access products, information, education — does not deprive a person of their dignity or ability to participate fully and fairly in daily life.\n\nThe stigma and shame that exists around menstruation have been generations in the making, but the pro-period movement has been gaining traction.\n\nIn November, Scotland voted to make period products free, becoming the first country to do so. Slow strides have been made stateside, too.\n\nAs a result, pads, tampons, cups and other similar products are now eligible for inclusion in health savings and flexible spending account allowances. (HSAs and FSAs give employees the option to set aside pre-tax earnings to pay for qualified medical expenses ranging from doctor visits to co-pays to sunscreen.) Menstrual products had been ruled ineligible by the IRS because they did not alleviate or aid in the treatment plan of a specific illness.\n\nIn May, Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) introduced the Good Samaritan Menstrual Products Act, which would allow for more menstrual products to be donated to and distributed by nonprofit organizations during the pandemic.\n\nMenstrual equity is not a choice or a luxury, Meng said. It is a human right and a health right. Furthermore, in the current fight against COVID-19, periods do not wait for pandemics.\n\nOutside of legislative efforts, food banks, day centers and local organizations are working overtime to get women the period products they need.\n\nOur first day of the Westlake High School drive through went really well today! Remember you can stop by again next Wednesday to drop off products!\n\nPeace + Love 💕#periodswithpride pic.twitter.com/711iDec0VN — Periods with Pride (@periodswpride) December 10, 2020\n\nAs Weiss-Wolf pointed out, hundreds of food hubs in New York City have been distributing menstrual products, thanks to the quick, creative advocacy of two public school students who called upon the City Council to do so.\n\nIn California's Ventura County, high school students started Periods with Pride, a grassroots organization dedicated to providing menstrual products for people in need.\n\nThe group hosts local drives where they hand out products, said Sanjana Chandrasekar, a junior at Westlake High School and the program's youth and community outreach director. Even one pad or tampon box can make a huge difference, she said.\n\nIn Philadelphia, a mother-daughter team launched No More Secrets, an organization that makes door-to-door delivery of pads and tampons every day of the year throughout the city.\n\nWeiss-Wolf is heartened to see local nonprofits meet the moment with such distribution efforts, but said she hopes to see the day when they won't be shouldering so much of the burden.
