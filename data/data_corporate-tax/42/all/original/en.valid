ATHENS, Greece (AP) – Authorities have banned demonstrations in a large section of central Athens and will shut down streets and subway stations during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who arrives in the Greek capital Thursday afternoon for meetings with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and other officials.\n\nAround 2,000 officers, a police helicopter and drones will be deployed for the visit, which ends Friday afternoon.\n\nGermany was the largest single contributor to the three international bailout packages Greece received since 2010 as it struggled through a dramatic financial crisis which almost saw it crash out of the eurozone. Germany was also seen as one of the main enforcers of the stringent austerity measures, including tax hikes and pension and salary cuts, imposed in return for the loans.\n\nGermany Profited €100 Billion From Greek Debt Crisis http://t.co/g1xF4xR5mh pic.twitter.com/pHhd52HA1k — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 11, 2015
The House Democrats' proposed 2019 homeland security budget reopens the nation's southern border to migrant inflows, while it also dangles the promise of cheap labor in front of GOP legislators and donors.\n\nThe draft budget adds $1.75 billion in extra border spending to President Donald Trump's $58.7 billion budget request for the Department of Homeland security in 2019, according to a copy published by the Washington Post.\n\nBut Democrats' draft bill does not include any funding for the wall, and it uses the extra money to help migrants bypass border protections and then win jobs in the U.S. labor market.\n\nJudging by the draft bill, the Democrats want to limit the government's ability to keep people out of the country, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. In the Democrats' provisions become law, he said, adding that enforcement would be weakened and people abroad would every quickly learn of that, and then illegal immigration would dramatically increase, especially of people with children.\n\nAny flood of new migrants will force down wages for Americans, raise profits for donors, and will pressure some Americans to seek welfare from the government. In 2017, under rules set by former President Barack Obama and Congress, roughly 400,000 migrants got work permits to compete against Americans for jobs.\n\nThe Democrats' bill does not include any money for fences or walls, and it bars officials from setting barriers in major migrant pathways across the border:\n\n[The bill] prohibits the use of funds from this and prior year Acts to construct physical barriers, as follows: Within or north of the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge; Within or north of the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park; Within or north of La Lomita Historical Park; Within, south of, or north of the National Butterfly Center; or Within, north of, or east of the Vista del Mar Ranch tract of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThe bill blocks Trump's rules which deny asylum to migrants who say they are afraid of gangs or domestic violence. It commits the DHS to end the detention of migrants who bring children to the border even though many migrants openly tell reporters that they bring children to trigger Obama's catch and release rules. The bill also cuts funding needed to keep migrants in detention until their legal claims are resolved, and it spends at least $75 million to encourage the catch-and-release of migrants.\n\nThe bill allocates $502 million for humanitarian concerns to welcome and aid migrants as they push their way through the border.\n\nIt also reopens Obama's pipeline for relaying Central American UAC youths from the cartels' coyotes at the border up to their parents and relatives who are living illegally in the United States while cutting ICE personnel levels and enforcement operations.\n\nThe bill also reauthorizes the EB-5 law which allows wealthy Chinese and Indian families to effectively buy green cards if they lend cash to American real-estate developers. The citizenship-for-sale program has strong supporters in both parties, including from New York's Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer and Texas' GOP Sen. John Cornyn.\n\nThe bill also diverts border security funds into pork-barrel spending in members' districts, such as the purchases of aircraft, extra construction projects, $403 million for disaster spending, and a requirement that federal agencies clean up debris from forest fires.\n\nThe Democrats' border-opening legislation comes after the GOP Hill leadership — and the White House's Hill liaison team — failed last winter to enact a DHS funding bill for 2019. During the entire year of 2018, the Senate's GOP leadership did not publicly use any carrots or sticks to win Democratic acceptance to a border security plan acceptable to President Donald Trump, who must now pressure Hill legislators to pass much of the 2018 border security bill which was not passed in 2018.\n\nBut Democrats do not want to recognize the economic and civic damage from their tacit support of mass migration, said Krikorian. He continued:\n\nIt is becoming increasingly mainstream on the left to reject the concept of immigration controls. Not that criminals should be let in, or terrorists, but the principle [they support] that everyone has the right to move here — unless there is some specific reason to keep them out— is now at the center of the Democratic Party.\n\nOur elites are increasingly dangerous — they are a danger to the health of their society, he added.\n\nTrump's Hire American policy is pushing up wages. So the DC estb. is loudly negotiating itself towards a wage-cutting amnesty. Lots of Kabuki noise and jumping to ensure the media does not pay attention to the money. https://t.co/8vkEEOocfi — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 19, 2019\n\nDemocrats have plenty of tools to pressure GOP legislators to accept the Democrats' border-opening legislation.\n\nThe bill denies any funding for walls. When GOP legislators push for wall funding, Democrats can demand offsetting cutbacks in enforcement and border rules.\n\nDemocrats also can offer more cheap labor to GOP donors if the GOP legislators agree to the Democrats' border opening plans.\n\nFor example, the bill does not include several expansions of visa-worker programs which were included in the July 2018 draft budget by Rep. Kevin Yoder and many GOP and Democratic appropriators. Yoder was defeated in November, but the border security panel is dominated by House and Senate appropriators.\n\nYoder's provisions would have roughly doubled the inflow of H-2B seasonal laborers, so forcing down salaries for American seasonal workers and blue collar workers.\n\nYoder also pushed for a rule which would allow all farm companies — including dairies — to use the fast-growing H-2A agricultural worker program. If adopted, the measure would shrink farmers' incentives and ability to buy American made, labor-saving machines, such as robotic cow-milkers.\n\nMost dramatically, Yoder and his fellow appropriators offered the hugely valuable prize of green cards to at least 50,000 additional low-wage Indian and Chinese graduates per year if they take middle-class jobs from American graduates. The green card offer is being marketed by lobbyists as the fair removal of country caps. But it is being backed by U.S. Fortune 500 companies who wish to raise their stock values by hiring more cheap visa-workers in place of American graduates.\n\nU.S. companies already employ roughly 1.5 million college trained visa workers, mostly in jobs that were not advertised to American graduates. Many of those workers accept very low wages from their employers in the hope of winning green cards from the government.\n\nFeds use a fake university to bust college-grad labor traffickers who funneled at least 600 Indian grads into jobs around the US. The trafficking was hidden within the quasi-legal workforce of 1.5 million H-1B, OPT, L-1, TN, etc. white-collar visa-workers. https://t.co/EBenDh5wE3 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 31, 2019\n\nThroughout the next several weeks, the GOP legislators will face pressure behind closed doors from business groups that want the cheap H-2A, H-2B, and H1B visa workers.\n\nYet few reporters ever ask legislators why they are eager to import cheap labor which forces down wages and salaries for Americans — including the wages and salaries paid to the journalists' children, friends, relatives, and college roommates.\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.\n\nThat flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up real estate prices in New York, California, and elsewhere, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
The looming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Tuesday has the potential to open up global tourism and foreign investment to North Korea, with little prospect of any profits reaching the North Korean people.\n\nReports have suggested since the dialogue process began that Kim Jong-un has encouraged Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping and President Trump to consider investing in lavish tourist resorts within his state.\n\nThe lush natural landscapes of North Korea – from Wonsan's beaches to the Pyongyang skyline to the terrific glory of Mount Paektu, an active volcano – lend themselves to inviting travel, particularly from China and other neighboring countries. Yet many remain skeptical that any investment enriching the Kim regime will help reduce the abject poverty the average North Korean suffers, and concerns abound that Pyongyang could use the money to strengthen its ironclad grip on religion, freedom of expression and any political dissent.\n\nUnlike his predecessors, father Kim Jong-il and grandfather Kim Il-sung, dictator Kim Jong-un made his avid interest in attracting tourism to the country well known early in his tenure. In 2013, Kim debuted the massive Masikryong Ski Resort, which official North Korean propaganda described as a feat of the supreme will of the people despite widespread hunger and disease that rendered skiing far from a priority of the average North Korean. Two years later, Kim announced that he would launch a campaign to attract up to two million foreign tourists by 2020, when the most common kind of tourist to the country was an elder Chinese communist seeking to relive the glory days of the Maoist era.\n\nWhile more permissive in allowing Chinese tourists to enter the country, the Kim regime does allow Westerners to see it, but only through restrictive tour programs where a North Korean guide stays with each individual at all times, ensuring they do not ask incorrect questions or wander out of the sight of the government. Tour companies like Koryo Tours and Young Pioneer Tours specialize in helping foreigners navigate the process of being allowed in, and organize itineraries once approved. They have not taken Americans since Congress passed a law banning American tourism to the country in 2017.\n\nThis interest in tourism has reportedly seeped into recent talks with China and the United States. This month, the South Korean newspaper Dong-A Ilbo reported that Kim has repeatedly mentioned to Chinese officials his desire to see Beijing invest in creating a world-class resort in Wonsan, a beachside city several reports suggest could be turned into a special economic zone where foreign investment is permitted. The same newspaper reported that Kim Yong-chol, believed to be Kim's most trusted official, suggested to President Trump that he could help North Korea build a casino in Wonsan, should talks with Kim go well, predicting that a casino in that city could generate $50 million a year.\n\nNorth Korea forced reporters covering the alleged shutdown of the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site to stay in Wonsan and write about what a beautiful place it is, reports revealed after the event, and at least one outlet, China's Xinhua news service, complied.\n\nMainichi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, reported this month that Kim may bring up the Wonsan project during his talks with Trump tomorrow.\n\nHarry J. Kazianis, the Director of Defense Studies at The Center for the National Interest and an expert on North Korean affairs, tells Breitbart News that any talk of resorts, at least in my view, is years away.\n\nWhile it would seem, at least on the surface, that any investment in a nation such as North Korea — with an economy one-third the size of Ethiopia — would be uplifting, it will do nothing to help the average citizen, he says. Building such resorts, in the hope that they will attract international vacationers and adventure seekers — if sanctions are lifted — will only enrich a regime that has over 100,000 people in gulags on-par with Stalin or Hitler. Such a thought actually sickens my stomach.\n\nPreliminary reports from Wonsan appear to corroborate the claim that resort construction has hurt the local people. Radio Free Asia (RFA), which relies on local sources to report on events deep within the secretive communist state, reported in May that Pyongyang is largely funding the Wonsan reports on the backs of local North Koreans.\n\nTo meet the needs of construction, the regime has issued a 'mobilization order' and has imposed a new construction tax, UPI, quoting RFA, reported. Local-level North Korean cooperatives, organized by neighborhood across the country, have been asked to donate manpower and financial support for the construction of the marine tourism zone, according to the source.\n\nWork on the construction in Wonsan has been so crushing, RFA reported two weeks later, that the rapid and haphazard construction caused an electrical fire in a barracks housing at least 40 laborers. It's unclear how many people died in the fire, but there were reportedly a large number of casualties, a source in the country told the outlet. The source stated that laborers were only allowed three to four hours of sleep a day.\n\nMore and more, local residents who hear about the deaths of these workers are expressing their dissatisfaction with how the construction is being pushed along, the source said. And even though a seaside resort is being built, we'll never get to go there.\n\nNorth Korea operates under a caste system known as songbun, that offers families clout based on how loyal they have historically been to the Kims. High songbun families live in Pyongyang and receive job offers in the central government; lower songbun families are banned from the capital and forced to starve for generations in rural areas. The lowest songbun families – relatives of known political dissidents or defectors, individuals found possessing Hollywood movies or Bibles – are relegated to concentration camps. Up to 120,000 people are estimated to live in North Korea's camp system, many having been born there and knowing nothing else.\n\nCommunist regimes that lack a rigid caste system rarely let locals partake in tourist activities meant for foreigners. In Cuba, for example – arguably gifted with the most lucrative tourist sites in all of the communist world – local Cubans are forced to do business in a worthless parallel currency, the Cuban peso, that is not accepted in tourist areas. Tourists use the Cuban convertible peso, which is worth the equivalent of an American dollar.\n\nThose who have observed the abuses of the Castro regime believe there is no way North Korea would allow low- or medium-songbun families to enjoy the nation's tourist resorts.\n\nFirst of all, North Korea has no money. Neither does Cuba. The investment you're going to make in Cuba, just like North Korea, is going to be China spending money there or some other entity spending money, but North Korea has no money and neither does Cuba, Dr. Javier García-Bengochea, whose family owned one of Cuba's most lucrative ports in Santiago before Fidel Castro stole it during the Revolution, told Breitbart News. So you are going to be effectively … cannibalizing or appropriating their natural or cultural resources going in for whatever their minerals are or tourism there is. You're not going to build Cuban society, or North Korean society.\n\nMickael Behn, whose family are the rightful owners of Havana Docks company, agreed. [Tourism and investment] will supply the top end of the regime, the military, to keep it alive, while all the other average people won't see any of it and will be used for cheap labor.\n\nThat's what the population is for, cheap labor, he added. it's an exact parallel to Cuba in that context.\n\nIf the Singapore summit results in the U.S. government allowing private American investors to profit there, Behn says, the nation's largest corporations may profit even if placed at risk of suffering what his family did in Cuba. I can see American companies going there … but it's at their own risk. The larger companies, I'm sure they can take a risk, a chance and they'll profit most from it.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has clearly stated it has no intent to invest American taxpayers' dollars in North Korea, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has hinted at the possibility of allowing Americans to invest there.\n\nThis will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid, he told Fox News Sunday. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives. These basic economic advances could go a long way to help North Korea's tourism industry.\n\nPompeo later said it was important to Kim Jong-un that he receive economic help from America in the form of private sector business's knowledge and know-how.\n\nThe tour guide companies – smaller than the major cruise corporations investing in Cuba, for example – have expressed a willingness to serve Americans with North Korea tours if Trump repeals the current ban. On its website, Koryo Tours states, as and when this travel ban is lifted, we would be more than happy to take you [Americans] to the DPRK (North Korea), and share our experience and knowledge there with you.\n\nWe will notify our mailing list as soon as there are any changes to this U.S. travel ban, and our ability to take people travelling on American passports to the DPRK, it adds.\n\nYoung Pioneer Tours, which chose to stop taking Americans after the death of one of its customers, Otto Warmbier, confirmed with Breitbart News that should the official U.S. ban on travel to the DPRK lift for U.S. citizens and if the opportunity to help facilitate positive business and economic relationships between the DPRK and American companies arose we would be open to assisting with these endeavours.\n\nTrump will likely face North Korea's economic concerns in person in his meeting with Kim tomorrow. Reports indicate the American side will not discuss human rights during this first meeting, so any conversation on the possibility of promoting tourism in the country will address only half the problem.\n\nNo American companies have publicly expressed a desire to invest in North Korea, whether in infrastructure or projects like the Wonsan resort. Yet estimates suggest it will take at least $2 trillion to bring North Korea into the 21st century, and South Korea simply does not have that kind of investment money around. China may help – it is already offering classes in economics to North Korean officials – but a communist regime can only do so much to spur economic growth.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
President Trump's compromise legislation to reopen the federal government funds border security measures in Pakistan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Libya.\n\nThe legislation known as the End the Shutdown and Secure the Border Act by Trump and the Senate GOP Leadership includes American tax dollars funding border security in North Africa, and the southern and western regions of Asia.\n\nWhile $5.7 billion is designated to build bollard-style fencing at the U.S.-Mexico border, about $15 million is allocated to border security programs in Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, the legislation grants nearly $6 billion to fund foreign militaries, which allows the Lebanese Armed Forces to use some of that funding to strengthen border security and secure Lebanon's borders.\n\nThe billions in U.S. taxpayer funding is also allocated to stabilize Libya, which includes increased border security for the country. The military of Egypt will continue to receive about $1.3 billion in taxpayer money that can likewise be used for border security efforts.\n\nIncluded in the compromise legislation is a plan to give amnesty in the form of three-year work permits to about a million illegal aliens and foreign nationals who would be shielded from deportation. The bill increases the number of low-skilled non-agricultural foreign workers that business is allowed to import every year instead of hiring Americans.\n\nThe Senate bill is expected to be voted on this week.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

President Donald Trump says ensuring legal immigrants prove they can be self-sufficient before permanently resettling in the United States is a critical Supreme Court victory for American taxpayers.\n\nDuring a rally in New Jersey on Tuesday evening, Trump touted this week's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allows the federal government to enforce the Clinton-era Public Charge rule, which seeks to end welfare-dependent legal immigration.\n\nI'm also very proud to report that we won a critical Supreme Court victory yesterday on immigration, Trump said. We will now finally be able to enforce federal law and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer-funded programs.\n\nThe rule ensures legal immigrants will be less likely to secure a permanent residency in the U.S. if they have used any forms of welfare in the past, including using subsidized healthcare services, food stamps, and public housing.\n\nPublic Charge: Self-Sufficient Immigrants Proficient in English Favored for Green Cardshttps://t.co/KeJI4XnNuC — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) August 12, 2019\n\nThe regulation will be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.\n\nThe National Academies of Science released a report two years ago noting that state and local American taxpayers are billed about $1,600 each year per immigrant to pay for their welfare, and immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households.\n\nA recent Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) study notes that about 63 percent of noncitizen households in the U.S. use at least one form of taxpayer-funded welfare, while only about 35 percent of native-born American households are on welfare. This means that noncitizen households use nearly twice as much welfare as native-born American households.\n\nThe most recent Harvard/Harris Poll finds that a 56-percent majority of Hispanic Americans support denying green cards to legal immigrants who have used welfare. About 60 percent of U.S. voters support ending welfare-dependent legal immigration — including 62 percent of swing voters.\n\nTrump also slammed Washington Democrats for betraying Americans on the issue of immigration, citing New Jersey's sanctuary policies that shield criminal illegal aliens from being deported:\n\nRight here in New Jersey, your state's Democrat leaders have instated sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your communities. For example, Cumberland County … they released an illegal alien with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child. He is now at-large, free to search for another innocent victim. They didn't give him to ICE. [Emphasis added]\n\nNo American should ever be hurt, harmed, or killed because left-wing politicians, Democrats, decided to shield and shelter criminals, Trump said.\n\nSince March 2019, New Jersey has been a sanctuary state for criminal illegal aliens. The statewide law bans local law enforcement from turning arrested illegal aliens over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\nCurrently, there is an estimated record high of 44.5 million foreign-born residents living in the U.S. This is nearly quadruple the immigrant population in 2000. The vast majority of those arriving in the country every year are low-skilled legal immigrants who compete against working- and middle-class Americans for jobs.\n\nEvery year, about 2,000 Americans are killed by illegal aliens, according to an analysis by Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL). Of the roughly 150,000 federal inmates in Bureau of Prisons custody, more than 40,000 are illegal aliens, indicating that more than 25 percent of the federal prison population came to the U.S. illegally.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

CLAIM: Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) says California had an incredible decade because it stood up for our values and took on big issues.\n\nVERDICT: Mostly false. California's economy recovered, but it lags behind in other areas.\n\nNewsom tweeted on New Year's Day: What an incredible decade. We've accomplished so much in CA by standing up for our values and taking on some of the biggest issues — from healthcare to gun violence to climate change.\n\nCuriously, Newsom did not cite the state's economic or fiscal progress, but its values. That is because much of what Newsom and the Democrats value in California has to do with good intentions, rather than real-world results.\n\nCalifornia's only achievement in health care is extending free benefits to illegal aliens. Despite gun control, it led the nation in mass slayings last year. And its effect on global climate is negligible, as its energy costs climb.\n\nWhen Breitbart News asked Newsom last month how he would defend his state against conservative criticism, he cited California's economic recovery, and noted that the state now runs a budget surplus, rather than a deficit.\n\nBut these trends, while commendable, are inseparable from the recovery of the nation as a whole. Though the state remains a hothouse for high-tech and media startups, thousands of companies left the state due to its high taxes, heavy regulations, and litigious environment.\n\nNewsom's predecessor, Jerry Brown, once said: We've got a few problems, we have lots of little burdens and regulations and taxes … But smart people figure out how to make it.\n\nThat attitude sums up California's economic development over the decade: incredible, and growing, wealth at the top, among the tech elite and the well-connected — while the poor grow, and the middle class stagnates, or leaves.\n\nAs Leo Tolstoy said, by way of Isaiah Berlin: The leaves of a tree delight us more than the roots. And the roots of California's progress have rotted over the past decade, under both Brown and Newsom, by a variety of measures.\n\nMiddle-class exodus: From 2007 to 2016, California lost a net million residents — some 2.5% of its population (which still grows due to births and immigration). The high cost of living — driven by high taxes and the shortage of housing — is a major factor. With homeowners and small business owners — the Republican base — leaving, Democrats and their policies become entrenched, though the state may lose a congressional seat after the Census.\n\nPower shortages: The state that leads the nation, and the world, in technological innovation cannot keep the lights on any longer — not since the Pacific Gas & Electric Company began shutting off the electricity last year during high winds to prevent wildfires and protect itself from liability. After focusing on green energy and letting nuclear plants go dark, the state government was unprepared for the basic task of making sure California had enough power.\n\nHomelessness: The most visible change in California over the past decade has been the surge in homelessness — 16.4% in 2018 alone, which entirely accounted for the nation's overall 2.7% rise. Tent cities are becoming a common sight in the big cities, and even in rural towns. The state has done nothing to address the root causes of homelessness; it keeps offering generous welfare benefits and asking the federal government for housing money.\n\nDrought: California suffered one of the worst droughts in its history for much of the decade. The effects were made worse because the state has failed to invest in new water storage infrastructure for decades. Though politicians point to climate change (inaccurately) as the cause of recent wildfires, poor forestry management — state and federal — plus restrictions on logging and poor residential planning have turned natural variation into man-made disasters.\n\nInfrastructure: The state suffers from a massive backlog in infrastructure spending. Democrats recently provided more funding for the state's roads — through an unpopular, regressive gas tax hike rather than spending cuts on less urgent priorities. But one of Newsom's first acts as governor was to cancel much of the state's high-speed rail plan, which had already sunk billions of federal dollars into plans for a rural segment no one had any interest in using.\n\nEducation: The past decade saw California schools continue to underperform. Reform movements, championing school choice, public charters, merit pay, and other proven innovations, gained support in minority communities and even won in local school board elections — only to be crushed, repeatedly, by teachers-union-backed candidates at the state level. For California's children, a decade of underachievement in public schools could have lifelong effects.\n\nCrime: Though crime remains at historically low levels, the past decade saw periods of increased crime in many areas, thanks in part to ill-conceived prison reforms such as Proposition 47, which focused on reducing sentences and downgrading many crimes. Notorious crimes committed by illegal aliens — such as the killing of Kate Steinle in 2015 — became national symbols of the lack of immigration enforcement and a general decline in the rule of law.\n\nAs this article was about to be published, Newsom added more claims about California's success:\n\nSpending some time looking back on 2019. CA made some serious first-in-the-nation and big moves… — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) January 2, 2020\n\nNoticeably absent: any mention of results, aside from the low unemployment rate, for which President Donald Trump can also claim credit.\n\nJoel B.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is reviving the establishment's virtual wall policy on the southern border to soften her uncompromising opposition to President Donald Trump's push for a real fence on the border.\n\nWhat the President is proposing is not the best way to protect our borders … We all support border security, and there is a better way to do it … The positive, shall we say, almost technological wall, that can be built is what we should be doing, Pelosi said January 10.\n\nNancy Pelosi's border security fix: Repair the border roads so it's easier for immigrants to enter U.S.https://t.co/X6ePFKurDQ pic.twitter.com/sYPgLLxHV9 — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) January 10, 2019\n\nPelosi's focus on a technological wall of sensors and drones helps the Democrats hide their push for more migration, despite its impact on Americans' wages, productivity, tax spending, crime, and civic peace, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThey have to make it sound like they are for some kind of enforcement, and so what they say they are in favor of is 'smarter enforcement,' just like the [Barack] Obama administration used to say their ICE strategy of 'prosecutorial prioritization' was really 'smarter enforcement,' she said.\n\nThe Democrats' push for a technological wall, is also very important for the new Democrat legislators elected in swing-districts, she said, adding:\n\nThey know they cannot afford to be seen blocking border security. We have to remember that Nancy Pelosi is not in the Speaker's chair now because voters want to abolish ICE or open the border. The Democrats [in November] won because there were a lot of Democratic candidates who won because they said they were just as hawkish on immigration as Republicans.\n\nPelosi also has to manage her raucous caucus, which includes moderates from swing-districts and progressives who back the Abolish ICE! slogan, Vaughan said.\n\nShe has to satisfy the open borders wing of her caucus [and] not veer too far in the direction of the progressives … I think the Democrats in Congress are more extreme on immigration than most Democratic voters are, but they can't afford to be associated with Abolish ICE! and pro-caravan demands.\n\nOverall, the party want the charade of enforcement, not actual enforcement, and that is true of border security and every other type of enforcement, she said.\n\nOther Democrats are touting technology as a full or partial substitute for a real fence. CNN reported January 4:\n\nIt is nothing more than a symbol when you look at it in this perspective, Bustos said during an interview on CNN's New Day, in reference to President Donald Trump's proposal for a wall. If we have a partial wall, if we have fencing, if we have technology used to keep our borders safe, all of that is fine. But it has just become this symbol that the president is not going to have any give-or-take when it comes to this $5 billion.\n\n.@RepCheri Bustos says the border wall has become nothing more than a symbol, but notes that in the end, we might have to give or take a little bit. It's just the way the world works.https://t.co/oiGb5OgcB7 pic.twitter.com/2aUrs7YK1Z — New Day (@NewDay) January 4, 2019\n\nPelosi is also trying to shift the debate away from fences and towards amnesties: We need to have comprehensive immigration reform … Dreamers and their families and the rest, she said January 10. Comprehensive Immigration Reform is what this debate frankly should be about, she said.\n\nThat Democrats' opposition to a wall is entwined with Democrats' increasing promotion of migrants above Americans and their children.\n\nOn January 4, for example, Pelosi said that a wall is an immorality — it builds walls in peoples' minds about who should come here.\n\nOn January 8, after Trump's national address, Pelosi downplayed the northward flow of economic migrants. The migrants are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counter-productive policies have only deepened, she said.\n\nOn January 10, Pelosi said that Trump's proposed barrier to Central American migration is discriminatory.\n\nIn February 2018, Pelosi gave a long speech in the House where she praised illegal migrants as better than Americans:\n\nWe recognize that they are a blessing to America … the dreamers are all over our country, Mr. Speaker, they are a blessing so across the board … These are the best of the best. They are so fabulous … I was impressed by the cumulative effect that they are making on their country. Each of them with their individual contribution to the greatness of America. So exciting, so proud of them … [They have] great humility about conveying their stories because when you see them and they tell their stories and the passion and the pride — the patriotism, passion, pride, patriotism, that they demonstrate, you will see why anyone who has had the wonderful experience of being in conversation or observing our dreamers, understand why they have had such a high reputation among the American people. some of whom have met them, some of whom have heard about them, some of whom have just catch the spark, catch the spark. Recognize, recognize again the hard work ethic, the commitment to education, to community service, to faith, to family, to the United States of America. It's a beautiful thing … Am I not lucky to be able to become so familiar with so many of these beautiful dreamers? We want to send these people back? This talent, this rich talent, this achievement, this determination, this faith in the future, this patriotism for America? I don't think so. We have to make [an amnesty] happen … Let us acknowledge the dreamers and their optimism, their inspiration to make America more American…\n\nDemocrats are trying to revive the establishment's 'virtual fence' substitute for a physical barrier. G.W. Bush and Obama ran that $1 billion scam from 2005 to 2015, but it only ensured more migrants, lower wages, and Trump's 2016 election. https://t.co/ZAQiunXoKl — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 10, 2019\n\nNationwide, the bipartisan establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. whites, Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
The government of Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro this week pledged to privatize as many state-run industries as possible in an effort to drastically reduce the size of the state.\n\nBolsonaro's new Minister for Infrastructure, Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas, revealed on Thursday that all airports managed today by state-owned Infraero will now be privatized, arguing that this would resolve the delay over contracts signed by former President Dilma Rousseff on the roads and at the Viracopos airport serving Sao Paulo state.\n\nEverything that can be privatized will be privatized, de Freitas said. We are going to test in March the auction of the three airport blocks.\n\nMinister of Economy Paulo Guedes claimed that the main priority of the administration involved the reform of the pension system, as well as widespread privatization and tax simplification.\n\nThe retirement system is currently a factory of inequalities, he explained. Those who legislate have the highest pensions, who they judge have the highest pensions. The Brazilian people and young people.\n\nBolsonaro also made a Twitter announcement about his economic plans on Thursday, promising to attract investment on transport systems such as trains, airports, and port terminals.\n\nWe will quickly attract initial investments for around 7 billion reals, with rail concessions, 12 airports, and 4 port terminals, he wrote. With the confidence of the investor in favorable conditions for the population, we will rescue the initial development of Brazilian infrastructure.\n\nRapidamente atrairemos investimentos iniciais em torno de R$ 7 bi, com concessões de ferrovia, 12 aeroportos e 4 terminais portuários. Com a confiança do investidor sob condições favoráveis à população resgataremos o desenvolvimento inicial da infraestrutura do Brasil. — Jair M. Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) January 3, 2019\n\nThe economic reforms are part of Bolsonaro's plan to reverse the calamitous socialist policies undertaken by former administrations. Excessive public spending led to a crippling recession that ended in 2017, leaving millions in unemployment and worsening the poverty they promised to eradicate.\n\nThis change in direction from previous administrations has excited investors around the world, many of whom believe Bolsonaro's leadership could revitalize Brazil's previously sluggish economy. The Brazilian stock market has already experienced an impressive rally since his election last October, hitting a new high of 91,564 points, with some analysts believing it could reach highs of between 100,000 and 120,000 points this year.\n\nAs part of his embrace of laissez-faire capitalism, Bolsonaro has also pledged to push back against communist movements around the world. Last month, the 63-year-old former army captain called for a global coalition against communism, instead urging people to support the wide struggle for freedom, democracy, and free commerce.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
An opinion piece published in the student newspaper at Texas State University this week tells white people that their DNA is an abomination.\n\nYou were not born white. You became white… You don't give a damn, author Rudy Martinez wrote in the University Star student newspaper.\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner, Martinez was arrested in Washington, DC during President Trump's inauguration. Martinez attempted to crowdfund money to help pay his legal fees, raising $1,345 of a $2,000 goal.\n\nWhiteness will be over because we want it to be, Martinez wrote in the column. And when it dies, there will be millions of cultural zombies aimlessly wandering across a vastly changed landscape. Ontologically speaking, white death will mean liberation for all… Until then, remember this: I hate you because you shouldn't exist. You are both the dominant apparatus on the planet and the void in which all other cultures, upon meeting you, die.\n\nWhen I think of all the white people I have ever encountered – whether they've been professors, peers, lovers, friend, police officers, et cetera – there is perhaps only a dozen I would consider 'decent,' Martinez continued.\n\nThe piece was titled Your DNA is an abomination, and ran under a genre header simply labeled, whiteness. A photograph of the column from the newspaper was provided to the media by former student body president Andrew Homann.\n\nThis is blatant racism against white people for nothing other than the color of their skin. She literally states she hates white people because we shouldn't exist, Homann wrote on Facebook. No one is going to stop Rudy from accomplishing what she wants, I guess aside from her lack of intellect. No one is going to take this paper seriously if the editorial board continues to allow baseless garbage to be published week in and week out.\n\nI have no doubt that racism is still alive today. Look no further than this blatantly racist, divisive article posted by the University Star, Homann told the Washington Examiner. While I believe Mr. Martinez has every right to express his disparaging world-view, I am appalled that the school paper, funded by tuition and tax dollars, would give this guy a platform to do so.\n\nOn Tuesday, Denise Cervantes, the Editor-in-Chief of the University Star, published an editorial note about Martinez's column. The column has received widespread criticism from readers, with many expressing that they find the author's ideas to be racist, she wrote. The University Star's opinion pages are a forum for students to express and debate ideas. While our publication does not endorse every opinion put forth by student columnists or guest contributors, as the editor I take responsibility for what is printed on our pages.\n\nThe original intent of the column was to comment on the idea of race and racial identities, she finished. We acknowledge that the column could have been clearer in its message and that it has caused hurt within our campus community. We apologize and hope that we can move forward to a place of productive dialogue on ways to bring our community together.\n\nMartinez's column no longer appears on the University Star website.\n\nThis story has been updated to remove references to Texas Tech that were originally included.
Planned Parenthood has filed a federal lawsuit against South Carolina in the wake of Gov. Henry McMaster's executive order banning abortion providers from the state's list of Medicaid providers.\n\nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic argues that Medicaid patients have the right to choose Planned Parenthood as their healthcare provider, reports the Post and Courier. The abortion facility also contends that South Carolina already has a shortage of healthcare providers.\n\nJenny Black, the Planned Parenthood affiliate's CEO, said Planned Parenthood and its patients are being irreparably harmed by the governor's order.\n\nThe women and men who come to Planned Parenthood for healthcare aren't doing so to make a political statement, she said. Every day that this continues, both (Planned Parenthood) and our patients are irreparably harmed.\n\nBrian Symmes, a spokesman for McMaster, said in a statement:\n\nGov. McMaster ordered (Health and Human Services) to continue reimbursing family planning providers because he recognizes how important those services are. But like millions of South Carolinians, he believes in the fundamental right to life for unborn children and does not believe tax dollars should go to organizations that perform elective abortions, and he will fight this foolish lawsuit with everything he has.\n\nIn his executive order, the Republican governor made a clear distinction between family planning services and abortion.\n\nAlthough the state should not contract with abortion clinics for family planning services, the state also should not deny South Carolinians' access to necessary medical care and important women's health and family planning services, which are provided by a variety of other non-governmental entities and governmental agencies, McMaster said.\n\nFederally qualified healthcare facilities in South Carolina that accept Medicaid as payment and provide more expansive health services than abortion clinics can be accessed at getyourcare.org. Since 2015, such federally qualified healthcare providers outnumbered Planned Parenthood clinics 268 to 2 in South Carolina.\n\nMcMaster also ordered the state's health agency to use funds left over from last year's budget for health care services for low-income individuals in South Carolina. The governor vetoed nearly $16 million for low-income individuals from the coming year's budget in order to cut Planned Parenthood's funding. The excess funds from last year's budget are providing monies for low-income services without funding abortion clinics.
Why, in the last 12 days of his presidency, did Donald Trump suddenly become the authoritarian of liberal fantasies? He sure wasn't an authoritarian for the past four years — he was a spineless wonder.\n\nWhen it came to the wall, bringing the troops home, ending hedge fund managers' tax loopholes and other campaign promises, Trump backed down to everybody: district court judges, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, the de facto president Jared Kushner, trusted Goldman Sachs alumnus Gary Cohn, useless donors, or any two people raising an objection.\n\nOK, never mind. I didn't know I'd have to get out of my chair. I'll just lie and tell my supporters it's already done.\n\nBut this time, it was finally about him.\n\nFor the items on Trump's 2016 campaign agenda, he actually had solid arguments. On overturning the election, he has no argument at all.\n\nThe bulk of Trump's rally speech last Wednesday consisted of the fanatically detailed claims of a paranoid about the election being stolen. The media, of course, have barely covered this part of the speech, since they're determined to suppress all mentions of any oting-vay aud-fray.\n\nNot to worry, media! I'm angrier after reading Trump's full exegesis on the election than I was when you were hiding it from me.\n\nHe cited vote tallies in this and that county, the media's use of suppression polls, constitutional provisions, the precise time of day votes came in, different states' voting rules and practices, the numbers of felons, dead people and illegal aliens who allegedly voted in various states, and on and on and on.\n\nDo you think Trump has any idea how many illegal aliens are in the country right now?\n\nNone whatsoever. Trump knows more about the accuracy settings on signature verification machines in Clark County, Nevada, than he does about DACA.\n\nFor four years, I've been told that Trump couldn't keep his campaign promises because: No one has ever faced such historic resistance! It's not his fault. Poor Trump!\n\nWell, how hard was it to keep his promises compared to overturning a presidential election?\n\nNow that we've gotten a bracing view of Trump's skills as a demagogue, I just want to know: Why didn't he ever use his powers for good? Why did he never hold a rally on the ellipse and ask his supporters to pressure their representatives to fund the wall? To repeal Section 230? To penalize outsourcing?\n\nNone of those proposals is insane. Now that I think about it, they are the exact ideas that got Trump elected. Another plus: Asking his supporters to lobby for popular issues would not have ended with senators and House members fleeing for their lives.\n\nEven as he was goading his most gullible supporters into criminal activity and — in one case — death, he still didn't give a crap about them.\n\nTrump was delighted by the mob he'd unleashed on the Capitol, but according to sources, appalled by how badly dressed they were. He expressed disgust on aesthetic grounds over how 'low class' his supporters looked, one Trump adviser told New York magazine, adding, He doesn't like low-class things.\n\nWhy are the cameras showing only my overweight supporters? Where are the hot women?\n\nYes, these were the deplorables, the left-behind, working-class Americans hanging on by their fingernails, who had bet their last dollar on Trump. (While we're on the subject, please drop the coup talk, media. We've seen the pictures. These weren't exactly Master of the Universe types.)\n\nDemocrats despise them, and Trump uses them.\n\nFor four years, Trump screwed over these very working-class Americans while giving Sheldon Adelson, Wall Street, and McConnell everything they wanted — sometimes things they didn't even ask for!\n\nClose your eyes … Surprise! I'm giving you the West Bank, too!\n\n(I admire Israel's gumption and even wish we could be more like them, but, seriously, did they even ask for approval of their settlements?)\n\nAt the same time, Trump said to the deplorables: Sorry, I guess we didn't have time to get to the wall…\n\nSo obviously, when it came to launching a mad plan with zero chance of success solely to benefit himself, Trump turned to the weakest members of society, the very people whom he had used to get elected and then betrayed. (Trump's best buddy, Benjamin Netanyahu, congratulated Joe Biden seconds after he was declared the winner.)\n\nIn his rally speech, Trump vowed he'd march to the Capitol with them. Go fight that guy! I'll be right behind you. After the rally, of course, he immediately repaired to the White House, where he could enjoy a nice lunch and watch the poor saps on TV.\n\nTrump sees other humans only in terms of what they can do for him. He will ask for favor after favor after favor, no matter how humiliating or burdensome, but the moment someone says no, will viciously attack him. Ask Jeff Sessions.\n\nThus, Trump came up with the manifestly insane idea that his vice president, Mike Pence, should refuse to certify the electoral votes. All Vice President Pence has to do, Trump said at the rally, is send it back to the states to recertify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people. It's even good for me, too!\n\nOn and on he went: So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he's listening to.\n\nThe vice president, not being a lunatic, had already declined Trump's very special offer — limited time only! — earlier that morning. Trump was setting up his supporters to be furious with Pence when they got to the Capitol and realized he had not awarded the election to Trump.\n\nAt 2:24 p.m., as Trump watched the mob streaming through the Capitol, he tweeted: Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution … Whereupon, some in the crowd began chanting, Hang Mike Pence!\n\nTrump never called to find out if Pence and his family were safe.\n\nFor 48 hours, Trump didn't lower the White House flag to half-mast in honor of Brian Sicknick, the Trump-supporting Capitol Hill Police officer who died from injuries sustained during the siege. The guy could at least have worn a decent shirt. Nor did he call Sicknick's family. Pence did.\n\nSometimes you get the feeling Trump's not really thinking about other people.\n\nThe reason Trump was a lazy, feckless coward for the past four years was that, once it got him elected, he didn't see how the MAGA agenda did anything for him. And the reason he became a whirling dervish of demagogic activity last week was that it was all about him.
Top industry bosses from Britain to Asia have seen staggering salary increases over the past several years, while worker wages in their respective countries have continued to lag far behind.\n\nLeading the pack in the United Kingdom is Britain's Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, the world's largest advertising company. Sorrell took home $90 million in salary and bonus in 2015 — up from his $65 million haul from the year before.\n\nThere is apparently no end yet in sight for the rise and rise of chief executive pay packages, said High Pay Centre director, Stefan Stern. In spite of the occasional flurry from more active shareholders, boards continue to award ever larger amounts of pay to their most senior executives.\n\nStern's outfit published its annual survey, earlier this month, on earnings at the Financial Times Stock Exchange's top 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe largest public companies in London earned an average of $7 million last year and have benefitted from a 10 percent pay raise while wages in the rest of the economy have declined.\n\nThe trend has extended beyond Great Britain's borders.\n\nCEOs in Japan — where 80 percent of the highest-paid executives are from other countries — take home about 67 times more than the average worker. The typical Australian CEO makes 93 times more.\n\nThe average salary of CEOs in India has doubled over the last two years.\n\nTop executives in the U.S. have seen similar salary inflation while worker wages have stagnated.\n\nAt McDonald's in 2014, the CEO to average worker pay ratio was 644 to 1, according to a Bloomberg News analysis.\n\nA 2016 report by Lawrence Mishel and Jessica Schieder of the Economic Policy Institute said CEOs from the 350 largest U.S.-based companies by sales took home an average of 276 times what the average worker at their company earns.\n\nDecades before the current rise in worldwide globalism, the United States Congress passed an Internal Revenue Service rule requiring all salaries above $1 million to be deemed as performance-based, forcing corporate tax deductions to kick in. Instead of slashing corporate pay, the law led to a rise in salaries. Companies, advised by high-priced consultants, began giving out stock options tied to performance-based goals that paved the way to the wide pay gap in today's global workforce, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nToday, from a maximum wage proposal to a push to raise the federal minimum wage, there's seemingly more makeshift solutions to the problem than there is political will to solve it.\n\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson.
The Algemeiner reports: JNS.org – The French government has denied a controversial report regarding a secretive department within the French Finance Ministry that allegedly targets Jews for tax evasion. France's General Directorate of Public Finance (DGFiP) stated that it categorically denies the completely unfounded assertions released today in the Globes newspaper, about the creation of a French tax department specializing in French Jews.\n\nThere is no such structure within the French tax administration. The French tax law forbids any distinction between people based on their origin, place of residence, nationality or religion, DGFiP added.\n\nThe denial came after the Israeli financial news outlet Globes reported last week that a one of a kind investigative department in France's Finance Ministry had 20 Hebrew-speaking employees and was in the process of hiring additional workers. The employees in the department were purportedly experts in Israeli law and able to discern whether or not French Jews were using Israel as a tax haven.\n\nRead more here.
In a column for the Hollywood Reporter, Senior Editor Eriq Gardner notes that Hollywood's major film industry players — who have often been the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump and his administration's policies — could actually be among the greatest beneficiaries of the president's proposed tax cuts.\n\nFrom the Hollywood Reporter:\n\nIf Donald Trump gets his way on tax reform, Hollywood actors, directors, and writers stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries. Understanding why takes some appreciation of the fact that the entertainment industry isn't just five big corporations, but also thousands of smaller ones — almost all incredibly obscure even if their owners are quite famous.\n\nAs the tax code currently stands, the richest individuals pay almost 40 percent on individual income (or less after deductions). Businesses pay a separate rate, which Trump wishes to set at 15 percent. Most importantly, the proposal outlined by the Trump Administration has this latter rate being applied to all businesses, including pass-through organizations like S corporations that distribute a salary to employee-owners and count the rest as profits. Under the current law, personal income and business income is taxed roughly the same, but if Trump succeeds, many folks may aim to establish mini-corporations for themselves to get their taxes down to 15 percent.\n\nGuess what? Many in Hollywood are largely set up already thanks to loan-out corporations that contract out services like acting and directing to production studios. Alas, alongside the 21st Century Fox's and Time Warner's come Kaling International (Mindy Kaling), Kimsaprincess Inc. (Kim Kardashian), Snooker Doodle (Emily Deschanel), Rogue Marble (Sylvester Stallone) and so forth.\n\n…
On Thursday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Special Report, Vice President Mike Pence stated of the Obamacare replacement bill, I think we're going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we're all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we've replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people's choices and giving states more flexibility, then that's where we're headed.\n\nPence said, [T]he legislation introduced this week in the House begins that process [of repealing and replacing Obamacare]. We're open and talking about ways we can improve that bill, but that combined with administrative action by the secretary of Health and Human Service,s and ultimately by, likely additional legislation, will get us to a point before we get to the spring this year where Obamacare will be gone, and it will be replaced with the kind of healthcare system that gives the American people more choices in their health insurance and gives states more freedom and more flexibility to provide Medicaid in the best way they see fit for our most vulnerable.\n\nWhen asked about objections to the repeal and replace in three phases, Pence responded, I think they can count on President Trump's going to be a man of his word. And the president made a commitment to not only repeal Obamacare, but to replace it with the kind of reforms that would allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines, the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance, and by giving states the flexibility to implement reforms in Medicaid a little bit like we did in the state of Indiana, where those programs will better serve our most vulnerable citizens.\n\nHe further stated, in response to a question the bill can be changed, I think we're going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we're all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we've replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people's choices and giving states more flexibility, then that's where we're headed.\n\nPence was then asked, So, eventually it's going to come down to that binary choice. And you're going to expend political capital to make sure it gets across the finish line?\n\nHe answered, President Donald Trump is a man of his word. … [H]e decided, the day after the election Bret, that that number one priority, the first priority of the Congress when they came back, is to keep his word to repeal and replace Obamacare. And we're going to make sure it happens.\n\nHe concluded, The central element of the president's vision for healthcare reform is to expand to a national marketplace, to allow the American people to purchase health insurance across state lines. … The president and I envision an American healthcare economy where people literally have hundreds or even thousands of health insurance products, not ordered by the government, but that they can choose from, and have some assistance from the government through tax credits and other ways to participate.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
President Trump called out Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos on Twitter, Sunday, referring to the billionaire as Jeff Bozo in a post to Twitter.\n\nSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post, President Trump declared.

A Kansas man has requested that an Iowa court grant his motion for a trial by combat to settle a custody dispute with his ex-wife and her attorney on the battlefield.\n\nDavid Ostrom, 40, of Paola, Kansas, has cited in court documents that his ex-wife, Bridgette Ostrom, 38, of Harlan, Iowa, has destroyed (him) legally, the Des Moines Register reported Monday.\n\nThe Carroll Times-Herald reported that Ostrom filed a request with the Iowa District Court in Shelby County to give him 12 weeks to source or forge Japanese swords used in battle.\n\nTo this day, trial by combat has never been explicitly banned or restricted as a right in these United States, Ostrom argues in court records, adding that it was used as recently as 1818 in British Court.\n\nOstrom told the Register that he got the idea for the duel after he learned about a 2016 New York Supreme Court case in which New York Supreme Court Justice Philip Minardo said that duels had not been abolished under state law.\n\nOstrom said the motion began when he became frustrated with his ex-wife's attorney, Matthew Hudson, saying he wanted to take the fight to the field of battle where (he) will rend their souls from their corporal bodies.\n\nHudson filed a resistance to Ostrom's trial by combat motion by doing a little spelling check.\n\nSurely (Ostrom) meant 'corporeal' bodies which Merriam Webster defines as having, consisting of, or relating to, a physical material body, the attorney wrote. Although (Ostrom) and potential combatant do have souls to be rended, they respectfully request that the court not order this done.\n\nHudson argued that a duel could end in one or both parties dying, which could outweigh custody and property tax issues.\n\nIt should be noted that just because the U.S. and Iowa constitutions do not specifically prohibit battling another person with a deadly katana sword, it does prohibit a court sitting in equity from ordering same, Hudson wrote.\n\nThe Iowa attorney also asked that the court take away Ostrom's visitation rights and make him undergo court-ordered psychotherapy.\n\nOstrom later admitted to misspelling the word but argued that he did not have any mental health issues.\n\nThe court has not made a decision on either party's motions.\n\nIn modern times, the right to trial by combat has been struck down in other courts around the world. In a 2003 case in the United Kingdom, a court ruled against a man who wished to invoke a trial by combat to settle a £25 fine for a minor motor vehicle offense, the Telegraph reported.
Foxconn Technology had big plans to build television displays in Wisconsin.\n\nThen the price of televisions in the United States crashed.\n\nFoxconn said Wednesday that it is rethinking its ambitious plans to build LCD displays in a factory in Wisconsin. In an interview with Reuters, a Foxconn executive said the company would instead use the site for research purposes rather than manufacturing.\n\nThe compaany said it remains committed to the project, the creation of 13,000 jobs and to our long-term investment in Wisconsin. But because the global market environment that existed when the project was first announced in 2017 has shifted, this has necessitated the adjustment of plans for all projects, including Wisconsin.\n\nFoxconn did not provide details about what global market changes had impacted its plans.\n\nMedia reports have cited tight labor markets and higher wages in the U.S. Manufacturing labor costs, however, are up just over 2 percent for the year.\n\nLouis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn CEO Terry Gou, told Reuters in a story published Wednesday that it is scaling back and possibly shelving plans to build liquid crystal display panel screens.\n\nIn terms of TV, we have no place in the U.S., Woo told Reuters. We can't compete.\n\nThe biggest challenge to its original plan to invest $10 billion to build a 22-million square foot liquid-crystal display panel plant is not labor costs in the U.S. What has changed is that the prices of televisions have undergone a stunning decline.\n\nCompared with a year ago, television prices have declined 18.6 percent, according to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThat makes it much harder to turn a profit while paying workers in the U.S.\n\nThere's no ready explanation for the decline in television prices. Industry experts say a slowdown in housing may be playing a role, although the price drop has been so steep that the housing market's woes seem insufficient. Some, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have said it is possible foreign manufacturers are illegally dumping televisions on the U.S. market at cut-rate prices.\n\nFoxconn is based in Taiwan but does the bulk of its manufacturing, including making Apple's iPhones, in China. It is the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer and the largest private employer in China.\n\nThe much-ballyhooed facility was heralded by President Donald Trump and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to return manufacturing to the Midwest and the United States. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers has criticized the tax incentives offered to Foxconn as too generous.\n\nAmerica is open for business more than it has ever been open for business. Made in the USA: It's all happening and it's happening very, very quickly, Trump said in June after visiting the Foxconn site. Today we're seeing the results of the pro-America agenda. America First, Make America Great Again. Greatest phrase ever used in politics, I suspect.\n\nEvery step of the way Foxconn has overpromised and under-delivered, said Democratic Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz in a statement. This news is devastating for the taxpayers of Wisconsin. We were promised manufacturing jobs. We were promised state of the art LCD production. We were promised a game-changing economic opportunity for our state. And now, it appears Foxconn is living up to their failed track record in the U.S. — leaving another state and community high and dry.\n\nThe president of Wisconsin's Technology Council, Tom Still, said he's not surprised that Foxconn wants to change course since televisions are becoming less expensive and iPhone sales are declining.\n\nStill, a supporter of the project, noted the company has already invested as much as $200 million in Wisconsin so he's not worried that the company might pull out.\n\nI do think that it's likely that they'll adjust to what the market conditions are, said Still, whose group nurtures tech in Wisconsin and advises state leaders on policy.\n\n–The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Less than a year after Massachusetts voters approved legalizing marijuana and taxing it at a rate of 12 percent, lawmakers already seek a larger take of the dealer's cut.\n\nIn shifting marijuana from decriminalized to legal status, voters permitted a maximum tax of 12 percent on sales of the sweet leaf. Seven months later, the state legislature seeks to grab more of pot profits by permitting taxes as high as 28 percent.\n\nIt's not as though those in the reefer business didn't see the state coming for their business.\n\nNine years ago, I sat down with two longtime pot dealers in the Beacon Hill Pub a short walk from where the Great and General Court does business. The sixtysomething sinsemilla sectaries viewed legalization as a way to corporatize a mom-and-pop enterprise.\n\nShould it be legal? Yes. Do we want it legal? No, declared cue-balled Charlie, dealing for decades within eyeshot of the state capitol. Mark, sporting a Pancho Villa mustache, informed, Every time I go over to Hempfest, I chant: 'Keep Marijuana Illegal.\n\nAt the time, a pot legalization proposal sought to impose a $150-an-ounce tax on the low-grade marijuana most commonly bought and smoked. In effect, the proposal aimed to double the price of a joint. This go-around, the proposed law allows for an end-around on the taxes by smokers using medical marijuana, which the bill exempts from the proposed taxation.\n\nIf you had to pay the licensing fee, it wouldn't necessarily be cost prohibitive, Mark explained. But with the taxes, your clientele is going to disappear. A lot of people would just balk at paying that.\n\nApart from raising taxes, the 48-page omnibus bill currently before the Great and General Court seeks to expand a cannabis board to five members, prohibit localities from enforcing laws against the transportation or delivery of pot, maintain a database on people using medical marijuana, and seize weed from those, such as Charlie and Mark, not given the state's imprimatur to sell. The proposed law authorizes investigations and audits of the pot dispensaries. It imposes stringent testing on the product. And it directs the authorized marijuana dealers to abide by an affirmative action program in hiring.\n\nFor pot dealers not keen on turning over their profits to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or eager to undergo annual audits, the law establishes a division of cannabis enforcement in the attorney general's office regarding a product that voters just legalized and long ago decriminalized.\n\nIronically, veteran dealers such as Mark and Charlie face a government more eager to put them out of business now than when they peddled an illegal product as consumers may boost their business by more enthusiastically turning to their cheaper, black-market pot.\n\nThe more than 54 percent who voted to legalize marijuana in November's election authorized a tax of no more than 12 percent. The 28 percent tax represents a 133 percent increase over the initial rate. Legislators seek to hold a vote on Thursday. Smoking citizens may counter by voting with their wallets.
Officials from the Treasury and the Department for Exiting the European Union have made contact with the City to discuss the best way to sever ties with the political bloc before the Government triggers Article 50.\n\nMeetings have been held between the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and top business lobby groups including the British Bankers' Association, the Confederation of British Industry, and City of London on how best to exit the European Union (EU), with officials wanting to draw up a plan of action before Article 50 is triggered, the Daily Express reported.\n\nThey have also had input from David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, who has been dubbed Minister for Brexit.\n\nThe Department has said: We are in the process of consulting various stakeholders, including the City of London, to ensure our approach will get the best deal for Britain.\n\nIt has been reported that officials have discussed the issue of passporting rights, which allow UK-based banks to set up branches in countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Talks have revealed a willingness among some top figures to abandon passporting, despite early calls to stay in the single market.\n\nMark Boleat has said: It's no good having a wish list that's not realistic – that's not what the Government wants. What it wants to know is: does Brexit mean the loss of 5pc of investment banking jobs? In which case – OK. If it means the loss of 30pc of these jobs, then what's the implication of tax revenue? Is passporting worth fighting for?\n\nMr. Boleat has cast doubt over the possibility of the UK securing a Norway-style deal to remain in the EEA, saying that accepting the free movement of people and accepting EU rules whilst paying large sums to Brussels would not be politically acceptable.\n\nAnthony Browne, Chief Executive of the British Bankers' Association, has said: We are not calling for membership of the single market – what we want is full two-way access to EU markets.\n\nNews of the discussions came as a survey conducted by ConservativeHome has shown that grassroots Conservative members do not think that the Norway option would not be a good deal for Britain.\n\nA majority of those polled at 69 per cent want a deal where the UK does not remain a single market member, and immigration is subject to full control rather than a time-limited emergency brake. This is compared to just 26% who wanted a Norway-style arrangement with the EU.\n\nNorway is part of the EEA, and apart from fisheries and agriculture, all other rules, including product registration and workers' regulations, are dictated by the EU. Legislation is made in Brussels without Norway's contribution to the decision making.\n\nUnder the European Economic Area Agreement. the Scandinavian country pays annually €391 million to 15 beneficiary states, €447 million a year to participate in certain EU schemes, and well as other smaller contributions – still in the millions of euros – to access other schemes.\n\nIn exchange, Norway has access to the single market – but must have free movement of people, an issue that swung the EU referendum vote in favour of Brexit.\n\nFollow Victoria Friedman on Twitter Follow @friedmanpress or e-mail: vfriedman@breitbart.com
President Joe Biden on his first day on the job axed the Keystone XL Pipeline, drawing the ire of union workers, industry stakeholders, and GOP lawmakers whose states will be negatively impacted by the decision.\n\nMike Sommers, president and CEO of trade group American Petroleum Institute, said Biden's announcement is a slap in the face to the thousands of union workers who are already a part of this safe and sustainable project.\n\nThis misguided move will hamper America's economic recovery, undermine North American energy security, and strain relations with one of America's greatest allies, Sommers said.\n\nMark McManus, general president of the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters, said in a statement:\n\nIn revoking this permit, the Biden Administration has chosen to listen to the voices of fringe activists instead of union members and the American consumer on Day 1. Let me be very clear: When built with union labor by the men and women of the United Association, pipelines like Keystone XL remain the safest and most efficient modes of energy transportation in the world.\n\nSadly, the Biden administration has now put thousands of union workers out of work, McManus said. For the average American family, it means energy costs will go up and communities will no longer see the local investments that come with pipeline construction.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board also responded to Biden's move, concluding that not only is it destructive to the U.S. economy but possibly illegal:\n\nSince 2000 the U.S. has led the world in energy-related emissions reductions as natural gas from shale hydraulic fracturing has replaced coal in power production. China's Paris commitment doesn't require it to cut emissions for another decade. Russia's are set to rise for years. Last November Russian oil giant Rosneft launched a massive exploration project in the Arctic. Mineral resources will remain a competitive advantage of Russia's economy, and will determine the place and role of the country in the world, Russia's strategic mineral plan says. Killing Keystone won't keep fossil fuels in the ground. It will merely strand billions of dollars in Canadian investment and kill thousands of U.S. jobs while enriching adversaries and alienating an ally. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has promised to use all legal avenues available to protect its Keystone investment if Mr. Biden killed the pipeline. [TC Energy] can avail itself of Nafta's investor-dispute settlement provision until June 2022, which would allow it to recoup its investment. The company also has a strong legal case that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress, not the President, power over foreign trade and that Mr. Biden's reversal violates due process.\n\nAnd some members of Congress are fighting back by introducing legislation to authorize the continued construction of the pipeline. Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) said:\n\nIt's only day one, and with the stroke of a pen, Biden has already taken steps to kill American energy projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline which is critical to energy producing states like Montana. This project will create thousands of jobs, generate tax revenue for local communities, promote North American energy security and independence, and it is the safest and most environmentally friendly way to transport oil. We must do all that we can to ensure construction moves forward.\n\nSen. James Inhofe (R-OK) said:\n\nWe came so far during the last administration – from prioritizing American energy development to ending the far-left's war on fossil fuels. The Keystone XL pipeline would create thousands of jobs in Oklahoma and throughout the nation and President Biden's disappointing choice today to revoke this permit will harm the nation's tremendous progress toward energy independence. I am sad to see this decision to continue the failed Obama-era legacy of denying tens of thousands of Americans good, well-paying jobs at the expense of satisfying liberal, 'Green New Deal' inspired interest groups.\n\nIt is a sad day for the future of American energy independence, but I will not stop fighting for legislation and other policies that keep energy costs down and further our energy and national security, Inhofe.\n\n[Keystone XL Pipeline is expected to provide approximately 11,000 direct high-paying jobs and up to 60,000 indirect and direct jobs, generate tax revenue, increase renewable-energy demand, reduce emissions and strengthen North American energy independence, the lawmakers' press release said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com
Tuesday on ABC's The View, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) said it is fantastic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is challenging the status quo, with policy proposals reflecting the ideology of the socialist left.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nMCCAIN: I wanted to ask you. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She was on 60 Minutes this weekend proudly calling herself a radical. And she's promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car should be eliminated within the next eleven years. Everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly and this ideology of the socialist left could splinter your party?\n\nHARRIS: No. You know, I think she's challenging the status quo. I think that's fantastic. I think that. You know, I used to teach, before, especially before, the last few years. And the thing I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it's good for the party. I frankly think it's good for the country. Let's look at the bold ideas. And I'm eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend the status quo, then do it. If there's not merit, let's explore new ideas.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) on Thursday called on Congress to investigate Robinhood's decision to restrict purchases of GameStop shares after Reddit users sent the stock soaring this week.\n\nWe need an investigation into RobinhoodApp's decision and who influenced that, Khanna wrote on Twitter. And this shows the need for a financial transaction tax on hedge fund shorting and SEC regulations on short selling practices.\n\nYes @aoc. We need an investigation into RobinhoodApp's decision and who influenced that. And this shows the need for a financial transaction tax on hedge fund shorting and SEC regulations on short selling practices. https://t.co/mYX8Ab3JwH — Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) January 28, 2021\n\nKhanna's comment came in response to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) expressing support for the House Committee on Financial Services to hold a hearing on Robinhood's actions.\n\nWe now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit. As a member of the Financial Services Cmte, I'd support a hearing if necessary, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\n\nAdditionally, Senate Republicans such as Ted Cruz (TX) and Mike Lee (UT) also signaled their support in getting to the bottom of Robinhood's stock trading restrictions.\n\nWe should investigate, Lee said.\n\nRobinhood and other retail brokerages are taking steps to tamp down the speculative frenzy surrounding companies such as GameStop, but the actions only sparked more volatility and an outcry from users of the platforms and some members of Congress that small investors are being treated unfairly.\n\nGameStop stock has rocketed from below $20 earlier to close around $350 Wednesday as a volunteer army of investors on social media challenged big institutions who had placed market bets that the stock would fall.\n\nThe action was even wilder Thursday: The stock swung between $112 and $483. At midday it was down 27% at $255.\n\nRobinhood said Thursday investors would only be able to sell their positions and not open new ones in some cases, and Robinhood will try to slow the amount of trading using borrowed money.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
More than 20 Manhattan investigators from the district attorney's office raided the offices of Newsweek magazine and its parent company IBT Media on Thursday, reports say.\n\nInvestigators were seen photographing Newsweek's servers, but it appeared at the time that no files were downloaded, according to the New York Post.\n\nOne source said that the investigators were paying special attention to the serial numbers on the servers.\n\nEmployees initially reported that the investigators were from the New York Police Department, but a department spokesman said the NYPD was not involved in the raid.\n\nLast month, the IRS placed a $1.2 million tax lien against Etienne Uzac, co-founder of IBT Media, owner of the magazine. IBT purchased Newsweek in 2013 after it had announced the end of its print edition. Under its new owners, the magazine reemerged as a print edition in 2014. the magazine's home offices double as IBT Media HQ.\n\nNeither Newsweek, its owners, nor the Manhattan DA's office have issued any statement about Thursday's raid.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.
Americans in the market for luxury homes are searching in the French Riviera because of President Trump, according to a real estate expert.\n\nWhile many Americans are also looking to buy properties overseas because of a strong dollar and low interest rates, one real estate expert says that President Trump's election has caused a spike in luxury housing sales, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMy phone started ringing the morning after he became president, and it hasn't stopped since, said Adrian Leeds, a Paris-based real estate expert who was born in the United States and is a regular guest on HGTV's House Hunters International.\n\nI'm signing contracts every single day from Americans who are either getting the hell out of Dodge or are thinking that they need backup homes. There are people who have profited from the stock market, and they don't know what effect Trump's going to have going forward, so they're looking for somewhere to put their money, Leeds added.\n\nFor prospective home buyers in France, there is no residency requirement to own a home there, and there are low property taxes. However, it is also difficult for many Americans to get a mortgage in France, and properties priced at $1 million or more have a higher tax rate.\n\nProperty taxes in France went up by an average of 14.7 percent between 2010-2015, according to English-language French news site the Local.\n\nAmerican homeowners who seek to rent their homes out are taxed on their profits, and people who own their homes for less than 15 years pay a capital gains tax of about 33 percent.\n\nBut despite the trade-offs of home ownership in France, real estate agents say it is a great time to buy property in France.\n\nIt is actually a buyer's market. There are a lot of properties for sale, but it's also a very stable market, said Angie Delattre, who works for a luxury property firm that specializes in real estate in the French Riviera.\n\nSome people have decided to give up their homes in favor of traveling the world. One such Maryland couple sold their house and embarked on a journey around the world in search of a new home after Trump's election.
Chancellor George Osborne has used the death of Jo Cox MP to demand Brexit supporters use more facts and less divisive political debate seconds before comparing UKIP to the Nazis and reasserting his discredited doomsday predictions for the economy.\n\nLook, first of all, I hope because of the tragic death of Jo [Cox] we can have a less divisive political debate in our country, he said on ITV this morning.\n\nAnd, particularly in the last few days of this referendum, we can have less baseless assertion and inflammatory rhetoric and more reasoned argument and facts, he added.\n\nThen, in the same interview, he went on to say that UKIP and Nigel Farage's breaking point poster was disgusting and vile, and had echoes of 1930s Nazi propaganda – himself echoing writers in the Guardian and a trades union boss, Dave Prentis of Unison, who reported the poster to the police for inciting hatred.\n\nYet even fellow Conservative MPs were shocked at how the Chancellor had so bluntly and shamelessly used the good name of the late Ms. Cox for political capital, just 48 hours after her death.\n\nMr. Osborne said UKIP were whipping up concerns, whipping up division, and making baseless assertions that millions of people are going to come into the country in the next couple of years from Turkey.\n\nAdding: That is what we should say no to. And, this referendum vote is a vote on the kind of Britain we want… do we want a meaner, narrower Britain that is poorer in every sense of the word? he asked.\n\nFor the remaining days [of the campaign], the people who are undecided in this referendum do want to hear the reasoned arguments and they want to hear the facts, he also said.\n\nAdding: And, I think it's important for people to understand that if we vote leave there is no turning back. It's a one-way door to a much more uncertain world where people's jobs and their livelihoods are at risk.\n\nGeorge Osborne's idea of reasoned argument and facts — presented in the past week — include his widely mocked doomsday predictions for a post-Brexit economy, based on figures from an independent organisation mostly funded by the European Union (EU) and British government.\n\nHis so-called 'Brexit emergency budget' was slammed by dozens of MPs in his own party, who promised to vote it down, as it was effectively using his power to threaten voters with punitive cuts and tax rises if they choose to vote against him.
The president of Jefferson Parish (JP) in Louisiana is facing petitions for recall after refusing to resign his post following allegations that he sent sexually explicit text messages to a 17 year-old boy.\n\nMike Yenni, a 40 year-old married father and lieutenant in the Naval Reserve, admits he sent inappropriate text messages to a teen boy when he was mayor of Kenner in 2015. Yenni did not indicate the details of the message nor identify the boy, reports WDSU.\n\nJefferson Parish Pres Mike Yenni in closed-door meeting with administration. @wdsu details @ 6 pic.twitter.com/Abbbts2QhF — Jennifer Crockett (@CrockettWDSU) October 10, 2016\n\nFBI investigators have interviewed at least four people regarding the sexting messages. Yenni – who has not been charged with a crime – sent sexually explicit text message to the teen after noticing him at a high school event, reports WWL-TV, which continues:\n\nThe youth who received the messages said Yenni, who was then the mayor of Kenner, first saw him at a function at his high school, a local Catholic institution. He said a mutual friend, who was 19 at the time, helped Yenni connect with him. … The friend, who allegedly helped connect the two, declined to be interviewed by WWL-TV. The youth said he and Yenni began to talk on the phone and text one another, and soon, the politician came to visit him at his job at a mall food court. They met in a bathroom, the youth said, and Yenni gave him some designer underwear. They kissed briefly. The texting continued, becoming more explicit over time. The youth provided WWL-TV what he says are copies of the text exchanges that were recovered after they were deleted, on the condition that the station not directly quote from them. Printouts of the messages appear to indicate they came from a cell phone account linked to Yenni in multiple online search engines. WWL-TV called the number in June and got the same outgoing voicemail message, featuring Yenni's voice, as could be heard on Yenni's official parish cell phone at the time. The phone listed on the printouts of the text messages is not billed to taxpayers. According to printouts of those texts, Yenni tells the teen he wants him naked. Days later, Yenni writes to ask the 17-year-old if he's worn the underwear Yenni bought him. Yenni says he wants to see him model it. Then Yenni texts the teen to say he wants to perform a sex act on him that night. The youth, who is openly gay and is now in college, said in an interview with WWL-TV that he wants to expose Yenni's behavior because he finds it disturbing. While the youth was initially flattered and intrigued by Yenni's overtures, he said the texts and phone conversations began to make him uncomfortable, such as one proposing three-way sex with him and the 19-year-old mutual friend. He asked me to go with him to his house in Oxford (Mississippi), the youth said. Records show Yenni owns an apartment there. Also, the way he would describe the sexual things he wanted to do to me. And he asked me to be a secretary or assistant in his office; that way I could be with him and not be questioned. Weeks after the sexting began, in June 2015, the youth said he broke off communication and blocked Yenni's number.\n\nIn a statement from his office Monday, Yenni, a Republican, announced that he will not resign his position because the incident at the center of this allegation is personal and, in no way, does it impact my ability to govern.\n\nI have read with humility your request for my resignation, Yenni said. While I understand your position and your concerns, I have and will continue to dutifully perform the obligations of the Office of Parish President.\n\nYenni continued:\n\nAs I noted in my statement, my actions are regrettable, and I am penitent. I have accepted responsibility for my poor judgment, and I apologized publicly to all parties involved. I did not violate any laws, I have not been contacted by any investigatory agency, especially the FBI, regarding this allegation. I want to put this in the proper perspective. I have been true to the oath that I have taken. I stated clearly that I never abused or misused my powers as a public official and there has been no misuse of tax dollars or public assets. And, I will work harder than ever to prove that good can rise from a bad decision.\n\nYenni is facing a chorus of calls for his resignation and warnings to stay clear of school campuses.\n\nJefferson Parish Council members called upon Yenni to resign, and the school board discussed banning him from their schools. Both the Gretna and Westwego City Councils voted for his resignation. Assessor Tom Capella, clerk of court Jon Gegenheimer, coroner Gerry Cvitanovich and sheriff Newell Normand also called for Yenni's resignation.\n\nU.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Majority Whip, cancelled his fundraiser scheduled with Yenni, citing the deeply concerning allegations.\n\nNationally, the New York Post cited Yenni's bizarre infomercial in which he admitted to the sexting scandal.\n\nMetairie attorney Robert Evans III filed a petition Wednesday to begin a recall.\n\nAttorney G. Patrick Hand III tells Breitbart News he is also filing for a recall drive. In his petition, Hand says:\n\nI don't care about Mr. Yenni's sexual preference (male or female). It makes absolutely no difference to me. However, the fact that Mr. Yenni did this with a minor, regardless of the age of consent in LA (17 y.o.a.), is very disturbing to me and many others. The fact that Mr. Yenni met his victim at an alumni function held by Mr. Yenni's Alma Mater, which is the same school the victim attended at the time (Jesuit High School), is very disturbing to me and many others. Many people believe Mr. Yenni used his power and influence to gain access to the 17 year old boy in question, and that he has used his power and influence to attempt to gain access to other minors. I am being told by members of Mr. Yenni's own family that there is much more to this story than simply sending inappropriate texts to a young man, as Mr. Yenni put it in his recent apology video.\n\nTerri Timmcke, a Jefferson Parish resident who asked for Yenni's resignation at the JP Council meeting and is also a member of the STOP Common Core Coalition in Louisiana, tells Breitbart News, The members of the activist group are all concerned about the welfare of our school children, and so many are sharing information on social media sites and contacting public officials in the hopes that widespread outrage will compel President Yenni to resign.\n\nMy biggest fear is that we, as a society, are now going to accept immoral behavior from public officials as long as it is not technically 'illegal,' she added.\n\nBreitbart News contacted Yenni for comment through his email address but received no response.
Multinational corporation General Motors (GM) sought to import nearly 2,800 foreign workers in the last three years to take U.S. jobs while laying off American workers.\n\nGM will be laying off at least 4,250 of its white-collar workers in Canada and America — with the vast majority in the U.S. — starting next week.\n\nThe layoffs are just a small component of the corporation's mass layoff scheme of 14,700 workers in North America — including at least 3,300 American factory workers. Meanwhile, GM is ramping up production of electric cars in China.\n\nIn 2019, GM expects to stop production at four American plants, including Detroit-Hamtramck and Warren Transmission in Michigan, Lordstown Assembly in Ohio, and Baltimore Operations in Maryland. This comes after GM laid off about 1,500 American workers in Lordstown in 2018, while their Mexico production remained unaffected.\n\nAt the same time GM has been laying off American workers, the corporation has been importing foreign workers from countries like India, China, Brazil, and South Korea.\n\nBlack Monday: GM to Layoff 4K American White-Collar Workershttps://t.co/2seec0UrBv — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) February 2, 2019\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018, GM attempted to outsource nearly 700 American jobs in Warren, Michigan, to foreign workers brought in on the H-1B visa. The corporation also tried to outsource 167 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign workers in Detroit, Michigan, another 154 U.S. jobs in Milford, Michigan, an additional 82 U.S. jobs in Pontiac, Michigan, and about 20 U.S. jobs in Roswell, Georgia.\n\nEvery year, more than 100,000 foreign workers are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program.\n\nLast year, alone, U.S. businesses attempted to outsource nearly 420,000 American jobs to foreign workers, a population that exceeds the total population of Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe U.S. high-paying jobs GM outsourced to foreign workers while laying off American workers over the last three years include nearly 320 electrical engineering jobs, nearly 320 mechanical engineering jobs, more than 220 software developer jobs, and about 66 commercial and industrial designer jobs.\n\nGM even outsourced nearly 150 U.S. jobs at its financial services wing in Arlington, Fort Worth, and Irving, Texas, as well as financial jobs in Detroit, Michigan, and Charlotte, North Carolina. The vast majority of these foreign workers imported to take these jobs were from India.\n\nThe United Auto Workers (UAW) union has launched a campaign urging consumers to boycott GM for their offshoring and outsourcing business practices that is leaving thousands of American workers laid off just years after the corporation was bailed out by U.S. taxpayers and received a massive tax cut.\n\nCompanies like General Motors have an obligation to build where they sell and stop exporting jobs abroad, UAW President Gary Jones said in a statement. After all, we invested in General Motors in their darkest days. Now they need to invest in us.\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported, more than 2.7 million H-1B foreign workers have been approved to come to the U.S. to take American jobs between 2007 and 2017. During that same period, businesses tried to outsource almost 3.5 million American jobs to foreign workers instead of hiring Americans.\n\nAbout four million young Americans enter the workforce each year, many looking for white-collar jobs in the STEM fields. Those Americans' prospects of finding work are crippled by the country's legal immigration process, which admits more than 1.5 million immigrants and hundreds of thousands of foreign visa workers annually.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The New York Times on Friday begrudgingly acknowledged that Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite, the latest blockbuster investigative work by Breitbart News senior contributor and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer, contains building blocks for scandals involving a number of 2020 Democratic hopefuls.\n\nThe Times featured a piece by Nicole Hemmer, who, throughout the piece, charges conservative media with minimizing not just impeachment but the full array of President Trump's misconduct.\n\nBut minimization is only half the strategy to protect Republican control of the White House. The other half is scandalization: an effort to create an air of nonstop scandal around previous Democratic presidents and presidential hopefuls, she contends.\n\nShe directly cites Schweizer's latest book Profiles in Corruption in an effort to build her case but appears to do the opposite, admitting that the investigative work — which contains a number of bombshells on top progressive leaders, candidates and non-candidates, like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Mayor Eric Garcetti — provides building blocks for scandals involving a number of 2020 Democratic hopefuls, albeit with a dismissive tone.\n\nHemmer writes:\n\nThe Breitbart contributor Peter Schweizer followed Clinton Cash, a book that helped spread the Uranium One conspiracy, with Secret Empires, which targeted Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden. Mr. Schweizer's most recent book, Profiles in Corruption, provides building blocks for scandals involving a number of 2020 Democratic hopefuls, like the daft tidbit that Senator Elizabeth Warren's son-in-law produced a film with support from two Iranian organizations. The investors, Mr. Schweizer wrote, might appear at first glance to be innocuous cultural organizations — but they are not. Both are funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government. It may not seem like much, but as the birtherism conspiracy shows, scandals have been rooted in less.\n\nHowever, Hemmer's attempt to equate Schweizer's book to wild conspiracy theories falls flat, as his work contains 1,126 endnotes with concrete evidence stemming from corporate and legal records, lobbyist disclosures, property records, White House visitor logs, tax liens, and federal bankruptcies, among other documents.\n\nBreitbart News has detailed several of the bombshell revelations featured in Schweizer's book, including Warren's son-in-law's ties to the Iranian regime via his production company, Tricolor Films.\n\nIn 2008, Warren's son-in-law, Sushil Tyagi, produced a film called The Song of Sparrows, which was directed by Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi. As Schweizer discovered, the movie's chief investors were funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government.\n\nAs Profiles in Corruption details:\n\nThe full credits of the film, for some reason, seem to also have been scrubbed from the internet. We obtained a copy by using the Wayback machine and made a startling discovery: the movie's chief investors included none other than the social deputy of the State Welfare Organization (SWO) of Iran (SWO-معاونت اجتماعی سازمان بهزیستی کشور) as well as the Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran. (سازمان فرهنگی و هنری شهرداری تهران) These two investors in the film might appear at first glance to be innocuous cultural organizations—but they are not. Both are funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government. The Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran states: This organization was founded in 1996 and [does] its activities under the supervision of a board of trustees composed of various cultural institutions such as IRIB and Islamic propaganda organization.\n\nBreitbart News broke down the revelation further:\n\nThe Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran's page promotes cultural events such as one for school children entitled The Seal of Hostages, attended by several top Iranian officials, according to the book. Another event is the inherently antisemitic Quds Day on the last day of Ramadan. The organization also arranges marches, as well as organizes posters and other materials, for Quds Day. Its site says, A new plan for the destruction of Israel will be launched, and the Quds Cultural Radio station will be located at the Radio Station. Also, the 'I love the fight against Israel' is distributed among the people. Schweizer notes, Quds Day typically features massive crowds organized by the Iranian government chanting 'death to America' and burning effigies, with full media coverage. He writes Tyagi's The Song of Sparrows has film credits that read like who's who of prominent Iranian government institutions. For example, there is a thank-you to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Air Force.\n\nThe revelation is just one of many on Warren, as well as the other prolific progressives featured in the book, as the Hemmer acknowledges in her op-ed for the Times.\n\nI think there's a lot of things about Elizabeth Warren that are troubling, about how she was actually a government consultant in the 1990s rewriting bankruptcy laws, and in a typical Washington move, she took that position and cashed in, Schweizer said during a recent appearance on Fox News's Special Report.\n\nShe basically went to corporations and said, I will consult for you and advise you in how to use the law that I wrote to your maximum advantage, he added.\n\nProfiles in Corruption also contains a number of detailed discoveries regarding the Biden 5, including how James Biden's firm received $1.5 billion in government contracts, despite having no experience, as well as Frank Biden's connection to projects receiving millions in taxpayer loans during the Obama administration. It also examines Hunter Biden's firms scoring business deals with people and entities tied to the governments of Russia, China, and Kazakhstan, as well as revelations on the former vice president's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, purportedly directing $2.5 million from Citizens for Biden and Biden for President Inc. to her own contracting firm during her brother's last presidential bid in 2008.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for forthcoming reports from Profiles in Corruption.
The New York state legislature has passed a new law allocating up to $5 million in tax credits meant to encourage operators of a qualified film production company to hire women and people of color as TV writers and directors.\n\nSenate Bill S4999D passed 38 to 24 on Wednesday and adds an additional $5 million in tax incentives on top of New York's existing budget allotment of $420 million in TV and film tax credits.\n\nPeople in the TV industry have understood for years that enhancing the diversity of writing and directing improves the stories that appear onscreen, Writers Guild of America, East executive director Lowell Peterson said, according to Deadline. The missing link for policymakers has been putting money at the point of hire, and this legislation is an important step in that direction.\n\nThe bill had received support from the Directors Guild of America, whose Eastern executive director, Neil Dudich, said, For years the DGA has pushed the industry to change their imbalanced hiring practices — so that talent, and talent alone, is the defining factor.\n\nBy encouraging studios, networks and producers to discover the talented New York TV directors and writers that are out there in abundance, this bill can be a meaningful step forward in establishing a level playing field for all, Dudich added.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is expected to sign the bill into law, which will allow appropriation of the new funding.\n\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
On Thursday Senate Republicans introduced a measure that would ban organizations from the use of taxpayer funds to promote or refer girls and women for abortions abroad.\n\nThe legislation, known as the American Values Act, is in response to President Joe Biden's executive order revoking the Mexico City Policy, which the Trump administration expanded to prohibit organizations that receive U.S. health assistance funding from promoting or performing abortions overseas as a method of family planning.\n\nBiden signed the executive order despite consistent polling that shows Americans share bipartisan unity on barring taxpayer funding of abortion both within the United States and abroad.\n\nSens. Jim Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Todd Young (R-IN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced the measure that seeks to permanently enact and expand existing prohibitions on the use of U.S. foreign assistance to pay for the performance or promotion of abortion services overseas, a joint press release stated.\n\nRisch said in the statement that pro-abortion groups have set their sights on exploiting loopholes and even overturning the long-standing pro-life provisions of law that have provided a solid foundation for values-based U.S. foreign assistance.\n\nIt is time for Congress to take decisive action and eliminate any ambiguity about how these provisions are meant to be applied, and so I'm proud to introduce the American Values Act to make them permanent in U.S. law, he added.\n\nU.S. foreign assistance is a critical tool of our national security and should not, in any way, go towards abortion or the promotion of abortion overseas, Rubio said.\n\nThe progressive left is working to enact their agenda at every possible opportunity, Young said, adding pro-abortion groups are hard at work trying to hijack those tax dollars not to protect our nation, but to perform or promote abortions around the world.\n\nThe legislation would permanently enact restrictions on the use of U.S. foreign aid to pay for the promotion or performance of abortions, forced sterilizations, or biomedical research related to abortions.\n\nPaul also reintroduced two pro-life bills that seek to defund Planned Parenthood and define human life starting at conception:\n\nThe proper role of government is to ensure that individual rights are protected, the most basic of which is the right to life. Sen @RandPaul introduces two pro-life bills, aiming to defund Planned Parenthood and define human life starting at conception.https://t.co/4wrANMN7ns — March for Life (@March_for_Life) February 3, 2021\n\nAbortion providers like Planned Parenthood will tell you differently, but every single life matters, including the unborn, Paul said in a statement. I was proud to force the Senate to vote on defunding this organization. Our nation cannot expect to fully protect and maintain our other rights if we do not respect the fundamental right to life even starting in the womb.
Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday regarding the potential for a new gun control debate in Congress after the tragedy in Las Vegas, President Trump's tax reform plan, and the federal response to Puerto Rico.\n\nSaid Norman of events in Las Vegas, For this to happen just shows the issues this country has.\n\nTo say that guns ought to be more regulated is just the wrong way, he continued, Now, what ought to be the topic of discussion is the tragedy that took place and how we can help to get God back into the mainstream of public life and it was absent in the killer and anyone that tries to make political hay, again, by talking about gun control, is backward in my opinion.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:
Marc Short, the former top aide to the Koch brothers who is the President's liaison to Congress, will leave as early as this summer, says the Wall Street Journal.\n\nShort is also complaining that he cannot get Trump's agenda endorsed by Congres, lamenting to colleagues the 'diminishing returns' of [his] pushing President Donald Trump's agenda through the Republican-controlled Congress as the midterm elections approach, according to people familiar with the conversations, says the WSJ report.\n\nShort's exit and replacement are important, partly because he is widely regarded as a champion for the GOP establishment's priorities, but not for the President's populist priorities, such as funding for a border wall.\n\nShort is a former top manager for the business donors in the Koch brothers' political network, and he also worked for Vice-President Mike Pence who did not have a populist record before 2016.\n\nShort played a leading role in persuading Congress to pass the December 2017 tax cuts.\n\nSince then, Trump's focus and agenda has turned to more populist priorities, such as a reduction in immigration numbers. The reductions will pressure companies to raise wages and develop labor-saving, higher-productivity machinery, so they are loudly opposed by the GOP donors. Short failed to get Trump's populist immigration policy and border-wall funded in the 2017 and 2018 omnibus bills, or getting Trump's immigration policy approved by the Senate in a February 2018 debate.\n\nThe WSJ reports:\n\nMr. Short's tenure has been marked by ups and downs, reflecting the Trump administration's legislative record. The main legislative accomplishment so far has been the tax package that Republicans approved in December, although some inside the White House have argued that Mr. Cohn and his team deserved much of the credit. But the White House was unable to repeal the Affordable Care Act, has abandoned its push for an infrastructure spending package, and has been unable to find consensus within the Republican Party on an immigration overhaul.\n\nShort has played a lower-profile role in the House debate over immigration reform and amnesty.
Left-wing filmmaker and activist Michael Moore said in a social media post Friday that furloughed federal workers should start a mass uprising and hound Mitch McConnell over the government shutdown.\n\nWhat would a nonviolent mass uprising by 800,000 federal workers look like? Sit-ins. Takeover buildings. Shut down all air travel, Michael Moore said. A human 'wall' at the WhiteHouse. Hound Mitch McConnell so that he has no sleep, no lunches w/ lobbyists. Refuse to show up for work. I'd join that!\n\nWhat would a nonviolent mass uprising by 800,000 federal workers look like? Sit-ins. Takeover buildings. Shut down all air travel. A human wall at the WhiteHouse. Hound Mitch McConnell so that he has no sleep, no lunches w/ lobbyists. Refuse to show up for work. I'd join that! — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) January 18, 2019\n\nThe federal government has been in a state of partial shutdown for over three weeks now in the longest shutdown in American history. Democrats refuse to pass spending for the government that includes money for President Trump's promised border wall.\n\nMoore's social media rants often target the president and Republicans. After the 2018 midterm elections, the 64-year-old said that the only way Republicans win elections is by making it harder for African-Americans to vote.\n\nIt has to feel awful knowing that your side is outnumbered by the millions and the only way you can hang on to any power is to simply rig it/steal it/prevent black people from voting. That is the work of cowards, he said.\n\nMore recently, the Bowling for Columbine creator declared that the GOP tax cut in 2017 was like an act of terror.\n\nAll the Republicans in that photo you showed standing there on the steps with him a year ago today all looking so slap happy and ah, remember it's not just Trump, all of the Republicans, all of them, nobody has had the courage to stand up and say this is wrong, this is un-American, he said.\n\nThis hurts this country. This is— this tax cut in a sense an act of terror because it's going to make the people who are already struggling to get by that much harder to get by.
California is the second-most expensive state to own a car, when adding in the purchase price, taxes, insurance premiums and maintenance costs — and Governor Jerry Brown is looking to regain the top crown.\n\nA new study from the personal finance website Go Banking Rates, reveals that the average additional costs per year to buy a new car and operate it for three years can vary by as much as $2,406 a year, depending on the residence of the consumer.\n\nAccording to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for a new car in America is about $33,543. But there are also six other factors that Kelly Blue Book evaluates to determine the true cost of owning and operating a vehicle in its first three years. Those costs include: sales tax, title fees, registration fees, average annual insurance premiums, annual gas expenses and average maintenance and repair costs. For a three-year period, the average additional cost per year to owning a car in the U.S. can vary by as much as about $3,742 a year.\n\nCalifornia has a well-earned reputation as Taxifornia. Consumers in the Golden State will pay an average of $4,817 per year over the purchase price to own a car in its first three years\n\nBut Michigan is even worse than California, because the state has the highest insurance premium costs in the nation. A Michigander will pay an average of $5,105 per year over the purchase price to own a car in its first three years.\n\nThe cheapest place to own a new car in its first three years is the Live Free or Die state of New Hampshire, where the annual cost is about $2,699. Keeping with its moto, New Hampshire does not impose a sales tax on vehicle purchases and has some of the lowest insurance premiums, maintenance and repair costs in the nation.\n\nSacramento politicians will probably review this story and be appalled that they are not the national leader in cost.\n\nBut as Breitbart News reported, California Governor Brown is already claiming that the Golden State has a $59 billion backlog of maintenance needs on state highways and bridges. He has recently argued: We're going to have to find another way to finance the upkeep of the roads.\n\nThere is little opportunity to raise taxes at the pump, since Californians already pay the highest gasoline tax rate in America at 70.87 cents a gallon. Consequently, Brown has set-up a 15-member commission to study replacing the gas tax with an even more expensive road usage charge.\n\nBreitbart News estimates that the new roadway scheme would cost each California driver about $350 more per year. That would be more than sufficient for the state to regain its title as the most expensive state to operate a car.
Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro addressed the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday, where he declared the country open for business while criticizing the policies and corruption of previous socialist administrations.\n\nIn what proved to be a short keynote address, the Brazilian leader made a pitch designed to excite foreign investors by promising to reduce the heavy hand of the state after years of sluggish growth and an economic crisis that saw skyrocketing unemployment and extensive civil unrest.\n\nI took office amid a great ethical, moral, and economic crisis, he declared. I want to introduce to all of you the new Brazil we are building. We are committed to changing our history.\n\nWe will work to lower the tax burden, streamline rules and make life easier for those who want to produce and do business as entrepreneurs, invest and create jobs, he continued. We shall work to foster economic stability while respecting and honoring contracts … and balancing government accounts. Bolsonaro also spoke of his country's extraordinary natural beauty and declared it his mission to make progress in harmonizing environmental preservation and biodiversity, with much needed economic development. The 63-year-old former army captain also took aim at the left-wing governments that have dominated Latin America over the past two decades but have failed to keep power in recent years with the election of right-leaning governments in Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Paraguay. We do not want to have a Bolivarian type of Latin America, as was the case in Brazil under previous administrations, he said. I believe that this new wave of interacting with South American countries has had a contagion effect – more center, center-right leaders have been successfully elected in these neighboring countries. I believe this is a clear cut response indicating that the left wing will not prevail in that region, which is a very good development in my view, not only for Latin America but for the rest of the world, he continued. Left-wing regimes continue to prevail in neighboring Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba, all of which Bolsonaro has pledged to push back against by forming a global coalition against communism. Bolsonaro's speech was written and revised by his economy minister, Paulo Guedes, a U.S.-educated free marketeer. It reportedly aimed to give the broadest message possible of the new Brazil that is presenting itself, with our arrival in power. The trip to Switzerland was Bolsonaro's first as the Brazilian leader. U.S. officials have previously indicated that he would visit Washington early in 2019 for a meeting with President Donald Trump.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
The European Union Capital of Culture competition has rejected the city of Székesfehérvár after claiming a video presented by the city's mayor showed the city to be too white and Christian.\n\nSzékesfehérvár, which was competing with several other Hungarian cities in the contest, presented a short video to the judges at the political bloc showing why the city should be shortlisted for the project.\n\nAccording to Székesfehérvár mayor András Cser-Palkovics, the committee who watched the film dismissed it as a propaganda film of white Christian Europe.\n\nMr Cser-Palkovics congratulated the three cities that had been shortlisted for the project but said that one of the EU experts said his city's video was a propaganda film of white Christian Europe, everyone is white, happy, dancing in the streets.\n\n'Accept the Will of the People on Migration, Culture, or Hit the Road': Orbán Tells Europe's Leaders\n\nhttps://t.co/bmp36tEsOy — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2017\n\nThe mayor claimed that one of the panel, a Belgian politician, objected to the identity of the application based on the Greek, Roman, and Christian-Jewish cultures.\n\nIn the context of the applications, almost nothing was done, they did not deal with sustainability, funding, and did not deal with programs or investments, but only with daily political and ideological accusations. Just because we take pride in our cultural values. The cross is not only a religious but also a cultural value, and gives it the diversity that makes us proud of Europe, he added.\n\nThe European Capitals of Culture initiative, started in 1985, is touted as promoting the diversity of Europe by highlighting different cities across the continent in an effort to promote a European identity.\n\n'Hungary First': Orbán Vows to 'Fight Those Who Want to Change the Christian Identity of Europe' https://t.co/It6BWyPxDo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2018\n\nThe rejection for being too white echoes a movement across the western world to promote diversity. This has been slammed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who recently called for a patriotic alliance to combat advocates of mass migration and globalism.\n\nThe Orban government has laid much of the blame for the promotion of 'diversity', open borders, and mass migration on left-wing billionaire George Soros and his massive network of NGOs.\n\nThe Hungarian government recently passed a new law that would implement a new tax on NGOs assisting mass migration, which would be used to further reinforce the Hungarian border.\n\nOrban has also been a champion of traditional European culture, remarking back in November that governments should be dedicated to Christian values.
Forbes deleted an article this week about closing public libraries in favor of buying books on Amazon after it sparked a backlash online.\n\nThe article, which was written by Long Island University economist Panos Mourdoukoutas, was entitled Amazon Should Replace Local Libraries to Save Taxpayers Money. The article argued that Amazon could fill the role of local libraries by replacing them with its own bookstores.\n\nAmazon should open their own bookstores in all local communities. They can replace local libraries and save taxpayers lots of money, while enhancing the value of their stock, Mourdoukoutas wrote.\n\nLibraries slowly began to service the local community more, he added. Libraries introduced video rentals and free internet access. The modern local library still provides these services, but they aren't for free. Homeowners have to be financed by taxpayers in form of a 'library tax.' It is usually added to school taxes, which in some communities are already high.\n\nThe article sparked an immediate backlash and Forbes promptly removed it from their site. In a statement, a Forbes spokesperson said that the article was removed because it was outside of the contributor's area of expertise.\n\nForbes advocates spirited dialogue on a range of topics, including those that often take a contrarian view, the spokesperson said. Libraries play an important role in our society. This article was outside of this contributor's specific area of expertise, and has since been removed.\n\nAngry tweets responding to the article's author garnered thousands of likes on Twitter.\n\nI'm a librarian and this is actually the worst fucking idea ever. Libraries by Amazon would eliminate the most important function libraries have—as a socialized daytime service to cash-poor and working class people left behind by digital advances. https://t.co/YqxLgAZQm6 — cyree jarelle johnson (@cyreejarelle) July 22, 2018\n\nAs they are today, libraries are mostly used by folks who don't (or who are denied access to) daytime economies, particularly homeless/houseless folks. There is NO WAY that Amazon libraries would continue to serve homeless/houseless people in this way. — cyree jarelle johnson (@cyreejarelle) July 22, 2018\n\nLibraries aren't just museums for books, people. Real life people come there for information on services to try to often save their lives. Info on doctors, domestic violence shelters, help to get jobs. Stop funding everything that rich folk want and leave libraries the fuck alone — jamey hatley (@jameyhatley) July 22, 2018\n\nIt is unclear why Mourdoukoutas' article and the resulting backlash prompted Forbes to act so quickly. In the age of Internet journalism, bad opinions are often met with swift and persuasive rebuttals. Disagreements are best had when each party has an opportunity to express their opinion. Moreover, it's important that no one fears that the mere expression of their opinion will result in brigading and censoring of their words.\n\nCensorship issues aside, many critics have pointed out that the closure of public libraries would have the strongest impact on low-income families. Paul Guequierre, director of communications for the Urban Libraries Council, explained why this decision would hit low-income Americans the hardest. The communities that would be affected the most would likely be low-income people, immigrants, and, really, the most marginalized among us, he said. [People] don't have to buy a cup of coffee at the library.\n\nAn archived version of the original Forbes article can be read here.
Despite many cities hosting the Olympics facing bankruptcy in the aftermath, a new study by Beacon Economics LLC and UC Riverside predicts that the Los Angeles area would see an $9.5 billion economic boost and generate $4.4 billion in worker earnings if the city is awarded the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nLos Angeles, Paris and Budapest are the finalists to be awarded the 2024 Olympic Summer Games. The winning city will be picked in September, supposedly based on evaluations of the competing cities' vision, governance, games delivery and venue funding.\n\nL.A.'s bid is uniquely structured compared to the other finalist cities, because LA claims it does not need to build any new permanent venues. LA 2024 intends to rely solely on access to existing sports complexes in Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties.\n\nThe economic impact study was conducted by the UC Riverside's School of Business Center for Economic Forecasting and Development to evaluate the viability of the L.A. 2024 Olympic Bid Committee (L.A. 2024) final proposal. According to their analysis, the City of Los Angeles will not lose money hosting the games and will generate additional tax revenues of between $152 million and $167 million, mostly from hotel transient occupancy taxes and incremental sales tax revenues.\n\nThe increase in economic output from the games will also generate the equivalent amount of between 74,308 and 79,307 full-time jobs.\n\nBut the City of Los Angeles will still be at risk for up to $6 billion in spending necessary to host the games. L.A. 2024 estimates it will make a surplus by selling $1.3 to $1.5 billion of Olympics and Paralympic Games tickets; plus taking in $4.8 billion in advertising and sponsorship revenue.\n\nThe competition to host an Olympic games comes after the 2016 Rio De Janeiro Olympic Summer Games that cost about Brazil about $4.6 billion to host and was filled with daily tales of corruption. Ten days after the final ceremonies, Brazil's Senate convicted impeached President Dilma Rousseff by a vote of 61-20 for illegally using money from state banks to bankroll public spending on the Olympics and other boondoggles.\n\nThe 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics was predicted to cost to cost the host $125 million. When challenged on the cost, Mayor Jean Drapeau — famously confident in his management capabilities — declared: The Olympics can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby. The economic flop left Montreal saddled with $1.5 billion in debt.\n\nAfter the estimated cost of hosting the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics doubled to over $11 billion, Greece had to admit to the European Commission that it was entering a public debt crisis. Thirteen years later, Greece is still an economic basket case.\n\nA confident Los Angeles Eric Garcetti claimed as the Rio Olympic scandal was raging in August: In 1984, Los Angeles showed the world that a responsibly managed Olympic Games could add billions of dollars to the local economy and bring progress that could be felt for decades to come — and we're ready to do that again in 2024.
The Ugandan military's heavy presence in the national capital, Kampala, ahead of the country's general election on Thursday evoked a tense, war-like atmosphere, Ugandan human rights lawyer Nicholas Opiyo told Deutsche Welle (DW) on Wednesday.\n\nIt doesn't feel as though the country is going into an election, Opiyo told the German state broadcaster.\n\nIt feels as though the country is at war, he said, describing scores of armored vehicles with mounted guns … patrolling the capital.\n\nOpiyo recently served jail time in Uganda after facing charges of money laundering and is currently out on bail. The human rights lawyer described the government's charges against him to DW as a continuation of a pattern targeting civil society leaders.\n\nOpiyo said many people he knew in Uganda sent their families out of the country or to the countryside after Uganda's army deployed forces to maintain order in the capital this week.\n\nIn addition to increasing security in Kampala, the Ugandan federal government has shut down access to most social media platforms used in the country ahead of its January 14 general election.\n\nThe government has closed social media, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said in a national address on January 12.\n\nMuseveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986, accused U.S.-owned Facebook and alleged foreign actors of arrogance in his speech after Facebook removed Ugandan accounts linked to his reelection campaign on January 11. The accounts were allegedly pretending to be independent supporters of Museveni.\n\nThis is unfortunate but it is unavoidable, the Ugandan president said of the social media blockage.\n\nThere is no way anybody can come around and play with our country, to decide who is good, who is bad. We cannot accept that, Museveni said, adding that he cannot tolerate this arrogance.\n\nThe social media shutdown has hindered journalists' efforts to report on Uganda's voting process on election day.\n\nMuseveni in 2018 criticized social media platforms for promoting allegedly false information in Uganda, claiming young people spent too much time on messaging apps such as WhatsApp. Later that year, Uganda's government imposed a $0.05 tax on social media usage in the country. Since then, many Ugandans have accessed the internet via Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to side-step the tax.\n\n[T]hose who are already using VPNs are able to easily get around this latest social media blackout, DW noted on Wednesday.\n\nSince [Monday], we have been having a problem with the internet, especially those people who are using [the social media tax]. They have found it so challenging but with people who had already downloaded VPN, they are okay, Kampala resident Gerald Sengelo told the broadcaster.\n\nUganda is one of 15 African countries to restrict social media access during elections since 2015, according to data from the privacy protection company Surfshark.
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's (D) push to ban private gun sales was defeated in the Virginia Senate Courts of Justice Committee Monday morning.\n\nThe Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that Second Amendment supporters held a Monday morning rally in Capitol Square while Northam planned speak to gun control supporters mid-afternoon.\n\nOn January 10, 2018, Breitbart News reported that Northam was pushing a ban on private gun sales by seeking a requirement that all gun sales, retail or private, be performed via a background check. This would have required law-abiding Virginians to seek out a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) to do a background check if a private citizen was selling a gun to a neighbor, a lifelong friend, or a co-worker.\n\nColorado already has a similar law and charges a fee every time a background check is performed. In the end, the fee is like a gun tax that raises the sale price for each gun sold without offering any substantial hindrance to high profile attacks in return. High profile attackers almost always acquire their guns via background checks, which is easy to do if one has avoided accumulating a criminal history.\n\nBackground checks look backward, as the name suggests, and where there is no criminal history there is no reason to prevent a gun sale.

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron and the 'Remain' campaign are only targeting one specific demographic to register to vote in Britain's referendum on the European Union (EU), Breitbart London can reveal.\n\nLast week, Breitbart London alleged that the government was spending copious amounts of tax payer money trying to get young people to vote in the referendum, considering they are more naturally likely to vote 'Remain'.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/740269678711431168\n\nDespite the dismissive messages from Remain campaigners, Breitbart London can reveal that in fact, Mr. Cameron is only targeting 18-35-year-olds exclusively on Facebook in order to get a huge voter registration bump in favour of the outcome he prefers: a vote to stay in the EU.\n\nFacebook sponsored adverts, which have accounted for a huge percentage of those registering to vote on the UK government website, reveal that Mr. Cameron is using his own tax payer funded Facebook page to target younger voters.\n\nThis means Mr. Cameron, his government, and the Remain campaign are not only ignoring anyone older than 35, but that their claim to simply be trying to register as many people to vote as possible is a verifiable lie.\n\nOn Friday, Facebook prompted Register to vote.\n\nMaybe coincidence, but here's how voter reg stats changed. #euref pic.twitter.com/ZjOdHfbv3l — dan barker (@danbarker) June 5, 2016\n\nThe screenshot proving the claim reveals: You're seeing this advert because David Cameron wants to reach people aged 18 to 35 who are in England. This is based on things like your Facebook profile information and your Internet connection.\n\nThe ad itself reads: Deadline Extended: You can register to vote until midnight tonight.\n\nThe link takes people to the UK government website which has seen a 2.5 million surge in voter registrations in the past 30 days – higher than at any previous General Election.\n\nAnd while no one has said that people should not register to vote of their own accord, Remain campaigners are hiding behind their extra government funding and the targeted ads by attacking Leave campaigners as being anti-democracy.\n\nA spokesman for the Leave.EU campaign told Breitbart London: The motives behind extending the deadline were already questionable, but to spend tax payers' money in this period targeting young people specifically is beyond contempt. It shows you the depths dodgy Dave and the Remaniacs will go to stitch up the vote.\n\nTraditionally, younger voters are more inclined to vote to Remain in the European Union than leave. Recent YouGov polling reveals that those under the age of 24 are likely to vote 'Remain' by 64 per cent to 18 per cent, with 5 per cent saying they would not vote, and 13 per cent remaining undecided.\n\nOf the age group 25-49, Remain has the backing of 44 per cent of voters, with just 35 per cent saying they'd vote to leave (six per cent would not vote, and 14 per cent are undecided).\n\nThe British government has undertaken a massive voter registration campaign, as has the Labour Party and a number of left-wing, pro-EU outfits such as the BBC, Facebook, local councils, Bite the Ballot, 38 Degrees, the Green Party, and more.\n\nQuestions will now be asked as to why the government is only using tax payer money to target one demographic that benefits the Remain campaign.\n\nCampaigners have told Breitbart London they expect Members of Parliament to demand to know how much the government has spent on total on this blitz. The figure is expected to stretch into the millions of pounds.\n\nFollow Raheem Kassam for more Brexit breaking news
Economist and CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow praised the GOP's tax legislation Sunday on New York AM 970 radio's The Cats Roundtable, saying he has never seen anything like the response by major corporations to increase wages, bonuses or increasing investments.\n\n[W]e are on the front end of a major business investment boom. And that boom is going to carry economic growth faster, it's going to create more jobs, it's going to create more wages, Kudlow told host John Catsimatidis.\n\nHe added, The deficit is going to be much lower. This thing is going to pay for itself inside of a couple of years. … This will enhance America's influence overseas because of our booming economy.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
INDIANOLA, Iowa (AP) — Joe Biden has called for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign to disown what he calls doctored video that some Sanders supporters say shows the former vice president endorsing Republican calls to cut Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThere's a little doctored video going around … put out by one of Bernie's people, Biden told supporters Saturday in Indianola, Iowa, referring to a 2018 speech in which Biden discussed then-House Speaker Paul Ryan saying rising deficit demanded action on the popular entitlement programs.\n\nI'm looking for his campaign to come forward and disown it, Biden continued, pointing to his 2020 campaign proposals designed to shore up Social Security. But they haven't done it yet.\n\nThe video in question, circulated on Twitter by a top Sanders adviser, does not appear to be altered. But the short clip omits Biden's larger argument over how Ryan handled the 2017 tax cuts and subsequent budget debates. A separate Sanders' adviser included a transcript of Biden's remarks in the video clip in a separate campaign newsletter. He added other, more extended video, of Biden as a U.S. senator in 1995 and presidential candidate in 2007 explaining his support for a more austere federal budget, including putting Social Security and Medicare on the table.\n\nThe 2020 campaign flap highlights long-standing philosophical fissures between the progressive Sanders, who has spent decades arguing for a massive expansion of the federal government, and the more centrist Biden. Those differences have come to the forefront as Biden and Sanders are bunched with Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren atop early state polls weeks before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.\n\nResponding to Biden's remarks Saturday, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said, Joe Biden should be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security.\n\nThe facts are very clear: Biden not only pushed to cut Social Security — he is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions, Shakir said in a statement. The vice president must stop dodging questions about his record, and start explaining why he has so aggressively pushed to slash one of the most significant and successful social programs in American history, which millions of Americans rely on for survival.\n\nIn a Jan. 1 tweet, Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels wrote that it is soul-wrenching to have heard Biden say 'Ryan was correct.' He attached a 20-second video clip taken from an April 2018 speech Biden delivered at the Brookings Institution.\n\nPaul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code. What's the first thing he decided we had to go after? Biden continued, leaning into the microphone. Social Security and Medicare … That's the only way you can find room to pay for it.\n\nIt was part of a broader speech in which Biden outlined his economic vision. He previewed his 2020 campaign emphasis on the middle-class, but declared that billionaires are not the problem, an implicit contrast with progressives. The statement that Gunnels highlighted reflects a common Biden argument from the 2020 campaign: that Republicans pushed a tax cut whose benefits are tilted to corporations and the wealthiest Americans, knowing it would balloon the deficits, so the GOP could then justify cutting Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhat I'd do is I make sure that we expand Social Security coverage, Biden insisted Friday when a voter in Iowa asked him about the program.\n\nBiden, like most Democrats, proposes raising the cap on the level of income that is subject to the payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. That cap is set at $137,700 for the current tax year, meaning any income beyond that threshold is still subject to personal income tax, but not payroll taxes. Biden — and many other Democrats — propose lifting that cap to increase the tax revenue flowing into the Medicare and Social Security trust funds.\n\nSanders' camp, meanwhile, maintains that Biden's history is more important than his current proposals. Another of their favorite video clips shows then-Sen. Biden, in the first years after Republicans' 1994 midterm election romp, calling for a more austere approach. When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security, as well, Biden said at the time. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans' benefits. … And I not only tried it once. I tried it twice, I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.\n\nJust as the Biden campaign argues that Republicans would lambaste the Vermont senator as a socialist if he wins the Democratic nomination, Sanders' backers retort that Trump would use the same video clips they cite to harm Biden with older voters who will prove critical in battleground states in November.
TEL AVIV – Fires in nine localities across Israel have been deemed acts of arson and possibly terrorism, rendering victims eligible to receive compensation from state emergency funds for victims of terror.\n\nThe Israel Tax Authority said on Tuesday that fires in nine cities and settlements occurring at specific times were started by arsonists. These include Haifa, where roughly 500 homes were burnt down, and several West Bank settlements.\n\nFrom information received by the Tax Authority, the Israel Police and the Fire and Rescue Services commission, it has been determined that the fires in these locations were caused by intentional arson with reasonable suspicion of terrorist activities, a statement from the tax authority noted.\n\nLosses caused by wildfires and other natural disasters would usually only be covered by private insurance. In these nine cases, financial losses would be considered war damages.\n\nSeveral dozen of the 1,773 fires firefighters battled last week are suspected to have been started by arsonists, police said. Six teenagers from the Arab-Israeli village of Jadeidi-Makr who were arrested last week on suspicion of setting a nearby forest on fire were denied bail on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, police announced that a 28-year-old Arab-Israeli man from the northern city of Umm al-Fahm is to be indicted for arson.\n\nKnesset members have been calling for the government to compensate all victims of the fire in full, regardless of whether or not the losses were the result of arson. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon (Kulanu) announced that NIS 2,500 ($650) will be awarded to every person who is unable to return home due to damages.\n\nSome 75,000 people were forced to flee their homes since the wildfires started last Tuesday, destroying 32,000 acres of land. Most have been cleared to return home but damages are estimated to reach hundreds of millions shekels.
Employees of tech companies in San Francisco, California, can't leave the city fast enough, fleeing for the potential tech hubs of tomorrow such as Austin, Texas, and Miami, Florida. One former San Francisco exec said: what else can God and the world and government come up with to make the place less livable?\n\nMiami Mayor Francis Suarez has been fielding inquiries from top executives in the tech world, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, according to a report by NBC News.\n\nThe report added that the mayor has also met with former Google Chairman and Clinton lackey Eric Schmidt, and the chairman of Palantir, Peter Thiel, among others.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that a big part of the reason why they are moving is that they feel that there is an inhospitable environment for regulation and taxation, said Suarez.\n\nMiami is not the only city experiencing this type of migration, as tech employees from San Francisco are fleeing to other states offering them better opportunities as well.\n\nTech workers living in San Francisco had once believed that the high rent, high taxes, long commute to work, and rude neighbors were worth it if they could live in the epicenter of a boom that was changing the world, reported SFGATE.\n\nBut now, in the wake of the pandemic, tech workers can't flee the city fast enough, as spending months working remotely in other towns has shown them that the quality of life can be higher elsewhere.\n\nTech workers and their bosses realized they might not need all the perks and after-work schmooze events. But maybe they needed elbow room and a yard for the new puppy. A place to put the Peloton. A top public school, noted SFGATE.\n\nAnd so they fled to more affordable places, like Georgia, and states with no income taxes, like Texas and Florida. The report added that the number one choice of relocation for people leaving San Francisco is Austin, Texas.\n\nJohn Gardner, the founder and CEO of the remote personal training startup Kickoff — who fled San Francisco for Miami Beach — told SFGATE that he can't help but wonder, what else can God and the world and government come up with to make the place less livable?\n\nJustin Kan, who co-founded Twitch, tweeted to his followers in August last year, asking them where he should move.\n\nWe're selling our house and moving out of SF. Where should we go and why? asked Kan.\n\nWe're selling our house and moving out of SF. Where should we go and why? — Justin Kan (@justinkan) August 17, 2020\n\nCome to Austin with us. Growing tech ecosystem and Texas is the best place to make a stand together for a free society, responded Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of software company Palantir.\n\nCome to Austin with us. Growing tech ecosystem and Texas is the best place to make a stand together for a free society. — Joe Lonsdale (@JTLonsdale) August 17, 2020\n\nThe report added that there are currently 33,000 members in a Facebook group called Leaving California, as well as 51,000 members in its sister group, Life After California. In the groups, people share photos of moving trucks, and links to property listings in new cities.\n\nWhen people decide to leave San Francisco, they usually don't know where they want to go, they just want to go, said Terry Gilliam, the founder of both Facebook groups.\n\nBear Kittay, the co-founder Good Money, echoed those sentiments, and even acknowledged that some people may find themselves relocating to a place that is more conservative.\n\nThe things that make this city ill are not within my control to change, said Kittay of San Francisco.\n\nA lot of people are choosing to go to places where there's opportunity, he added. And maybe it's a place that is more conservative and there can be an integration of dialogue.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently promised on social media that future Tesla vehicles will have the ability to fly while announcing the same day that Tesla will no longer be producing certain popular Model S vehicles.\n\nIn a recent series of tweets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed that future Tesla vehicles will have the ability to fly. Replying to a tweet in which one Twitter user jokingly implied that Tesla vehicles in the year 2022 will look something like a flying DeLorean car from Back to the Future, Musk stated that the new Roadster will actually do something like this.\n\nThe new Roadster will actually do something like this https://t.co/fIsTAYa4x8 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nPopular YouTube tech reviewer and Tesla owner Marques Brownlee (known by his YouTube handle of MKBHD) replied to Musk's tweet saying that he feels as if Musk wasn't joking in his initial tweet and actually believes that Tesla Roadsters will be flying in 2022. Musk replied that he was indeed serious:\n\nI'm not. Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite over-wrapped pressure vessel in place of the 2 rear seats. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nBrownlee did not appear skeptical of Musk's claim and instead stated that he loved the idea, Musk then said that one of the benefits of this idea is that the Roadster could accelerate at the limit of human endurance.\n\nPlus, you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nWhen asked if the car would be able to drive a quarter of a mile in less than eight seconds, Musk replied: No problem.\n\nNo problem — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nBut a few hours later, Musk returned to Earth when tweeted that Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the popular 75 kWh battery version of their Model S and Model X vehicles, with the 100 kWh battery version becoming the standard model:\n\nStarting on Monday, Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the 75 kWh version of the Model S & X. If you'd like that version, please order by Sunday night at https://t.co/46TXqRJ3C1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nRecently, John Engle, President of Almington Capital, noted that as Tesla manages to fix some of its production issues, resulting in a 13 percent rise in Model 3 car deliveries in the fourth quarter, the company now faces a new challenge — lack of demand. While Tesla has still failed to meet its previously projected production goal of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles a week, their delivery of 63,150 Model 3 vehicles in the fourth quarter was a solid improvement. But as the company closes up a supposed backlog of 450,000 vehicles, cracks are beginning to appear.\n\nAccording to what Engle says are Tesla's reported numbers, approximately 7,000 Model 3 vehicles are being kept in storage and without buyers. This amounts for approximately two weeks worth of vehicles at Tesla's current production rate. Combined with the $2,000 price slash across all of the company's vehicles in an attempt to offset the phase-out of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle owners, and a general drop in Model 3 sales, it's understandable why many investors believe that the coming year will show a lack of demand for Tesla's vehicles. Even as the company plans to expand their European sales, Goldman Sachs sees an imminent lull in demand.
A new report on the state of the public school systems in Obama's home state of Illinois finds they are $20 billion in debt with no end in sight to the growing budget failure.\n\nAccording to a new review by the Chicago Tribune, the massive debt isn't necessarily crushing the state's schools, because the state legislature has passed laws to give schools the power to keep borrowing no matter what, so there is no incentive for the schools to mind budgets. According to the paper, the debt has accrued due to special deals in Springfield that have given districts exemptions so they can keep borrowing beyond limits set by law.\n\nThe Tribune found the state's schools are collectively in enough debt to amount to about $10,000 for each Pre-K to 12th-grade public school student in the state.\n\nAll the borrowing is a drain on taxpayers who have to repay the debt, the paper noted, as well as school budgets that must steer billions of dollars annually to principal and interest payments — money that could be targeted to classrooms. In some districts, more local tax money is collected for debt payments than for teacher salaries and student instruction.\n\nOne public schools official told the paper that if a school in the state exceeds its limits nothing happens, so they just keep borrowing or they go to their representatives and get special set-asides or borrowing deals that sit outside their limits.\n\nAs an example, the paper revealed that one district supposedly had a debt limit of $16 million but last year reached $50 million, as there was no legal curb on its spending.\n\nThe problem isn't just laid at the doorstep of state Democrats, either, as one bill in the state legislature filed by Republican House Leader Tom Cross allowed a district near his home to float $450 million in bonds without having the debt count toward its borrowing limit.\n\nAnother district, Ford Heights District 169, borrowed a whopping ten times more than its supposed borrowing limit.\n\nOf the nearly $20 billion in debt statewide, the Chicago Public Schools account for a huge chunk totaling at least $6.3 billion in overages.\n\nYet, despite the massive overspending, teachers unions in many districts want more. Recently the Chicago Teachers Union launched an illegal one-day strike demanding raises and higher spending in the Windy City.\n\nThe strike was such an outrage to city officials that Chicago Public Schools chief Forrest Claypool vowed teachers would not be paid for missing the school day.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com
An amnesty would generate more taxes for the government and more cheap workers for businesses, according to a pitch from a construction executive and various Koch network activists that sidelines the interests of American employees.\n\nStan Marek, the owner of Marek Brothers, a Houston-based construction firm that has employed many illegal migrants, is pushing the ID & Tax Proposal amnesty:\n\nLet's face it: those 11 million [illegal migrants] are not sitting on their duff. They're working somewhere. They may be working under a fake Social [Security Number], they may be working as an independent subcontractor, but they're working and they've got skills. A lot of these workers working in the underground economy, used to work for [construction company] people like me. They were let go because of ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] audits or Social Security No Matches, or insurance audits or whatever, and yet they're 11 to 12 million people in this country on payrolls sending in about $6 to $7 billion a year of Social Security [payments] that they would never get. These ICE audits have taken millions of people off of payrolls and dumped them into the underground economy where they're working for cash and not paying taxes.\n\nThe fix is an adult DACA: We know it works because it works for 800,000 people, said Marek, who has long complained about the No-match letters.\n\nThis is crony capitalism … business partnering with government to increase its profits [by cutting Americans' wages] while dumping the costs on taxpayers, responded Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. By legalizing the illegal immigrants, the benefit to employers is greater because there's more of the cost of [cheap labor] immigration that taxpayers can be forced to bear.\n\nMarek's DACA refers to President Barack Obama's 2012 award of work permits to roughly 800,000 young illegal migrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. The DACA work-permit giveaway has not been approved by Congress, partly because many millions of Americans are worried about their families' jobs, income, and health in an increasingly elite-controlled economy. It's not amnesty, Marek wrote in 2014. It is a sensible program aimed at identifying people and taxing them for working in the United States. That's the kind of border security we need.\n\nThe corporate demand to hire illegal migrants instead of Americans comes amid a housing boom that could otherwise help pull many sidelined Americans back into jobs and the middle-class. But Marek's video excludes any talk about Americans' current or future role in their own nation's economy.\n\nThe children of migrants are our future workforce, said Marek, as the video shows migrants working in jobs needed by Americans such as cleaning hotel rooms, driving, construction, and laying bricks. The video also shows many jobs where employers prefer to use cheap migrant labor instead of investing in labor-saving machinery. So the video shows migrants cutting weeds with prehistoric tools, milking cows, picking fruit by hand, and delivering food by bicycle.\n\nSeveral investor-funded activists echoed Marek's call for cheap labor in the video.\n\nDeporting illegal migrants would be an economic tragedy, said Daniel Griswold, the immigration policy director at the Koch-funded Mercatus Center. Think of the workplaces that would be disrupted, he lamented.\n\nBecause 95 percent of the undocumented residents in this country are employed, it means that the market can bear it, said Tony Payan, from the James A. Baker Institute at Rice University. I think the immigration system in the United States has a huge gap — we don't have [work] visas for the kinds of workers that our very dynamic economy often needs.\n\nPayan's call for endless visa worker inflows echoes the any willing worker plan pushed by President George W. Bush — and dodges the question of whether the United States should adopt a two-tier society of citizens exploiting powerless foreign workers.\n\nThe video did not mention that companies are free to hire employees away from other companies by offering higher wages and benefits.\n\nThis video sympathy helped Marek and other speakers to offer progressives and government employees a share of the potential benefits from the mass amnesty of illegal migrants.\n\nWe think over half of the undocumented are uninsured, said Ken Janda, an adjunct professor of healthcare management at Rice University. That's a challenge because if they don't have the cash to pay, those costs are shared by the rest of the community. Either tax dollars pay for them, or … those costs have to be pulled out of insurance premiums and insurance dollars from other sources.\n\nThe amnesty pitch was wrapped in a soft-focus video, which portrayed the illegals as the victims, even though the illegals voluntarily enter the United States, break laws, and extract wages away from Americans' labor market. For example, Marek offered sympathy for the poor migrants who accept low wage jobs from construction executives:\n\nThe jefes that run big crews, the labor brokers who violate every principle and law, yeah, they're making a lot of money. But if you take the typical worker out there walking on that truss, that are working as independent contractors, they're living in poverty, most of them. They don't have workman's comp, and if they get hurt most of them are going to just suck it up. If they get hurt, they're going to go to the ER [hospital emergency room]. And if they go to the ER, it's expensive and we have to pay for it.\n\nMarek and his allies repeatedly blamed Americans for not welcoming an uncapped inflow of migrants that would push the Americans out of jobs, cut their wages, spike their housing costs, and crowd their children's' schools.\n\nWe have not given the [illegals] the opportunity or [the] certainty to be able to fully contribute to the country, said Jorge Lima, the senior vice president of policy at the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity group. That is not just hurting them, but that's hurting us.\n\nThis is us who becomes the obstacle, said Robert Sanborn, president of Children at Risk. a Houston, Texas, advocacy group for migrants. I worry about all these kids [of illegal migrants] that could be tremendous economic assets for us … they're always going to be underperforming.\n\nOur legal immigration system has failed for years to keep up with the demand of our economy, said Ali Noorani, the president of the National Immigration Forum.Since there are very few legal pathways for people to enter the country, [migrants] make a decision to overstay a visa, to enter without inspection and hence, we're faced with this population of unauthorized immigrants.\n\nThe video ignored the impact of the cheap-labor migrant workforce on the employment and income of American workers. In 2018, Breitbart reported:\n\nBlaine Taylor, the whistleblower, said the construction industry in California once offered a starting wage of about $45 an hour in the late 1980s. Fast-forward to 2018 — nearly two decades into when illegal aliens began flooding the industry — he now says that wages have fallen by more than half, standing at just $11 an hour.\n\nTaylor continued:\n\nThe reality is that a person that was hired as a laborer in 1988, I paid $15 an hour and within a month if I could leave him on the job alone, he got $20 an hour. If I hired somebody that already knew how to do certain types of labor or certain types of operations, they would get $20 an hour. Now, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. They can't go lower than the minimum wage. And much of that, if they're not being paid by the hour at less than $11 an hour, they're being paid per piece — per piece of plywood that's installed, per piece of drywall that's installed. Now, the subcontractor can circumvent paying them as an hourly wage and are now being paid by 1099, which means that no taxes are being taken out.\n\nMarek's pitch to progressives is the latest example of employers trying to globalize the American labor market so they can hire anybody they want from abroad and break the bargaining position of American workers, said Krikorian. He continued:\n\nThere's not that many unions, generally speaking, but American workers in a tight labor market have bargaining power, even as just individuals. But if the labor market is expanded to include in effect the entire world, then there can never be a tight labor market. It becomes effectively impossible. That puts employers in the driver's seat and takes away any [marketplace] bargaining power that American workers would have, even those who aren't in unions or have any kind of formal organization.\n\nIn a tight labor market, they still have market power [to demand higher wages]; With a globalized labor market, American workers lose that market power, he added.\n\nMany polls show that the public welcomes legal migrants — but also much prefers that new jobs go to Americans first. In April 2020, a Washington Post poll showed 69 percent of Hispanics said yes when they were asked, Would you support … temporarily blocking nearly all immigration into the United States during the coronavirus outbreak? Just 30 percent of Hispanics opposed the border shutdown.
DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron says the European Union needs to reform itself this year to be able to compete with big powers like China and the United States.\n\nMacron said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that more ambitious EU countries must be able to move toward more European integration, even if other European countries don't want to join in.\n\nHe said: The less ambitious should not block the more ambitious in the room.\n\nHe added that countries sharing the euro currency must be able to agree on a much stronger and much fair system. He said EU countries need to coordinate their tax policies because otherwise talents will disappear.
Swedish bank Handelsbanken says Sweden's economy has signs of weak growth and the unemployment rate has increased compared to other European Union member-states.\n\nHandelsbanken chief economist Christina Nyman stated in a press release that the Swedish economy grew by just one per cent in 2019, that she expected the economy would continue to perform poorly this year, and that unemployment would also continue to rise.\n\nSweden is the only country in the EU where unemployment has clearly increased in recent years, Nyman said.\n\nThe economist went on to say that the labour market in Sweden would likely be weaker than both the EU and United States averages in the coming year, and that predicted wage increases could lead to low inflation.\n\nWe believe that economic indicators will start to turn up during the year and that the Riksbank will therefore still leave interest rates unchanged at zero percent both this year and next year, she said.\n\nThe Swedish unemployment rate, according to newspaper Dagens Industri, is expected to sit at around 7.2 per cent this year and rise even further to 7.4 per cent in the following year.\n\nSwedish Municipalities Who Took in Too Many Migrants Face Service Cuts https://t.co/3ZnaxssAfY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 26, 2019\n\nSweden's unemployment rate shows a massive disparity when native Swedes are compared to foreign-born residents.\n\nA report released in October of last year showed that as many as 90 per cent of migrants who arrived during the height of the 2015 migrant crisis and received permanent residency were unemployed.\n\nAnother report from earlier this month revealed that in the 18 to 25 age bracket, close to half of Swedish debtors were migration-background young men.\n\nThe struggling economy has left many local governments in financial peril as costs for services for new migrants remain high and existing unemployed migrants do not add to the already strained tax base.\n\nEight out of ten municipalities will be forced to make serious cuts to local services as a result of mass migration and changing demographics.\n\nSweden: Around 90 Per Cent of 2015 Migrants with Residency Status Are Unemployed https://t.co/G4IhlnXBCx — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 6, 2019
A video of a father confronting Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) about her plans to erase the bulk of student loan debt went viral on Thursday after he questioned the fairness of her proposal and added that those of us that did the right thing get screwed.\n\nA father confronted Warren during an event in Grimes, Iowa, on Monday about her plan to roll back student loan debt for about 95 percent of students who have debt.\n\nI just wanted to ask one question. My daughter is getting out of school. I've saved all my money. She doesn't have any student loans. Am I going to get my money back? he asked.\n\nOf course not, Warren replied.\n\nSo you're going to pay for people who didn't save any money and those of us who did the right thing get screwed? he asked.\n\nMy buddy had fun, bought a car, and went on all the vacations, I saved my money. He makes more than I did. I worked a double shift, the man pressed before accusing Warren of not taking him seriously.\n\nYou're laughing at me, he said. Yeah that's exactly what you're doing. We did the right thing and we get screwed.\n\nI appreciate your time, Warren stated as he walked away:\n\nMy daughter is in school. I saved all my money just to pay student loans. Can I have my money back?@ewarren: Of course not So you're going to pay for people who didn't save any money and those of us who did the right thing get screwed?pic.twitter.com/EXoU2ci2Wt — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) January 23, 2020\n\nUnder Warren's plan, individuals with a household income of $100,000 or less could have $50,0000 in student debt erased. Those with a household income of up to $250,000 could also see some of their debt erased, but a lower amount.\n\nShe also vows to cancel the majority of student loan debt on day one of her presidency via executive action:\n\nWe have a student loan crisis—and we can't afford to wait for Congress to act. I've already proposed a student loan debt cancellation plan, and on day one of my presidency, I'll use existing laws to start providing that debt cancellation immediately. https://t.co/bvhpuQmHH1 — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 14, 2020\n\nWarren says it is nonsense to suggest that the U.S. cannot afford her proposal, contending that her Ultra-Millionaire Tax will cover the costly plan.
Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Sen. Lindsey Graham‏ (R-SC) said if Republican legislators did not follow through with their promises they are dead.\n\nWhen asked if Congress was going to pass tax reform Graham‏ said, ‏If we don't we are dead.\n\nHe continued, If we don't cut taxes and we don't eventually repeal and replace Obamacare then we're going to lose across the board the house in 2018. And all of my colleagues running in primaries in 2018 will probably get beat. It will be the end of Mitch McConnell we know it. That is a symptom of a greater problem. If we do cut taxes and repeal and replace Obamacare it doesn't matter what Bannon does because we'll win.\n\nHe continued, Mitch McConnell is not our problem. Our problem that we promised to repeal and replace Obamacare and we failed. We promised to cut taxes, and we're yet to do it. If we're successful Mitch McConnell is fine if not we're all in trouble. We'll lose our majority, and I think President Trump will not get reelected.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Mike The Situation Sorrentino, of MTV's Jersey Shore fame, is facing up to five years in federal prison after pleading guilty to felony tax evasion, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Friday.\n\nMarc Sorrentino, brother of The Situation, also pleaded guilty to aiding in the preparation of a fraudulent tax return and will face a maximum of three years. Five and three years are statutory maximum sentences; both men are likely to receive much less severe penalties.\n\n\n\nThe charges against the Sorrentinos stem from the concealment of cash receipts from businesses the brothers set up to monetize The Situation's fame. The bothers were alleged to have failed to report potentially millions of dollars of receipts, knowingly failing to file tax returns, and filing false tax returns and strategically depositing the cash to avoid oversight.\n\nAs we approach this year's filing season, today's guilty pleas should serve as a stark reminder to those who would attempt to defraud our nation's tax system, Jonathan D. Larsen, Special Agent in Charge of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division's Newark Field Office, said in the DOJ press release accompanying the pleas. No matter what your stature is in our society, everyone is expected to play by the rules, and those who do not will be held accountable and brought to justice.\n\nAll of us are required by law to pay our fair share of taxes. Celebrity status does not provide a free pass from this obligation, the U.S. attorney supervising the prosecution, Craig Carpenito of the District of New Jersey, added.\n\n\n\nTheir accountant, Gregg Mark, already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government in 2015.\n\nThe plea agreement, which saw the brothers plead guilty to one felony charge each, avoided the much more serious charges detailed in the their 14-count indictment, including currency structuring (continually making deposits under $10,000 to avoid reporting requirements) and conspiracy.\n\nThe Sorrentinos are scheduled to be sentenced April 25 before U.S. District Judge Susan D. Wigenton.
The GOP tax overhaul looks increasingly likely to win enough votes to pass in the Senate after Senator John McCain said he supports the bill.\n\nAfter careful thought and consideration, I have decided to support the Senate tax reform bill. I believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle class families, McCain said in a statement Thursday.\n\nMcCain also said he endorses the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate that is included in the Senate tax bill, describing the mandate as an onerous mandate.\n\nBy repealing the individual mandate, this bill would eliminate an onerous that especially harms those from low-income brackets, McCain said.\n\nMcCain also said that while he takes seriously concerns some Senators have raised about the economy, it's clear this bill's net effect on our economy would be positive.\n\nMcCain's endorsement is a major milestone because it was his vote against the repeal of Obamacare that sunk the GOP bill this summer. His declaration of support narrows the range of issues that need to be resolved by GOP leaders to reach the fifty votes required to pass the measure (with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast the tie-breaking vote).\n\nThe list of GOP Senators whose votes are in doubt now includes just the deficit hawks Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, the small business advocates Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, and healthcare holdout Susan Collins of Maine. Nearly all, however, have expressed confidence that their issues can be resolved in negotiations with Senate leaders.
The value of Tesla Inc. stock plunged by about $5.4 billion over a 48-hour period this week as the company declared a large quarterly loss and finally acknowleded that deliveries of its high-volume Model 3 will be delayed by at least 6 months.\n\nTesla (OTC: TSLA) has only made a profit in one quarter of its 14-year existence, and that was only due to selling federal and state tax credits to traditional auto manufactures and others that actually do make taxable profits.\n\nAlthough Tesla's $2.98 billion third quarter revenue slightly beat Wall Street analysts' estimates, the company lost $671 million, or $2.92 per share. That was twice the-$336 million loss in the prior quarter, and set an all-time cash burn high of $16 million per day.\n\nBreitbart News reported in early October that CEO Elon Musk had announced that Tesla Inc. had its all-time best quarter with record deliveries of 26,150 vehicles, including 14,065 Model S sedans; 11,865 Model X SUVs; and 220 Model 3 economy cars. That was considered a disappointment for Model 3 deliveries, and its stock sold off by 1 percent.\n\nBut Musk emphasized that through physics-first principles, Tesla would shape a new mode of industrial production to improve efficiency by factors of 10 or even 100 times. He said Tesla's key advantage in building all-electric vehicles was limiting the number of moving engine parts to 20, versus up to 10,000 for internal combustion engines.\n\nWith investors reassured that Tesla was on track to ramp up to delivering 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in the December quarter and 10,000 per week in the March quarter, Tesla's stock traded up on big volume to an interim high of $362.55 on October 18.\n\nBut the stock opened at $301.15 per share on November 2 and has been trading down after Musk acknowledged on the company's third quarter conference call that it is difficult to predict when the bottlenecks will be cleared in production of Model 3s. He said he did not expect to be at 5,000 Model 3 units a week until late March.\n\nMusk tried to reassure shareholders that he is leading from the front lines to battle production hell delays. Tesla said the main problem holding up production of the Model 3s were production delays at Tesla's $5 billion Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada, where Panasonic four-battery cell modules are automatically inserted into an aluminum-wrapped battery case. Musk referred to his Instagram post last week where he is having a late-night campfire with a couple of managers on the Gigafactory's roof as a sign of his focus.\n\nMusk did assign some blame for production delays on the Model 3 being more automated, compared to the company's largely hand-built luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. Musk stated that bringing this level of automation online is simply challenging in the early stages of the ramp.\n\nBut he failed to comment on Edward Niedermeyer's brilliant October 30 report in the Daily Kanban industrial blog that Tesla did not give a purchase order to a major automated tooling supplier to develop two Body in White (BIW) transfer lines for the Model 3 early this year. Although car companies normally place fully-designed orders for BIW lines with at least a two-year lead time, and BIW manufacturers almost always assemble and test the line at their factories, Tesla asked for a 4-month delivery and wanted to expedite delivery by doing a risky cold build line layout and quality testing at Tesla's factory.\n\nNiedermeyer added that disagreements between Tesla's designers and engineers resulted in numerous revisions to the scope of the contract and eventually led Tesla to drop the second line from its purchase order. The BIW vendor blamed Tesla's high level of turnover in key positions, which Breitbart News has highlighted in the past. Without the second BIW assembly line, Tesla can never produce 10,000 units per week.\n\nIn another example of Tesla failing to have enough lead time to produce Model 3 units, Panasonic's Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga told Reuters that Gigafactory batteries are still being mostly made by hand. This process (for battery packs) will be soon automated, and then the number of vehicles to be produced will rise sharply. Tsuga declined to comment on how far Tesla Model 3 production is behind its targeted delivery schedule.
With 2018 in the rear-view mirror, some of the world's largest, most influential, and most volatile states prepare to elect their heads of government this year. Below, five countries whose presidential races – or attempts at hosting presidential races – will help shape the political impact of 2019.\n\nAfghanistan\n\nThe government of Afghanistan confirmed this weekend that the 2019 presidential elections will occur on July 20, raising a host of questions regarding the nation's democratic norms and ability to maintain security for voters in light of ongoing, and increasingly frustrating, peace negotiations with the Taliban. The July date pushes the election back from April 20, the original election day; government officials cite security, operational, and technical related issues making that deadline impossible.\n\nAfghanistan will begin registering presidential candidates today, meaning a full list of the candidates is not yet available, though incumbent President Ashraf Ghani will likely appear on the ballot.\n\nWho wins the Afghan presidential election is less important than whether the country can pull off organizing a nationwide election without major intervention by the Taliban. The Taliban rejected yet another call for direct talks with Ghani's government this weekend, insisting that they had gained too much ground to bother entertaining Ghani. The Taliban has repeatedly rejected talks with Ghani because they consider themselves the legitimate government of Afghanistan and Ghani merely a puppet of the United States.\n\nU.S. peace talks with the Taliban could also endanger the election, as reports suggest that the Trump administration is seeking a FARC-like peace deal that would legitimize the Taliban as an Afghan political party. In the unlikely event that such a deal is signed before the election, there is a non-negligible possibility that the Taliban itself fields a presidential candidate.\n\nNigeria\n\nNigeria, Africa's largest economy, held its first successful democratic transfer of power in 2015, when incumbent Goodluck Jonathan lost to former dictator Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari won the presidency largely on his promise to eradicate the Boko Haram threat in northeastern Nigeria, a promise he has entirely failed to live up to despite repeatedly declaring victory against the terrorist group as early as December 2015.\n\nThe 2019 election is pivotal for the future of Nigeria not just because of the prolonged Boko Haram threat, but because it will be a test of whether the 2015 election was a mere fluke or whether Nigeria has fully embraced democratic institutions. Democratic traditions are built over time, and the lack of overt threat of a military takeover or coup d'etat bodes well for the state so far.\n\nDemocracy is so in demand in Nigeria that, by October, 79 political parties had registered to field candidates in the 2019 election. In the regional legislative elections, 89 parties registered to run candidates. Yet the frontrunners remain the candidate for the two major parties: Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). The campaign has already turned bitter – Buhari's campaign is accusing Abubakar of having a sealed indictment against him for corruption in the United States, while Buhari has had to deny that he is a clone of himself deployed to replace the real, dead Buhari. According to some estimates, as Buhari kept some of his medical treatment for unspecified conditions a secret, he spent up to 15 percent of his term abroad receiving healthcare.\n\nArgentina\n\nArgentina was the first major country in the Americas to turn rightward after the early 21st-century wave of leftist presidents took over the region – including the United States, as former Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri took over the country before President Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Macri won his election largely in response to the tremendous backlash against leftist predecessor Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's ties to the Venezuelan dictatorship and Iran's Islamic theocracy in the aftermath of the suicide of the prosecutor investigating Iranian terrorism in Argentina, Alberto Nisman.\n\nDespite running as a pro-business candidate, Macri's biggest challenge in 2019 will be justifying the languishing status of his nation's economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently gave Argentina a $56 billion credit line to fix its recession, the largest ever, which only exacerbated concerns that the Argentine peso's value is about to plummet. The economic situation has deteriorated to a point that speculation has begun that Kirchner will attempt to reclaim the presidency from Macri despite an ongoing corruption investigation and the still-unresolved status of the Nisman murder.\n\nIt is impossible to fully assess the status of the Argentine election until candidates, Kirchner in particular, confirm their running status. Whoever confronts Macri, however, will have to navigate residual bitterness from the Kirchner presidency – and fear of becoming another Venezuela under yet more socialist rule – to adequately use Macri's woeful economy against him.\n\nCanada\n\nCanada's is not technically a presidential election, but the nation will choose its head of government in October 2019 through its parliamentary elections, granting the nation a chance to review the record of leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trudeau will face off against Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer and Jagmeet Singh of the New Democratic Party, attempting to run on issues such as environmental regulation and regional trade.\n\nConservatives appear eager to discuss environmental regulation under Trudeau; this summer, Scheer spelled out the Carbon Tax! in black marker on a white plate, donned safety glasses, and smashed it in a gleeful if somewhat cheesy performance of the traditional Greek celebration at a political event. In parts of Canada dependent on the energy industry for its economy, Trudeau is highly unpopular, facing boos even at the peak of his popularity nationwide.\n\nTrudeau is also running as a sort of anti-Trump for the region, repeatedly referencing the alleged polarization of the Western political climate and how embracing leftist policies can temper its effect. The campaign, for now, appears to be working, though not by much – early polls show Trudeau's Liberals with a four-point lead over the Conservatives, whose major challenge will be Scheer's relatively lackluster name recognition.\n\nBolivia\n\nFew doubt that longtime socialist leader Evo Morales will win Bolivia's 2019 presidential election, scheduled to take place in October. What makes this election interesting is the growing concern that it will neither be free nor fair, as Morales should not legally be allowed to appear on the ballot in the first place.\n\nBolivia held a referendum on term limits in 2016, and the people spoke clearly: they did not want Morales to have the ability to run for yet another turn. Morales responded to this news by turning to the nation's Supreme Court, which ruled in December that, despite the referendum, Morales' name should appear on the ballot. If he wins, Morales will begin his fourth term in office.\n\nOpponents call the Supreme Court move a slow-motion coup and organizers have planned protests attended by thousands against Morales. Morales is currently facing five official opponents, the most prominent of which is former president Carlos Mesa, who has made the questionable legality of the Supreme Court ruling a key issue in his campaign.\n\nThe two biggest questions this election poses are whether Mesa can effectively unite the anti-Morales opposition and, in the case that he does, whether Morales' government will allow a free and fair vote, anyway.
Starting this year, the Hungarian government is set to offer free in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures for couples wanting children in order to boost the national birthrate to 2.1 children by 2030.\n\nThe Hungarian government has taken control of six private fertility clinics and plans to purchase new buildings in order to meet demands of the estimated 150,000 couples across the country who have fertility issues but want to have children, La Croix reports.\n\nPreviously, IVF procedures were largely out of reach for many Hungarian couples due to the costs associated with the procedure, but now the pro-family government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is planning to give all couples free access.\n\nSecretary of State for the Family Katalin Novák commented on the new measures saying: If all couples who want a child manage to have a baby, Hungary will no longer have demographic problems.\n\nHungary currently faces a demographic winter if trends are not reversed, with the population expected to decline from the current 9.7 million to six million by the year 2070.\n\nHungarian Government Will Give $33,000 Bonus to Married Couples Who Have Three Children https://t.co/twV072eq7e — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 1, 2019\n\nOther nations have largely relied on mass migration to counter demographic trends and ageing populations but the Orbán government has, instead, adopted arguably the most pro-family policies in the world in order to avoid turning to migration to reverse population decline.\n\nAmong the policies adopted by the government last year has been a 30,000 euro loan to couples which is completely forgiven if they have three children. Hungary has also introduced tax breaks for families as well as extending daycare options or an allowance for elderly relatives who care for children.\n\nAnother programme will also see women with four or more children becoming exempt from income taxes for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn our minds, immigration means surrender, Prime Minister Orbán said last year, and added: If we resign ourselves to the fact that we are unable to sustain ourselves even biologically, by doing so we admit that we are not important even for ourselves.
The homeless population in New York City has reached an all-time high.\n\nNew York City's Department of Homeless Services said 60,252 people remain homeless, up 200 in two weeks, CBS New York reports.\n\nIt's definitely something that we cannot stand for as a city, NYC Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito said.\n\nViverto told CBS New York that one possible way to solve this problem in the city would be to expand the Living in Communities (LINC) voucher program, a program that gives money to those in homeless shelters to spend on more permanent housing options. But some landlords might be hesitant to participate in the program.\n\nI think the challenge that we've seen with the current voucher program, subsidy program, the LINC program, is for a very short period of time, there may be some hesitancy by landlords to engage with the city on it, she said.\n\nViverto is not the only city official to comment on this disturbing trend in New York City.\n\nComptroller Scott Stringer called the lack of child care at city shelters a tragedy for the city.\n\nFormer NYC Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who now runs a program for the homeless called WIN, called on the city to create a position that would be in charge of finding permanent housing options for the homeless.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio insists that solutions are coming. Some of the biggest tools, weapons, we have to address homelessness are on the way, he said in response to a question about the issue. There's a lot more coming, and we intend to turn the tide, but it's going to be a long battle.\n\nSo far, the mayor's office is working on a new initiative that would require 25 percent of the apartments built under a tax exemption plan to be set aside for the homeless.\n\nBut the mayor's office declined to give any more specifics, saying more plans are in the works, but there is nothing that can be shared yet.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:\n\nClick here to browse full transcripts of Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sunday, February 10th. I'm Margaret Brennan. And this is FACE THE NATION.\n\nBreaking news this morning as Virginia's embattled governor, Ralph Northam, sat down with Gayle King for CBS THIS MORNING. We'll have a preview.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM (CBS THIS MORNING/D-Virginia): Yes, I have thought about resigning, but-- but I've also thought about what Virginia needs right now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gayle's interview comes as the scandals involving the top three state-elected officials in Virginia near meltdown proportions. Now Virginia Democrats are calling for Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax to quit following accusations of sexual misconduct and now rape. As the governor, attorney general, and Republican leader in the State Senate struggle to deal with racially insensitive photos from their past, we'll talk with two Democrats from the Virginia congressional delegation, Jennifer Wexton and Don Beyer. Then, as the deadline nears for a deal to keep the government from shutting down again, what's the status of negotiations? We'll ask a key conservative in the House, North Carolina's Mark Meadows.\n\nAll of that, and more news of the week just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\n\nGood morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin with the chaos in Virginia's government and the scandals that have rocked the top three Democrats in the commonwealth, Governor Ralph Northam, Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax and Attorney General Mark Herring. CBS THIS MORNING co-host Gayle King has just returned from Richmond, Virginia, where she spoke to the governor in his only television interview.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nGAYLE KING (CBS THIS MORNING/CBS THIS MORNING Co-Host/@GayleKing): I know this has been a very difficult week for you in the state of Virginia. So where would you like to begin?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM (CBS THIS MORNING/D-Virginia/@GovernorVA): Well, it has been a difficult week. And-- and, you know, if you look at Virginia's history we're now at the four hundred year anniversary, just ninety miles from here in 1619 the first indentured servants from Africa landed on our shores in Old Point Comfort what we call now Fort Monroe and while--\n\nGAYLE KING: Also known as slavery.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes.\n\nGAYLE KING: Yeah, yeah.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: And, you know, while we have made a lot of progress in-- in Virginia, slavery has ended, schools have been desegregated. We have ended the Jim Crow laws, easier access to voting. It is abundantly clear that we still have a lot of work to do and I-- I really think this week raised a level of awareness in the Commonwealth and in this country--\n\nGAYLE KING: Mm-Mm.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: --that we haven't seen certainly in my lifetime.\n\nGAYLE KING: And why you think you still deserve this job when so many people are calling for you to step down?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Well, again we-- we have worked very hard. We've had a good first year. And-- and I'm a leader. I've been in some very difficult situations, life and death situations taking care of sick children. And right now--\n\nGAYLE KING: Because you're a doctor, yes?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: --right now, Virginia needs someone that can heal. There's no better person to do that than a doctor. Virginia also needs someone who is strong, who has empathy, who has courage and who has a moral compass. And that's why I'm not going anywhere. I have learned from this. I have a lot more to learn. But we're in a unique opportunity now. Again the four hundred year anniversary of-- of the history whether it be good or bad in Virginia to really make some impactful changes--\n\nGAYLE KING: Of slavery in this country?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes.\n\nGAYLE KING: In this state, yeah. Did you ever think about resigning when the drumbeat became so loud and, by the way, there was still beating for you to step down?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: I don't live in a vacuum.\n\nGAYLE KING: Yes.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: And so, yes, I-- I have heard it. And I've had-- this has been a difficult week. And again, I'm-- I'm fine. It's been mainly difficult for Virginia in this country. So, yes, I have thought about resigning but-- but I've also thought about what Virginia needs right now. And I-- I really think that I'm in a position where-- where I can take Virginia to the next level and it-- it will be very positive and, you know, we have a number of inequities in this country right now and in Virginia and-- and we're in a position to really stop talking so much and now to take action with policy to address a lot of these inequities.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gayle, thank you for bringing us this interview. What did you make of the governor's explanation?\n\nGAYLE KING: Well, the interview was at seven o'clock, and he was there ready to-- we were in his house, of course, he was there ready to go. And he was on time. And he clearly is very anguished by this whole situation. I know that this is an attempt at damage control. Who's calling us, Margaret?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I don't know.\n\nGAYLE KING: I-- I know that is clearly an attempt at damage control, but I didn't feel that he was spinning a story. I think he's anguished, I think he's very sincere. And I think that he's hoping that once voters and viewers hear his story, that they will reconsider the calls for his resignation. That said, he's not planning to go anywhere. He thinks that he-- he-- he feels he is in a very unique position to lead Virginia to another way, and that this is actually, as painful as it is, a very good conversation for us all to have.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He thinks he can ride this out?\n\nGAYLE KING: I think he is hoping he can ride it out. He is not going to step down. He is not going-- I even asked, Under what circumstances would you step down? And he couldn't even give-- he did not want to give an answer to that question because that is not how he is thinking, that is not what he wants, and that's not what he believes that he should step down.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think, though, about-- what this has sparked in terms of a national conversation? I mean, this is a state that has a long-troubled history with race. It was the capital of the Confederacy.\n\nGAYLE KING: Mm-Hm. Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This has really resonated around the country.\n\nGAYLE KING: Mm-Hm. And he is aware of all of that. And I think I said, Listen, in Virginia you have one, two, three people that are involved in a very messy scandal all at the same time. What do you make of that? He knows that the optics aren't good. He said, But I am concentrating on my battle and my fight. And I want to figure out a way how can I turn this around.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and you continued your conversation with him. Let's play that clip.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nGAYLE KING: Let's talk about Justin Fairfax.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes.\n\nGAYLE KING: In the beginning, he did not call for your resignation. He said, you know, Let the Governor decide. I know the Governor will make the right decision. But now his story has also changed.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes.\n\nGAYLE KING: As you know, two women have come out and accused him of sexual assault--\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes.\n\nGAYLE KING: --sexual inappropriateness. And they have both said that if there is an impeachment hearing that they will testify against him. Where do you sit on how you feel about Justin Fairfax today? Are you too calling for him to step down?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: I can only imagine that it must take tremendous courage for women to step forward and-- and talk about these things that-- these are so hurtful. And-- and these accusations are very, very serious. They need to be taken seriously. As you know, Governor Fairfax has called for an investigation. I really think where we are now. We need to get to the truth. The-- the truth-- the truth is important and certainly is--\n\nGAYLE KING: He is-- he too is calling for an investigation.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes. He is and I support that. And-- and if these accusations are determined to be true, I don't think he is going to have any other option but to resign.\n\nGAYLE KING: At this time, do you think he should resign?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: That's going to be a decision that he needs to make.\n\nGAYLE KING: I know he needs to make it, but what do you think? Do you think he--\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Well, again, I want the truth to come out. I-- I certainly support an investigation. And again, these accusation-- accusations are very serious. And we need to get to the bottom of them.\n\nGAYLE KING: And now your attorney general is also-- also has some explaining to do about--\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yeah.\n\nGAYLE KING: --his use of blackface. He said it was because it was Halloween and he was dressed up as his favorite-- one of his favorite rappers, Kurtis Blow.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Mm-Hm.\n\nGAYLE KING: Calls for him to resign, as well.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Mm-Hm.\n\nGAYLE KING: Your thoughts about that?\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Well, I know Attorney General Herring well, as I do Lieutenant Governor Fairfax, and you know we have all grown. I don't know what the attorney general was thinking, what his perception was of-- of race, of-- of the use of blackface back then. But I can tell you that I am sure, just like me, he has grown, he has served Virginia well. And he and I and Justin, all three of us have fought for equality.\n\nGAYLE KING: Mm-Hm.\n\nGOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: And so again, I regret that our attorney general is in this position. But this is a decision that he's going to need to make.\n\n(End VT)\n\nGAYLE KING: Yeah. Lots of decisions that need to be made. He has not spoken, I thought-- I thought this was interesting. He has not spoken to Justin Fairfax since this second accusation came out. And I said, Why haven't the two of you communicated? And he said, You know, well, I am dealing with what I'm dealing with. He is dealing with what he is dealing with, and I'm concentrating on this. I do know that the wives have reached out to one another. I was told that today.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's interesting.\n\nGAYLE KING: Yeah. But the-- the two of them have not spoken.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gayle, we'll be watching the rest of this interview on CBS THIS MORNING.\n\nGAYLE KING: Oh.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you.\n\nGAYLE KING: Well, we talked to him about the moonwalk. We talked about his wife, we talked about--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nGAYLE KING: --how this all came about. There are-- I'll just say, Margaret, we have a lot of interesting information that we'll have tomorrow on CBS THIS MORNING. I know you're ready for me to go.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: No. Gayle, we love that you are here--\n\nGAYLE KING: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --and you brought that. I want to get reaction to your--\n\nGAYLE KING: All right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --interview, actually.\n\nAnd we have someone on set to do just that. Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton, who represents Northern Virginia in Congress. Congresswoman, I-- I know you know Governor Northam.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON (D-Virginia/@RepWexton): I do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He campaigned for you. The contrition you heard there, is that enough for you to say he does not need to resign?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: It does not change my opinion that he needs to resign.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Because I don't believe he can effectively lead co-- the commonwealth at this time. I mean, I understand that he wants-- that he is feeling contrition, that he is feeling regret. But we need somebody who-- who cannot only address the wrongs of the past but take Virginia into the future. And I think he's lost the confidence of the people in order to be able to do that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And yet The Washington Post had a poll out that published overnight and it said Virginians are split. But an interesting portion of that said the majority of black residents say he should remain in office. Is that black-- public opinion persuasive to you at all?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Well, I mean that's-- everybody's entitled to their opinion and that's-- that's persuasive. But remember he-- he won a vast majority of the black vote in his election. And we're not talking about approval numbers. We're talking about people who feel that the governor should step down immediately. So, it's a very different situation. The fact is, he's really lost the confidence of a lot of the people he's supposed to be leading.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And what about the Attorney General Herring who also admitted to having appeared in blackface in the past? Should he resign?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Well, his situation is different and I judge each situation on its merits. The attorney general came forward proactively, is very regretful and contrite. He reached out to all the African-American leaders and-- and other leaders, very heartfelt anguish about what he had done. But he's got a lot of work to do to regain the trust of the people of Virginia.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're withholding judgment?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: I'm withholding judgment.\n\nGAYLE KING: Margaret, can I ask you a question? Am I still on mic? No.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I don't know that you are. Sorry, what is your question, Gayle?\n\nGAYLE KING: Well, when you said that he's lost the confidence, he realizes that. But he also wants a chance to regain the confidence. Do you think he deserves that? He knows that he's lost everyone's confidence.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: But he still needs to be able to govern.\n\nGAYLE KING: Okay.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: And that's the problem. If he's spending his entire rest of his term apologizing and trying to preserve his own reputation and his legacy, he's not going to be an effective--\n\nGAYLE KING: Okay.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: --governor for the people of the commonwealth. I don't-- I don't think the governor is that selfish at the end of the day.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I want to make sure we also talk about the Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax because I know you have strong feelings about him as well. He has made clear he's not going to resign. Do you expect there to be an attempt to impeach him?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Well, one of the members of the House of Delegates has said that he intends to file articles of impeachment next week. That's a decision that my-- my former colleagues in the General Assembly are going to have to make about-- about how that plays out. But I expect that the lieutenant governor will do the right thing for Virginia and resign.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Two of your Democratic colleagues, Senator Warner and Congressman Scott have-- have sort of hedged their criticisms saying if true. Is there a possibility that Justin Fairfax is unfairly accused here?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: He is the subject of two extremely credible corroborated accusations of serious sexual assault. That's the situation we're looking at right now. It seems highly unlikely that these women would come forward and subject themselves to this kind of abuse if these allegations were not factual.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because I think a lot of people ask, where is the benchmark for you believing the accuser versus believing the lieutenant governor? And they apply that to various different cases whether it was Justice Kavanaugh or their own personal experience. For you, what is the benchmark?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: I don't know that I can say that there is a particular benchmark, I judge every case and every-- every complainant and every situation on its merits. You know, I was also a prosecutor and this is not an issue where we need to prove something to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Elected leaders need to be held to a higher standard and where there are credible allegations-- corroborated allegations of serious sexual assault. We're talking about rape and forcible sodomy. This is something that impacts his ability to lead in future.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Democratic Party has really tried to stake out a moral high ground on issues of race, on issues of gender and sexual assault. Do you think these stories--three Democrats here--do you think that this has damaged the party?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: I think that our reaction to the-- to these stories shows how seriously we take these allegations and-- and-- and conduct of our elected officials. You know, the good news is Democratic elected leadership-- Democratic leadership doesn't begin and end with the three men serving in elected office in Virginia right now in statewide office. We have a vast numbers (sic) of really talented, diverse, hardworking, capable leaders who are able to step up and fill the void that-- that will be left.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman thank you for joining us. Gayle King, thank you--\n\nGAYLE KING: Thank you, Margaret. Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --for being here with us\n\nWhen we come back, we'll talk with another Virginia Democrat, former lieutenant governor, now Congressman Don Beyer. Don't go away.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: For some more perspective we turn to Virginia Congressman Don Bayer-- Beyer who also served as the commonwealth's lieutenant governor. You jinxed me there congressman.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER (D-Virginia/@RepDonBeyer): I'm sorry, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry I mu-- muddled your name there. You heard the conversation we just had with Congresswoman Wexton and with Gayle King. Do you agree? Do you think that the governor still needs to step down?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: I do. And-- and I think that just the-- the great confusion last weekend where he wasn't sure whether he was in the Klan robe or the blackface, has just sacrificed so much of his credibility and his ability to lead. You know, I know he's determined to go on this reconciliation tour but I think he should do that as a private citizen, rather than as the governor.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think because of this experience, as he argued in that interview with Gayle, that he can now have the authority to reach out in a significant way on racial issues?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Well, I know that's what he wants to do. And I-- I respect him. I know he wants to rehabilitate his reputation and-- and even his sense of what he called his moral compass. But he sacrificed so much of his ability to govern effectively. Figured the Legislative Black Caucus in Richmond, the Congressional Black Caucus on the Hill, virtually every African-American leader I know, has said that he needs to resign and the-- the Post poll that we've talked about before--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: --one of things we missed is that forty percent of black Virginians think he shouldn't remain. That's-- that's a damning number for a Democratic governor.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The governor's a peer of yours. Do you think that the-- the time, the place, the context of any of this should be considered in placing judgment on him?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Yes it should. And I think that's one of the differences between Governor Northam and Attorney General Herring. They both made dumb mistakes as young men. Governor Herring though, or Lieutenant Attorney General rather, has been incredibly remorseful, very simple, took it very responsibly. The way our-- my-- Governor Northam handled the first couple of days was confusing, even bizarre. And he's also in a different role. The attorney general is-- runs the state's largest law firm, whereas the governor really has to be the role model for more than eight million people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Attorney General Herring who you just brought up also admitted to having worn blackface at one point. If he resigns, the next in line is a Republican.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Cynics would look at this and say the calculus to not be as harsh on the attorney general is influenced by that.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Yeah, but I don't think that's actually true. There are-- there are cynics who say this is about the next election. But I think it's much more about values. We would move from a progressive, very strong attorney general to someone, who is not just a Republican, but someone who is on the arch conservative end of it. So, the way our laws would be administered Virginia would be completely different. This isn't about party politics as much it is about the kind of Virginia that we want.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Now, the Lieutenant Governor, Justin Fairfax, now two of the accusers have said that they would publicly testify should there be impeachment proceedings. There was no formal investigation here. Does one need to happen?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: I don't really know how that happens. I mean, maybe the impeachment proceeding does that. I know the lieutenant governor has called for an FBI investigation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: We'll see any way that particularly happens. You know, this whole notion of how do you adjudicate guilt here is very difficult. I believe both women. I see no reason why they would come forward. They have nothing to gain. There is no lawsuit. There's no money involved. These were all documented some years back. It wasn't created overnight and I believe the women and I think if you believe the women, we have no-- no call but to call for his resignation. No choice.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Congressman, thank you very much for giving us your perspective.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Thank you, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with more FACE THE NATION in just a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to North Carolina Republican Congressman Mark Meadows. He is the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and one of President Trump's top allies on Capitol Hill. Good to have you here.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS (R-North Carolina/@RepMarkMeadows): It's great to be with you. Thanks so much.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was on a number of networks this morning and said he absolutely cannot rule out another shutdown this week. Would you support one?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I think that that's accurate. Obviously, no one wants it, the President doesn't want it. Mick doesn't want it. I don't want it. At-- at the same time what we're seeing with these negotiations going on-- I-- I don't know that they're real serious about reaching a compromise. I mean, they've met twice in-- in almost two weeks now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And yet Senator Shelby was so optimistic after he met with the President this week.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. I-- I-- I heard that and-- and Senator Shelby is a, you know, a very seasoned negotiator and-- and-- and certainly when you look at-- at his conversations, you can draw some optimism from it. But I can tell you based on my conversations with conferees and a number of rank and file, there are distinct differences. And-- and here's-- here's what I'm concerned about. Border patrol came in to brief the conference. They gave their top three priorities and the conferees have said zero money for those top three priorities. How can you be serious about securing our border if the very people that are experts on securing it say these are our top three priorities, we need money. And yet they're saying zero dollars for that. I-- I don't understand that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, what is it that you need to see in order to get your vote and that of your caucus?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I think we need to make sure that our border is secure, not just from a standpoint of strategic fencing or border slats, whatever you want to call it, but we need to make sure that once and for all we secure our border to make sure our communities are safe.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And that means explicit wording that says what?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I think what it means is-- is some amount of funny-- funding that gives border patrol section chiefs the ability to establish priorities, work with the administration on doing that and secure part of the Rio Grande Valley. You know, when we look at-- at some thirty to forty percent of those who come here illegally, they come through one corridor that-- that many times is-- is left open. We need to secure it. That requires some type of physical barrier. And-- and certainly we would support that. If that number is less than 5.7 billion, certainly everyone should be willing to compromise. I know I am and we'll find that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Two billion would be the compromise that the White House would--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I've-- I've heard that reported honestly when you look at zero to 5.7, somewhere in the mi-- middle would be, you know, a two-billion to three-billion-dollar range. But it's not as much just the dollar amount. It's the flexibility and how to spend it. I think what Democrats are trying to do is say you can spend it here, you can't spend it there. And really the experts should be the ones deciding how we spend it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Two of the Senators involved in negotiations were on Fox today saying that one of the sticking points is the number of ICE agents. What is that--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. I think--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -issue?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: --it's more detention beds when-- when we look at-- at ICE versus detention-- detention beds and what they're talking about is those who come across the border illegally, cutting down on the number of beds which would actually force them being released into the United States and so it's-- it's more of an open border policy that some Democrats have supported in the past. And-- and I don't think that-- that's-- in fact I know that's not going to be supported by this administration.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, we are just days away from running out of money.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Right. Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: How does this end? And do you expect the President to declare a national emergency?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I-- I do expect the President and take some kind of executive action--a national emergency is certainly part of that. There are a few other things in his toolbox that he could use. But I do expect him to do that if we don't reach a compromise. And-- and, listen we have about twenty-four hours to do that. At this point they're going to need to look at some type of funding measure to make sure that we don't have a lapse, whether that's a clean CR for a short-term basis or a-- a longer period going through the end of September. They need to make sure that they have something on the table and ready to be voted on in the Senate where we could pass it in the House without a lapse in funding.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, you and your fellow Republican colleagues were incredibly critical of the last administration when they used executive action that bypassed the will and consent of Congress. How can you support it this time?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: You know I have been. And-- and here's one of the things that I would reach out to my Democrat colleagues. If once and for all you're wanting to work in a bipartisan manner, to return the power back to Congress, I'm willing-- I'm-- I'm willing to do that even now with this President, with our President's party in-- in the White House, I'm willing to do that. But until we do that, why should we allow a Democrat president in the White House to use executive orders and-- and not do the same with a Republican president. I've put forth measures that would actually eliminate some of the executive branch power.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: You know philosophically, that's where I am. And yet, at this point, we have a crisis. We have a crisis with a need to secure the border that we have to do. And this President is going to build a wall one way or another.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for giving us your perspective.\n\nWe will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Jamelle Bouie is a CBS News political analyst and is now a columnist with The New York Times. Jonah Goldberg is the senior editor for the National Review. Margaret Talev is a senior White House Correspondent for Bloomberg News. And we have our own political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Ed, it's good to have you here. I know you've been in Richmond for like ten days now--\n\nED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Something like that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --covering the story. You heard Gayle King's interview with the governor. What did you make of what he said?\n\nED O'KEEFE: I-- you know, clearly, he's bound and determined to stay. And there is some evidence this morning that Virginians, at least half of them, may be okay with that. What I thought was interesting though is that he still clearly hasn't come up with some specific plan on how to move forward other than he mentioned, and I don't believe we aired this part, but he talks later about concerns of infant mortality in the state--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nED O'KEEFE: --and trying to tackle issues like that over next three years. People need to remember outside of Virginia, they only get elected to one term as governor, so he's a lame duck immediately. So, if he stay, he stays and there's no political retribution for him, but there clearly could be for his party. And I think it's-- it's still an open question as to whether Democrats are really going to tolerate him being in office for the next three years. There are legislative elections later this year. Mark Warner, the senior Senator is up for reelection next year while it's also a presidential year and the thirteen electoral votes in Virginia are ones both parties desperately want. And if these guys are still around, all three of them, even just one or two of them, it could be radioactive for Democrats.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Jamelle, you're a Virginian. But looking not just at this as a state story but as a national one, why-- why do you think this is resonating?\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE (The New York Times/@jbouie): I think there are a variety of issues, I mean, with Northam and Herring in particular, there is sort of the-- this larger national reckoning with racism that's ongoing. In some-- to some extent prompted by the President and the President's sort of use of-- of racialized rhetoric and-- and racist rhetoric over his term. And I think Democrats and Virginia Democrats nationally are seeking to kind of basic (INDISTINCT) of zero tolerance for anything like that to create a contrast by saying, in our party, if you have any sort of like whiff of racism in your past or present, that kind of renders you radioactive for-- for the rest of the party. And so, I think that is kind of what is driving this. I think also there is just the element of-- it's-- it feels so old-fashioned, and I think just talking to people who are not Virginians, even talking to Virginians, sort shocked that in 2019 an entire state is facing controversies over blackface, a thing that I think many observers would have thought is in-- in our past or at least recognized as being unacceptable. And so, I think that the shock and surprise of just the circumstances of the controversy, plus the-- the way it resonates in our current national politics has come to driving a lot of-- a lot of the attention.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Jonah, the President weighs in on a lot of things, and he weighed in on this a few times this week. And then this morning said, African-Americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in Virginia. It's not clear what he was referring to, it might have been this Washington Post poll that said the majority of black residents were okay with Northam remaining in office. Why weigh into this?\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG (National Review/@JonahNRO): Because he is like the Norse god Loki. He likes to create drama. He is a master at trolling and creating division. And-- and he was watching-- I think he was watching CNN, Jake Tapper tweeted that. This tweet came right after a conversation along these lines. There-- there are African-American politicians in Virginia, as I understand it, who think the calls for Fairfax to resign are unfair given the fact that, you know, for all the usual understandable partisan politics reasons. And Donald Trump is very good at sort of making-- of-- of sewing division and-- and-- and trolling this kind of stuff. And he gets, from-- from his perspective, pretty good results when he does.\n\nMARGARET TALEV (Bloomberg News/@margarettalev): But-- well, you know, some-- to some extent, what's going on in Virginia is really about these three politicians and they're kind of youth or semi-youth catching up to them. But if you're following 2020, it's so hard to miss the preview of what's to come, you've got this potentially huge Democratic field with cross sections that involve a lot of women, a handful of African-American candidates, and a lot of older white men who have had decades of yearbooks and past statements and-- and sort of generational political shifts where things like three strikes you're out or, you know, whatever, the way you talk about crime, the way you talk about welfare have changed over the years. And so, to some extent, I think it does give us a-- a preview and gives the Democratic Party a preview of the pitfalls of zero tolerance, and also the kind of traps of saying we're going to hold ourselves to a higher standard than-- than President Trump or-- or his party.\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG: My colleague Rich Lowry says-- has this line where he says the Democrats are going through the first woke primary.\n\nED O'KEEFE: Yeah.\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG: --where everybody is trying to prove that they're zero-tolerance people, that they're-- they-- they check all the boxes on social justice stuff. And this is, you know, a radioactive mess if everybody is trying to be, you know, sort of (INDISTINCT) than now and purer than now in the Democratic 2020 primary.\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE: Probably, I think--\n\nED O'KEEFE: And you just wonder when the rush to judgment and the inability to stop, take a breath, and wait a second might catch up to them because two or three times this week they've all rushed out and said, he's got to go--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nED O'KEEFE: --whoever it was. Well, you know, then you ask-- you hear them saying, give us a little time to seek forgiveness and understanding or for due process. And it's like, how-- you know, are they potentially putting themselves in an even bigger box if they don't say, you know what, I'm not from Virginia, why don't we let this sort itself out there and see what happens?\n\nMARGARET TALEV: And the media plays the role and that will also play out over the--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET TALEV: --next election cycle also.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Jamelle, I want to pick up on something you touched on earlier.\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Wall Street Journal editorial board put it this way. It says Democrats believe they must sacrifice Mister Northam to preserve the sword they have made of racial politics for routine use against Republicans. Racism has become the default charge for any GOP policy they dislike on crime, immigration, education, the environment, you name it. The argument is this is tactics. Not true.\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE: So I-- I don't think it's tactics because I-- I do think there's-- there's substance here, right? The-- the Northam yearbook photo is genuinely shocking. It is genuinely shocking to see someone dressed up as a Sambo next to someone dressed up as a Klansman, two things that evoke very painful history and a painful like you see in this country that affects people living today, people alive, people I've spoken to and living, you know, quite recently have experienced these things. And so, I think-- I think the substance is important. I don't think-- I think trying to-- I think Democrats in Virginia and Democrats natural-- nationally are trying to reconcile the-- the fact that there is a substance here with these emerging political standards, with sort of like, yes, the tactical stuff. But I don't think this is a pure, like immoral power politics. I think I'll also add that-- and I think, Margaret, you made a really good point tying this to 2020 that there already has been-- there already are signs the Democrats are looking for my diverse candidates or looking for candidates who are sort of-- aren't tied to legacies of the politics or the '90s and the '80s. And I do think this very much kind of makes that even more solid and in-- in a weird way, even though, you know, I'm reasonably sure Joe Biden has nothing like this in the past. It may-- it may cripple Joe Biden's attempt to run. It may damage Bernie Sanders' attempt to run that just the-- the optics of this are going to reverberate throughout Democratic politics next year.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what about Elizabeth Warren? Because you saw this week, another issue here of identity and of race. She, it was revealed according to Texas State Bar Application, self-identified as Native American on that and-- and critics seized on this saying, this wasn't an issue of true identity. This was her seeking to advance herself by asking for special treatment. Does this stick to her?\n\nED O'KEEFE: It's-- it's already sticking. It's clearly sticking. And they know this. And I think to the point about this being a woke primary, that's the element of this that her team didn't anticipate. They thought they get credit for being as transparent as possible, releasing tax return to allowing a thorough review by the Boston Global for employment history and then releasing a DNA test because it would provide such a sharp contrast of the President who doesn't release any information despite the fact that he won and is still in office. But what they didn't anticipate was that by identifying that way when you clearly aren't or only a minuscule part of you is, it suggests that you were trying the take advantage of somebody else's heritage. And that is an-- is an-- is a radioactive element of this that they just are not prepared for. And I think she is going to suffer throughout this campaign, whether they like it or not. And there has been this attitude from her team of, well, we put it all out there.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nED O'KEEFE: Don't we get credit for that? Yeah. But when you can't verify that you have every document and which she's done this, and we don't know whether she and her family spent decades identifying this way, potentially to their advantage, then it invites the scrutiny that they're getting and will continue to get.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And, Jonah, the President again weighing in on this in a tweet not only mockingly calling her Pocahontas, but then using the term TRAIL, all caps, which many read as a nod to the Trail of Tears, the-- the forceable relocation of thousands of Native Americans leading to mass death, is he going to be paid-- paying a price for that?\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG: No. I mean, I-- like I--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, have the-- we're talking about this as if these politics of race should have a cost to them.\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the caveat seems to be in the case of the President, you're saying, no, it's actually a tactic that can be to his benefit.\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG: Well, I-- I just think all of this is baked in with President Trump. The President Trump you see allegedly mocking the Trail of Tears is the same President who mocked parents of gold star families. Everyone has made up their mind about the guy, and that's-- there's a reason why he's never made it out of the forties in approval rating and his real-- his support is about thirty-five percent of the electorate, which gets us to the fact that this-- there's-- if you just look at the math of the electoral college and his approval rating, there is almost literally no way Donald Trump can affirmatively win in 2020. But the Democrats can certainly lose. And if you look at the way these fights are shaping up, if you look at the way the Democrats this last week walked into Donald Trump's thing at the State of the Union about how we're never going to be a socialist country by unveiling in not great fashion the green new deal, it does seem like the Democrats are in danger of spiraling off to exactly the place where the White House wants them to be.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And along those lines, the issue of abortion, very divisive, also reignited. That's where the scrutiny of Northam came from in the first place because of this radio interview he did, Margaret. And Republicans are arguing that Democrats are out of step with public opinion on abortion. Gallup poll conducted in May 2018 showed sixty percent of Americans think abortion should be legal in the first trimester, thirteen percent when asked about terminations in the third trimester. And that's where Northam's comments were directed, that later part.\n\nMARGARET TALEV: Yeah, this is part of, sort of, a larger effort by-- you know, by some Republican strategists to-- to try to paint the Democrats to the extremes because the battle is fought in the middle on these sorts of issues. It's much tougher for Donald Trump and his-- and-- and that segment of kind of the Republican ideological arm, whereas if you're talking not about a woman's right to choose but if you're talking about something that most Americans find extremely reprehensible. If you can redefine what it means to support abortion rights, you can redefine how you feel about Democratic candidates. And I think going to our other conversation, you know, the Trump base is demonstrably different than-- than the Democratic Party's base, which is why there is asymmetrical and there's two different standards for how you talk about racial issues or gender issues or-- or, you know, sort of anything in the spectrum that we have been talking about this morning.\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE: Just also on that point, I think there is something in terms of public perception in the fact that we were referencing a woke primary. I think the term, Woke, gets to it, which is that there is a sense-- a broad sense that talking about race and racism, talking about identity, it's somehow opportunistic, is somehow not quite sincere in that. On the other end, President Trump sort of like open use of racist language, regardless of what people think about it, reads as somehow more authentic. And I think that there is-- there is a-- there is a-- I'm not saying that it is authentic, but that there is like this Archie Bunker quality to it that I think people are willing to look--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE: --past versus a kind of suspicion based on this country's history with racism--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nJAMELLE BOUIE: --of anyone talking about it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We've got to leave it there. Thanks to all of you. We'll be back in a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration missed a congressional deadline to officially weigh in on whether Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. We spoke Friday, the day of that deadline with the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir and asked him about his meeting with the secretary of state earlier in the week.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR (Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs/@AdelAljubeir): The-- the death of Jamal Khashoggi was a mass-- massive tragedy. It was a mistake. It was committed by officials of the Saudi government acting outside their scope of authority. The king ordered investigation. The investigation led to the arrest of a number of individuals. Those-- eleven of those individuals have been charged by the public prosecutor, and the trials have begun. We have said we will investigate. We will hold those accountable-- those responsible accountable and we will punish them. The crown prince had nothing to do with this. There was no order given to murder Jamal Khashoggi and-- and the whole country is shocked by this. The trial is taking place. What I tell people is wait until the legal process plays out and then judge us. But don't judge us before the process is complete.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that what the secretary of state told you, that he agrees with your assessment that the crown prince had nothing to do with it?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: I believe that the positions of the President and the secretary of state were very clear. They said that the evidence doesn't-- there is no evidence that points in that direction.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The intelligence community, though, had a very different conclusion here and after the CIA director briefed Congress on the details of what the CIA had found, the Senate then passed a bill saying undoubtedly the crown prince knew about what happened.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: I don't know what the CIA briefed them but I don't-- I believe that the same briefing that the President and the secretary of state and the secretary of defense at the time received did not point in that direction. So, I think there's a-- there's-- there may be emotions here, there may be exaggerations here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have you been briefed on what the CIA determined?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: I personally have not. No. But we have communications with them through intelligence channels.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. And that intelligence relationship is one of the strongest assets of the work between our two countries. So, I know you would think highly of the CIA and its assessment. When it comes to your own internal investigations, in October is when this murder happened.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Where is Jamal Khashoggi's body?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: We don't know.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean you don't know?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: We don't know. They said that the-- the public prosecutor is working to try to establish this fact. We have asked for evidence from Turkey, and he asked them several times, formally, through formal legal channels to provide evidence. We are still waiting to receive any evidence they may have.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're blaming the Turkish government?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: No, I'm blaming the murderers who committed this crime.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have them, you say, in custody though.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They can't tell you where the body is?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: We are still investigating. There-- we have now-- a number of-- of possibilities and we're asking them what they did with the body, and I think this investigation is ongoing, and I would expect that eventually we will find the truth.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The New York Times has new reporting out, and I'm sure you've seen the story, detailing how U.S. intelligence intercepted communications of the crown prince telling a top aide in 2017 that he would, quote, use a bullet on Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi if he did not return to the kingdom and end his criticism of the Saudi government. What was he talking about?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: I'm not going to comment on reports based on anonymous sources. We have seen many such reports in over the past two or three months that turned out to be incorrect, or that turned out to-- that turned out to be incorrect frankly. And so, I don't know this-- this-- the background. The crown prince, we know, did not order this. This was not a government sanctioned operation. We have an investigation and we have a trial. And many things have been put out that turned out to be incorrect.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Did the crown prince know of the murder? You're saying he didn't direct it.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: Of course not. Of course not. Nobody in Saudi Arabia knew about the murder except the people who did it. That's why when the team came back we said, as far as we know he left the consulate through the backdoor. It turned out to be false. And that's when the king asked for an investigation to be launched. The prosecution launched the investigation. The public prosecutor determined that something went wrong, brought in the people who were in the mission and basically detained them and questioned them and established that yes, they did in fact murder him.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You-- you realize though that there's a lot of skepticism, that there would be this level of dissent to have that large number of people defy the monarch and the crown prince and carry out such a rogue operation?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: It's-- Oliver North was involved in Iran-Contra. And he thought that Ronald Reagan wanted this. And Ronald Reagan did not want this at all. Abu Ghraib, you had people abusing prisoners and the President and the vice president and the secretary of state were not even aware of it. Unfortunately people make mistakes. Unfortunately people exceed their authorities. Unfortunately people do things wrong. We have done the right thing. We acknowledged that this happened. We acknowledged that these were officials of the Saudi government. We acknowledged that this-- they had no authority to do this, and we jailed them. And now we're putting them on trial.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns the Washington Post, is accusing AMI, which publishes The National Enquirer, for essentially trying to extort him with these incriminating photos. He personally said though that the Post's essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder, specifically of Khashoggi, was undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles. Did the Saudi government have anything to do with these leaks to AMI?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: Absolutely not. This sounds to me like a soap opera. I've been watching it on television and reading about it in the paper. This is something between the two parties. We have nothing to do with it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, can you say though that the Saudi government and any of its employees or its, you know, contractors that it works with, definitively that they had no contact--\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --with David Pecker or AMI?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR: That's as far as I'm aware. And I believe I would be aware. We have ab-- absolutely nothing to do with this. We-- maybe some of our citizens read The National Enquirer when they're in the United States. Other citizens watch the soap opera unfold on television, but that's it.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The full interview with minister al-Jubeir is on our website at facethenation.com.

CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata filed this report from the front lines.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nCHARLIE D'AGATA (CBS News Foreign Correspondent/@charliecbs): At full sprint we raced through a desert wasteland of former ISIS territory in eastern Syria toward the last sliver of land still under the group's control. Years of battle etched on the face of our chain-smoking escort behind the wheel. Up the stairs in a bombed-out home, the rooftop provides a glimpse of the final ISIS village of Baghuz Fawqani. Women in black burqas, trucks, motorcycles, daily life of all that's left in the dying days of this so-called caliphate.\n\n(Khaled Baran speaking foreign language)\n\nCHARLIE D'AGATA: Local commander Khaled Baran told us there had been a pause to let civilians leave before the final offensive, yet moments later, airstrikes in all probability from a U.S. warplane struck an ISIS position in the no man's land between the front line and the village. And then one much closer to us followed by a whizzing noise, what sounded like an incoming mortar that sent everyone scrambling. It's not clear how many ISIS militants remain holed up, but the past few days have seen an exodus of families along with some suspected ISIS fighters among them. They arrive hungry and cold to a desolate holding camp in the desert. The men separated from the women and interrogated.\n\nThey were promised a utopia of an Islamic State, but now these ISIS families have been reduced to eating American-made rations and living out of a hole in the ground.\n\nWhen we first visited the front lines a few weeks ago right beside local soldiers launching a barrage of mortars, we found some of the two thousand American troops who had been at the forefront of this fight. Their Kurdish allies have suffered grave losses, more than eight thousand fighters. They now worry the end of ISIS as a territorial force will hasten the withdrawal of U.S. troops they desperately rely on for advice, artillery, and especially air power.\n\nWe know how important America has been to the fight. Are you worried about what might happen after American forces leave?\n\n(Adnan Afreen (ph) speaking foreign language)\n\nCHARLIE D'AGATA: We started this together with Americans on the ground and their air support, Commander Adnan Afreen told us. Just before the end the American decision to withdraw, it's not a good decision, not the right time.\n\nISIS is cornered now. Territory once bigger than Indiana now reduced to a strip of land no larger than Central Park, and unlike every other battle here, this time there is no escape. There is nowhere left to run.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Our Charlie D'Agata reporting from Syria.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Please tune in to CBS THIS MORNING tomorrow for more of Gayle King's interview with Virginia Governor Northam, and Bob Schieffer filed a special tribute to the longest-serving member of Congress, John Dingell, who died on Friday.

OMAHA, Neb. - Investor Warren Buffett says he would be willing to sell Berkshire Hathaway's big investments in American Express, Coca-Cola and other companies if he found a significantly better option, but he still believes in those companies.\n\nBuffett appeared on CNBC Monday after meeting with roughly 40,000 Berkshire shareholders on Saturday.\n\nBuffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has held major stakes in American Express and Coca-Cola for decades, so the company would face a significant tax bill on the gains if he did ever sell those investments.\n\nBuffett says the tax implications are a factor in his decisions.\n\nBuffett says he likes owning roughly 15 percent of American Express' stock even though competitors are trying to develop a better way to process payments. Berkshire owns about a 9 percent stake in Coca-Cola Co.
WASHINGTON - MetLife (MET) has been fined $20 million by Wall Street's policing body for misleading customers in switching them from variable annuities contracts into more expensive ones.\n\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Tuesday the decision was its largest fine related to variable annuities, popular yet complex investments that have grabbed the attention of regulators in recent years. FINRA has taken hundreds of disciplinary actions against brokers and investment firms for abuses in sales of variable annuities.\n\nFINRA also ordered MetLife Securities Inc. to return $5 million to customers for making negligent material misrepresentations and omissions on applications for switching into new variable annuities contracts. Tens of thousands of customers were affected, the regulators said.\n\nNew York-based MetLife neither admitted nor denied the allegations.\n\nMetLife fully cooperated with the FINRA investigation and we are pleased to put this matter behind us, the company said in a statement.\n\nFINRA said that from 2009 through 2014, MetLife misrepresented or omitted one important fact related to the costs and guarantees of customers' current variable annuities contracts in 72 percent of the 35,500 replacement applications it approved. The company told customers that their current contract was more expensive than the recommended replacement, when in fact the current contract was less expensive, according to the regulators.\n\nIn addition, MetLife failed to tell customers that the recommended new contract would reduce or eliminate important features of the current contract, such as guaranteed income benefits and accrued death benefits.\n\nMetLife's variable annuities replacement business garnered it around $152 million in commissions over the period, FINRA said.\n\nSales of variable annuities, which are tax-deferred and often used to save for retirement, have ballooned in recent years. They're contracts with investors in which the company selling them agrees to make periodic payments to the investor. The periodic payouts change depending on the performance of the mutual funds, bonds or other investments linked to the annuities.\n\nThe Obama administration recently acted to require that brokers who recommend investments for retirement savers meet a stricter standard that now applies to registered advisers. The idea is to prevent brokers from steering customers into riskier investments because they pay the broker a high commission.\n\nVariable annuities are often the investment that brokers recommend for people's retirement accounts, especially when they're retiring or leaving a company and roll over their employer-based 401(k) account into an individual retirement account, or IRAs.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.-- A man described by a Florida federal judge as the boss of a $100 million-plus fraud factory that used thousands of stolen identities to illegally obtain income tax refunds was sentenced Thursday to nearly 20 years in prison.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas imposed the sentence on Harlan Money King Decoste, 27, who previously pleaded guilty to fraud, identity theft and other charges. Decoste had faced even more prison time, but Dimitrouleas gave him a slight break by using a somewhat lower tax-fraud loss estimate than the government.\n\nStill, the judge made clear Decoste got the longest prison sentence of the five men convicted in the case because he was in charge.\n\nI think it was a fraud factory, Dimitrouleas said at a hearing Thursday. He's the boss.\n\nInternal Revenue Service investigators say the group used a rented house in the quiet suburb of Miramar as the hub for 10 laptop computers used in an attempt to steal about $108 million between July 2011 and May 2013. The IRS estimated the men were able to fraudulently obtain at least $28.2 million in actual refunds using 29,000 separate stolen identities.\n\nThe operation broke wide open after police responded to a May 2013 home invasion robbery at the house and found the computers, stacks of cash, closets filled with expensive shoes and jewelry, watches, bags of marijuana and other drugs, and dozens of prepaid debit cards and credit cards.\n\nDecoste attorney Barry Greff insisted the IRS fraud estimates were vastly overblown. He said even the loot and cash recovered at the house was meager compared to the government's loss figures in the tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThere's just no way, Greff said. It is all based on speculation, conjecture and possibilities.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Watson said investigators had not been able to trace all of the stolen money but said the operation was among the largest tax refund fraud schemes the IRS has ever uncovered. Watson said Decoste was arrested in 2015 on similar charges in the Atlanta area and appeared to brag in recorded jail phone calls there about his abilities to steal.\n\nThey don't call me the Money King for no reason, Decoste said on one recorded call in which he told another person details of using stolen identities on tax forms.\n\nDecoste also created a purported rap label called GroundUp111 as a cover for the fraud business, Watson said. Other defendants were listed as officers of the so-called company, which did not produce any music.\n\nProsecutors are seizing the ill-gotten gains, including more than $174,000 in cash, the 10 computers, Rolex and other expensive watches and more than a dozen gold and diamond necklaces, chains and pendants. Most of the defendants also must pay as much as $28 million each in restitution to the government.
Washington — As early as Tuesday, the Biden administration will begin asking dozens of U.S. attorneys across the country to resign, a senior Justice Department official tells CBS News' Clare Hymes. They will include most of the ones who were appointed by former President Trump, as the Biden administration moves to transition to its own nominees, The Associated Press says.\n\nBut the U.S. attorney overseeing the federal tax probe involving President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, will remain in place, the official told Hymes. The acting attorney general, Monty Wilkinson, called U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who runs the federal prosecutor's office in Delaware, and asked him to remain on the job, the official said.\n\nThe Justice Department has been investigating the finances of Hunter Biden, including scrutinizing some of his Chinese business dealings and other transactions. The tax investigation was launched in 2018, the year before the elder Biden announced his candidacy for president, two sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News. Hunter Biden confirmed the existence of the investigation in December after a round of subpoenas was issued in the case.\n\nThe Associated Press has reported that the subpoena seeking documents from Hunter Biden in December asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma.\n\nSeparately, U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was appointed in October by then-Attorney General William Barr as a special counsel to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe, will remain in that capacity, the senior Justice Department official told Hymes, but Durham is expected to resign from his other position as the U.S. attorney in Connecticut.\n\nThe transition process, which happens routinely between administrations, is expected to take weeks and would apply to a few dozen U.S. attorneys who were appointed by Mr. Trump and confirmed by the Senate. Many of the federal prosecutors who were nominated by Mr. Trump have already left their positions, some in recent weeks.\n\nIt's fairly customary for U.S. attorneys to leave their positions after a new president is in office, but the departures are not automatic and don't necessarily happen all at once.\n\nIn 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked for the resignations of 46 U.S. attorneys who were holdovers from the Obama administration.\n\nThe U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president and are generally nominated with a recommendation from a home-state senator. The 93 U.S. attorneys are responsible for overseeing the offices of federal prosecutors and charged with prosecuting federal crimes in their jurisdictions.\n\nThe Senate has yet to schedule a confirmation hearing for Mr. Biden's attorney general nominee, Merrick Garland, a federal appeals court judge who in 2016 was snubbed by Republicans for a seat on the Supreme Court.\n\nCNN was first to report that the department was seeking the resignations.
In the years since the 2008 financial crisis, this southern U.S. port city has attracted a new Airbus factory, seen its steel industry retool, and gained thousands of jobs building the Navy's new combat vessel.\n\nSome 300 miles north in Huntsville, new businesses sprout in farm fields drawn by readily available land, low taxes, flexible labor rules and improving infrastructure. As President Trump faces pressure to deliver on his promise to revive manufacturing in the northern rust belt states that put him in the White House, his biggest challenge may not be Mexico or China, but the southern U.S. states that form the other pillar of his political base.\n\nStates like Alabama have built a presence in the global supply chain in direct competition with the country's Midwestern industrial heartland, and even if Trump coaxes jobs back to the United States they may well head south rather than north.\n\nWhether the rust belt's expectations are met will be central to 2018 U.S. mid-term elections and likely frame the presidential race in 2020. The southern states are reliably Republican, but the party's ability to repeat its success in Midwestern swing states, such as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, may hinge on whether the Trump administration delivers on its economic promises.\n\nFor a decade now, nine southern states - North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas - together have accounted for a larger share of the U.S. economy than nine northern states that defined America as the 20th century's industrial superpower, according to a Reuters analysis of federal data.\n\nThe analysis compared gross domestic product, population and other factors among northern and Midwestern states that played a key role in Trump's victory or are typically considered part of the industrial heartland, with those in the south and along the Gulf Coast that have become an emerging destination for auto and other investment.\n\nFlorida, a state whose population has boomed under an influx of retirees, many of them from the north, was excluded.\n\nEconomists and industrial site consultants say the reasons behind the trend have moved beyond lower wages and lower levels of unionization. Per capita income in the south has now almost caught up with that in the Midwest, and its skilled workforce continues to grow as college graduates move in.\n\nLabor? Perceived advantages. Taxes? Some of these are fairly low (tax) states. Real estate? For big projects that are going to employ three, four, five thousand people, you can find free land - zero cost land, said Darin Buelow, an industrial site specialist with Deloitte Consulting.\n\nIn the south, business executives and development officials interviewed by Reuters were less likely to call for new tariffs and trade deals than to worry about how any new regime may disrupt a system they have learned to work with.\n\nDavid Fernandes, president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama, said that of the roughly 700,000 engines the factory made last year, half went to Mexico and Canada. The facility also makes engines for cars assembled at a Toyota plant in Georgetown, Kentucky.\n\nAnything that hinders the opportunity to provide product to a customer is what is concerning, he said.\n\nPlants in Kentucky and Indiana gave Toyota a U.S. foothold in the 1980s and 1990s, but in this century the Japanese carmaker turned to Alabama, Texas and Mississippi for expansion. Located on former cotton fields, the company's Huntsville, Alabama, plant now employs more than 1,400 people and churns out about 3,000 engines a day.\n\nGunmaker Remington Outdoor came to Huntsville lured by $110 million in tax and other concessions. Its factory here is expected to eventually employ 2,000, and it has already begun shifting employees from elsewhere, including 100 from the town in upstate New York where the company was founded two centuries ago.\n\nJeremy Littlejohn moved his cloud computing start-up RISC Networks from Chicago to Asheville, NC, in 2012 for the less hectic pace, but has found the location a selling point as he grew from 6 to 33 employees.\n\nMany of those new workers came from out of state, contributing to North Carolina's net annual influx of about 46,000 college degree holders. That migration of educated workers is the norm among the southern states.\n\nThe rust belt by contrast saw a net outflow of more than 400,000 residents with college degrees between 2007 and 2014. The customers are heading south too. From 1990 to 2015, population in the nine southern and gulf states grew 43 percent, to more than 76 million, and passed that of the rust belt states in the late 1990s.\n\nPopulation in the rust belt grew 13 percent, to 63 million, over the same period. When the Minnesota-based Polaris Industries Inc. began planning a new facility for its line of outdoor vehicles, there was no Minnesota play, said Eric Blackwell, director of operations at the company's new factory outside Huntsville.\n\nThe market for Polaris' machines, popular for farm work, hunting and sport riding, was growing in the south. Open land was available, and Alabama had programs to help recruit and train a workforce expected to rise to 1,500.\n\nGlobalization hit both the north and the south hard. Between 2000 and 2010 each lost about a third of their manufacturing jobs. But employment rebounded faster and more broadly in the south. Between 2000 and 2015, combined private sector employment in nine southern and gulf coast states still grew 13.5 percent.\n\nIn the nine northern states total private sector jobs as of 2015 remained 1.3 percent below their 2000 level, according to federal data. The transition dates back to the 1980s, when German and Japanese automakers began investing in what has become a sprawling, regional industry.\n\nSupplier networks followed, creating even stiffer competition in an industry already changing due to passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the growth of automaking in Mexico. New industries, such as aerospace, followed.\n\nBoeing opened a new factory in Charleston, South Carolina, while decades of federal spending on space and defense programs created a pool of engineers in Alabama. A surge in energy and locally important industries like wood products added to the employment gains.\n\nJudith Adams, vice president at the Alabama State Port Authority, speeds visitors through warehouses of wood fiber products, steel ingots and other goods ready to ship abroad. The port is spending $47 million to boost its capacity to 500,000 containers a year from 300,000. The longer-term the goal is to triple that to 1.5 million.\n\nThe vessel sizes are getting bigger. The market is getting bigger. The cargo is here, Adams said.\n\nWhen European aircraft maker Airbus scouted sites for its $600 million North American plant more than a decade ago it settled on a former Air Force base in Mobile.\n\nAs it ramps up production, local officials say 20 suppliers have already arrived in Airbus' wake, with firms like Ireland's Maas Aviation looking to put 150 people to work painting planes.\n\nWe looked at transportation costs, labor costs, productivity, and it made sense, said Allan McArtor, chief executive of Airbus Group Inc. We will be building single aisle airplanes (in Mobile) for a long, long time.
A day after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin suggested economic growth could pay for a majority of President Trump's tax reform proposal, debt hawks are sounding the alarm, warning that any tax overhaul must not add to the federal deficit.\n\nConservatives are eager to do tax reform, but they're also eager to address the massive debt and deficit, a top aide to one key GOP senator told CBS News. Tax reform that adds to the 10-year debt projection is pretty much dead on arrival with most Republican members of Congress.\n\nIf it's just pure tax cuts and no revenue-raising provisions, we don't predict that any tax cut will pay for itself. There's just no federal tax that's bad enough to raise sufficient revenue by eliminating it, explained Alan Cole, an economist with the conservative Tax Foundation. It means you're punting on the question of how the revenue will eventually be raised to pay for this.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) added Friday in a release, Not paying for tax reform is extremely misguided, would explode the federal deficit and end up harming long-term economic growth prospects.\n\nOn Thursday, Mnuchin acknowledged that eliminating loopholes and deductions will finance only a portion of Mr. Trump's ambitious plan to overhaul the nation's tax code.\n\nThe deal will pay for itself, Mnuchin declared during a question-and-answer session at the Institute of International Finance's Washington Policy Summit. The secretary added, however, that the administration fundamentally believe[s] in dynamic scoring and will judge the proposal's impact on the deficit accordingly.\n\nSince a rule change in 2015, the Congressional Budget Office has gauged the cost of various proposals using two distinct methods: traditional scoring and dynamic scoring. The traditional scoring method looks only at the text of legislation to determine its impact on the deficit -- specifically, the money a bill proposes to spend, and the methods the bill proposes to pay for it. The dynamic scoring method, by contrast, adds to that calculation an estimate of the bill's impact on the broader economy.\n\nSome conservatives have long argued that the cost of tax cuts should be evaluated using dynamic scoring, rather than traditional scoring. They don't believe tax cuts must be fully paid-for in legislative text, clalming that the economic growth they create will counterbalance any additional money the tax cuts add to the national debt.\n\nSome deficit watchdogs, however, argue that past tax cuts haven't yielded the economic growth that proponents have promised. They believe dynamic scoring encourages fiscally irresponsible proposals that will blow up the deficit.\n\nThere is no evidence that broad-based tax cuts can pay for themselves completely, and economic studies from across the spectrum have found that deficit-financed tax cuts only pay for a fraction of their cost, the CFRB said in a blog post. Even if tax cuts could generate more growth than estimated, no plausible amount of economic growth would be able to pay for the tax plan, let alone reduce deficits.\n\nCFRB president Maya MacGuineas added in an email that the administration must decide how it wants to spend any revenue accrued through growth.\n\nThe administration has been saying they were going to use economic growth to deal with our fiscal challenges and reduce the debt. Now they want to use growth effects to pay for tax cuts, she explained. You shouldn't assume growth effects before they occur, and you sure shouldn't count them twice.
The Trump administration may direct the Internal Revenue Service to delay the April 15 tax filing deadline as part of the U.S. government's efforts to ease the economic impact of the novel coronavirus, an administration official told CBS News.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed in testimony Wednesday to the House Committee on Appropriations that he is considering providing substantial relief to certain taxpayers and giving extensions on tax filings, a move Mnuchin said would inject the equivalent of $200 billion into the U.S. economy.\n\nMnuchin also said that the government should pick up the costs for small and medium businesses whose workers have to self-quarantin or care for quarantined family members.\n\nThis is a little bit like a hurricane, and we need to cover these [costs] outside the normal expenses, he said.\n\nThe government is also considering guaranteed loans to industries hit hardest by the outbreak, such as airlines and cruise lines, Mnuchin said, although he insisted any funding did not amount to bailouts.\n\nThe Treasury chief's remarks came a day after some Democrats in Congress urged the IRS to consider a filing delay given the possibility of disruption from the outbreak.\n\n[W]e are concerned about the ability of the IRS to provide taxpayer assistance and process returns, as well as the ability of taxpayers, free tax-preparation sites, and tax professionals to meet the filing deadline, members of the House Ways and Means Committee wrote in a letter on Tuesday.\n\nThe agency has previously pushed back the tax filing deadline, including two years ago when the website to make payments suffered multiple outages hours before the deadline. The legislators noted in their letter Tuesday that the IRS already has authority to extend filing deadlines by up to six months, as well as to waive penalties.\n\nSo far this year, tax return filings have run mostly on schedule. The IRS had received 59 million tax returns as of the end of February, the same number as it had this time last year. That's just over a third of all the returns the agency expects to process this filing season.\n\nHowever, the spreading coronavirus could disrupt tax season, as many Americans rely on IRS field offices and volunteer centers for help with their filings.\n\nThe White House has also floated a number of possible measures to mitigate the economic fallout of the coronavirus, including a temporary payroll tax cut.
Trump says he doesn't need to be tested for c...\n\nTrump says he doesn't need to be tested for coronavirus\n\nTrump says he doesn't need to be tested for coronavirus\n\nPresident Trump has not been tested for coronavirus, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Monday night in a statement.\n\nThe President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms, Grisham said. She added that Mr. Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him.\n\nGrisham also cited CDC guidelines that say testing decisions should be based on symptoms and exposure history.\n\nFour GOP members of Congress — Senator Ted Cruz and Congressmen Matt Gaetz, Paul Gosar and Doug Collins — are quarantining themselves after learning they had contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, or coronavirus, at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington last month.\n\nTwo of them had some exposure to Mr. Trump after the conference. Gaetz traveled on Air Force One with the president to Washington from Florida Monday. His office has said he isn't experiencing any symptoms and expects to receive the results of a COVID-19 test soon.\n\nCollins shook hands with Mr. Trump last week and visited the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta with him.\n\nLarry Kudlow, the chairman of the president's council of economic advisers, and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, will be going to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to meet with Republican lawmakers about economic measures the government could take to provide relief to those impacted by coronavirus. They're expected to discuss a payroll tax cut, aid for hourly wage earners to help them avoid lost wages, small business loans, and aid for the airline, cruise and hotel industries, which are suffering losses over fear about the spread of coronavirus.
Special counsel Robert Mueller's office is alleging former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort continued work related to Ukraine after his 2017 indictment, according to a redacted transcript from Manafort's hearing with federal prosecutors on Monday.\n\nThe hearing focused on whether Manafort breached his plea agreement by lying to investigators, including about his meetings with Konstantin Kilimnik, who is suspected of having ties to Russian intelligence. Prosecutors allege Manafort was talking about a redacted issue related to Ukraine as late as 2018.\n\nThis goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the Special Counsel's Office is investigating, prosecutor Andrew Weissman said, according to the transcript, about Manafort continuing to work with Kilimnik on Ukrainian issues.\n\nManafort's attorneys submitted a poorly redacted filing in January revealing Manafort shared polling data with Kilimnik during the campaign. In their response to Mueller claiming Manafort breached his plea deal, Manafort's attorneys inadvertently revealed the special counsel alleges Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nManafort and Rick Gates, his former business associate, were indicted by a federal grand jury in late 2017. He was found guilty on five counts of tax fraud, one count of failing to disclose his foreign bank accounts and two counts of bank fraud, in August.\n\nManafort reached a plea agreement with Mueller's office on Sept. 14 to avoid a second trial on additional charges in D.C. District Court. Under the deal, Manafort pledged to cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly with Mueller's probe and any other investigation.
The IRS is giving all Texas residents and businesses an additional two months to file their federal income taxes, citing the deadly winter storm that left millions without power and water. Texans will now have until June 15 to file their 2020 returns, instead of the regular deadline of April 15, the tax agency said on Monday.\n\nThe extension also includes any taxes that would have been owed by April 15, as well as any business returns that otherwise would have been due on March 15, the IRS said. Texans also will have until June 15 to make 2020 IRA contributions, the agency said.\n\nThe extension will be automatic for anyone living in Texas, which means they won't have to file forms requesting more time to file.\n\nFollowing the recent disaster declaration issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the IRS is providing this relief to the entire state of Texas, the IRS said in a statement.\n\nTaxpayers in other states that have been affected by harsh winter weather may also receive the same extension for filing their returns, as long as their states receive similar FEMA disaster declarations due to the same storms, the IRS said.\n\nThe IRS last year extended the tax deadline for all U.S. taxpayers due to the coronavirus pandemic, although this year it plans to keep its regular April 15 deadline for 2020 tax returns. With about 29 million residents, Texans represent almost 9% of the U.S. population, which means about 1 in 10 taxpayers will get an extension on their taxes this year.
President-elect Donald Trump has no intention of giving up his Twitter account when he takes office, and the so-called Tweeter-in-chief said the followers should expect more posts.\n\nMr. Trump's ability to influence a company's stock prices with a single tweet is no secret -- just ask companies like Boeing, Ford, Toyota or Macy's. All it takes are 140 characters for him to move markets in a big way.\n\nSo one financial app, called Trigger, has even created an alert to notify users if Trump tweets about a company they have invested in, reports CBS News correspondent Alex Wagner.\n\nHe's tweeting about specific companies, calling them out on Twitter and that's having massive effects in the stock market, said Trigger CEO Rachel Mayer.\n\nAbbey Klaassen, chief marketing officer for ad agency 360i, said brands need to be ready for anything, because Trump's Twitter feed can instantly hurt or help a company.\n\nPresidents and brands have always intersected over the years, but this is an entirely new level of engagement, Klaassen said. It's about thinking through the motions of, 'Okay, how do we react if Trump tweeted this positive thing to us, if he tweeted this negative thing to us?'\n\nEarlier this month, he targeted General Motors on Twitter for Mexican-made Chevy Cruzes, threatening: make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax.\n\nGeneral Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017\n\nGM's stock dropped one percent. The company said most Cruze models are made in Ohio.\n\nLockheed Martin's shares also plummeted nearly three percent when Trump tweeted that the defense company's F-35 program costs were out of control. Lockheed's CEO personally vowed to lower costs.\n\nHits to both companies' stock prices were temporary.\n\n\n\nTrigger's app tracks major financial news and events -- or trigger -- to help investors. The latest Trump alert quickly became their most popular feature.\n\nOne single tweet we've seen can eradicate market cap losses in the billions of dollars. One single tweet can adjust the strategy of a large Fortune 500 company, Mayer said.\n\n\n\nKlaassen said some companies may profit.\n\nDo you think we're going to see the tables turn in the coming years where companies go after Trump in the hopes of bating themselves into a Twitter war and raising their public profile? Wagner asked.\n\nYou know the adage, about 'all publicity is good publicity?' I'm sure there will be companies out there that think that this is a great idea; I'm sure it will be a way to get on Trump's radar, Klaassen said. And if you're on Trump's radar, there's a good chance you're going to be on a lot of other people's radar very soon.\n\n\n\nWhile the majority of the companies featured on Mr. Trump's Twitter feed took hits, some companies have seen boosts. Fiat Chrysler saw an uptick in its stock price after a favorable tweet from the president-elect\n\nAccording to experts, the lasting effects of Mr. Trump's tweets on the economy and big business are yet to be seen.
If you're looking for a quick, low-cost way to pay off your student loans, you can find a few options. But while you may be able to consolidate or refinance (even private loans), you won't find many ways to significantly pay off those loans without forking over more money every month.\n\nHowever, if you have home equity, a new route to paying down student loans is now open. Fannie Mae, the federal mortgage financing company, recently announced a new program that allows student debt holders to swap student debt for mortgage debt.\n\nThe novel program permits mortgage originators that sell loans to the mortgage giant to offer a new refinance option for the purpose of paying off a student loan. Proceeds from the refinancing will go directly to the student loan servicer to fully pay off at least one loan.\n\nThat means you can exchange student loans for mortgage debt. That will indeed erase your student loans on paper, but what you owe isn't magically eliminated. It's added on to your mortgage obligation. And it could boomerang on you if you can't pay your mortgage: You could lose your home.\n\nAlthough you can often get a better rate on a home-equity loan than on most credit cards and installment loans, federal college financing is mostly pretty cheap. Federal student loan rates range from 3.76 percent (undergraduate) to 5.31 percent (graduate). They reset on July 1.\n\nPrivate home-equity loans range from 4 percent to 7.6 percent, according to Bankrate.com. The higher your credit score, generally, the lower your interest rate. Credit card rates are averaging 15 percent, according to creditcards.com.\n\nThe one exception to the low-rate student rate offerings are PLUS loans, which parents usually take out, pegged at 6.31 percent for this academic year. Note to parents: Avoid these loans at all cost.\n\nStill, the lure of rolling federal loans into a mortgage debt sounds tempting. But here are five major drawbacks you should be aware of:\n\nYou lose flexibility from the federal student loan program. Homeowners who tap home equity to pay off student debt give up their rights to income-driven repayment options on their federal student loans, which cap federal student loan payments at roughly 10 percent of their income, said Rohit Chopra, senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America. Income-driven repayment is a critical safeguard during periods of unemployment or other income shocks that help avoid the consequences of default. Also, keep in mind that the federal college loan program has multiple repayment options.\n\nYou may not be able to have your federal student loan forgiven. This would apply to those in public service professions who may qualify for loan forgiveness after a decade.\n\nYou may not net a lower rate on your rolled in debt. As noted above, student loans relative to private mortgage rates, can often be a better deal. Federal Stafford Loans for undergraduate students have a low fixed rate, currently 3.76 percent, noted Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Cappex, a college decision site. They are unlikely to qualify for a lower rate on a mortgage.\n\nAs noted above, student loans relative to private mortgage rates, can often be a better deal.

They are unlikely to qualify for a lower rate on a mortgage. You lose federal loan breaks if you can't pay. The federal loan program has a surprising number of generous provisions if you're sick, disabled or can't pay back your loan.  Federal student loans offer significant benefits that aren't standard with mortgages, such as death and disability discharges, economic hardship deferments, forbearances, income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness options, said Kantrowitz.\n\nThe federal loan program has a surprising number of generous provisions if you're sick, disabled or can't pay back your loan. Federal student loans offer significant benefits that aren't standard with mortgages, such as death and disability discharges, economic hardship deferments, forbearances, income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness options, said Kantrowitz. The tax treatment may be less favorable. The traditional wisdom over the years has been to favor mortgage debt over other kinds of credit because home-related debt is tax deductible. However, Kantrowitz pointed out: There's a deduction for mortgage interest, but you must itemize (most taxpayers don't). The student loan interest deduction, on the other hand, lets you deduct up to $2,500 in interest on federal and private student loans. It's an 'above-the-line' exclusion from income, so you can claim it even if you don't itemize. It also reduces the [adjusted gross income], which may have other benefits.\n\nWhile plenty of factors argue against doing a mortgage debt swap with your student loans, there's one exception, Kantrowitz pointed out:\n\nThe only case in which a borrower might consider using a mortgage or home equity loan or line of credit to pay off student loans is if the student loan borrower has high-interest private student loans.\n\nThey might be able to save money through refinancing. Though, generally, if they have a high interest rate, they might be able to get a lower interest rate if their credit score has improved a lot since they borrowed the money. If they don't qualify for a lower rate on a private consolidation loan, they're unlikely to qualify for a home loan with a lower rate.\n\nThe bottom line with student debt management is to be careful. Look at all of the scenarios carefully and see how much you can save -- if you can reap any savings at all.
Two lawmakers from opposite coasts and different parties want to ease the burden on local governments and small businesses of operating during the pandemic by helping them purchase personal protective equipment and rapid testing equipment.\n\nThe Getting Americans Safely Back to Work Act, introduced Monday by Virginia Democrat Abigail Spanberger and California Republican Young Kim, would create a $1 billion block grant program for such purchases to be administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health departments. A quarter of the funds, $250 million, would be set aside to help small business like restaurants fully reopen. The bill was first reported by CBS News.\n\nIn conversations with Central Virginia small businesses, restaurants, and local governments, a major concern remains the continued cost of PPE and COVID-19 testing supplies, Spanberger said. While these costs are high, employers recognize the importance of making these investments for both the safety of their employees and the health of our communities.\n\nHer cosponsor, freshmen representative Young Kim, who is a former small business owner, said it was an immediate and urgent priority to distribute rapid tests and personal protective equipment, both of which could be purchased with the grant program created by the bill. Funds could also used to implement any other workplace safety measures to mitigate the spread of the virus.\n\nThese costs have largely been borne by local businesses, who often see those safety measures as necessary to get customers back in the door.\n\nState and local governments around the country are also facing major budget shortfalls because of the declining tax revenues and the costs they have incurred to fight the pandemic. But they've been largely left out of COVID relief efforts — including the $900 billion package passed in December — because of Republican opposition.\n\nA spokesperson for Spanberger also said the congresswoman is actively working to include the provisions of the bill in the upcoming COVID relief package proposed by the White House that is working its way through the House and Senate.\n\nChesterfield County, Virginia Sheriff Karl Leonard said the legislation was a necessary step to reduce the risk for law enforcement officers and other employees in his county, including those who might have to contain a virus outbreak in a prison or jail.\n\nThis bill benefits our essential workers and our community as a whole, he said.
Washington — Congress and the White House moved quickly to craft the parameters of a massive stimulus bill to prop up the economy in response to the coronavirus crisis on Tuesday. Senate Republicans took the lead on a package that could cost upwards of $1 trillion.\n\nA senior Republican official told CBS News, based on Tuesday's lunch discussions with Senate Republicans and conversations with senators throughout the afternoon, that the package will likely include roughly $50 billion in assistance for airlines, $250 to $300 billion in small business loans, and $250 billion in direct payments for Americans to be paid in April.\n\nThese direct payments may be structured in a way similar to the tax rebate in 2008 in the midst of the financial crisis. In that case, individuals received a designated amount, married couples received a certain amount, and additional funds were given based on the numbers of dependent children.\n\nThe direct payments are planned for those who fall beneath an income threshold. It's not yet clear how the payments will be funded. For the time present, the payroll tax holiday favored by the president is not under consideration in the package.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a press conference on Capitol Hill that senators will first vote on an earlier aid package that passed the House over the weekend before moving on to a much larger phase three deal outlined by administration officials just hours before.\n\nWe're going to move in warp speed for the Senate, which almost never does anything quickly, McConnell said. These are not ordinary times. This is not an ordinary situation, and so it requires extraordinary measures.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is leading negotiations for the administration, traveled to the Hill to discuss the measure with senators over lunch on Tuesday.\n\nWe just finished discussions at the president's request with the Republicans. I know there's been some rumors of the number. It is a big number, Mnuchin said afterward. This is a very unique situation in this economy. We've put a proposal on the table that would inject a trillion dollars into the economy.\n\nThe phase three proposal follows an initial $8.3 billion measure passed earlier this month to boost emergency funding, and the House legislation approved early Saturday providing paid sick leave and family leave to some workers forced to remain at home over the outbreak. This phase two bill passed in the House has a potential price tag of $104.9 billion over ten years, per the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nThe aide said that the phase two bill is expected to be passed in the Senate on Wednesday, and phase three by the end of the week.\n\nAt a press briefing at the White House, Mnuchin said the administration wants Congress to approve measures to get cash in the hands of consumers within the next two weeks, a proposal floated by Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Tom Cotton, among others.\n\nWe're looking at sending checks to Americans immediately, Mnuchin said. We have to do this now.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks during a press briefing with the coronavirus task force at the White House on Tuesday, March 17, 2020. AP\n\nMcConnell said senators will remain in Washington until they approve a phase three deal, and said Republicans who were reluctant to approve some provisions in the House's bill should put aside their concerns for the time being.\n\nWe're not leaving town until we have constructed and passed another bill, he said. My counsel to them is to gag and vote for them anyway, even if they have some shortcomings, and to address those shortcomings in the next bill.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats will support the House bill. He had proposed his own phase-three deal worth $750 billion on Monday, but said Tuesday the final figure may have to be higher than $1 trillion.\n\nHouse leaders are also looking toward the next phase of the response, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi laying out Democratic priorities in a third package. In a statement, she said the third phase of the response should include expansions of sick leave and family leave for workers, as well as tax credits to support the self-employed and gig workers.\n\nWhite House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland told reporters Monday that the price tag of any such measure was no issue for the president.\n\nThe president has instructed his team to look very expansively at what we need to do and not be impeded by the potential price tag of what's necessary here, Ueland said.\n\nMnuchin echoed that point on Tuesday, saying concerns over the price tag for a stimulus bill are secondary.\n\nI've said in different times, we'll fix the deficit, he said. This is not the time to worry about it.
President-elect Joe Biden unveiled his $1.9 trillion dollar coronavirus economic relief plan on Thursday evening. The expensive legislation contains three major targets: $400 billion for arresting the spread of COVID-19 and increasing vaccine capabilities; over $1 trillion to assist families needing direct financial support; and $440 billion in emergency funds for cash-poor small businesses and communities.\n\nI believe we have a moral obligation, Mr. Biden said in a speech on Thursday night from Wilmington, Delaware. In this pandemic in America, we cannot let people go hungry, we cannot let people get evicted, we cannot watch nurses, educators and others lose their jobs, we so badly need them. We must act now, and we must act decisively.\n\nMr. Biden in his American Rescue plan, calls for an additional $1,400 in stimulus checks for Americans, on top of the $600 that's already been approved, bringing the total stimulus to $2,000. Other financial aid includes expanding unemployment insurance by $100, bringing the weekly total to $400, and increasing the child tax credit to $3,000 per child.\n\nThis gets money quickly into the pockets of millions of Americans who will spend it immediately on food and rent and other basic needs, as economists tell us that helps the whole economy grow, Mr. Biden said in the speech.\n\nThe president-elect also wants to implement emergency paid sick, family, and medical leave, stabilize childcare centers with $25 billion in emergency funding, and forestall COVID-related evictions.\n\nHis proposed legislation also would also initiate his push for a $15 national minimum wage and for ending the tipped minimum wage.\n\nMr. Biden on Thursday also laid the foundation on how his administration will change the vaccine distribution process. The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure so far, Mr. Biden said.\n\nMr. Biden is proposing $400 billion dollars to boost vaccine infrastructure, with a specific focus on increasing the number of community vaccine distribution locations. An incoming senior Biden administration official reiterated confidence that the goal of providing 100 million vaccine shots in the first 100 days would be met.\n\nThe incoming official said the number is not dependent on an additional vaccine becoming available, like the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine that is awaiting the Food and Drug Administration's authorization. Under the plan, the vaccine will be free and available to everyone, regardless of immigration status.\n\nMr. Biden said he will detail specific vaccination procedure changes on Friday.\n\nCOVID-19 testing would also be expanded, with an additional $50 billion. A 100,000-strong public health jobs corps would help spread factual information about the vaccine and to contact-trace COVID cases.\n\nMr. Biden's coronavirus package proposes $170 billion for updates to K-12 schools to ready them for in-class instruction again. Funds could be used to reduce class size, modify space, improve ventilation or provide additional funding for summer school to make up for lost time.\n\nHigher-education institutions, including public colleges, HBCUs and other Minority Serving Institutions, could receive $35 billion in assistance. Biden's plan details that millions of students could receive an additional $1,700 in financial assistance with this money.\n\nMr. Biden's proposal to eliminate $10,000 of student loan debt is not included in this plan, but an incoming senior Biden official said during a press briefing that he still supports this idea and reiterated the Biden administration's plan to continue the pause on student loan payments.\n\nFinally, to assist struggling businesses, Mr. Biden is asking for $15 billion dollars to go directly to 1 million small businesses. He also wants to increase loans to businesses in need. Community transportation, tribal communities, and technology investments are also included in the bill.\n\nThis is the first of two bills Mr. Biden plans to address COVID-19. Mr. Biden said Thursday evening he will introduce his recovery bill in February at a joint session of Congress.\n\nHow will Biden convince Congress to pass this bill?\n\n\n\nCBS News reported on Wednesday the Biden White House has already begun trying to line up bipartisan support for the COVID-relief package, which could mean significant changes to the legislation in order to attract more Republican support. This goal was also communicated to the congressional aides on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Biden proactively addressed critics who not share his optimism of striking a bipartisan deal, saying unity is not some pie-in-the-sky dream, it's a practical step to getting the things we have to get done as a country, get done together.\n\nIf Mr. Biden cannot reach a deal with Senate Republicans, this package could still pass under reconciliation, a process sometimes used for spending measures. Under this approach, the bill would require only a simple majority to pass and would not be subject to being blocked by a filibuster. Most Senate bills require 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. This option would be used pass the Biden team's framework with only Democratic votes. Once the Georgia Senate election results are certified, there will be a 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would break any ties. With Harris as the 51st vote, Democrats will control the Senate.\n\nThis legislation is likely to face intense lobbying from congressional members and special interests, which could affect the final price tag.
Now that tax day (plus one) has come and gone, millions of Americans are looking forward to refunds. After all, nearly 80 percent of individual filers get a check from the IRS. According to the agency's most recent data, it has processed more than 101 million returns and issued more than 79 million refunds totaling $226.6 billion so far. The average refund is $2,864.\n\nMost people like getting that financial boost, and when considering the opposite, who would disagree?\n\nBut when you get to the heart of the matter, a refund is the result of overpaying income taxes during the year. Worse, you must file a tax return to ask the IRS to return your overpayment. When else do Americans gladly overpay for something and wait till the next year to get a refund?\n\nGetting a big refund -- more than a thousand dollars -- while carrying expensive debt can be a financial mistake. It's better to reduce your tax withholding, which increases your take-home pay, and use the larger cash flow to pay off your debt. Of course, your tax refund the following year will be smaller, but your debt will be smaller, too.\n\nThe risk is that you may not withhold enough tax -- and then find that you owe tax when it's time to file your return. Nobody wants that. Which is why we overpay our taxes and are happy to get a refund.\n\nThe next question is: What to do with your tax refund?\n\nSome people will need it to pay for essentials, like rent, food and car expenses. Others will pay down debt or boost savings.\n\nThe IRS says nearly 90 percent of refunds are directly deposited into a bank account. But that can be a temptation to spend.\n\nSo if you really want to do something productive with your refund, the first step is to move it out of your bank and put it into another account that's harder to reach. If you don't already have one, consider opening brokerage account, mutual fund or retirement account.\n\nHere are a few other ideas for making good use of a tax refund:\n\nContribute to a health savings account. If you have a health insurance plan with a high deductible, you can open an HSA. These accounts allow pretax contributions, which grow tax deferred. And withdrawals used to pay qualifying medical expenses are tax-free. The 2018 HSA contribution limit is $3,450 for individuals and $6.900 for families (those 55 and older can contribute an additional $1,000).\n\nPay down high interest rate debt. If you carry a balance on a credit card account, listen up. Interest rates are on the rise, and that means that your credit card debt will cost you more. The average rate on newly issued cards in 2018 has risen to 15.59 percent. When you pay down this debt, you'll also save money on interest and fees.\n\nIncrease contributions to your employer's 401(k) plan. Using your refund to save for retirement is a great move, especially when you get paid to do it. That's because many employers match their employees' contributions, for instance, 50 percent of the first 6 percent you contribute. That would put 9 percent of your pay into your 401(k).\n\nSave for your child's education. If you're planning to set aside savings for future education costs, consider opening a state-sponsored college savings plan. In one of these 529 savings plans, the money saved can be used tax-free to pay for future college tuition. Many states also offer a deduction on your state income tax return if you contribute to your own state's plan.\n\nMake extra mortgage payments. Finally, think about adding extra principal to your monthly mortgage payments. By making the equivalent of just one additional monthly payment on a 30-year mortgage each year, you can pay off that loan in about 18 years instead -- and save thousands of dollars in interest over that time.
Over the past decade, the much-vaunted freelance economy has spawned dozens of platforms designed to help people launch their unrealized dreams of independent work: from TaskRabbit to Fiverr to Upwork to Handy to the much-maligned Uber, to name just a handful.\n\nOne thing it doesn't seem to have created, though, is many full-time freelancers.\n\nThe portion of independent contractors in the workforce last year was slightly smaller than it was in 2005, according to figures released Thursday by the Labor Department. Just 6.9 percent of workers toiled primarily as independent contractors in 2017, down from 7.4 percent in 2005. There were slightly fewer on-call workers. The portion of temp workers and contract workers -- employees of a company who work for a client of their employer -- was flat.\n\n[I]t's hard for us to know if this reflects the strength of our economy or a structural shift, said Martha Gimbel, director of economic research at Indeed. It seems likely that this is due to cyclical factors giving [freelance] workers the ability to negotiate themselves into more stable work arrangements.\n\nThe data are puzzling to some, since many other measures indicate that freelance and on-demand work has exploded since 2005. Some studies by gig-economy platforms put the portion of so-called independent workers at a third or more of the workforce.\n\nThe government study, however, has some key differences from industry research. It only asked about a person's primary job, so it doesn't capture freelancers who moonlight on top of a day job. And it is time-limited, so it only captures the freelance workers at a single point in time.\n\nPeople may be working one week and not the next week, so if you look at one week's worth of data you dramatically undercount the workforce, Stephane Kasriel, CEO of the freelancing platform Upwork, told CBS MoneyWatch. A substantial part of the workforce is moonlighting.\n\nStudies done differently, such as those that look at tax data, indicate the number of people who dabble in freelance work is substantially higher than those who use it to replace steady income.\n\nSeasonal changes could also be a factor: The previous survey was conducted in February, while the one released Thursday was conducted in May 2017.\n\nOh, & 2 big caveats about comparing this CWSto the prior one: reasonable to think that contingent work is seasonal, so that will explain some of the difference between Feb 2005 and May 2017. Also those 2 months very well might not be apples-to-apples in the business cycle either — Ernie Tedeschi (@ernietedeschi) June 7, 2018\n\nIndependent contractors earned slightly less than traditional workers, while temp workers and on-call workers made significantly less money. Demographics play a role here, since temp and on-call workers are more likely to be African-American and Latino. Temp workers are also younger than the workforce overall.\n\nEven though they earn less, however, independent contractors overwhelmingly love their jobs, with more than 4 in 5 saying they preferred it to a different arrangement. Most temps, on the other hand, would rather have a traditional job.\n\ncon\n\nThese figures suggest that for some workers -- particularly those with specialized and in-demand skill sets, who also tend to be older -- independent work really is one path to a more satisfying life. That's the line that many independent work platforms have been pushing for some time.\n\nAs full-time employees, we tend to build our personal lives around holes and gaps that are left by our professional lives, said Kasriel. For freelancers, it's the opposite.\n\nBut labor advocates note that work satisfaction isn't incompatible with traditional employment. Full-time freelancers who eschew nine-to-five employment are often giving up much more than a portion of their pay.\n\nIndependent contractors don't have the right to a minimum wage, overtime or breaks, said Maya Pinto, senior researcher and policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project. They can be subject to discrimination based on age, race, gender or disability; they don't have the right to organize or the right to a safe and healthy workplace, or workers' compensation or unemployment benefits, and they bear the full cost of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIt's true, workers want flexibility, she added. But they also want basic security and the right to health care and retirement, and they shouldn't be forced to choose.
Los Angeles -- Teachers overwhelmingly approved a new contract Tuesday and planned to return to the classroom after a six-day strike over funding and staffing in the nation's second-largest school district.\n\nAlthough all votes hadn't been counted, preliminary figures showed that a vast supermajority of some 30,000 educators voted in favor of the tentative deal, therefore ending the strike and heading back to schools tomorrow, said Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of United Teachers Los Angeles.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, accompanied by leaders of the union and the Los Angeles Unified School District, announced the agreement at City Hall a few hours after a 21-hour bargaining session ended before dawn.\n\nThis is a good agreement. It is a historic agreement, Garcetti said.\n\nThe deal was broadly described by officials at the news conference as including a 6 percent pay hike and a commitment to reduce class sizes over four years.\n\nEducators, parents, students, and supporters of the Los Angeles teachers strike wave and cheer in Grand Park on January 22, 2019 in downtown L.A. at rally after tentative deal ending six-day strike was announced it Scott Heins / Getty Images\n\nSpecifics provided later by the district and the union included the addition of more than 600 nursing positions over the next three school years. Additional counselors and librarians were also part of the increase in support staff.\n\nMarianne O'Brien said the need for additional support staff was one of the main reasons she walked picket lines.\n\nThis is not just for teachers. It's also for counselors, nurses, psychologists and social workers, said O'Brien, who teaches 10th grade English.\n\nThe new contract also eliminates a longstanding clause that gave the district authority over class sizes, officials said. Grades 4 through 12 would be reduced by one student during each of the next two school years and two pupils in 2021-22.\n\nClashes over pay, class sizes and support-staff levels in the district with 640,000 students led to its first strike in 30 years and prompted the staffing of classrooms with substitute teachers and administrators.\n\nThe district maintained that the union's demands could bankrupt the school system, which is projecting a half-billion-dollar deficit this budget year and has billions obligated for pension payments and health coverage for retired teachers.\n\nDistrict Superintendent Austin Beutner said he was delighted the deal was reached. But he stressed that financial challenges remained.\n\nThe issue has always been: How do we pay for it? Beutner said. That issue does not go away now that we have a contract. We can't solve 40 years of underinvestment in public education in just one week or just one contract.\n\nUnder the tentative agreement, the district, the union and the mayor's office will work jointly to advocate for increased county and state funding for Los Angeles schools, according to the UTLA summary.\n\nThe Board of Education was expected to move quickly to ratify the deal, which would expire at the end of June 2022.\n\nCBS Los Angeles points out that the accord calls on the district to support a statewide cap on charter schools and provide regular reports on proposed co-locations of charter and public school campuses. The pact also calls on Garcetti to support a ballot initiative going to voters in November 2020 that would roll back Proposition 13 property tax limits on commercial buildings to increase state tax revenue for public education.\n\nWe have seen over the last few weeks the way that the city has rallied around public education, and quite frankly it's been breathtaking; it's been inspiring to see, Garcetti said agt the news conference, CBS L.A. notes.\n\nThe deal came as teachers in Denver voted to go on strike as soon as next Monday. More than 5,000 educators would be affected. The main sticking point is increasing base pay and lessening teachers' reliance on one-time bonuses for having students with high test scores or working in a high-poverty school.\n\nIn Oakland, California, some teachers called in sick last week as part of an unofficial rally over their contract negotiations, which also hinge partly on a demand for smaller class sizes.\n\nThousands of boisterous educators, many wearing red, and their supporters gathered on the steps outside City Hall where the tentative agreement was announced.\n\nThe crowd began cheering, blowing horns and chanting the initials of Caputo-Pearl as the smiling union leader emerged from the building and walked through the throng.\n\nJoaquin Flores, a special education teacher, said he believed he would support the deal unless it weakened health care or didn't go far enough to reduce class size.\n\nIt's almost like metaphoric, Flores said. The sun's out. When we started, it was all rainy and cold. I feel like it's a new day.\n\nTeachers hoped to build on the Red4Ed movement that began last year in West Virginia and moved to Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado and Washington state. It spread from conservative states with right to work laws that limit the ability to strike to the more liberal West Coast with strong unions.\n\nCBS L.A. says the LAUSD covers 710 square miles and has 1,322 schools, although 216 are independent charter schools, most of which were being staffed with non-union teachers and were unaffected by the strike.
ATHENS, Greece -Greece and its bailout creditors on Tuesday suspended talks on the country's austerity program until next week, after a new set of marathon overnight negotiations failed to produce a breakthrough.\n\nFinance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said the meetings in Athens would resume April 18, with an aim to reaching an agreement by April 22, when he is due to meet with his peers from the 19-country eurozone.\n\nHe said both Greece and its creditors -- other European countries and the International Monetary Fund -- agreed that some progress has been made.\n\nThe new pause in the talks, which were originally scheduled for completion last October, will allow officials participating in the negotiations to attend an IMF meeting in Washington this week.\n\nGovernment spokeswoman Olga Gerovassili voiced optimism that an agreement can be found in time. It is in the interest of all the parties involved, she said.\n\nGreece's left-led government is hoping to conclude the talks as soon as possible because that would allow the beginning of negotiations with creditors on easing the country's crippling debt load.\n\nThe main sticking points are creditors' demands for cuts in pensions under a sweeping reform package designed to keep the tottering system alive, plus tax reform and the degree of protection accorded to individuals and companies struggling to repay their bank loans.\n\nThe country has depended on rescue loans since 2010 and signed up to a third bailout last summer after the government ditched its anti-bailout policies to prevent a disastrous Greek exit from the eurozone.\n\nGerovassili insisted that Greece would honor its bailout commitments, but she accused the IMF of dragging its feet during the negotiations.\n\nThe Labor Ministry said agreement or significant progress has been achieved on the proposed pension reforms, insisting that there will be no reductions in basic pensions. It also said Tuesday that its proposals for a core national pension of 384 euros ($438) have been accepted.
IRS may already be behind on refunds\n\nIRS may already be behind on refunds\n\nIRS may already be behind on refunds\n\nA week into tax season, the U.S.' tax collector appears woefully behind its own projections on processing tax returns and refunds.\n\nAccording to the agency's own numbers from last November, the IRS expected to process 1.2 million electronic tax refunds and 300,000 paper refunds during its fourth working week of the year, from Friday, Jan. 18 to Thursday, Jan. 24. The following Friday-to-Thursday week, it expected to process a total of 4.3 million refunds.\n\nWhile the IRS is able to accept and process tax returns before the official opening of tax season (Jan. 28 this year), it's not able to accept large numbers of electronic returns before then, which is the filing format preferred by nearly 90 percent of taxpayers.\n\nThe IRS' November projections show it processing 1.2 million electronic refunds by Jan. 24 — a number that now appears highly unlikely, since electronic filing did not officially open until Jan. 28.\n\nAn agency spokesman said the IRS had started processing some returns in January, but did not have data on how many had been filed or processed to date.\n\nThe IRS is also coming off a 35-day shutdown that saw just a fraction of its workforce show up. The agency has said it will be doing everything it can to have a smooth tax season and minimize the impact on taxpayers, but it has also canceled three days' worth of Tax Court sessions over larger tax cases, and left open the possibility of canceling more.\n\nIt's likely there will be at least a week's delay from what taxpayers are used to, Jeanie Ahn, senior reporter for Yahoo Finance, told CBS News recently. Everyone is bracing for the most chaotic tax season in three decades, she said.\n\nLast year, 18 million tax returns were filed by the first week of filing season, which ended Feb. 2. A spokesman for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc., the country's No. 2 tax-prep company, said the number of January filers was much lower than typical this year, a drop he attributed to the effect of the government shutdown.\n\nSince 2010, the IRS has faced every tax season with fewer and fewer staff. This year, just over 70,000 permanent agency employees are on hand for a projected 155 million tax returns.
A semi-abandoned town in Italy is selling homes for just over $1 in hopes of luring foreigners to renovate the properties and revive its local economy.\n\nSambuca, a hilltop town in Sicily with sweeping views of the Mediterranean, is selling dozens of bargain basement-priced homes after other Italian towns and villages have made similar offers. Sambuca -- no relation to the liqueur of the same name -- has a population of fewer than 6,000 residents and is located about 40 miles south of Palermo.\n\nGangi, also in Sicily, started selling vacant homes for €1 in 2015, and Ollolai, in Sardinia, followed suit. At the heart of those efforts are attempts to revive their economies and preserve their cultures as young residents flocked to big cities and older inhabitants passed away, leaving a stock of abandoned homes in their wake.\n\nHome-rental company Airbnb is also offering to pay four foreigners to spend three months in Grottole, located in the southern province of Matera, through its Italian Sabbatical program. Participants will help the local community revitalize the village.\n\nThe small village of Grottole, with only 300 inhabitants and more than 600 empty homes, is at risk of disappearing and is asking for your help! the program's description reads.\n\nAn aging population\n\nItaly's birth rate has been trending downward for years. The Italians a few years ago set records for having the lowest birth rate recorded in history, at 1.1 children, said Steven Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute.\n\nHe said he's witnessed a number of initiatives aimed at encouraging procreation, none of which have been effective.\n\nThere are villages and towns where they are offering bonuses for every child born there because the birth rate is so low, he said. But there seems to be no combination -- around the world -- of economic incentives, at least in developed countries, to bring the birth rate up to be replacement, which would be 2.1 children, he said. I don't know if there is anything Italy can do.\n\nYounger residents of Sambuca have moved to urban environments, while its elderly inhabitants generally are not equipped to maintain a modern economy.\n\nOlder populations don't innovate and invest for the future, they just draw down resources they have already accumulated, Mosher said. Some countries have years of inventory of homes that may never be occupied again because there simply aren't people to occupy them. It's a drag on the economy.\n\nThousands of emails\n\nBut global interest in the newly listed Sambucan homes suggests the tactic is already working.\n\nIt's amazing I have had thousands of people expressing interest all the way from Dubai, Barcelona, and I have had tons of requests from New York, Giuseppe Cacioppo, Sambuca's deputy mayor and tourist councilor, told CBS MoneyWatch. He said he hasn't come up for air since the international community got word of the deal after CNN initially wrote about the plan.\n\nI didn't sleep last night because I was getting so many phone calls, he said. I received 39,000 emails in response to the offer, including people who want to buy whole blocks of houses.\n\nStrings attached\n\nThe homes -- which cost less than a slice of pizza -- are enticing, but do come with strings attached.\n\nBuyers must make a €5,000 (or $5,682) security deposit and commit to spending upwards of €15,000 (about $17,000) to revamp them within three years. The security deposit will be returned once the renovations are complete, CNN reported.\n\nPotential homebuyers should also come armed with a plan to keep themselves busy.\n\nThese places are small and very skewed toward older generations. Life is very quiet and simple and basic. There wouldn't be much to do beyond renovating your property and gardening, said Kathleen Peddicord, publisher and founder of Live and Invest Overseas.\n\nAnd fluency in Italian is a must, according to travel and retirement experts.\n\nYou definitely need to be comfortable in Italian if you are going to undertake any kind of labor project, said Kat Kalashian, editor of Live and Invest Overseas. You will need to speak Italian to get referrals and find labor, and you will need to speak Italian to work with them.\n\nProperty taxes\n\nBuyers can avoid paying property tax on the homes if Sambuca becomes their principal residence. Otherwise, a tax rate of up to 0.76 percent applies. A secondary tax, that varies across municipalities, also applies, in the range of zero to 3.3 percent. You could have zero point zero taxes depending on the municipality, Kalashian said.\n\nMax Dilendorf, a New York-based attorney who last year responded to a similar initiative, ultimately decided the offer didn't make sense after weighing the cost of a gut renovation against renting.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you are only going to end up being there once or twice a year, I think you are better off just getting an Airbnb, he said. But if someone is willing to relocate and live there, maybe it does make sense.\n\nPeddicord agrees that while it's a unique opportunity, it's not for everyone.\n\nIt would mostly be a labor of love and a life adventure. These properties really make sense for someone who is in love with the romantic idea of it, she said.
The White House's top budget official, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney, talked up the administration's plans for a simpler tax code while introducing the budget Tuesday, predicting such a change would help shrink the country's tax gap.\n\nSo, what is the tax gap?\n\nThe tax gap, simply put, is the amount in taxes individuals and companies owe the government, but that the government never receives. There are three reasons for that gap --some fail to pay any taxes, others underreport income, and yet others underpay their taxes, according to the IRS. Mulvaney said the president's proposed tax plan doesn't include an expectation that the gap will close, but pointed out how shrinking it would help the proposed $4 trillion budget. The tax gap in 2016 was $486 billion -- out of the expected revenue from income and corporate taxes of roughly $1.9 trillion.\n\nAlmost enough to close the deficit that year, Mulvaney said. And we don't assume an additional penny of that being closed as part of our tax reform.\n\nMulvaney said there are two reasons for the tax gap -- people either don't want to pay, which is always a problem, or filing out the form is just too hard. It's not easy to make headway into that first problem, Mulvaney conceded, but that second reason has a solution.\n\nIf you can really fill out your tax reform -- tax returns on a single piece of paper, you're much more likely to actually do it, Mulvaney added.\n\nHowever, Mulvaney's hopes of closing or even significantly shrinking the tax gap may be a stretch. The tax gap has remained relatively stable during the last decade, with the majority of the gap stemming from individual, rather than corporate, tax, shortages. The total tax gap was $450 billion in 2006, and the total tax compliance rate was 83 percent, according to the Government Accountability Office. The Obama administration made attempts to close the gap by stepping up enforcement, but probably only reduced it by $50 billion to $100 billion over a decade, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nMulvaney thinks a simpler tax code will help close the gap-- he reasons that one of the biggest reasons people don't pay taxes is that they don't want to or are unsure how. Much of the White House's pitch for tax cuts hinges not necessarily on cuts, but on how the plan -- still in a preliminary stage -- would make filing taxes simpler for the average American.\n\nIt's not that easy to get rid of it, Goldwein said. In fact I should say, it's impossible to get rid of it. It's not that easy to reduce it.\n\nSimplifying the tax code reduces an incentive to underreport and makes it easier to report the correct numbers, but no one approach or combination of approaches will eliminate the gap, Goldwein said.\n\nGAO, which analyzed the tax gap problem in 2012, pointed out that simplifying the tax code is only one way to help close the gap. GAO said the IRS also needs to improve customer service lines for taxpayers, devote additional resources to enforcement, expand compliance checks before issuing refunds and modernize information systems, among other things, to address the gap.\n\nThere's not some magic way to get an entire half a trillion dollars a year, Goldwein said.\n\nBut if the Trump administration managed to do what previous administrations have been unable to do and closed the tax gap with a one-approach solution, what would that more than $400 billion cover?\n\nThe answer is, quite a lot. That $486 billion represents more than 10 percent of the White House's proposed fiscal year 2018 budget. For instance, it would easily cover the proposed 2018 Medicaid budget of $408 billion, a good chunk of the proposed $600 billion defense budget, or much of the proposed $582 billion Medicare budget.\n\nThat would be huge, if somehow we could get that, we would have barely any budget deficit this year, Goldwein said.\n\nBut that's also kind of a fantasy, Goldwein added. That's kind of the equivalent of saying, what if we eliminate all government waste, fraud and abuse?
The House passed President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package early Saturday morning almost entirely along partisan lines. The bill now goes the Senate, although it included a minimum wage hike that the Senate parliamentarian ruled on Thursday cannot be included if Congress uses the budget reconciliation process.\n\nTwo Democrats, Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Jared Golden of Maine, voted with the Republicans in the 219-212 vote. Not one Republican voted for the bill.\n\nDebate on the bill went until nearly 1 a.m. on Saturday.\n\nThe bill, called the American Rescue Plan, includes $1,400 in direct checks for Americans making under $75,000, a $400 per week supplemental unemployment bonus, money for vaccine distribution, and funding to aid schools and state and local governments.\n\nAlthough previous coronavirus relief bills have passed with bipartisan support, the bill had been expected to pass in the House along party lines, as Republicans have criticized the high price tag and the inclusion of provisions they see as unrelated to the crisis.\n\nThe vote in the House came days after the U.S. passed the grim milestone of 500,000 American deaths from the coronavirus. Millions have lost their jobs due to the economic fallout, and supplemental unemployment assistance established by Congress late last year is set to expire in mid-March.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan is broadly popular among Americans, earning support from Republican voters as well as Democrats and independents. A poll by Morning Consult/Politico released on Thursday shows that 76% of Americans support the package, including 60% of Republicans.\n\nThe need is great. The opportunity is there, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Thursday.\n\nThe bill also includes a provision raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, even though the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the bill could not include an increase of the federal minimum wage if Congress uses the budget reconciliation process.\n\nCongressional Democrats opted to use the procedural maneuver known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, allowing it to be approved by only a simple majority in the Senate. Most legislation requires 60 votes in the Senate to advance, so the budget reconciliation process allows Democrats — who hold a 50-seat majority — to pass the bill without any Republican votes.\n\nThere are strict rules for utilizing the budget reconciliation process, such as the Byrd rule, which requires that all provisions in the bill be budget-related, and must not increase the federal deficit after a 10-year budget window. Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled that the minimum wage hike did not fit the parameters for budget reconciliation.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Pelosi said MacDonough's decision was disappointing.\n\nHouse Democrats believe that the minimum wage hike is necessary. Therefore, this provision will remain in the American Rescue Plan on the Floor tomorrow, Pelosi said. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 has not been increased since 2009.\n\nHowever, it's unclear that the provision raising the minimum wage would have been included in the final bill even if MacDonough had ruled that it was possible to include a wage hike in the bill. At least two Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, had expressed concerns about raising the minimum wage. Without support from all 50 Democrats in the Senate, the bill's prospects would be doomed.\n\nOnce the Senate considers its version of the bill, progressives in the House could threaten to withhold their support for the final package unless some kind of minimum wage hike is included. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested on Thursday that progressive members of the House should pressure their own party in ways similar to conservative Democrats in the Senate.\n\nThere are progressive Democrats that have that muscle in the House, Ocasio-Cortez said. If we as a party decide to stand down on our promise of elevating the minimum wage, I think that's extraordinarily spurious and it's something that as a party we could have a further conversation about how to fight for it.\n\nCongresswoman Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the House Progressive Caucus, told reporters on Friday that the Senate should consider eliminating the legislative filibuster, which would allow any legislation to pass in the Senate with a simple majority. Using budget reconciliation is a work-around that allows lawmakers to approve bills with a simple majority without torpedoing the filibuster.\n\nThe rules in the Senate have been really put there to preserve the power of the minority, Jayapal said. Now we have to show that it's going to make a difference that we're not going to get caught up in the tyranny of the minority that exists in the Senate.\n\nJayapal and other progressives have pushed for Vice President Kamala Harris to overrule the decision of the parliamentarian in her capacity as president of the Senate.\n\nA senior Democratic aide confirmed to CBS News that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is looking to add a new provision to penalize large corporations that don't pay their workers at least a $15 minimum wage, an idea which appears to be gaining traction.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Budget Committee and an outspoken advocate for raising the minimum wage, said Thursday that he would introduce an amendment to the package to take tax deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don't pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide small businesses with the incentives they need to raise wages.\n\nThat amendment must be included in this reconciliation bill, Sanders said.\n\nOther senators appear to be open to punishing corporations for not paying their workers sufficient wages. Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden suggested a plan B approach to the minimum wage in a statement on Friday, which would impose a 5 percent penalty on a big corporations' total payroll if any workers earn less than a certain amount.\n\nAt the same time, I want to incentivize the smallest of small businesses-those with middle-class owners-to raise their workers' wages. My plan would provide an income tax credit equal to 25 percent of wages, up to $10,000 per year per employer, to small businesses that pay their workers higher wages, Wyden said.\n\nRepublican Senator Josh Hawley, who joined Sanders in calling for $2,000 direct checks late last year, also introduced a bill that would require companies with revenues of $1 billion or more to pay their employees $15 per hour.\n\nAmendments only require a simple majority to be added to legislation, so an amendment on the minimum wage is possible as long as all 50 Democrats approve.\n\nRaising the minimum wage is widely popular, with a 2019 poll by the Pew Research Center showing that 67% of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15. It even has support in some red states, as demonstrated by a ballot initiative in Florida to increase the minimum wage increase to $15 by 2026 which passed with support from more than 60% of voters in the last election.\n\nJack Turman contributed to this report
LAS VEGAS - What happens in Las Vegas could have a ripple effect across the country if 50,000 casino-hotel workers employed at more than 30 of the city's world-famous resorts go on strike at any time starting next week.\n\nIf members of the union that includes hotel and food workers don't show up to work, it could cost the destination millions and lead to travel woes for anyone taking a vacation or business trip to Sin City. It could also send casinos looking for temporary workers amid low unemployment rates.\n\nAnalysts declined Wednesday to weigh in on the financial impact that a strike could have on casino operators. But the casinos and hotels aren't the only ones that would feel the squeeze. Local and state governments stand to lose millions from the impact on tourism.\n\nThe last time casino-hotel workers went on strike across Las Vegas was in 1984. That job action lasted 67 days and cost workers and the city more than $1 million a day each in lost wages and revenues, not counting gambling losses. The price could be much higher this time if the two sides can't reach agreements: The city has 90,000 more hotel rooms and gets an additional 29 million visitors a year than it did in 1984. More than 42.2 million people visited Vegas last year.\n\nStatistics from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority show visitation did not decline overall in 1984, with about 12.8 million traveling to this desert oasis. The agency on Wednesday said it's monitoring the situation but wouldn't say whether it expects visitation to decrease in the event of a strike.\n\nDavid Fiorenza, who teaches urban economics at Villanova University, said local and state governments will start to notice a hit to their sales tax revenue if the strike lingers. And if hotel stays decrease, less revenue will come in from the local hotel tax.\n\nFiorenza doesn't expect an immediate impact on the number of people visiting Las Vegas if a strike happens, but it will affect bookings if it lasts more than a few days.\n\nPeople who already booked to go out there are not going to cancel, he said.\n\nBut the strike is a lingering worry for those still planning summer vacations.\n\nWhat happens during the summer in Las Vegas is you get a lot of people who are traveling. They say 'We're going to visit family in California, and then we'll go on a trip to Las Vegas,' said Michael McCall, a Michigan State University professor of hospitality business. This would deter them. That's going to shut down everything.\n\nThe contracts of 50,000 members of the Culinary Union who work at 34 different casino-resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and downtown Las Vegas are set to expire at midnight May 31. Half of those workers cast ballots Tuesday, a majority of whom authorized a strike at any time starting June 1. Individual casino operating companies and the union have failed to reach agreements through negotiations that began in February.\n\nUnion officials say workers want to increase wages, protect job security against the increasing use of technology at hotel-casinos and strengthen language against sexual harassment.\n\nMGM Resorts International (MGM) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) operate more than half the properties that a strike would affect. Both companies have said they expect to reach agreements with the union.\n\nHowever, Fiorenza said major casinos have contingency plans, and he expects them to find ways to continue operating if a strike does happen, such as using managers in front-line jobs and bringing in workers from outside the area.\n\nOperators that have casino-hotels in other states likely have begun sending notices to some workers at those properties to draw them to Las Vegas temporarily, McCall said. It would be hard to hire short-term replacement workers locally because unemployment is low in Las Vegas.\n\nEric Brasure of Newark, Delaware, is planning a trip to Las Vegas to attend a Star Trek convention in the summer. He said he supports the union, and on Wednesday retweeted on his podcast's account a list of the hotel-casinos that would be affected by the strike.\n\nI fully intend to support the strike by not patronizing any casino where workers are striking, Brasure said in a Twitter message.\n\nBefore Tuesday, the union last voted for a strike in 2002, but it reached a deal before employees walked out.
The Internal Revenue Service expects taxpayers to pay their taxes on time — and it also holds itself accountable for sending out late tax refunds. Last year, the agency sent out $3 billion in interest to taxpayers whose refunds were delayed, up 50% from the prior year.\n\nThat's according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office, which assessed the IRS' performance last year during the coronavirus pandemic and outlined some risks to the 2021 tax season. The reason for the surge in interest payments due to late refunds is tied to the coronavirus outbreak, which caused a backlog of paper tax returns and prompted the IRS to delay the tax filing season by three months.\n\nIn a response to the findings, the IRS pointed to the delay in the tax filing deadline as one reason for the increase in interest payments. The agency must issue refunds within a 45-day window after the April 15 filing date, or else it owes interest on the refund. But the delay in the tax deadline meant the IRS had to pay interest going back to that April 15 filing date even though it had given taxpayers more time to file.\n\nToo much paper\n\nThe report also highlighted another factor: a pileup in paper returns that IRS personnel struggled to process after the pandemic shut down its offices and workers shifted to remote work.\n\nIRS' overall 2020 performance was significantly impacted by its reliance on manual processes such as for paper returns, and its limited ability to process returns remotely while processing centers were closed, the GAO report said. As a result, as of December 2020, IRS had a significant backlog of unprocessed returns and taxpayer correspondence.\n\nWhile the GAO highlighted the challenges of the pandemic as a culprit in the surge in interest payments, it pointed out that the IRS has been paying out more in interest payments on late refunds for several years prior to the pandemic. That's likely to increase for the current tax season until IRS addresses its backlog of unprocessed and suspended returns, the GAO added.\n\nIRS backlog\n\nTaxpayers aren't exactly getting rich from the IRS interest payments on late refunds, given that the agency's interest rate is 3%. The average amount of interest paid to taxpayers for late refunds was $18, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe IRS is still digging out from a backlog of tax returns filed last year, when the agency shifted its workers to remote work and stored paper tax returns in trailers until it could get to them. The backlog of unprocessed returns from last year still numbers in the millions.\n\nAccording to IRS officials, when IRS staff returned to work at processing centers, they resumed opening mail on a first in, first out basis — opening mail with the earliest received date, the GAO report noted. At the end of the filing season, IRS' mail backlog was significant — a volume of nearly 8 million — with IRS returns processing staff opening mail received months prior.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 individual returns are filed electronically, but the GAO found that more than 20% of businesses filed paper returns even though they could have e-filed, which is a faster option because processing is automated.\n\nIndeed, the IRS — which was still processing 6.7 million returns at the end of January — has advice for taxpayers in the current tax season: Use e-file.\n\nThere is no doubt this is the year to file electronically, Ken Corbin, the new chief taxpayer experience officer at the IRS, said last month. Taxpayers who file paper returns need to prepare for a lengthy potential wait.
The House passed a coronavirus relief bill shortly after midnight on Saturday following lengthy negotiations between Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. The bill passed on a bipartisan basis with President Trump's endorsement.\n\nIt will be considered by the Senate next week, although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cautioned that Republican senators will have to thoroughly read the 110-page bill before bringing it to a vote.\n\nThe package addresses the potentially devastating economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, including measures on free testing and paid sick leave.\n\nHere's what's included in the legislation:\n\nFree coronavirus testing: Federal health providers such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers, are required to provide free testing.\n\nFederal health providers such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers, are required to provide free testing.

Congress is expected to continue considering legislation to respond to the crisis in the coming weeks.
As the coronavirus promises to strain the nation's supply chains, top White House trade adviser Peter Navarro says he's delivering an executive action to President Trump intended to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and bring that manufacturing to the U.S.\n\nWhat I can speak to is this broader, interesting issue of how dependent the United States of America is on the global supply chain, not just for its medicines but for its medical supplies and medical equipment, Navarro told CNBC's Squawk Box Monday, as stocks plummeted amid the worsening economic impact of the virus.\n\nNavarro, in a recent interview with CBS News, said the impending executive action he has been working on would tighten domestic procurement by requiring federal agencies looking to purchase pharmaceuticals and medical equipment to Buy American. The medical supply chain has been a concern — face masks and other necessary medical equipment are made in China, where this strain of coronavirus is believed to have originated. Navarro is also pushing for a payroll tax cut to address the country's worsening economic outlook, an initiative that Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for, despite pushback from bipartisan lawmakers.\n\nThe executive action consists of a three-pronged strategy that includes the Buy American piece, streamlining regulations to allow for a quicker approval process for domestic products, and incentivizing new technologies. The goal of the order is to have a robust domestic production of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment on U.S. soil, Navarro said.\n\nThe best way to ensure adequate investment is to provide a stable, strong, long-term demand domestically for these products, Navarro said.\n\nThe Health and Human Services, Defense and Veterans Affairs Departments would be most affected by the possible change. Navarro argues the coronavirus crisis highlights that the U.S. is dangerously dependent on numerous nations for medicines, supplies and equipment, roughly 15 to 20 countries, not just China. The top trade adviser said the previous administration wasted numerous opportunities to address this in the face of crises that underscored this dependence, such as during the H1N1, SARS and MERS crises.\n\nThis executive order would target essential medicines and medical countermeasures— not just pharmaceuticals, but supplies and equipment needed to deal with emerging infectious diseases, as well as medical products and the supply chains that feed into those two categories, according to Navarro.\n\nEssential medicines refers to the over 400 medicines the World Health Organization has identified as essential for any nation to have. Medical countermeasures are products that the United States has identified to fight five threats: chemical, biological, radiation, nuclear, (CBRN), and emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19. This includes medicines, supplies such as face masks and gloves, and medical equipment like ventilators.\n\nThe executive action is expected soon — Navarro says it will be done in Trump time, meaning as soon as possible.\n\nThis president wants to bring our jobs home. This is especially important when our national defense and public health are at risk, Navarro said.\n\nPrashant Yadav, a visiting fellow at the Center for Global Development whose expertise is in global health supply chains, said such a possible executive order comes down to how it's implemented. The pharmaceutical industry should be encouraged to increase their resilience, meaning they should be encouraged to have more bandwidth to manufacture drugs on U.S. soil.\n\nWe need to build resilience into the supply chain, undoubtedly, Yadav said.\n\nPharmaceutical and medical supply companies should be required to demonstrate to the Food and Drug Administration that they're working towards building more resilience into the supply chain, he said. Resilience in practical terms means ensuring companies have at least two suppliers, sourcing for instance 50% of their products from New Jersey and 50% from China, he said.\n\nThe manufacturing of medicine and medical supplies is highly concentrated in China not necessarily because the cost of labor is cheaper, as many might think, but because of the availability of subsidies, the lower cost of capital, better access to utilities, and lower environmental standards, he said.\n\nIt's not the cleanest manufacturing industry, Yadav said, pointing to stricter environmental regulations in Europe and in the U.S.\n\nNow, the greatest supply chain concern for the U.S. lies in the future: will the U.S. be able to deliver all the pharmaceutical drugs and medical equipment the U.S. will need? Whatever production capacity there is now in the U.S. and in Europe, Yadav said he has less confidence in whether that capacity will remain available over the next few months, as workers at manufacturers may not be able to go to work.\n\nVentilators in particular are a concern, since orders for them at health care facilities will increase as the Coronavirus continues to spread. The Trump administration has been unable to say how many ventilators it thinks the country will need in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nOverall ventilator capacity and what we need in Europe or the orders that will keep coming in from Italy and France, orders from within the U.S. ... they will all aggregate up to quite a high number, which may be more than the current capacity of existing manufacturers, Yadav said. So we might have to think about bringing on board new manufacturers who might not be certified or approved to sell medical equipment in the United States, but we might have to think about how we bring them on board.\n\nYadav said the U.S. should also consider giving companies that produce ventilators a guarantee that if they overproduce ventilators months from now, the federal government will purchase them, or purchase them and allocate them to developing countries hit by the pandemic later in the year.\n\nThat brings me to another point, which is, in such a scarce capacity scenario, we also worry about the limited supply is going to be sucked up by what we need in the U.S. and what we need in Europe, and in such a scenario, what happens to a country in Africa which is also ... trying to buy ventilators, Yadav said.
With tax season officially starting on Friday, millions of Americans could be in for a shock: owing taxes on unemployment benefits they received in 2020. The federal government and most states consider jobless aid taxable income. But unlike a paycheck, taxes typically aren't automatically deducted from such benefits, with the IRS expecting its cut.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates people could end up owing as much as $50 billion in taxes on unemployment insurance benefits they got last year — as layoffs soared during the coronavirus pandemic — come the April 15 tax filing deadline. That could wipe out many taxpayers' refunds and even dent the economy.\n\nThese surprise tax bills would reduce tax refunds or possibly even require net tax payments for vulnerable households, which may force some to cut back on spending, analysts with the investment bank wrote in a report.\n\nFor now, the Internal Revenue Service is not considering extending the April 15 deadline or waiving penalties for Americans who find they underpaid taxes throughout the year, Ken Corbin, chief taxpayer experience officer at the IRS, said on a call Thursday.\n\nCongress could still ride to the rescue. Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill to exempt unemployment benefits from taxes, with worker advocates noting that taxing unemployment assistance undercuts the purpose of the payments.\n\nIn the meantime, workers can make their own calculations to see if they'll owe money. Unemployment benefits are subject only to federal income tax paid at income-tax rates (not Social Security or Medicare taxes that are taken out of employer paychecks.) People living in states without an income tax or in select states that don't tax such benefits — including Alabama, California, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia — don't need to worry, said Robbin Caruso, a partner in the tax practice at Prager Metis.\n\nRead on to learn about other ways doing your taxes might differ this year.\n\nMoved for work? You may owe in multiple states\n\nMillions of Americans who started working from home or relocated to a different state during the pandemic may find themselves owing state tax in multiple locations.\n\nMany millions of taxpayers will have more complexity this year — they'll have to file in two states, Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, told CBS MoneyWatch. A smaller number may experience actual double taxation.\n\nDuring the health crisis, and even as Americans started working remotely, employers continued to send taxes to the states they normally did — without adjusting for workers' new location.\n\nA number of states also have what are called tax convenience laws, under which the state collects taxes from workers based on the location of their employer, regardless of whether someone commutes to the office. Typically, a worker's state of residence will provide a credit for taxes paid to another state so that an individual doesn't get taxed twice on the same income.\n\nIf you moved permanently or temporarily last year — especially if you spent more than 180 days in a new state — it may be advisable to consult an accountant to figure out what tax applies to you. Double taxation could cost a lot.\n\nSomeone subject to this should basically think of a doubling of their state income tax liability, or potentially more, Walczak said.\n\nHome office expenses and deductions\n\nMany workers who've spent the last year with their office in their living room may be wondering if they can deduct the costs of setting up a home workspace.\n\nUnfortunately, unless you have a business, you can't, said Alicia Jegede, a CPA in Brooklyn, New York, and founder of New Gen Financial Planning.\n\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act barred workers from deducting unreimbursed work expenses — anything from news subscriptions to business travel to union dues — from their income. Jegede suggests that anyone who spent money on their work-from-home set up ask if their employer can reimburse the cost. The business can deduct it, but the employee can't, she noted.\n\nThere's one exception to this rule: Independent contractors and small business owners can deduct home office costs from their business income. To qualify for the tax break, the workspace must be exclusively and regularly used as a place of business, Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert at TurboTax, told the Associated Press. That means working from the dining room table doesn't qualify.\n\nSelf-employment costs\n\nWorkers who turned to the gig economy to make ends meet in 2020 could find themselves owing a lot more in taxes. For one, their payroll tax would be double what a regular employee owes — 15.3% on any income up to $137,000. This is separate from federal income tax.\n\nAs a result, gig workers and freelancers should make sure they're deducting all their business costs. Any money spent on work cuts into business profits — that includes equipment, office supplies, advertising or marketing-startup costs, or costs for a dedicated home office.\n\nGig workers for a delivery company should make sure to claim all the mileage they are eligible for, as well as costs for car maintenance, vehicle supplies or washing, which are eligible expenses.\n\nAbove-the-line deductions\n\nTaxpayers can deduct $300 worth of charitable donations this year, even if they don't itemize their deductions. The IRS estimates that about nine in 10 taxpayers now take the standard deduction instead of itemizing.\n\nTeachers can deduct $250 spent on teaching supplies from their income, provided their employer didn't reimburse those costs. That includes personal protective equipment.\n\nEarned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit\n\n\n\nTaxpayers used to claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which is worth between $538 and $6,660 depending on income and number of children, can continue to do so — with a twist. Taxpayers who had big income changes in 2020 can use their income from 2019 to qualify for the credit. The same is true for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), which is worth up to $2,000 per child.\n\nNormally, a taxpayer's income in the prior year will determine if they can claim the EITC. But the credit typically applies only to money earned from work. Unemployment benefits, though they are subject to federal income tax, don't count as earned benefits for the purposes of the EITC or CTC.\n\nWith many unemployed workers potentially facing a smaller credit this year or even owing taxes, Congress adjusted the eligibility criteria for the EITC and CTC as part of a December pandemic relief package, allowing taxpayers to use their 2019 income to qualify for these credits.\n\nThese are considered the two most valuable tax credits for low- and moderate-income working families. A family of four earning up to $53,000 can claim the EITC, while the CTC is applicable to families making as much as $400,000.\n\nThose expecting to claim either credit should be prepared to wait a little longer to get their refund, as the law requires the IRS to hold these refunds as it verifies claimants' qualifications to prevent fraud.\n\n\n\nFor taxpayers who file immediately, the refunds should land in bank accounts by the first week of March if there are no other issues, Corbin said.\n\nNo tax on your stimulus check — or that PPP loan\n\nAnd now for some good news: Americans don't have to pay federal taxes on any of the Economic Impact Payments the government has distributed as coronavirus relief.\n\nIt's a tax credit, basically, and it's a refundable credit, Caruso said. That means a person whose income is low enough could potentially owe no taxes and still qualify for a stimulus check.\n\nEligibility for the full stimulus payment last year included an income of $75,000 or less for a single person and $150,000 or less for a married couple; people who earned above those amounts may have qualified for a reduced payment. If you fell within the income brackets but didn't get a payment, you'll want to claim it on your tax return. If you earned too much to qualify based on 2019 but your 2020 income was lower, filing your tax return will allow you to get a payment based on your 2020 income. And if you had a child last year, you'll qualify for a back payment of $500 or $600 (or potentially both) if you haven't already received the dependent payment.\n\nSmall business owners whose Payment Protection Program loans were forgiven are also exempt from income tax on the value of the forgiven loan.\n\nUnlimited business losses\n\nWith many businesses last year losing money and even closing, Congress has increased the amount of losses a business owner can use to offset their income.\n\nWe're expecting more people to have business losses. Before, you could deduct up to $250,000 [in losses] for single people. Now you can deduct an unlimited amount, Jegede said.\n\nIf you had a large business loss but no other income last year, you could potentially wind up owing no taxes. A taxpayer could even use a large loss from 2020 to offset income for prior years, potentially getting tax refunds for, say, 2019 or 2018, said Robert Caplan, a partner at Caplan & Wong CPAs in San Mateo, California.\n\nNot only will their taxes go down this year, but also for five prior years, he said.\n\nInvesting gains — or losses\n\n\n\nMany people jumped into the stock market for the first time in 2020 — that might entail new tax obligations.\n\nThe most important thing to understand is that you only pay taxes on investments when you realize their gains. So if you bought a stock in 2020 and its value went up, you won't pay taxes on those gains until you sell. And if it sank in value, the same rules of realizing apply. Investment losses hurt, but you can use them to offset your gains, up to a limit.\n\nIt's also important to understand that gains are taxed differently depending on how long you held on to the investment. If you sell a stock you held for less than a year, it is taxed at the higher short-term capital gains rate, versus the lower long-term capital gains rate for investments held for more than a year.\n\nHigher-income households may also face a net investment income tax on capital gains and other investment income.\n\nMade a killing on GameStop shares? That won't come up until 2021 taxes, which aren't due until next year. But it would be wise start making plans or anticipated payments on those taxes now.\n\nAimee Picchi and the Associated Press contributed reporting.
JERUSALEM -- The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem reopened early on Wednesday after Israeli officials suspended a plan to impose taxes on church properties in the holy city. The iconic church, revered by Christians as the site of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, had been closed for three days to protest the Israeli tax plan.\n\nFather Sinisa, a Franciscan cleric, said that clergymen from various Christian denominations had continued their prayer routines inside the church throughout the closure, but he said the public must also be able to visit.\n\nIt's important to reopen the doors of the Church, to let the people who sometimes come once in their life to visit this holy place, he said. Because a holy place without people is nothing ... only the stones.\n\nJerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat said his decision had affected only commercial properties, such as hotels, restaurants and offices, and not houses of worship. He said other cities follow similar practices worldwide.\n\n\n\nBut angry religious leaders say their non-church properties provide valuable services for pilgrims and their local flocks, and fund important services like schools and health clinics.\n\nThey also accused Barkat of surprising them with the order and violating longstanding understandings with the churches. Barkat's office claimed the churches have debts of roughly $185 million.\n\nThe closure of the church raised tensions with the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, as well as smaller denominations, weeks ahead of the busy Easter season.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said a professional team, including representatives from the Jerusalem municipality as well as government ministries, was being established to negotiate with church officials to formulate a solution.\n\nIsrael also suspended legislation in parliament that would govern sales of church sales to private developers.
In 2020, Corvain Cooper was featured in the BET documentary titled Smoke: Marijuana + Black America. In a telephone interview from a maximum-security prison in Louisiana, the 41-year-old Cooper detailed his sentence.\n\nI'm serving a life sentence for marijuana, money laundering and tax evasion for a non-violent crime, Cooper said in the documentary.\n\nA year later, Cooper is free and at home, finally able to hug daughters, Scotlyn,15, and Cleer, 11, after spending nearly eight years in prison.\n\nI see my daughters and I finally got to tell 'em, you know, I'm sorry. Your dad's sorry. I had chose the wrong road...in trying to provide for you guys...And it took me away from you guys. ... I'm sorry for missing everything that I've missed, Cooper told CBS This Morning national correspondent Jericka Duncan exclusively.\n\nIt's been a long couple of years for Cooper and his family. He reflected on how his time behind bars impacted his daughter and his family.\n\nThe pain that I have caused on my kids and on my dad and on my mom and on my family and on my loved ones and the pain that I caused on myself, he said. When he was arrested in 2013, Cooper said he hadn't sold marijuana in at least four years.\n\nI had a clothing store, it was like a boutique....it was called SC clothing named after my kids Scotlyn and Cleer. I had their faces on the side of the wall, he said in the BET documentary.\n\nCooper was convicted for his involvement in trafficking marijuana from California to North Carolina. He was sentenced under the now widely-criticized 1994 federal crime bill's three-strikes rule.\n\nHe had two previous non-violent convictions; which were both later vacated. But because of those two convictions, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for his third conviction.\n\nI'm watching rapists get out and my brother is in prison facing life without the possibility of parole, Cooper's sister, Shqunda, said. Things have changed. You know what I mean? And he's not there all because of marijuana? And then it's legal here. So it makes it even worse.\n\nCalifornia legalized cannabis in 2017. Cooper said in the BET documentary that growing up in California, his children often saw marijuana dispensaries.\n\nMy kids have to roll by every day by living in California and they have to see more dispensaries than they can even see liquor stores. The clothing store that I built from the ground up, that I put my kids' faces on, had all events in the neighborhood, finally to make my dream come true turned into a dispensary...to change the clothing store to a weed store, he said.\n\nWhile the nation has been decriminalizing marijuana possession and its use over the last decade, relief for Cooper didn't come until the very last day of Donald Trump's presidency when he granted Cooper and at least 11 others clemency.\n\nHis life sentence was just one of 143 cases that received commutation during Mr. Trump's last weeks in the White House. Of the people who had their sentences commuted, at least 12 were serving lengthy time for non-violent drug-related crimes. Cooper detailed to Duncan what his final day of prison was like.n\n\nSo I am in a cell for about an hour and then they come to the door and say, 'Pack it up, you got five minutes to get out of here. You just got immediately released.' And I just break down, he said.\n\nWow. Just like that, Duncan said,\n\nJust like that...I made my first call and I called my mom. And she said—I'm crying uncontrollably. But she says, 'What are you crying for? Ivanka Trump called me at 12:30 and said that you that you're coming home, Cooper recalled.\n\nHe spent his homecoming spending time with his daughters—who were happy to have their dad home.\n\nIt's like to have my dad home; it's like a relief. Like it's like, I was when he was in jail, it was like I was missing a part of him. It's like a piece of me is back, his daughter, Cleer, said.\n\nIt was like memories lost. Like, I would see my friends have their dad there and they would pick them up and I didn't have that memory with my dad, his daughter, Scotlyn, said.\n\nCooper is now a dad determined to set an example by growing a message of hope.\n\nHow do you save someone like yourself at that time? Duncan asked.\n\nThe first thing I wanna tell them is they get to see the results. They get to see what actually happened to me. I got a life sentence, Cooper said. And I wanna show them the stuff that they're chasing is all fools' gold.\n\nCooper started a website selling clothing and also advocating for companies that legally sell marijuana. He called the BET documentary pivotal to raising awareness about his story and so many others. BET is a division of Viacom CBS.
Shoppers at Wegmans Food Markets across New York are no longer carting their groceries home in plastic bags. Starting Monday, the grocery chain is ditching single-use plastic bags, with a statewide ban set to take effect March 1 in the Empire State.\n\nThose who don't bring or buy their own reusable sacks can pay five cents apiece for paper bags, with any profits donated to local food pantries, according to the 101-store Wegmans chain, which also operates in neighboring Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Massachusetts as well as Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina.\n\nAcross its chain, Wegmans found that reusable bags account for only a fifth of all bags used. But a test Wegmans conducted in two stores in New York state found that customers opted to bring reusable bags when the company imposed a small fee for paper bags.\n\nOn average today, 20% of the bags used across all Wegmans stores are reusable. However, at our pilot stores in Corning and Ithaca, we've flipped that statistic so that only 20% of the bags used are single-use bags, according to Jason Wadsworth, Wegmans packaging and sustainability manager.\n\nThat said, the grocery chain has no immediate intention to remove plastic bags from its stores outside New York, with a spokesperson emailing CBS MoneyWatch: We don't have specific plans to remove them from stores in other states. However, we will continue to focus on helping our customers shift to reusable bags.\n\nOther supermarket chains are also moving away from plastic bags as more cities and states ban them. Plastic bags are considered especially bad for the environment as they are made with petroleum and don't decompose.\n\nWalmart, the planet's largest retailer, last April began offering reusable bags at the checkout counters in U.S. stores. Kroger, the nation's biggest grocery chain, in May said it would eliminate plastic bags by 2025.\n\nNew York is among more than half a dozen states to ban plastic grocery bags; others include California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine and Oregon.\n\nAlready complying with bag bans in several Massachusetts communities since 2014, Big Y Foods in August shelved plastic checkout bags at its more than 80 supermarkets across the state and in Connecticut, with the latter state enacting a 10-cent tax on disposable plastic bags.\n\nStop & Shop also dropped plastic bags, but only at its 91 stores in Connecticut. It also operates another 300-plus stores in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey.
Health Savings Accounts feature prominently in the new health care bill being considered by the U.S. House of Representatives, with a variety of changes in store.\n\nBut research shows not many participants are actually saving money beyond the initial tax break.\n\nMore than 20 million Americans currently have these accounts, which allow people with high-deductible health plans - above $1,300 for an individual or $2,600 for a family - to put aside money for out-of-pocket medical expenses and save leftover funds for future expenses.\n\nContrary to Flexible Spending Accounts, in which you put aside pre-tax dollars and have to spend it all in a year or lose it, there is no yearly expiration for HSAs. The account is yours for good.\n\nYou get a tax break for your contributions, and if you earn interest or investment growth on your account, that is also tax-free as long as you use the money for qualified expenses.\n\nThese accounts have sky-rocketed in the last six years, with 85 percent of the accounts opened since 2011, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, or EBRI.\n\nNew research shows how people are using them, which may shed some light on the best way to make changes.\n\nThe most prominent takeaway is that there is not actually that much saving beyond the tax break in Health Savings Accounts. Money goes in and comes right back out, with only a fraction held over.\n\nHere are some other key points analysts have learned:\n\nEmployer contributions matter. Want to encourage people to put aside money for their medical expenses? Have an employer start the kitty.\n\nThe average employer contribution to workplace HSAs is $868, with the average employee contributing $1,786, for a combined yearly total of $2,654.\n\nIn accounts not associated with a workplace, the average contribution was $1,713, according to Devenir, an HSA research consultant.\n\nAny minimal employer contribution - even just $500 - and you've essentially given them the jump start, said Steve Christenson, executive vice president at Ascensus, a retirement and savings plan provider. When you say 'here are dollars to start with and here's some additional information on how to keep funding it' - those two simple things go a long way.\n\nNot even close to the max. Among the propositions of the new health care bill is raising the maximum contribution allowed to HSAs, which this year was capped at $3,400 for an individual and $6,750 for a family. The bill proposes to raise that ceiling to be equal to the out-of-pocket maximum for high-deductible plans, which is $6,550 for individuals and $13,100 for families.\n\nWhat we know from current behavior is that just 15 percent contribute the maximum, according to Devenir. More than 30 percent do not contribute any money at all in a given year.\n\nShrinking savings. Most HSAs are churn accounts, and saving might actually be going down instead of up. Devenir's latest report found participants holding over less in 2016, just $5.7 billion, compared with $5.9 billion in 2015 and $6.2 billion in 2014.\n\nA HelloWallet study from 2015 found that nearly 30 percent of HSA participants spent nearly all they contributed in a year.\n\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing, as you still get a tax deduction for the contribution, said Paul Fronstin, director of Health Research and Education for EBRI.\n\nLosing to inflation. Most of the $37 billion in HSA accounts is sitting in cash, with only $5.5 billion invested in any way, according to Devinir. EBRI's study found that investments made up only about 3 percent of the total deposits. In today's low interest-rate environment, that means these accounts are not keeping up with inflation, and actually losing value over time.\n\nIf you think you're going to spend most of the funds, it doesn't make sense to invest it, said Evan Powers, a certified financial planner with Cypress Financial Planning in Charlottesville, Virginia, and an adviser for myfinancialanswers.com.\n\nThose who are saving and investing are doing better - they have an average balance of $14,971, seven times larger than those who do not invest.\n\nThe missing component is consumer education, said Ascensus' Christenson.
Warren Buffett is one of the richest men in the world. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns or has a stake in over 70 businesses such as Coca Cola, IBM, and American Express. But this is no ordinary billionaire. He's giving 99 percent of his wealth to charity and he thinks rich people should pay higher taxes.\n\nPerson to Person take you to where Buffett's mega deals are done. His private office in Omaha, Neb., is as unconventional as the man himself.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Charlie, Lara -- I'm glad to have you here at world headquarters. (LAUGHS)\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Why Omaha for you?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, you know, I was born here. I've always been happy here. II've lived various other places -- Washington D.C., New York. ...It's home. And I live five minutes from here. I've lived in the same house for 53 years. I've been in this building for 50 years. My car just automatically drives back and forth (LAUGHS). If I try to take it anyplace else, it won't go.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: So no desire to have lots of, a lot of mansions around the world, a big boat -- all those things that your wealth would allow you to do?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: I have every possession I want. I have a lot of friends who have a lot more possessions. But in some cases, I feel the possession possess them, rather than the other way around.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: There are some references to the University of Nebraska there, the Big Red. Does that football team mean something?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: It -- means a lot. Means everything. It -- in Nebraska, when there's a div -- when there's a divorce, the husband says, you know, You can have the kids, I want the tickets. (LAUGHS) ...Yeah, come on and look around a little here. (CHUCKLES)\n\nHere's a Nebraska helmet signed by Tom Osborne and a number of the top players. I've -- I've been red-shirted myself now for 61 years. But I'm ready to go when the need arises.\n\nLARA LOGAN: I see there's a sign that you were pointing to there above your -- your hallway.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, it -- if you leave the Notre Dame locker room, there's a sign, you know, Play like a champion today, and -- and all the players touch that as they go out on the field. And I figure, with Notre Dame's record, you know, (LAUGHS) who I am -- who am I not...to argue with that? ...We just touch this every morning when we come in and hope for the best. (LAUGHS)\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Take us into the hallway.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Let's go around, and we'll look at that.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: My goodness, look at this.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: We have all kinds of things here... Let's start with some of the sports material. Here's Ted Williams in his first game as a Red Sox player against Holy Cross.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: What do you admire about Ted Williams?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Ted Williams described in his book, The Science of Hitting, that the most important thing -- for a hitter -- is to wait for the right pitch. And that's -- exactly the philosophy I have about investing...Wait for the right pitch, yeah, and... wait for the right deal. And it will come... It's the key to investing.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Is that Tiger Woods I see?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: This is Tiger Woods over -- I caddied for him some years ago down at Isleworth. He was a terrific -- he's a terrific student. I mean he -- (CHUCKLES) picked up all kinds of things from the tips I gave him as I caddied. And...\n\nLARA LOGAN: Were you any good as a caddy?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, I would say that based on the size of the tip, no. (LAUGHS)\n\nLARA LOGAN: Can you take us into your office, Warren?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK, let's take a look.\n\nLARA LOGAN: Wow, that's very nice.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: It's a nice office. It's perfect. I've been -- I'll be happy here the rest of my life. It -- you know, it -- it is home to me. (LAUGHS)\n\nLARA LOGAN: How long have you been making deals from here?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, I've been making deals from this building for -- for 50 years. ...and I love this building and wonderful landlord. And -- they keep the rent down for me. (LAUGHS) Well, I'm a happy guy here.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Over your left shoulder, I see a picture of your father.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, my dad. That's his campaign picture in 1942. He was 39 years of age then. And he ran for Congress. ...And that picture comes from his campaign card. ...he went on to -- have a few more terms.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: You said to me once, Warren, that he was your hero.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Absolutely. Absolutely. I never saw my dad do anything as -- in his entire life that -- you wouldn't...feel good about being on the front page of the paper. And -- I mean he was, in every respect. He gave me unconditional love. He was -- supported everything I did. He was a terrific human being.\n\nThis is his desk right here, from, I don't know, 75 or more years ago. And my sister, older sister, Doris, found this little train that used to be on his desk when we were little kids...she had kept it...having found it, she gave it to me.\n\nLARA LOGAN: There's no computer that we can see on your desk. Is there, does that really mean you have no computer in your office at all?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Not in my office. I'm working on the abacus now. And if I get that mastered we'll go to the multiplication tables.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: There's hope for you yet. ...The phone seems to be the principle instrument there.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. It's - it - it -- it is the principle instrument, that, and -- and the pile of reading material ... it's just a question of kind of gathering facts, which come in mostly via print, and then thinking about 'em. And if -- if I can make one good decision a year, you know, we'll do OK.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Well, take the IBM investment which you recently made. I mean it is said...you were reading the annual report, and you saw opportunity there to invest in a company because you saw potential.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Charlie, I'd been reading IBM's annual report, literally, every year for 50 years. And then this year...I saw something that sort a clicked in terms of adding to my-- feeling of confidence. And -- so we spent $10-plus billion. (CLEARS THROAT)\n\nLARA LOGAN: What would you say most investors do wrong?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, they-- they-- think that what is important is next quarter's earnings. And they think they have to trade around, and they have to read news events and change their opinion ...And if people would...adopt the philosophy that they're buying something to hold for the rest of their life. ...they can't go wrong doing that.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: What are the other photographs in this room that -- that represent something (CLEARS THROAT) important to you?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well -- they almost all represent something important. I mean over here -- is my -- certificate from the Dale Carnegie course I took when I was 21. (CHUCKLES) I was terrified of public speaking. I -- oh, I couldn't do it. I couldn't get in front of a crowd and give 'ya my name. (CHUCKLES)\n\n...And finally, I spent 100 bucks...And I took this course. And not only did I get so I could talk in front of people, you know, I can't stop talking in front of people. (LAUGHS) -- and during-- during that class, I should mention, Charlie, I proposed to my wife during that. So -- if I didn't get my $100 worth (LAUGHS) from that class. And--\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: You also had received the Medal of Freedom from President Obama in 2010. Is that in this office?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: It's right here. I feel very good about that.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: What does the inscription say?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, it -- it goes on and on. But it -- (LAUGHS) it -- it says some-- it says some nice things-- Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Modesty -- modesty becomes you. (LAUGHS)\n\nLARA LOGAN: This is the baseball you were talking about.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, Willie Mays. We've got...Ted Williams, we got Joe DiMaggio all on the same baseball.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Wow.\n\nLARA LOGAN: Where'd you get that?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, a friend gave it to me. And - and -- and it's got -- you know, it's got a bunch of my boyhood heroes, and they're still my heroes -- on there.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: The New York Post and other newspapers were full of your recent visit to New York, and...you were seen and photographed with Jay-Z.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: That -- that is true. And Jay-Z had been out here about a year ago. And what I did was I admired his tie about six times. I said, Boy, that is a good (LAUGHS) looking tie, Jay. And (CLEARS THROAT) finally he said, OK, you win, Warren. And he took it off and he gave it to me. (CHUCKLES)\n\nSo I thought if I went to this opening -- I wore his -- the tie he gave me. And then, when I saw him, I started looking at his tie. And I said, You know, Jay, that is one good looking tie. And he said, Warren, he said, forget it, you only get one. (LAUGHS) ...but he is a very smart guy. And he's financially smart.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Here are my children here. Here's Peter and Susie probably giving me little advice at the annual meeting. And that's my son, Howard, over there.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: There's also a picture among the board of directors of Bill Gates. And you have become...obviously, well known because of -- of the commitment to philanthropy and -- and giving -- $30 billion or more to Bill to -- as part of his foundation. That grew out of what?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, it grew out of the fact that, when I was in my 20s, my wife and I decided, after we took care of ourselves and our family reasonably well, that we would probably have a lot of money left over. And the original idea was that I would pile it up, and then some day, she'd unpile it -- (LAUGHS) for philanthropy.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: But...I expected that she would outlive me, and she died in 2004. So I had to come up with another plan to take care of what would be -- now amounted to a very large sum of money, which I wanted to go back to society. ...I go to somebody that's better at it than I am.\n\nAnd you've got not only Bill and Melinda Gates of the Gates Foundation, but you've got my three children, and I've left them-- or I'm giving them significant amounts for their foundations. ...And I feel very good about it.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: You know, there's a lot of talk about America, and whether America's in decline. We've had -- the president mentioned it in his State of the Union address. You feel good and optimistic about America and its future?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: (CHUCKLES) Charlie, America's not in decline. I mean I was born in 1930, just imagine that you had foreseen 25 percent unemployment, 4,000 banks closing, the Dow going, from the day I was born, from 250 down to 42? I mean all kinds of things, a world war coming on. But this country, it moves ahead.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: There is one thing that's come up. It's fairness. And you have been making the point...that it wasn't exactly fair for you to be paying at a lower tax rate than your secretary. ...There is also the -- now the Buffett Rule. Explain to us what the Buffett Rule is.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: It encompasses the idea that people who are extremely rich, who have benefited enormously from this society, should have a tax rate...that's at least as high as the people that work for them. And the people of this office averaged 36 percent.\n\nMy figure was 17 percent. So clearly-- something is out of whack. And, you know, nobody's gonna pay more than is required. Mitt Romney doesn't, I don't, you know. ...And, incidentally, I don't fault M -- Governor Romney at all. He paid what -- the Congress told him to. ...we were promised that a rising tide would lift all boats. A rising tide has lifted all yachts.\n\nIf you're gonna talk about shared sacrifice -- we have not had an ounce of shared sacrifice from the very rich.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: When you look at the future, your own future -- are there things that you want to accomplish? Are there goals that still are there for you?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: I'm doing what I love, Charlie. I -- I've got great news for you, Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Yeah?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: When you're 81, you're (LAUGHS) gonna have more fun than you're having now. I mean 81 is a great year. (LAUGHS) I look forward to doing what I do ... I forget whether it was Mel Ott, when he was playing for the Giants or somebody, said, You know, they -- you mean they pay me for this? (LAUGHS) That's the way I feel.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Warren, thank you very much. This been a remarkable visit.\n\nLARA LOGAN: Thank you very much.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Thanks for joining me.\n\n(CHUCKLES) And Charlie, be sure -- be sure, if this is gonna be on with George Clooney (CHUCKLE), be sure you keep explaining to your viewers which one of us is which, because he gets called Warren a lot.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Oh, does he really?\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: And - and -- and your viewers are gonna get very confused about which one of us you're interviewing unless you make it perfectly clear. (LAUGHS)\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: We'll do our best. We - we -- we're basically saying that -- that these are the two sexiest men in America today. So that's sort of --\n\nLARA LOGAN: Yeah.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: -- the way we're pitching this.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: I think that's the way to do it. And I think saying the two is the best way to do it, because you wouldn't want him to feel bad if you're writing this, right? (LAUGHS). Thanks to both of you.\n\nBuffett turns to leave and walks back towards his office.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Thank you very much. Warren. Great to see you ...\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE: Go back to work.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK (LAUGHS).
WASHINGTON—Borrowing a word from Democrats, a new White House report says changes made to the Affordable Care Act under President Trump didn't amount to sabotage.\n\nDue out Friday, the report from the Council of Economic Advisers says Obama-era subsidies that help low- and middle-income customers pay their premiums will keep HealthCare.gov afloat even if some healthy people drop out or seek other coverage because of Trump's changes. Nearly 90 percent of customers get taxpayer-provided assistance.\n\nThe report looks at three big changes under Mr. Trump that affect former President Barack Obama's health care law. They are congressional repeal of the law's unpopular fines on people who go uninsured, association health plans for small businesses that can be marketed across state lines, and low-cost short-term health insurance that doesn't have to cover pre-existing conditions or basic benefits like prescription drugs.\n\nThese reforms do not 'sabotage' the ACA but rather provide a more efficient focus of tax-funded care to those in need, the report says. The council is a White House agency that advises the president.\n\nLarry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation said less regulation isn't automatically an act of sabotage, but Mr. Trump has made clear his hostility to Obamacare.\n\nThe president seemed to take pride in undermining the ACA, but now his administration is resisting the argument that they have undermined the health law, said Levitt, who reviewed the report for AP. They can point to benefits of deregulation, but will also have to live with the costs, which include higher premiums for middle-class people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe report comes as House Democrats under Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are moving to shore up the ACA, including trying to undo some of Trump's insurance changes. Although such a rollback seems unlikely to succeed under divided government, there has been bipartisan support for measures that would help reduce premiums and guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions. Restoring the ad budget for HealthCare.gov slashed by Mr. Trump is also a possibility.\n\nDemocratic White House hopefuls are seizing on health care as an issue, with some pushing for a government-run system that would cover all Americans and replace Obamacare.\n\nAbout 10 million people continue to get private insurance through the ACA's subsidized markets, or exchanges, and another 12 million are covered by its Medicaid expansion. The GOP's drive to repeal the ACA in 2017 fell flat, and Democrats effectively blocked another try by gaining control of the House.\n\nCasey Mulligan, chief economist for the White House council, said it turns out that the penalty for people going uninsured wasn't really essential for the Obama health law to function. The subsidies were more important.\n\nRemoving the tax penalty and opening up more affordable options was able to save taxpayer dollars, give families more choice, without destabilizing the exchanges, he said.\n\nThe report didn't address constitutional arguments in a Texas court case against the ACA brought by red-state officials. But its economic analysis could have a bearing on that case.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that the whole law was made unconstitutional by congressional repeal of the fines on the uninsured. A federal district court judge agreed, and that ruling is on appeal. The Justice Department has said in connection with the case that it will no longer defend the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nNow the White House report undercuts the notion that the tax penalties at issue in the case are central to the health law. Officials at the Council of Economic Advisers said they're not policymakers or lawyers, but economists.\n\nThe report also claims $450 billion in consumer benefits over the next 10 years based on broader availability of less costly insurance options, reduced taxpayer spending on subsidies, and the cancelled fines. But it acknowledges that premiums will go up for some middle- and upper-income consumers.\n\nKaiser Foundation analyst Levitt said $450 billion seems high to him.
LOS ANGELES -- Johnny Depp sued his former business managers on Friday alleging they mismanaged his earnings throughout a lucrative period of his career, although the company says the actor's spending is to blame.\n\nDepp's lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court against The Management Group seeks more than $25 million, alleging its owners failed to properly pay his taxes, made unauthorized loans and overpaid for security and other services.\n\nMichael J. Kump, an attorney for The Management Group, calls Depp's lawsuit a fabrication and wrote in a statement that Depp never alleged any wrongdoing. The company did everything possible to protect Depp from his irresponsible and profligate spending, Kump wrote.\n\nDepp's lawsuit accuses the company and its owners, attorneys Joel and Robert Mandel, of receiving $28 million in payments for their services over the roughly 16 years they managed his finances. The company actively concealed the true state of Mr. Depp's finances while driving him deeper and deeper into financial distress, the lawsuit states.\n\nDepp hired the Mandels in 1999 and their compensation was not subject to a written contract, his lawsuit states. It states they received 5 percent of his income on hit films such as the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and other major releases, including Alice in Wonderland and the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nIt alleges the company failed to file Depp's tax returns on time, costing him nearly $5.7 million in penalties. The lawsuit also alleges the company overpaid for several services, including forgetting to terminate the lease on a home where Depp's mother lived temporarily, and spending $8 million on security between 2012 and 2015 alone.\n\nDepp learned of the problems after hiring a new management company in March 2016, the complaint states.\n\nKump wrote that Depp owes The Management Group $4.2 million from a $5 million loan they provided the actor. His tactics and lawsuit will fail, and he will be forced to pay back the loan as promised, Kump wrote.\n\nThe lawsuit came on the same day Depp finalized his divorce from actress Amber Heard. Their divorce judgment calls for the actor to pay his ex-wife $7 million in installments -- which she has earmarked for two charities -- while allowing him to keep numerous properties and vehicles.\n\nDepp isn't the only blockbuster star to take his former managers to court alleging mismanagement. Nicolas Cage sued his former business manager seeking $20 million for alleged mismanagement in 2009 and the manager in a countersuit cited the actor's spending for his financial troubles. The case was resolved before trial.
It's tax time — here's when to expect your refund The IRS started processing tax returns this week. Here's when to look for your refund.
CALERA, Ala. -- Kathleen Dawn West described herself as a full-time wife and mom on Facebook but lived another life on other social media platforms, calling herself an exhibitionist and posting risque photos with a chance for subscribers to see sexier images for $15.99 a month.\n\nWest, 42, was found dead outside her home near Birmingham, and authorities are now faced with a question: Did West's online activities play a role in her death?\n\nPolice have classified West's death as a homicide, but they haven't said how she died. What appears to be the remainder of a blood stain darkens the asphalt across the street from the two-story brick home she shared with her husband and middle school-age daughter.\n\nNo charges had been filed by Friday, six days after she died. But the mysterious nature of West's death - she was found dead early Saturday in the quiet bedroom community of Calera, a town of 14,000 people about 35 miles south of Birmingham - has people buzzing.\n\nAt least two Facebook groups with more than 2,200 members total have been created to discuss the case, and neighbors are concerned in West's subdivision, where homes are still under construction.\n\nIt's shocking that it happened so close to home, so all you can do is worry and think about your family, and that's all I've been doing, Xavier Lee, who lives two door down, told CBS affiliate WIAT-TV.\n\nWord of West's death was met with sadness at the gym where she worked out until dropping her membership a few months ago.\n\nShe'd come in, do her thing and leave. She kind of kept to herself, said Austin Lockhart, owner of Fit 24 Calera. She'd wave and smile. She was a nice lady.\n\nOn Facebook, West posted lots of selfies and commenters often mentioned her attractiveness. But there were also photos of her wedding to longtime husband William Jeffrey West and images of West and her daughter playing in the snow last month.\n\nBut West, a Florida native with blonde hair and a resemblance to Marilyn Monroe, seemed like a different person on other online accounts.\n\nWith a personal description that included exhibitionist, West had a private Instagram account with nearly 52,000 followers that linked to a paid site that featured adult content and naughty fun. Some of the images were included on a site for mature hotties.\n\nSimilar content was posted on Twitter, where West's presence began March 2016.\n\nInitially, West just tweeted links to a site where she sold clothing items, including dresses, coats, shoes and kid's clothing. The feed took a sharp turn Aug. 11, when she tweeted: Happy Frisky Friday - Let's get this party started, with a link to the pay-per-view site. The description included a link to a wish list page where viewers could purchase lingerie for her.\n\nThe posts continued until the morning before her death, when West tweeted a link to sell a women's wool jacket. A few days earlier, she had posted a lingerie photo showing her bare buttocks that linked to her adult site.\n\nIn Calera, neighbors don't know what to think about West's slaying.\n\nThis child doesn't have their mother anymore. Don't know why, don't know what happened, that led up to the incident, but to wake up to that news, it makes you think, Lee said.\n\nThat's the sad thing about it, another neighbor told WIAT-TV. You've got a little girl that's not gonna have her mother anymore.\n\nFederal court records show West and her husband filed for bankruptcy in 2007 while living in Cartersville, Georgia, but the case appeared to be handled routinely and closed within months. Tax records indicate they moved into the home in Calera in 2015. It was valued at $169,000 last year.
Some Senate Democrats are urging President Joe Biden to overhaul the nation's approach to handing out stimulus payments, the direct financial relief deployed by Congress to help millions of Americans affected by the economic collapse that followed the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nInstead of providing discrete rounds of stimulus checks that are negotiated each time and arrive months apart, the federal government should provide recurring checks to help families get by until COVID-19 is over, the 10 lawmakers said in a letter released on Tuesday.\n\nThe request comes as the Senate takes up Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package this week, which would include a third round of stimulus checks that would direct $1,400 to millions of eligible Americans. Congress distributed $1,200 checks a year ago under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and sent an additional $600 payment in December as part of a broader stimulus bill. The senators didn't specify an amount they are seeking for monthly direct aid.\n\nThe idea of issuing recurring stimulus payments as a way to speed up the economic recovery has been championed by progressives and some Democrats. In January, more than 50 House members urged the Biden administration to back a proposal for $2,000 monthly payments until the pandemic ends.\n\nSupporters of the idea point out that financial hardship remains widespread around the U.S. almost a full year after COVID-19 effectively shuttered the economy. Despite the ongoing recovery, a third of adults are struggling to pay their bills, while employers have slashed roughly 10 million jobs from their payrolls during the crisis, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe decades of research on stimulus checks back up the argument that much of this is spent, which helps stimulate the economy, and sources like the Census show there is immense need for more funding despite the fitful recovery, said Claudia Sahm, an economist who has worked at the Federal Reserve and the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.\n\nShe added, The reason we aren't in the 1933 world when things were really bad is because the federal government and Federal Reserve stepped in — but we aren't out of the woods yet.\n\nThe senators who signed the letter, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon, argue that aid such as enhanced unemployment benefits hasn't reached every family hurt by the economic crunch.\n\nMillions do not qualify for unemployment insurance after seeing their hours reduced, switching to lower-paying jobs, or temporarily leaving the workforce to care for family members during the pandemic, they wrote in the letter. Direct payments are crucial for supporting struggling families who aren't reached by unemployment insurance.\n\n$1,400 pushback?\n\nStill, such arguments are unlikely to gain traction among congressional Republicans and even some moderate Democrats given that many have already voiced opposition to the $1,400 checks that are part of Mr. Biden's American Rescue Plan. Some lawmakers have also called for the the third round of stimulus checks to be distributed to fewer households by focusing on lower-income Americans.\n\nUnder the American Rescue Plan, a person's income is the chief determinant of whether they'll get a check, as well as the payment amount — similar to the previous two rounds of stimulus checks.\n\nSingle people could receive as much as $1,400 each, while married couples filing jointly could receive $2,800. Only individuals earning up to $75,000 would get the full payments, as would married couples with incomes up to $150,000. For incomes above those thresholds, payment amounts would decline, phasing out completely for single individuals earning above $100,000 and married couples with a combined income of more than $200,000.\n\nSome lawmakers have cited research that shows higher-income families are rebounding well from the pandemic's economic impact, as a rationale for lowering those income thresholds. Given that debate, many lawmakers are unlikely to support recurring stimulus payments.\n\nEven so, some elements of the American Rescue Plan could provide a similar form of ongoing relief to some households. First, it would direct an extra $400 per week to unemployed Americans, up from $300, which would be helpful to jobless workers and their families but wouldn't help those who are struggling with cut hours or other income losses.\n\nThe bill also would expand the Child Tax Credit and transform it from an annual break claimed on tax returns — and which typically shows up in people's annual refunds — into a monthly payment. Under the plan, the tax credit would rise from $2,000 to $3,600 for children up to 6 years old and to $3,000 for children up to age 17. The IRS would pay the tax credit in monthly installments. That means that a family with two children under 6 could receive monthly checks of $600 from the IRS, for example.\n\nIn making their argument, the senators noted that the $1,400 isn't likely to tide many families over for very long.\n\nFamilies shouldn't have to worry about whether they'll have enough money to pay for essentials in the months ahead as the country continues to fight a global pandemic, they wrote. Almost six in 10 people say the $1,400 payments set to be included in the rescue package will last them less than three months.
Parenthood isn't cheap. But come tax time, parents and guardians of kids can take advantage of a number of tax savings that aren't available to the general public.\n\nThe Child Tax Credit is the best-known of these, since it doubled in size recently with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. But parents can also take advantage of tax perks for some child-care expenses — including for adult kids.\n\nChild Tax Credit\n\nThis tax credit can reduce your liability up to $2,000 per child. It can also give you back up to $1,400 even if you had no tax liability, making it one of the most valuable tax credits.\n\nSome 22 million households, or about 1 in 7 taxpayers, claimed the Child Tax Credit in 2017, the most recent year for which IRS data are available. The figure last was likely much higher, since the late-2017 tax law changes more than doubled the maximum income someone could earn and still qualify for the credit.\n\nThe IRS lists seven criteria for a child to be eligible for the credit:\n\nThe child needs to be a U.S. citizen or legal resident\n\n\n\nShe should be no older than 16 at the end of the tax year\n\nThe child needs to be your child, foster child, sister or brother, or a descendant of one of them (such as a niece, nephew or grandchild)\n\nYou need to claim the child as a dependent on your tax return\n\nThe child cannot provide more than half her own living expenses\n\nThe child can't file a tax return as part of a married couple\n\nThe child should have lived with you for more than half the year\n\nThe residency requirement is structured so that a single child can't be claimed by more than one taxpayer for a given year. But its complexity can lead to confusion, especially in multi-generational households, said Nina Olson, founder of the Taxpayer Rights Center and the National Taxpayer Advocate from 2001 to 2019.\n\nBecause of the dynamics of the American family, children move back and forth between separated parents; they may be living with grandparents; they may be living with unmarried parents, Olson told CBS News.\n\nIf you're just caring for a child and it's your cousin, that's not necessarily going to qualify you for the tax credit, she explained. That's where you really get into people claiming something that maybe makes sense, but doesn't qualify under the law.\n\nWhat about divorce?\n\nIf you have one situation that can cause problems, it's children of divorced parents, said Mark Jaeger, director of tax development at TaxAct. Sometimes they may not understand who should be claiming what child, and it causes some complexities.\n\nA divorce decree will usually spell out who can claim the child, but individual families can make decisions differently, Jaeger notes. Sometimes parents will alternate years, with one claiming the child tax credit in odd years, and the other claiming them in even years. Or, if two children are involved, one parent can claim each child.\n\nStill, it's not always foolproof.\n\nI've had situations in my practice where I've had parents come in and complain to me that, even though they're legally entitled to claim a child on their tax return, their former partner has claimed the child and gotten extra tax refunds, said Jonathan Medows, a CPA based in Manhattan. It created a fight with the IRS to get their refunds.\n\nFor that reason, Medows tell clients claiming the credit to file as early as possible.\n\nIf your dependent is 17 or older\n\nChildren who are 17 or older won't qualify you for the full Child Tax Credit, but you can get up to $500 per person through a dependent care credit. You can claim an adult child or an aging parent, for instance — as long as that person meets the IRS' definition of a dependent.\n\nChild-care costs\n\nIn addition to the Child Tax Credit, working parents can deduct some of the cost of child care. If you paid someone to care for your kids so that you could work or look for work, you likely qualify. The deduction limit is $3,000 for a single child, or $6,000 for two or more children.\n\nA quick reminder of the difference between tax credits and tax deductions: Credit reduces the amount you owe in taxes dollar-for-dollar, making them generally more valuable than deductions. A deduction reduces the amount of your income on which you have to pay taxes, so its value to you will depend on what tax bracket you fall into.
Walter Jones, a 13-term Republican congressman from North Carolina who made a name for himself by becoming an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq after initially supporting the invasion, died Sunday afternoon, his office announced. He died on his 76th birthday.\n\nIn a statement, his office praised Jones as a man of the people and a champion of the men and women serving in the military.\n\nCongressman Jones will long be remembered for his honesty, faith and integrity. He was never afraid to take a principled stand. He was known for his independence, and widely admired across the political spectrum, the office wrote Sunday night. Some may not have agreed with him, but all recognized that he did what he thought was right.\n\nJones, whose health had deteriorated after he fell and broke his hip, had been in hospice care since late January.\n\nRep. Walter Jones, R-North Carolina, poses for a portrait in his office on Capitol Hill, on Wed., Oct. 25, 2017, in Washington. AP\n\nAfter initially running for a North Carolina congressional seat as a Democrat in 1992, Jones was first elected to Congress in 1994 during the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich. Although he was a reliable Republican vote for most of his nearly 24-year tenure, Jones gained notoriety for sometimes breaking with his party. Most recently, he did not support the 2017 GOP bill to overhaul the nation's tax system — one of President Trump's few legislative achievements with a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nIn 2002, like most members of his party, he voted to authorize the invasion of Iraq during the administration of President George W. Bush. But he later expressed deep regret and vowed to atone for his support of the war. About 4,000 Americans and tens of thousands of Iraqis have died as a result of the conflict.\n\nAfter his metamorphosis, Jones became a staunch opponent of U.S. military engagement abroad and took part in bipartisan efforts to curtail the White House's power to deploy troops on foreign soil, including in Syria.
Although tens of millions of U.S. workers stand to benefit from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, roughly as many Americans would not.\n\nThe proposed bill, which the Senate is expected to vote on this week after the House passed similar legislation last weekend, could provide billions of dollars to workers affected by the coronavirus — a key step in propping up an economy that is quickly sliding into recession.\n\nThe measure is a huge, huge first step, said Kathleen Romig, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Millions of people are going to get some paid time off that they would not have otherwise, and employers are getting a big government subsidy.\n\nShe added: People are already starting to take this leave, with or without emergency benefits.\n\nStill, unless changes are made to the bill, more than 60 million Americans would be ineligible for the two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of family and medical leave it offers for those impacted by the global pandemic. That's because larger companies, those with 500 or more employers, are exempt from the proposal's provisions.\n\nFor now, the bill's status remains fluid. House lawmakers passed a series of corrections to their bill Monday night. In the Senate, Kentucky Republican Rand Paul is reportedly threatening to delay a vote unless lawmakers include additional means of funding the benefits expansion.\n\nMy understanding is changes are being made as we speak, Sarah Jane Glynn, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. Whether that leads to substantive revisions in the bill or minor technical fixes remains to be seen, she added.\n\nWhat the House is proposing\n\nThe House's latest proposed changes to its measure stipulate that:\n\nCompanies would not be compensated for sick days they already provide workers, although they could be reimbursed for health care premiums for employees on emergency sick leave.\n\nThe right to paid-family leave would only apply to parents whose children's school or childcare facility had closed due to the coronavirus.\n\nHealth-care providers and emergency responders — along with workers who had been in quarantine or caring for a family member with the virus — would not be eligible for the additional 10 weeks of paid leave.\n\nIn the original version of the bill, all workers who received paid sick time would be eligible for another 10 weeks of paid leave at two-thirds pay.\n\nThere is a risk that the Senate could look to make alterations to the House bill, though we expect that the pressure to act rapidly, and the bipartisan nature of the current text, will reduce the likelihood of changes, Height Securities analysts Clayton Allen and Hunter Hammond said in a report.\n\nThe paid sick leave provision — the center of negotiations last week between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — is complicated, according to the analysts. It mandates that employers with less than 500 employees fund paid leave at varying rates for varying amounts of time, with wide variations for different circumstances, they wrote. Government tax credits would offset some of those costs.\n\nThe 500 employee cap likely leaves millions of Americans without the new benefit, Allen and Hammond wrote.\n\nStranding small businesses?\n\nAs it stands, the bill provides tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses finance the new benefit. For an employer, those credits would materialize when they pay their taxes, which companies typically do quarterly. For self-employed workers, that relief would also come when they pay their annual taxes.\n\nEither way, that presents problems, given that many employers are already taking an income hit from the virus, Glynn said. For one, the bill would not take effect for two weeks after being signed into law. For small businesses, that means they'd have to start covering workers as soon as early April — but they wouldn't see any relief until July, when filing quarterly taxes.\n\nFor small business experiencing steep declines in demand now, my fear for some is that is going to mean having to close their doors, Glynn said.\n\nAs now structured, the measure covers workers in businesses with less than 500 employees, which is roughly half of private-sector workers, or 67 million, Glynn said. If you add public sector workers into the mix, a total of 87 million are covered.\n\nOf the 61 million people working for the larger employers that are exempt from the coronavirus relief measure, 11%, or 6.7 million, have zero paid sick days, data show. Most those workers have 7 to 8 paid sick days — not enough to self-quarantine as long as health experts recommend.\n\nThere were earlier versions that would have covered more people, but after extensive lobbying from big business and what conservatives wanted, this is where we ended up, Glynn said.\n\nThe wait for the refundable tax credit is now the number one sticking point, said Romig, while adding that everybody sees we need to do this quickly.\n\nAs she put it: As the crisis spreads it's going to become more evident that this is necessary, that businesses of all sizes will need this, at some point.
Florida's Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that a law requiring convicted felons to pay off any fines or fees related to their sentence before being able to vote is fair. The opinion sided with Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, who had upheld the Republican-controlled legislatures' decision.\n\nThe issue arose after Florida voters n 2018 overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure, known as Amendment 4, that amended the state's constitution to give voting rights to former felons — restoring nearly 1.4 million people's right to vote. Republican lawmakers argued that the bill should be more narrowly defined.\n\nThe specific amendment's wording, all terms of sentence, quickly became a flashpoint in the state. In June 2019, DeSantis signed S.B. 7066, requiring all financial obligations be paid off before a convicted felon can vote.\n\nDeSantis then requested an advisory opinion from the high court over the issue but did not ask them to determine its constitutionality. Instead, the governor confined his request to whether all terms of sentence included legal financial obligations, or LFOs, incurred during a sentence.\n\nThe answer to the Governor's question largely turns on whether 'all terms of sentence' encompasses all obligations or only durational periods, the court wrote in its opinion. We conclude that the phrase, when read and understood in context, plainly refers to obligations and includes 'all' — not some — LFOs imposed in conjunction with an adjudication of guilt.\n\nI am pleased that @FLCourts confirms that Amendment 4 requires fines, fees & restitution be paid to victims before their voting rights may be restored. Voting is a privilege that should not be taken lightly, and I am obligated to faithfully implement Amendment 4 as it is defined. — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) January 16, 2020\n\nVoting rights advocates have denounced the court's opinion.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court's decision is disappointing and cuts the 1.4 million people who voters expressly intended to re-enfranchise almost in half, said Nancy Abudu, the Southern Poverty Law Center's deputy legal director. By holding Floridians' right to vote hostage, the Florida Supreme Court is permitting the unconstitutional modern-day poll tax in SB 7066, and redefining an amendment nearly 65 percent of Florida voters approved of in 2018.\n\nA lawsuit filed by voter rights advocacy groups against DeSantis and the Florida Secretary of State over SB 7066 is not affected by the court's opinion, the Tampa Bay Times reported. It remains unclear how the court's opinion will affect felons waiting to register to vote.
President Trump marked the launch of his Evangelicals for Trump coalition at El Rey Jesus Church in Miami Friday, the day after he ordered a deadly strike on Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds military force and one of the most powerful figures in the Islamic Republic.\n\nSoleimani has been killed and his bloody rampage is now forever gone, the president said during his speech at the church, adding Soleimani had been plotting attacks but they've been stopped for good.\n\nHe was planning a very major attack, and we got him, the president told a supportive audience.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, Mr. Trump addressed reporters, insisting, We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war.\n\nEvangelicals, particularly white evangelicals, were a critical voting bloc in propelling the thrice-married president who says he's never asked God for forgiveness to the White House in 2016. And the president said he thinks he can improve upon that performance among evangelicals in 2020.\n\nI really do believe we have God on our side. I believe that, I believe that, the president said from the stage.\n\nThe president's speech comes as the commander-in-chief is ensuring his grip on the evangelical vote, after a widely circulated Christianity Today editorial denounced him in December. The day after that editorial ran, the Trump campaign announced the launch of the Evangelicals for Trump coalition in Miami.\n\nWanda Albritton, of Miami Springs, Fla., raises her ams in prayer during a rally for evangelical supporters at the King Jesus International Ministry church, Friday, Jan. 3, 2020, in Miami. Lynne Sladky / AP\n\nThe president appeared to take the critique from one of his strongest voting blocs personally, mocking the magazine, which was founded by Billy Graham, and retweeting supporters of his who also blasted the publication. Mark Galli, the editor in chief whose name was attached to the editorial, is retiring.\n\nAt the coalition launch, Mr. Trump recognized a number of the evangelical leaders who were at the event supporting him, including Franklin Graham, the son of Billy Graham. The president said that Franklin Graham had a special family and thanked him for having fought very hard for us over the two weeks since the editorial was published.\n\nOn Friday, the president repeated his line that he has been a better president for people of faith than anyone else. He also issued his usual warning that anyone on the radical left who takes the White House will eliminate any policy gains for religious people.\n\nFor America to thrive in the 21st century, we must renew faith and family as the center of American life, the president told the crowd.\n\nThe president also touted his work in weakening the Johnson Amendment, which has long restricted tax-exempt churches from endorsing or denouncing political candidates.\n\nThe president addressed the recent attack on Jews in New York, condemning anti-Semitism and insisting his administration will continue to stand up for Israel.\n\nMr. Trump has been largely holed up at his Mar-a-Lago resort since the Friday before Christmas, making frequent golf outings. While in Florida, the president has been tweeting and retweeting tweets about the impeachment process, which, at this point, is stalled. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to send the articles of impeachment passed by the House to the Senate.\n\nThe Witch Hunt is sputtering badly, but still going on (Ukraine Hoax!), the president tweeted Thursday morning. If this...had happened to a Presidential candidate, or President, who was a Democrat, everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason (and more), and it would be considered the CRIME OF THE CENTURY, far bigger and more sinister than Watergate!\n\nFundraising for the Trump campaign remained strong through the impeachment process. The campaign raised $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nGrace Segers contributed to this report.
For almost two decades, presidents have often sat for interviews airing the Sunday of the Super Bowl. For CBS News, Scott Pelley sat down with then-President Barack Obama before the Super Bowl on Feb. 3, 2013.\n\nCBS also interviewed President George W. Bush in 2004 and President Obama before the Super Bowl in 2010 and 2016.\n\nThis year, Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan will sit down with President Donald Trump for his first network television interview since the end of the partial government shutdown.\n\nJAMES BROWN: And welcome back to the Super Bowl today presented by Pizza Hut, as we continue from inside the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. You know, over the years Super Sunday has become far more than a championship football game. It is now an unofficial American holiday. And with that in mind, it's only fitting that we check in with the nation's first fan.\n\nJoining us now is Scott Pelley, the anchor and managing editor of the CBS Evening News who is live with President Barack Obama at the White House. Scott?\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Thanks J.B. We're in the Blue Room of the White House. Mr. President, very kind of you to take the time. Thank you very much.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Great to be with you.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: There has been concern about the safety of football at all levels, high school, college, and in the NFL. If you had a son, would you let him play?\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well as I said before, I'd have to think about it. You know, it's hard to say no to a kid when they've got a passion for something. And I've got daughters. They don't have a passion for football. It is a great sport. I am a huge fan. But there is no doubt that some of the concerns that we've learned about when it comes to concussions have to give parents pause. And you know, as I said before, I feel differently about the NFL. These are grown men. They-- they're well compensated. They know the risks that are involved. But as we start thinking about, you know, the pipeline. Pop Warner. High school. College. I want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make the sport safer and-- and that means that the game's probably gonna evolve a little bit.\n\nAnd for those of us who we'd like to see a big hit, and enjoy, you know, the rock-em sock-em you know, elements of the game, you know, we're probably going to be occasionally frustrated. I know defensive players in the NFL get frustrated now, because some of the changes in the rules. But I do think that we want to make sure that after people have played the game that they're going to be okay. And I'm glad to see that the NFL is starting to take this seriously. I understand that Commissioner Goodell has authorized 30 million dollars to the NIH to help study issues of how we can prevent concussions. But these are serious issues and especially for younger kids, as well as college players who don't make a big-- a big salary playing the sport. We want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep them safe.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: It was right here in this room, two weeks ago today, that you took the oath of office for the second time to begin your second term so let me ask you about the next four years. You have just raise tax rates on families that make more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year and above. Are you through raising tax rates?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well I don't think the issue right now is raising rates. The question is, if we're going to be serious about reducing our deficit, can we combine some smart spending cuts? Because there's still some waste in government. Can we reform our health care programs in particular, because we spend a lot more on health care than every other country does. And we don't get better outcomes. So there's a lot of waste in the system and there are things that we can do to reduce health care costs.\n\nAnd can we close some loopholes and deductions that, folks who are well-connected and have a lot of accountants and lawyers can take advantage of, so they end up paying lower rates than a bus driver or a cop. Can we close some of those loopholes? If you combine those things together, then we can not only reduce our deficit but we can continue to invest in things like education and research and development that are going to help us grow.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Without raising rates again?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Without raising rates again.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: So I'm not hearing you say, read my lips, no new taxes. You think there is going to have to be additional revenue over the next four years?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: There is no doubt we need additional revenue, coupled with smart spending reductions in order to bring down our deficit. And we can do it in a gradual way so that it doesn't have a huge impact. And as I said, when you look at some of these deductions that certain folks are able to take advantage of, the average person can't take advantage of-- the average person doesn't have access to Cayman Island accounts. The average person doesn't have access to carried interest income where they end up paying a much lower rate on billions of dollars that they've earned.\n\nAnd so we just want to make sure that the whole system is fair. That it's transparent and that we're reducing our deficit in a way that doesn't hamper growth, reduce the kinds of strategies that we need, in order to make sure that we're creating good jobs and a strong middle class.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: American women have fought in many of our wars. Some of them have been killed and wounded in our wars. But the Pentagon just announced a major policy change, opening hundreds of frontline combat jobs to women. Do you have any hesitation as commander-in-chief ordering women into combat?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, I don't. And the reason has become because women, as a practical matter, are now in combat. They may not get treated as if they're in combat. But when they're in theater in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, they are vulnerable. They are wounded. And they've been killed. And they have carried out their jobs with extraordinary patriotism and distinction.\n\nAnd you know, I've said before the greatest honor I have as president is being commander-in-chief and I meet extraordinary women in uniform who can do everything that a man can and more.\n\nAnd you know, one of my military aides is about five feet tall. Probably weighs about a hundred pounds. You put a 50 pound pack on her and she can do things that you or me would keel over doing. And so, you know the truth is is that women are serving. They are taking great risks. What we should not do is-- is somehow prevent them from advancing in an institution that we all revere.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Next week the board of the Boy Scouts of America is going to vote on whether to end their national ban on gays in scouting. Should scouting be open to gays?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Why so?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well because I think that, you know, my attitude is that gays and lesbians should have access and-- and opportunity the same way everybody else does in every institution and walk of life. And, you know the Scouts are a great institution that are promoting young people and exposing them to, you know, opportunities and-- and leadership that you know will serve people for the rest of their lives. And I think that nobody should be barred for that.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: We found out last week that the economy actually shrank in the last three months of last year. If the federal spending cuts that are on tap for March actually take effect, will that push the country into recession?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: I don't know if it will put-- push the country in a recession. But here's what we know. The reason that the economy shrank a little bit, despite the fact that housing's recovering, manufacturing is gone strong, car sales are up. You know truth is that overall there were a lot of positive signs in the economy. The big problem was defense spending was cut 22 percent. It was the biggest drop in-- in 40 years. And it was very abrupt and it had to do with you know folks being worried about the possible impacts of the fiscal cliff and what goes on here in Washington and what I've said repeatedly is-- you know Washington cannot continually operate under a cloud of crisis. That freezes up consumers. It gets businesses worried. We can't afford these self-inflicted wounds.\n\nAnd there is a way for us to solve these budget problems in a responsible way. Through a balanced approach that the vast majority of people agree with. If we do that, there's no reason why we can't have really strong growth in 2013. But you know, we can't have Washington dysfunction getting in the way.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Mr. President thank you for having us in today. I hope you enjoy the game. Enjoy Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: It is gonna be a great game. I got some some wings waiting for me upstairs.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Thank you again sir. J.B. back to you in New Orleans.\n\nJAMES BROWN: All right Scott, and our thanks to President Obama and to Scott Pelley for joining us this afternoon.
He's said it before and he's saying it again. In his widely read annual letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's chief executive, emphasized that bonds are risky and that investors should stick with equities—even though they can pose greater risk in the near term.\n\nIt is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons -- among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals -- to measure their investment 'risk' by their portfolio's ratio of bonds to stocks, Buffett wrote. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk.\n\nThe billionaire investor offered the recommendations not long after the stock market's biggest single-day drop in more than six years. He also urged investors not to use leverage to invest in stocks, saying it can lead to irrational behavior when times are volatile.\n\nEven if your borrowings are small and your positions aren't immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines and breathless commentary, he wrote, adding: An unsettled mind will not make good decisions.\n\nBuffett's yearly missive included an explanation of Berkshire's 2017 results, which included the conglomerate tallying a more than $29 billion gain for 2017 due to the tax overhaul passed by Congress late last year. The gain, which was mildly offset by $1.4 billion in taxes paid on repatriated foreign earnings, made up almost two-thirds of Berkshire's $44.9 billion in net earnings for the year.\n\nBuffett in the past has repeatedly called on Congress to raise taxes on the wealthy, saying people like him should be paying more. He refrained from revisiting that call in his yearly update.\n\nBuffett also refrained from calling stocks overvalued, as he's done in past yearly updates, but he did say acquiring other companies had gotten overly expensive. His view that acquisitions need to come with a sensible purchase price prevented Berkshire from making a big deal in 2017, he wrote.\n\nWhile lower interest rates allowed acquirers to borrow money to finance their deals, Buffett dismissed the notion he would join the trend. At Berkshire, in contrast, we evaluate acquisitions on an all-equity basis, knowing that our taste for overall debt is very low. Referring to Charles Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman, Buffett stated that both of us believe it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don't.\n\nBuffett also said his company does have a plan for when he's no longer at the helm, despite the 87-year-old's stance that he has never felt better.
Former U.S. Rep. Mel Reynolds is up for sentencing on convictions that he failed to file tax returns for income he made while consulting for Chicago businessmen in Africa.\n\nThursday's sentencing comes some seven months after U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman found Reynolds guilty in a bench trial on four misdemeanor counts.\n\nReynolds has been representing himself. In a Wednesday filing, he argued that one year of probation would be an appropriate sentence. Prosecutors argued earlier that he deserves at least two years behind bars because he had flouted the law for so long. The maximum sentence is four years in prison.\n\nThe Harvard graduate and Rhodes Scholar resigned from Congress in 1995 after being convicted of statutory rape. He was later convicted on charges that included concealing debts.
NEW YORK -- When the Kushner Cos. bought three apartment buildings in a gentrifying neighborhood of Queens in 2015, most of the tenants were protected by special rules that prevent developers from pushing them out, raising rents and turning a tidy profit.\n\nBut that's exactly what the company then run by Jared Kushner did, and with remarkable speed. Two years later, it sold all three buildings for $60 million, nearly 50 percent more than it paid.\n\nNow a clue has emerged as to how President Trump's son-in-law's firm was able to move so fast: The Kushner Cos. routinely filed false paperwork with the city declaring it had zero rent-regulated tenants in dozens of buildings it owned across the city when, in fact, it had hundreds.\n\nWhile none of the documents during a three-year period when Kushner was CEO bore his personal signature, they provide a window into the ethics of the business empire he ran before he went on to become one of the most trusted advisers to the president of the United States.\n\nIt's bare-faced greed, said Aaron Carr, founder of Housing Rights Initiative, a tenants' rights watchdog that compiled the work permit application documents and shared them with The Associated Press. The fact that the company was falsifying all these applications with the government shows a sordid attempt to avert accountability and get a rapid return on its investment.\n\nKushner Cos. responded in a statement that it outsources the preparation of such documents to third parties that are reviewed by independent counsel, and if mistakes or violations are identified, corrective action is taken immediately.\n\nKushner would never deny any tenant their due-process rights, it said, adding that the company has renovated thousands of apartments and developments with minimal complaints over the past 30 years.\n\nFor the three Queens buildings in the borough's Astoria neighborhood, the Kushner Cos. checked a box on construction permit applications in 2015 that indicated the buildings had zero rent-regulated tenants. Tax records filed a few months later showed the company inherited as many as 94 rent-regulated units from the previous owner.\n\nIn all, Housing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos. filed at least 80 false applications for construction permits in 34 buildings across New York City from 2013 to 2016, all of them indicating there were no rent-regulated tenants. Instead, tax documents show there were more than 300 rent-regulated units. Nearly all the permit applications were signed by a Kushner employee, including sometimes the chief operating officer.\n\nHad the Kushner Cos. disclosed those rent-regulated tenants, it could have triggered stricter oversight of construction crews by the city, including possibly unscheduled sweeps on site by inspectors to keep the company from harassing tenants and getting them to leave.\n\nInstead, current and former tenants of the Queens buildings told the AP that they were subjected to extensive construction, with banging, drilling, dust and leaking water that they believe were part of targeted harassment to get them to leave and clear the way for higher-paying renters.\n\nIt was noisy, there were complaints, I got mice, said mailman Rudolph Romano, adding that he also bristled at a 60 percent rent increase, a hike the Kushner Cos. contends was initiated by the previous landord. They cleaned the place out. I watched the whole building leave.\n\nTax records show those rent-regulated units that numbered as many as 94 when Kushner took over fell to 25 by 2016.\n\nIn Kushner buildings across the city, records show frequent complaints about construction going on early in the morning or late at night against the rules, improper or illegal construction, and work without a permit.\n\nAt a six-story walk-up in Manhattan's East Village that was once home to the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, the Kushner Cos. filed an application to begin construction in late 2013 that, again, listed zero rent-regulated tenants. Tax records a few months later showed seven rent-regulated units.\n\nAll of a sudden, there was drilling, drilling. ... You heard the drilling in the middle of night, said one of the rent-regulated tenants, Mary Ann Siwek, 67, who lives on Social Security payments and odd jobs. There were rats coming in from the abandoned building next door. The hallways were always filled with lumber and sawdust and plaster.\n\nA knock on the door came a few weeks later, and an offer of at least $10,000 if she agreed to leave the building.\n\nI know it's pretty horrible, but we can help you get out, Siwek recalls the man saying. We can offer you money.\n\nSiwek turned down the cash and sued instead. She said she won a year's worth of free rent and a new refrigerator.\n\nNew York City Council member Ritchie Torres, who plans to launch an investigation into permit applications, said: The Kushners appear to be engaging in what I call the weaponization of construction.\n\nRent stabilization is a fixture of New York City that can bedevil developers seeking to make money off buildings. To free themselves of its restrictions, landlords usually have to wait until the rent rises above $2,733 a month, something that can take years given the small increases allowed each year.\n\nSubmitting false documents to the city's Department of Buildings for construction permits is a misdemeanor, which can carry fines of up to $25,000. But real estate experts say it is often flouted with little to no consequences. Landlords who do so get off with no more than a demand from the city, sometimes a year or more later, to file an amended form with the correct numbers.\n\nHousing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos. filed dozens of amended forms for the buildings mentioned in the documents, most of them a year to two later.\n\nThere is a lack of tools to go after landlords who harass tenants, and there is a lack of enforcement, said Seth Miller, a real estate lawyer who used to work at a state housing agency overseeing rent regulations. Until officials inspect every construction site, you're going to have this incentive for landlords to make life uncomfortable for tenants.\n\nNew York City's Department of Buildings did not comment in general about the false filings by the Kushner Cos., but said it disciplined a contractor who filed false documents while working on two of the Queens buildings, which are currently under investigation by a tenant-harassment task force. It added that the department is also ramping up its monitoring of construction, hiring 72 new inspectors under city laws recently passed to crack down on tenant harassment.\n\nWe won't tolerate landlords who use construction to harass tenants - no matter who they are, spokesman Joseph Soldevere said.\n\nExactly how much money the Kushner Cos. earned from the buildings mentioned in the documents is unclear. Of those 34 buildings, only the three in Queens and a fourth in Brooklyn appear to have been sold. The company also likely made money by reducing the number of rent-regulated tenants and bringing in those who would pay more.\n\nJared Kushner, who stepped down as CEO of the Kushner Cos. last year before taking on his advisory role at the White House, sold off part of his real estate holdings as required under government ethics rules. But he retained stakes in many properties, including Westminster Management, the Kushner Cos. subsidiary that oversees its residential properties. A financial disclosure last year showed he still owns a stake in Westminster and earned $1.6 million from the holding.\n\nBack in Queens, the mailman Romano was one of the few rent-regulated tenants who fought back.\n\nHe hired a lawyer who found out he was protected from the 60-percent rent hike by law, something Romano did not know at the time. And he said his rent, which was set to increase to $3,750, was restored to $2,350.\n\nRomano is still in the building where he has lived for nine years, with his wife, four children and his guests from the construction days - the mice.\n\nI still haven't gotten rid of them.
While death and taxes may be two inevitabilities of life, some people like to push the envelope when it comes to the latter.\n\nProcrastinators live among us, given that about 20 percent of taxpayers wait until the last two weeks of the tax season to file their returns. The majority of Americans tend to file early because of the anticipation of receiving their tax refund, said Lisa Greene-Lewis, CPA and tax expert at TurboTax. Others, however, may have complicated tax issues or late-arriving tax forms that delay their ability to file, while some might simply put it off because they are worried or confused about the process.\n\nBut issues such as higher preparation costs and even more delays may come hand-in-hand with putting off tax preparation until the last minute. Because the workload intensifies leading up to the filing deadline -- which is April 18 this year -- some certified public accountants will ask their procrastinating clients to file a tax extension. Consumers relying on tax software programs or online filing will face higher costs than if they had filed earlier in the season.\n\nTurboTax, for instance, ended its early season pricing on its online filing products on March 17, which means that consumers will now pay as much as 25 percent more for the same products. The company still offers its federal free edition, which is geared for consumers filing either the relatively simple 1040EZ or 1040A forms, although TurboTax said that is subject to change. TurboTax's Deluxe edition now costs $54.99 for federal returns, for instance, instead of the $34.99 before March 17.\n\nH&R Block, meanwhile, appears to have kept its online and software prices steady. Like TurboTax, it also offers a free filing option for simple tax returns. Still, many of those free filing options disappear later in the tax season, according to research from Oppenheimer & Co. cited by Bloomberg News. H&R Block didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAs for taxpayers who rely on accountants, there's the danger that your CPA may not have time to handle your returns the closer you wait until April 18. It's not all that unusual to file for an extension, since about 8 percent of all returns the IRS receives are filed with the additional 6 months that the extension provides.\n\nAs far as using an accountant, what I've seen, having worked for a CPA firm, they may (have) a deadline about when they want to see your tax documents because they get backed up, said Greene-Lewis. They may have a cut off where they put you on an extension.\n\nThere are a few issues to be aware of with extensions, such as the fact that payments are still due on April 18. That means people filing extensions will need a reasonable estimate of what they owe the tax agency by the deadline.\n\nYou should try to file as soon as possible, said Greene-Lewis, who noted that TurboTax users can file up to 11:59 p.m. on the night of the tax deadline. People who rush at the last minute may leave something out or forget about tax deductions and credits, even though we do remind you. It's best to do everything earlier.

And I think the idea of a tariff against Mexico is a terrible idea. I think it would hurt Mexico a lot, and I think it would hurt American consumers as well. We don't need a trade war with Mexico.\n\nThe White House has floated the idea of imposing a 20% tax on imports from Mexico, in order to pay for Trump's proposed southern border wall. However, the White House says Trump is weighing other options.\n\nMoore also said he views Trump's trade policy with China differently.\n\nPHOTO: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images UNITED STATES - AUGUST 31: Stephen Moore of The Heritage Foundation is interviewed by CQ in his Washington office, August 31, 2016.

I think he views China as an adversary, and I've come to the conclusion that they are a bit of an adversary militarily, and economically. They're playing a different game economically. They don't play by the rules. They do cheat, they do steal, and I think taking a tougher stance with China is overdue.\n\nMoore also recommended conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly's book on Harry Truman's presidency, Killing the Rising Sun to the President and listeners.\n\nI think people like Trump can learn from Harry Truman, Moore said.

(CNN) Two of President Donald Trump's Cabinet secretaries -- Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos -- are resigning over the riot Wednesday at the US Capitol.\n\nThe secretaries were among a number of administration officials who announced they were leaving in the wake of a mob of pro-Trump supporters breaching the US Capitol.\n\nIn the statement, addressed to the agency she led, Chao wrote that she will resign effective Monday and was deeply troubled by the entirely avoidable events at the Capitol building\n\nI am tremendously proud of the many accomplishments we were able to achieve together for our country and I will never forget the commitment you have for this Department and the United States of America, her statement continued.\n\nShe added that will help the Transportation Secretary designate, Pete Buttigieg, in taking on the department.\n\nIt has been the honor of a lifetime to serve the U.S. Department of Transportation, she tweeted Thursday.\n\nDeVos submitted a letter of resignation to Trump on Thursday, calling Wednesday's events unconscionable for our country.\n\nThere is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me, she wrote. Impressionable children are watching all of this, and they are learning from us. I believe we each have a moral obligation to exercise good judgement and model the behavior we hope they would emulate. They must know from us that America is greater than what transpired yesterday.\n\nDr. Elinore F. McCance-Katz, assistant secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, also resigned Thursday, writing in her resignation letter that she had planned to stay on until the next administration but her plans abruptly changed Wednesday evening when she saw the violent takeover of the Capitol building.\n\nI believe that this behavior was totally unacceptable and, in my own heart, I simply am not able to continue, she wrote.\n\nBecause I believe that the mental health of our people has suffered so greatly under the stresses of COVID-19, the social justice issues that have been so painful for so many, and now with the rending of our nation over questions raised about the presidential election, I cannot support language that results in incitement of violence and risks our very existence, she added.\n\nAdditionally, Anthony Ruggiero, senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense at the National Security Council, resigned on Thursday in protest of the President's incitement of protests of supporters at the Capitol, according to a person familiar. Ruggiero leads the council's North Korea policy and is a key East Asia expert.\n\nStephanie Grisham, Betsy DeVos, Elaine Chao, Elinore McCance-Katz, Sarah Matthews, Ryan Tully, Mick Mulvaney, John Costello, Matt Pottinger, Tyler Goodspeed, Rob Greenway, Anna Christina Niceta\n\nThursday's outgoing cohort followed a similar tranche of administration resignations the previous day. Trump's deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger resigned Wednesday afternoon.\n\nStephanie Grisham -- the former White House communications director and press secretary and current chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump -- and White House social secretary Anna Cristina Rickie Niceta both resigned Wednesday effective immediately, White House officials told CNN. The two were among the longest-serving Trump administration officials.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol has also triggered departures outside the administration. The chief of the Capitol Police is resigning effective January 16. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House sergeant-at-arms, Paul Irving, was submitting his resignation, while Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger submitted his own resignation late Thursday, according to a statement by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nChao decided to resign after taking time to absorb the insurrection on Capitol Hill and the President's response to it, a senior administration official said. The official said Chao's decision to resign on Monday -- not immediately -- was done in order to give her staff time for an orderly departure and transition.\n\nChao discussed the matter with her staff and her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, before deciding around 11 a.m. that she would resign.\n\nToday, there was a lot of soul-searching and discussion, a senior official said. It was obviously the right thing to do.\n\nBefore releasing her statement, Chao called White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to inform him of her decision, the senior official said. She has not as of yet submitted a letter of resignation to the President.\n\nChao encouraged senior officials at the Transportation Department to stay on until January 20 to ensure a smooth transition. Several of her senior staff were considering resigning as well, but were talked out of it by Chao, this official said.\n\nThe department's general counsel Steven Bradbury is next in the line of succession because there is currently no deputy secretary. He would become acting Transportation secretary unless the President names another individual to the post.\n\nA veteran of Republican administrations, Chao came into her post with a focus on reviving the nation's crumbling infrastructure.\n\nBut an overhaul package to rebuild roads, bridges and highways never came, stalled by other legislative priorities including tax cuts and health care. The administration did unveil a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan earlier in Trump's administration, but the framework has faced obstacles in Congress.\n\nA succession of White House-sponsored Infrastructure Weeks did little to advance the cause. The term has become a punch line for the administration's ability to step on its own message with unforced errors or a President prone to inflammatory tweets or remarks.\n\nChao had until now remained a dutiful foot soldier for the President, appearing at White House events and traveling the country to view administration-sponsored projects.\n\nUnlike much of the administration, Chao came to her post with years of government experience. She served in both Bush administrations, acting as labor secretary for all eight years of President George W. Bush's tenure.\n\nTrump has eyed some Bush veterans skeptically, though isn't known to have singled out Chao specifically.\n\nInstead, it is her husband that has sometimes proved the awkward component in her relationship with Trump. The President has openly sparred with the Republican leader in the Senate over legislative priorities.\n\nChao had previously navigated the spats deftly. Standing alongside Trump in August 2017 in the midst of a dispute between the President and McConnell over health care, she was asked what she thought of the rift.\n\nI stand by my man, Chao said, both of them.\n\nThis story has been updated.

And the longest government shutdown ever.\n\nAround nearly every corner, crucial question marks are looming over the business world right now.\n\nWill the US economy grow at 3% in 2019 or succumb to a recession? Will the United Kingdom be in or out of the European Union? Will the Fed raise rates twice or not at all?\n\nTaken together, these forces appear to be driving up uncertainty to elevated levels. That backdrop makes it tricky for businesses, households and investors to plan for the future.\n\nThe risk is that poor visibility causes companies to rein in spending, further delaying the investment boom that the US tax overhaul was supposed to spark.\n\nWe are in an uncertain environment on the policy front and the economic front — and that spills over into the corporate front, said Erin Browne, a managing director and portfolio manager at PIMCO.\n\nIn some ways, a murky outlook is common as economic expansions age and the next recession begins to take shape on the horizon.\n\nAs you move towards late cycle, the level of uncertainty increases. And the level of volatility around economic outcomes also increases, Browne said.\n\nOne measure of this volatility, the global economic policy uncertainty index, shot to a record high in December. The index, which goes back to January 1997, measures how often newspaper articles in 20 countries contain terms related to the economy, policy and uncertainty.\n\nThere's no shortage of questions swirling around board rooms right now. Consider the headlines from just the past few days.\n\nTrade war lingers, Brexit mess deepens\n\nThe United States and China, the world's two biggest economies, remain mired in a trade war. Fragile talks on reaching a trade deal have yet to produce a breakthrough.\n\nIn the meantime, economists say the tariff spat is exacerbating the sharp slowdown in China. And it's at least partially to blame for the sudden deceleration of America's manufacturing industry and an outright contraction in China's.\n\nApple (AAPL), the world's largest public company, recently said trade tensions helped lead to soft iPhone sales.\n\nIn Europe, the British parliament resoundingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal, raising the risk that her government collapses. The vote also deepens questions over whether the UK will crash out of the EU or decide to remain or further delay a decision. A messy divorce could spark market turmoil and fuel a recession in the UK, the world's fifth-biggest economy.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's economy contracted in the third quarter and 2018 growth was the weakest in five years.\n\nThe rest of the world is clearly tugging the US downward, said Browne.\n\nVolatility in Washington, energy\n\nIn Washington, the shutdown of the federal government stretched into its 26th day on Wednesday. Each day is causing more damage to the economy — and more pain for the 800,000 federal workers going without pay.\n\nCorporate America is beginning to feel the pain as well. Delta Air Lines (DAL) estimates that fewer bookings caused by the government shutdown will cost the company about $25 million in January.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned Washington on Tuesday that if the shutdown lasts for the entire quarter, it could reduce economic growth to zero.\n\nMeanwhile, the oil patch is living up to its well-worn reputation for volatility. US oil prices crashed into a bear market last fall, plunging as much as 44%. Crude has since spiked 22% in just three weeks on signs that OPEC is dialing back production.\n\nThe gyrations in the energy market won't make the budget process any easier for airlines, trucking and other businesses that rely on crude.\n\nThe oil turbulence also helped lead to the shutdown of the junk bond market in December, the first month without a US high-yield bond offering in a decade.\n\n'Wild' market swings\n\nWall Street is still mending its wounds from the worst December stock market performance since the Great Depression. Extreme volatility led to sharp trading revenue declines at JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup (C).\n\nEven though US stocks have rebounded, there's always a risk that prolonged market mayhem dents consumer and business sentiment enough to impact the real economy.\n\nWe saw wild risk-off swings, John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo's chief financial officer, told reporters on Tuesday. That could have a knock-on effect to invest confidence, and maybe consumer and business confidence.\n\nFed policy remains another major mystery. Just a few months ago, Wall Street was prepared for the US central bank to raise interest rates another four times. But market stress and slowing global growth caused the Fed to hint that it may be done with rate hikes, at least for now.\n\nEven Esther George, a hawkish Fed official, said in a speech on Tuesday that it might be a good time to pause rate hikes. And George acknowledged it's unclear whether, or how much, the Fed's shrinking balance sheet is causing borrowing conditions to tighten.\n\nRecession or slowdown?\n\nEconomists and investors continue to clash over whether the American economy is headed toward a recession, or just a sharp slowdown like the one experienced in 2016.\n\nNearly half of the US CFOs surveyed by Duke University expect a 2019 recession. And 82% believe that a recession will strike by the end of 2020.\n\nBut fund managers' point of view is quite different. Just 14% of them expect a global economic recession this year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey published on Tuesday.\n\nTheir diagnosis is secular stagnation, not a recession, Michael Hartnett, Bank of America's chief investment strategist, wrote in the Tuesday report.\n\nStill, the risk is that extreme uncertainty becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, speeding the arrival of the next downturn by causing business and consumer spending to dry up.\n\nIt's inevitable we will get a recession in the next few years. The question is timing, said Browne. This could pull forward the onset of the next recession.
India just got a ringing endorsement from the world's most famous investor.\n\nI think the potential for India is incredible, Warren Buffett said in an interview with Indian news channel ET Now on Monday, describing the South Asian nation as a huge, enormous market.\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway chairman, also known as the Oracle of Omaha, said he'd immediately hop on a plane to India if the right investment opportunity came up.\n\nIf you tell me a wonderful company in India that might be available for sale, I'll be there tomorrow, he said.\n\nRelated: Warren Buffett says he dumped a third of his IBM stock\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to smooth the way for foreign investors such as Buffett, but there are still many hurdles standing in their way.\n\nCompanies such as Walmart (WMT) and Apple (AAPL), which both feature in Buffett's huge portfolio, have thus far failed to open their own stores in the country.\n\nBerkshire set up operations in India when Buffett visited in 2011, selling insurance online in a partnership with Indian firm Bajaj Allianz. But Buffett's firm reportedly exited that partnership two years later, citing excessive regulation.\n\nRelated: Why Walmart is interested in India's biggest online retailer\n\nBuffett mentioned those hurdles again on Monday, particularly one that prevents foreign firms from fully owning companies in India.\n\nSometimes there have been restrictive laws in terms of the percentage we can own, and that's a disadvantage, he said. We would like to own 100% of any business that we run.\n\nRelated: Warren Buffett laments missing out on Google\n\nModi has tried to make it easier to do business, but many of his big reforms -- such as a uniform national tax system that is yet to be implemented -- have fallen short of expectations.\n\nAnother famous investor, Jim Rogers, sold all his Indian shares in 2015 after getting tired of waiting for change.\n\nYou can't just invest on hope, he said in an interview with Indian newspaper Livemint at the time.\n\nBuffett says the country's huge population and rapidly growing middle class is too big to ignore.\n\nIt's a lot of people with a lot of buying power, he said. You can't have a billion people and not be important to this world.
That was exactly as wild as it seemed.\n\nThe VIX volatility index, which tracks short-term market turbulence, jumped 116% on Monday -- the highest daily percentage recorded. The index has data going back to 1990.\n\nIt's the biggest move since February 2007, when the index rose 64%.\n\nThat shows how much fear has jumped back into the market in a very short period of time, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.\n\nMonday was the worst day for markets in recent memory.\n\nThe Dow plunged almost 1,600 points before recovering slightly. It closed down 1,175 points, the worst single-day point decline in Dow history. Its 4.6% fall was the biggest percentage decline since August 2011, during the European debt crisis.\n\nRelated: CNNMoney Fear & Greed index is in Extreme Fear\n\nThe VIX reflected that turmoil.\n\nThe index, which hit 37.32, is now the highest it's been since August 24, 2015, the last time the Dow plunged 1,000 points in a day.\n\nA big reason for the sudden surge in volatility is that stocks have been calm for months, which has kept the VIX tamped down.\n\nThe index touched an all-time intraday low of 8.56 on November 24, 2017, and was as low as 8.56 again on January 4. That relative tranquility made Monday's leap feel particularly severe.\n\nIf investors had been expecting that to change, the VIX would have been moving higher before Monday.\n\nIf anything, we should have been surprised by how low volatility was to begin with, said Andres Garcia-Amaya, CEO of wealth management firm Zoe Financial.\n\nAfter months of calm for stocks, investors could now experience some rockiness in the coming weeks.\n\nRelated: Stocks plunged. That doesn't mean the economy is in trouble\n\nOne group of investors likely to be hit hard are those who have been betting against volatility.\n\nMarket watchers are pointing to an exchange-traded security called the XIV, which is structured to go up when the VIX falls.\n\nThe XIV is down more than 82% after hours. That means investors who thought the market would continue its bull run without a sell-off could get hit.\n\nBut most people shouldn't panic, analysts say.\n\nThe market's economic underpinnings remain strong. Corporate earnings are still expected to be bolstered by tax reform, and job creation remains steady.\n\nIf you're a day trader, this is a huge deal. If you're an investor in the long term, this becomes a blip, Garcia-Amaya said.
Millions of Americans may have to wait a little longer to receive their stimulus payments from the federal government due to a glitch in distribution that is expected to be fixed soon.\n\nThe payments -- worth up to $600 per taxpayer and $600 for each of their dependents -- were part of the latest Covid relief package signed into law at the end of December.\n\nThe IRS began issuing direct deposits of those payments on December 29 and says up to 100 million have already been completed.\n\nBut, according to Intuit TurboTax spokesperson Ashley McMahon, millions of payments were sent to the wrong accounts, and some may not have received their stimulus payment.\n\nRoughly 13 million people may have been affected, according to one banking industry source.\n\nRead More

Washington (CNN) A second round of stimulus payments are on the way and many eligible families are expected to receive the money this month.\n\nThe first payments started going out on December 29 and will continue to be sent through January 15 . But anyone eligible who isn't automatically sent the money by then will have to claim it on their 2020 tax return, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nCongress included the $600 payments in a sweeping pandemic aid bill passed just before Christmas. President Donald Trump stalled the bill, calling for $2,000 payments though he had largely left negotiations up to lawmakers and his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, then ultimately signed it into law after a week-long delay.\n\nThe money comes nearly eight months after the first round of stimulus payments, worth up to $1,200 per person, were sent as part of a larger coronavirus relief package passed last March. Many of the same people will receive the money again, but there are some small eligibility differences.\n\nWhen and how will the money be sent?\n\nRecipients may have seen a direct deposit pending in their bank account as early as December 29, but the funds became officially available January 4.\n\nPaper checks or debit cards will be sent to those who don't already have a bank account on file with the Internal Revenue Service. Checks also began going out last week.\n\nSome people may not receive the money the same way as in the first round. If you received a preloaded debit card last year, the payment will not be added to that card. You'll either receive a new card in the mail or a paper check.\n\nThe law requires the Internal Revenue Service to stop issuing the payments after January 15. Those not issued a payment by then will have wait to claim it on their 2020 tax return. The money will either increase your refund or reduce the taxes you owe. If the payment was sent to an old bank account, you will also have to wait to file your taxes in order to receive the money\n\nPeople can check the status of both their first and second payments by using the Internal Revenue Service's Get My Payment online tool\n\nWho is eligible?\n\nEligibility is largely based on income. Individuals earning less than $75,000 a year will receive the full $600. Heads of household earning less than $112,500 and married couples filing jointly earning less than $150,000 are also due the full amount. They will receive $600 per child under the age of 17, which is $100 more than in the first round.\n\nThe payments start phasing out for people making more money, at a rate of $5 per $100 of additional income. Some people who received the first payment may be phased out of the second round because the payments are smaller.\n\nThey will phase out entirely at $87,000 for single filers without children and $174,000 for those married filing jointly without children, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation\n\nUndocumented immigrants who don't have Social Security numbers remain ineligible for the payments. But in a change from the first round, their spouses and children are now eligible as long as they have Social Security numbers.\n\nThose who are claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, like some college students, remain ineligible.\n\nLost your job? You may be able to claim more money\n\nBoth the first and second round payments are based on 2019 adjust gross incomes. That means that someone who saw their income drastically fall in 2020 may be eligible for more money than they first received.\n\nIf that's the case, they may claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 tax return. The credit eligibility and the credit amount will be based on the 2020 tax year income, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThose who may have earned more in 2020 than 2019 are not required to pay back money they have already received.
Washington (CNN) The Trump administration on Saturday announced new travel restrictions after confirmation of the first coronavirus death in the US, with President Donald Trump signaling a more robust response as US cases rise.\n\nTrump said additional cases in America were likely but cautioned the public not to panic.\n\nAdditional cases in the US are likely, Trump said, but healthy individuals should be able to fully recover.\n\nThe President, joined by members of his administration's coronavirus task force as he made comments from the White House briefing room, aimed to calm Americans.\n\nWe respectfully ask the media and politicians and everybody else involved not do anything to incite the panic, because there's no reason to panic at all, Trump said.\n\nThe President also offered his condolences to the first coronavirus death in America.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington, confirmed Saturday that the individual who died was male. Trump earlier described the patient, who died in Washington state, as a medically high-risk patient in her late 50s and a wonderful woman.\n\nA senior administration official blamed the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the mix up.\n\nDr. (Robert) Redfield briefed Pence and Trump after speaking with Washington State health officials that it was a woman. Washington State has since corrected, the official said.\n\nRedfield tweeted later Saturday that the CDC erroneously identified the patient as a female in a briefing earlier (Saturday) with the President and Vice President.\n\nThe Washington patient appears to have become ill through community spread, according to Redfield, who spoke alongside the President at Saturday's briefing.\n\nTravel and coronavirus\n\nPence said at the briefing that the US would be expanding travel restrictions from Iran to include any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days. He also said the US would heighten a travel advisory for specific regions of Italy and South Korea.\n\nWe are urging Americans to not travel to the areas in Italy and the areas in South Korea that are most affected by the coronavirus, Pence said.\n\nPence also emphasized that the average American does not need to go out and buy a mask, and that at least 35 million more masks per month are expected to be produced for the United States.\n\nMore courses of action to increase the availability of masks to high-risk health care workers will be announced later Saturday, Pence said.\n\nTrump also said he'll be meeting with pharmaceutical companies at the White House on Monday to discuss developing a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThe President's update followed a briefing from his coronavirus task force earlier in the day, which Trump said lasted for more than two and a half hours.\n\nThe President said there are now 22 cases of the novel coronavirus in the US. This number does not include individuals repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China, or from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those cases have been counted separately by the CDC.\n\nThere are four instances of possible community spread transmission of coronavirus -- two in California, one in Oregon and one in Washington.\n\nThe markets will all come back, Trump said. We have one problem -- we have to get this problem brought into focus.\n\nIt's certainly not a good situation. When you lose travel that's a big part of market. But for a period of time we're going to have to do what's necessary. Safety, health -- number one. The markets will take care of themselves, he continued.\n\nThe President suggested the Federal Reserve should take measures to assist with the economic dip that has resulted from the coronavirus outbreak. He also brought up his long-anticipated middle-income tax cuts.\n\nThe President has previously appeared to downplay the effects of coronavirus, saying earlier this week that he did not think community spread of the infections disease in the country was inevitable, despite that fact that CDC officials have been assessing that they expect to see community spread within the country.\n\nTrump has rarely delivered remarks to the press from the White House briefing room, but his Saturday appearance marks his second time in the room in less than a week.\n\nThe President said at a rally in South Carolina Friday that Democrats are now politicizing the virus. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, Trump said. They have no clue, they can't even count their votes in Iowa.\n\nThis is their new hoax, Trump added.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump said he doesn't think coronavirus itself is a hoax, but the criticism is. Asked if he regretted calling it a hoax during Friday's rally, Trump said he didn't.\n\nHoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, the President explained. I'm not talking about what's happening here, I'm talking about what they're doing.\n\nTrump called it the continuation of the hoax, and mentioned the Russia investigation and his impeachment.\n\nI don't like it when they are criticizing these people, and I don't like it, he said. That's the hoax I'm talking about.\n\nWorldwide, the virus has killed at least 2,922 -- including 2,835 people in China -- and there have been 85,055 confirmed cases.\n\nA senior administration official told CNN on Friday that Trump's mid-March meeting with leaders of southeast Asian countries in Las Vegas had been postponed.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect that the individual who died in the first reported coronavirus death in the US was male.

We've just been spoiled.\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nThe junk bond market, one of the biggest beneficiaries of easy money, has screeched to a halt.\n\nNo US high yield bonds were offered between November 30 and January 10, according to Dealogic. December marked the first month since the 2008 crisis without any junk bonds being issued, the research firm said.\n\nThe reversal of fortunes underscores how quickly sentiment can change in financial markets, especially in the riskiest pockets of Wall Street.\n\nDeep fears about the end of the economic cycle similarly led to an exodus out of momentum stocks and the oil patch. Both the Nasdaq and crude oil tumbled into bear markets.\n\nThe stock market and oil really drive the junk bond market. They were a double-barreled depressant in December, said Mark Howard, senior multi asset specialist at BNP Paribas.\n\nThe energy sector accounts for about 15% of the US high-yield market, making the junk bond market particularly sensitive to sharp swings in oil prices. The 2014-2016 oil crash sparked dozens of oil bankruptcies.\n\nThe silence of the junk bond market marks a sharp slowdown from last December, when 36 companies tapped the junk bond market to raise nearly $18 billion, according to Dealogic.\n\nThe good news is that financial markets and oil prices have been on the upswing since Christmas Eve. People are less worried, for now at least, about a recession and the US-China trade war. That could allow for a reopening of the junk bond market.\n\n'Starting to crack open'\n\nA subsidiary of Targa Resources (TRGP), an oil and natural gas pipeline company, successfully priced a high-yield offering on Thursday. In another positive sign, Targa was able to raise $1.5 billion, twice as much as the Houston-based company originally sought. Sanjay Lad, director of investor relations at Targa, told CNN Business the deal was upsized because of very strong investor demand.\n\nIt marks the first US junk bond issuance since late November.\n\nIt's starting to crack open, said Howard.\n\nThis year, US high yield bond funds posted their best start in a decade, according to UBS.\n\nStill, the boom-to-bust in junk bonds serves as another reminder of the role of easy money on financial markets.\n\nUnbelievably low interest rates from global central banks forced investors to scour for returns elsewhere. Vast sums of money were poured into high-yield debt, allowing even some companies with shoddy balance sheets to borrow at reasonable rates.\n\nBut that easy money has begun to slowly fade away, with the Federal Reserve simultaneously raising interest rates and trimming its towering balance sheet.\n\nAt the same time, Wall Street is on high alert for signs of a recession. A downturn would cause trouble for some companies that reside in the junk bond market.\n\nNot surprisingly, investors backed away from that risky market late last year. Money has flown out of high-yield bond funds in 12 of the past 13 weeks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nThere is concern that the earnings cycle has peaked. The trade war is not a great help, said Mike Ning, chief investment officer at PhaseCapital, a boutique investment manager.\n\nProlonged shutdown could spark trouble\n\nNervous investors have similarly retreated from another risky corner of the debt market: leveraged loans. These distressed loans had been a favorite investment for years but concerns about higher borrowing costs and slowing growth have changed the risk-reward calculus.\n\nPrivate-equity giant KKR (KKR) on Wednesday revealed that it has slashed its overweight exposure to leveraged loans to zero.\n\nGiven the disclocations of late, we want a little more flexibility, Henry McVey, KKR's head of global macro & asset allocation, wrote in a report titled The Game Has Changed.\n\nThe fear is when the economic cycle ends, these highly leveraged companies will have trouble refinancing their debt. That could lead to a wave of bankruptcies.\n\nThe market was sharply constrained in the fourth quarter. If we saw a prolonged period, you would have companies that would start to have challenges, said Howard.\n\nRecord-high corporate debt\n\nConsider that US nonfinancial companies rated by Moody's were sitting on $5.7 trillion of debt as of the end of June 2018.\n\nThe ratio of nonfinancial corporate debt to GDP has never been higher going back to records that began in 1947, according to the Office of Financial Research, a Treasury Department bureau created after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nEven if a recession strikes soon, most companies aren't facing imminent deadlines to pay back debt.\n\nMany CFOs took advantage of easy money to lock in low rates for extended periods. And record-high corporate profits, boosted by the corporate tax rate, have given companies lots of ammo to repay debt.\n\nMost companies have low refinancing risk in 2019, according to a Moody's Investors Service report published on Thursday.\n\nWhen the markets get bumpy, high-yield borrowers can sit on their hands and wait, Howard said.\n\nThat's good because December showed they could be waiting a while.
Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n\nElizabeth Warren is looking at a potentially weak finish in her neighbor state of New Hampshire tonight following on a disappointing third place finish in Iowa, and her campaign manager is out with a new memo that hits at what the Warren campaign sees as the fundamental weaknesses of her rivals.\n\nIt's notable that the memo, penned by Roger Lau and just sent out to Warren supporters, draws stark contrasts between Warren and her rivals even as the senator herself remains reticent to directly go after her competitors.\n\nSome of the key critiques that Lau outlines about their top rivals include saying that Bernie Sanders has a ceiling; pointing out that Joe Biden's support among even older and black voters is eroding; questioning Pete Buttigieg's ability to appeal to diverse voters; and saying Amy Klobuchar is untested and doesn't have a long-term infrastructure in place.\n\nHere are some key lines:\n\nSenator Sanders starts with a ceiling that's significantly lower than the support he had four years ago.\n\nFormer Vice President Biden entered this race as the clear frontrunner, reaching over 40% in national polling last spring. He's now polling under 30% even among older voters and African-American voters, who have been his strongest supporters, and his support among younger voters has fallen to just 6%.\n\nFormer Mayor Buttigieg's most significant challenge is yet to come, as the contest moves into states with more diverse electorates, and he still hasn't answered tough questions about his record in South Bend.\n\nSenator Klobuchar is getting a well-deserved look from voters for the first time, but hasn't been able to build out infrastructure for the long haul, and is playing catch up on a very short timeline.\n\nAs the campaign has been doing for a while, this is clearly another effort to set expectations for a long haul fight that extends through at least Super Tuesday for the Warren campaign.
Win the lottery? Welcome to the 1%. Now here comes the taxman.\n\nThe odds of winning the record $1.5 billion jackpot in Saturday night's drawing are 1 in 292 million. Anyone who beats those odds has tremendous luck, and a colossal tax bill, to look forward to.\n\nPrize money = taxable income: Lottery winnings are taxed like income, and the IRS taxes the top income bracket 39.6%. The government will withhold 25% of that before the money ever gets to the winner. The rest has to be paid at tax time.\n\nThen there are local taxes. Of the 44 U.S. states that participate in Powerball, all but a handful will take an additional cut of the money, according to lottery statistics site USA Mega.\n\nNew Jersey's rate is among the lowest at 3%, while New York's is the highest at 8.82%.\n\nA New York City resident would probably have the highest lottery tax rate anywhere in the nation, since the city also has a municipal tax -- an additional 3.9%.\n\nRelated: Powerball jackpot hits $900 million\n\nPayout options: Exactly how much a winner owes in taxes will depend on how they opt to have the prize money distributed.\n\nLottery winners can choose to take a one-time cash payout, or to receive annual payments for the next 30 years.\n\nIf the winner opts for the lump sum, Powerball will award the jackpot's cash value, which is about $930 million. That means the recipient would pay the income tax on that amount up front.\n\nYou're even less likely to win Powerball than you think\n\nSo if a resident of New York City wins and takes the lump sum, he or she will only get about $577 million. The government will withhold about $353 million, nearly 40%.\n\nPowerball winners also have the option of collecting their prize money in annual payments, or an annuity.\n\nIn that scenario, the jackpot winner will get a small slice of the $930 million up front. Powerball invests the rest and uses the interest to pay out bigger and bigger installments over the next 30 years. Eventually the total could add up to $1.5 billion...before taxes.\n\nThe same federal and state taxes still apply, but they're paid as each installment is distributed.\n\nRelated: 114 lottery millionaires are missing\n\nWhile the first chunk of prize money will be charged the current rate, future tax bills may go up or down (probably up) depending on how lawmakers change the tax code.\n\nThe bottom line: To maximize the overall value of your winnings, most financial experts advise taking the lump sum.\n\nEven after taxes, that option can net you more than $1.5 billion over 30 years if you invest it -- even in something ultra-conservative like municipal bonds (which are tax free).\n\nBut an overly aggressive [investment] portfolio or careless and outlandish spending can leave you penniless, Wells Fargo Advisors vice president of investments Scott Kaminsky said.
For decades, millions of Indians emigrated to the Middle East to make money. Now many of them are investing their profits back home, encouraged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's overhaul of the economy.\n\nSeveral prominent businessmen in the United Arab Emirates -- home to the world's largest Indian diaspora -- have committed billions to India in the past three years. Modi's business-friendly policies are encouraging others.\n\nWe've always been hesitant to invest in India just because the bureaucracy was too much and corruption was too much, said Binay Shetty, CEO of BRS Ventures. But when the new government came in, they started changing this and we took a view that we wanted to expand, he told CNNMoney.\n\nRelated: Millions more companies are now paying tax in India\n\nShetty's father left India in 1973 for the UAE, where he first worked as a medical supplies salesman. Two years later, he launched a clinic and distribution company in Abu Dhabi, eventually building a network of hospitals across the UAE. The company, NMC Health (NMHLY), listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2012 and is now worth $8.5 billion.\n\nBRS Ventures wants to replicate that success in India. It acquired several hospitals over the past few years with 1,000 beds in total. Shetty's aim is to add at least another 4,000 beds over the next five years.\n\nThe target is to become one of the largest hospital groups in India, he said. The company is also looking towards India for other sectors it operates in, including pharmaceuticals, education and financial services. It plans to invest $300 million over the next two years.\n\nModicare: India plans free healthcare for 500 million\n\nPrime Minister Modi is guest of honor at the World Government Summit in Dubai, starting Sunday. Since taking office in 2014, he has pledged to boost India's growth and slash the country's notorious red tape.\n\nHe's had mixed results with the former, but recent moves to relax retail restrictions and overhaul the tax system have cheered foreign investors.\n\nIndia jumped 30 spots in the World Bank's ease of doing business ranking released last November. Some analysts have questioned the reliability of the ranking, but Modi and his government have touted it as a ringing endorsement of their policies.\n\nSudesh Aggarwal, a Dubai-based Indian businessman who sits on the board of the UAE Business Leaders Forum, said the World Bank's seal of approval has boosted investor sentiment.\n\nThe forum says 100 expat Indians have pooled $1 billion to invest in India.\n\nThey are open to investing in a variety of sectors such as healthcare, education, solar power and infrastructure, Aggarwal told CNNMoney, adding that the group is looking to join hands with state governments to work on specific projects.\n\nThe question is what the state governments want for their states, we work according to that, he said.\n\nSeveral other companies started by Indians based in the UAE are also expanding their footprint back home.\n\nThe Lulu Group, best known for its chain of supermarkets, already operates malls, convention centers and hotels across southern India and has several new projects in the pipeline. KEF Holdings, a construction firm that specializes in prefabricated buildings, has invested in four Indian projects worth around $180 million since 2016.\n\nAster, a Dubai-based healthcare firm, is reportedly planning an IPO on the Bombay Stock Exchange next week.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that several major UAE-based Indians are now making major investments into India, said Navdeep Singh Suri, India's ambassador to the UAE.\n\nBusiness is driven only partly by patriotism, it is principally driven by returns and by ease of doing business, Suri told CNNMoney. Along with the growth of the Indian economy, [investors] also see that it is becoming easier.\n\nRelated: Modi tells Davos globalization is under attack\n\nThe affection is mutual, and with good reason. More than 3 million Indians live in the UAE, according to the United Nations. (Only Mexicans in the United States constitute a larger immigrant population between two countries.)\n\nThe UAE accounts for the largest proportion of remittances sent to India, estimated at almost $13 billion in 2016.\n\nModi's visit in 2015 was the first by an Indian prime minister to visit the Gulf state in 34 years. The crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nayhan, has visited India twice since then.\n\nState money is flowing east, too. The UAE government has committed $75 billion towards developing Indian infrastructure, with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Dubai port operator DP World inking deals worth $1 billion and $3 billion respectively in recent months.\n\nAnd Emirates Airline just announced an agreement with Indian state Andhra Pradesh to help develop its aviation sector.\n\nThere's probably a lot more deals to come.\n\nWe've really [only] scratched the surface, said Suri. This is a very capital rich country, and as returns weaken in Western markets, India -- with its combination of growth, scale and stability -- is a very attractive opportunity.

Aired 1-2p ET\n\nAired November 19, 2019 - 13:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\n[13:00:00] JORDAN: -- Mr. Eisenberg had told me to take my concerns to him.\n\n\n\nThen I ask you did -- did Mr. Eisenberg tell you not to report, to go around Mr. Morrison. And you said actually he did say that I shouldn't talk to any other people. Is that right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes, but there's a whole -- there's a period of time in there between when I spoke to him and when he circled back around. It wasn't that long a period of time but it was enough time for me to ...\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Enough time for you to go talk to someone that you won't tell us who it is right.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I've -- I've -- I've been instructed not to, Representative Jordan.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Well, here's what I'm getting. The lawyer told you don't talk to any other people and you interpret that as not talking to your boss but you talk to your brother, you talk to the lawyers, you talk to Secretary (inaudible), you talk to the one guy Adam Schiff won't tell you -- won't let us -- won't let you tell us who he is. Is that right.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Representative Jordan, I did my job.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: I'm not saying you didn't. All I'm saying is you -- your -- the instructions from the lawyer was you shouldn't talk to anybody and you interpret that as don't talk to my boss but I'm going to go talk to someone that we can't even ask you who that individual is.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is incorrect.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Well, I just read what you said. I shouldn't talk to any other people.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: The time of the gentleman has expired.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: There's -- I'm sorry, Chairman, but that sequence is not the way it played out.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJORDAN: I'm reading through (ph) the transcript Colonel Vindman.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Jordan, please let Colonel Vindman ...\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: There's -- the sequence played out where immediately afterwards I expressed my concerns. I did my coordination function, Mr. Eisenberg circled back around, told me not to talk to anybody else. In that period of time I did not manage to talk to ...\n\n\n\nJORDAN: So that's when it happened. That's when you talked to someone.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Heck, you are recognized. Mr. Heck.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That's right.\n\n\n\nHECK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Colonel Vindman, let's go back to that pair of meetings on July 10 in Ambassador Bolton's office and down in the war (ph) room where you witness Ambassador Sondland inform the Ukrainian officials that as a prerequisite to a White House meeting between the two presidents, quote, the Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens, end quote.\n\n\n\nYou said that Ambassador Sondland was quote, calling for an investigation that didn't exist into the Bidens in Burisma, is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nHECK: It's that same afternoon you went to Mr. Eisenberg, the council, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That meeting occurred in the afternoon and within, you know, a couple -- I'm sure it was within a couple hours I spoke to Mr. Eisenberg.\n\n\n\nHECK: How did he react?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He was cool, calm, and collected. He took notes and he said he would look into it.\n\n\n\nHECK: And did he not also tell you to feel free to come back if you had additional concerns.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He did. He did, Congressman.\n\n\n\nHECK: Ambassador Sondland had told you that his request the Ukrainians had been coordinated with the chief of staff -- acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Did you report that to Mr. Eisenberg?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nHECK: And what was his reaction?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He -- he took notes and he said he was going to -- he'll follow up or look into it. I don't recall exactly what he said.\n\n\n\nHECK: Colonel, you've also testified that on the July 25 call now between the two presidents, quote, there was no doubt, end quote, that President Trump asked for investigations into the 2016 election and Vice President Biden's son in return for a White House meeting. Within an hour of that call you reported back to Mr. Eisenberg, did you not?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nHECK: Went back to him just to see (inaudible) suggestion would be appropriate.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He's an assistant the president. He -- it was less a suggestion and more than -- more of an instruction.\n\n\n\nHECK: Did you tell the lawyers that President Trump asked President Zelensky to speak to Mr. Giuliani.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nHECK: And the lawyers -- it was at this point, told you not to talk to anyone else.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is -- that's -- that is not correct with regards to timing. They didn't fall back -- they didn't circle back around. What ended up happening is in my coordination role I spoke to state (ph) -- I spoke to number (ph) of intelligence community and the general counsel from one of the intelligence bodies notified Mr. Eisenberg that there was -- you know that there was information on the call, on the July 25th call, as that point Mr. Eisenberg told me I shouldn't talk to anybody else about it.\n\n\n\nHECK: Colonel, I want to go back to 2014 in Iraq. When you were blown up, I presume that given the point in your military career and what else was going on in the world that upon recovery there was the very real prospect or possibility that you might once again find yourself in harms way. Is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes, Congressman, it happened in 2004, but yes.\n\n\n\nHECK: Four, excuse me, thank you. Did you consider leaving the military service at that point?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: No. Frankly, Congressman, I suffered light wounds I was fortunate compared to my counterparts in the same vehicle. And I returned to duty as, I think it may have been that same day.\n\n\n\n[13:05:00]\n\n\n\nHECK: But you could have been subjected to additional harm. You chose to continue service in uniform.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I continued to serve in combat for the remaining 10 or 11 months of the tour.\n\n\n\nHECK: You know, Colonel, I have to say I find it a rich but incredible painful irony that within a week of the President contrary to all advise of the Senior Military Officials he pardons those who were convicted of war crimes, which was widely decried in the military community. Within the week of him doing that he is engaged in an effort and allies on his behalf including some here today to demean your record of service and the sacrifice and contribution you have made. Indeed, sir, less than 20 minutes ago the White House officially quoted out, out of context the comments referred to earlier by Mr. Morrison in (ph) your judgment.\n\n\n\nI can only conclude, sir, that what we though was just the President is the subject of our deliberations in this inquiry isn't sufficient to capture what's happening here. Indeed what subject to this inquiry and what is apparel is our constitution and the very values upon which it is based. I want to say thank you for your service. But you know thank you doesn't cut it. Please know, however, that it comes from the bottom of my heart and I know on the bottoms of the heart of countless other Americans, thank you for the service, sir. I yield back.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Jordan.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sunday the Speaker of United States House of Representatives called the President of the United States an impostor. Speaker of the House called the President an impostor. The guy, 63 million people for, the guy who won an Electoral College landslide, the Speaker calls an impostor. That's what happened to our country, to this Congress. The Speaker statement says it all. The Democrats have never accepted the will of the American people. Democrats don't trust the American people. The American people who wanted to send someone to this town who was willing to shake it up a bit.\n\n\n\nThey don't trust that and they have tried to do everything they can to undo what the American people decided on November 8, 2016. They've been out to get the President since the day he was elected. The whistleblowers lawyer, the whistleblowers legal team said this January 30, 2017, the President had been in office about a week, coup has starter, first of many steps. Next sentence impeachment will follow ultimately. I guess we're in the final step. It started three and half years ago. Congressman Tlaib started this Congress. First day of Congress said impeach the President.\n\n\n\nRepresentative Greene said if we don't impeach him the President's going to win reelection. We got to do it. Mot importantly, most importantly five Democrat members of this committee voted to move forward with impeachment before the phone call ever happened. The truth is the attacks actually started before the Inauguration even before the election. Ranking Member talked about this. Hi opening statement July 2016 FBI opens investigation so called Trump-Raja (ph) coordination collusion which was never there. Opened an investigation spied on two American citizens associated with the Presidential campaign. My guess is that's probably never happened in American History, but they did it.\n\n\n\nAnd for 10 months Jim Comey FBI investigated the President, guess what after 10 months they had nothing. And you know why we know that because when we disposed Mr. Comey last Congress he told us they didn't have a thing. No matter, Special Counsel Mueller gets appointed and they do a two year $40 million, 19 lawyer unbelievable investigation and guess what they come back and they got nothing. But the Democrats don't care. So now we get this, a bunch of depositions in the bunker and the basement of the Capital, witnesses who aren't allowed to answer questions about who they talked to about the phone call. We get this all based on some anonymous whistleblower, no first hand knowledge biased against the President.\n\n\n\n[13:10:00]\n\n\n\nThese facts have never changed, we learned these right away. Who worked with Vice President Biden , who wrote a memo the day after somebody talked to him about the call, awaited 18 days to file a complaint, 18 days to file a complaint. What did he do in those 18 days? We all know, ran off and talked with Chairman Schiff's staff. And then hired the legal team that I just talked about, one of those steps in the whole impeachment coup as his legal team has said.\n\n\n\nThis is scary what these guys are putting our country through. It is sad, it is scary, it is wrong. And the good news is the American people see through it all, they know the facts are on the President's side as Representative Stefanik said, four facts will never change. We've got the transcript which they never thought the President would release. Shows no coordination, not conditionality, no linkage. We got the two guys on the call President Trump, President Zelensky, who have side nothing wrong no pressure no pushing here. We've got the fact that Ukrainians didn't even know aid was held up at the time of the call and most importantly we have yet to have one witness tell us that the any evidence from anyone that President Zelensky did anything on investigations to get the aid released.\n\n\n\nThose facts will never change. The facts are on the President's side, the process is certainly not. It has been the most unfair process we have ever seen and the American people understand that. Those 63 million Americans they understand it and frankly I think a lot of other do as well. They see what this for what it is. And they know this is wrong, especially wrong just 11 months before the next election. I yield bank.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Welch.\n\n\n\nWELCH: Thank you. What this hearing is about, I think was best stated by Colonel Vindman's opening statement. The question before us is this, is it improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate the United States citizen and political opponent? It's very well stated.\n\n\n\nI just listened to Mr. Jordan, as you did as well, and I heard his criticisms in the process, nothing really happened, a lot of people are out to get the president. I didn't hear an answer to the question, as to whether it's proper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent.\n\n\n\nAnd to date, I haven't heard any one of my Republican colleagues address that question.\n\n\n\nColonel Vindman and Ms. Williams, thank you. I want to ask some questions that go through the background. What's come out during this process is that we had two Ukraine policies.\n\n\n\nOne was bipartisan and long-standing, and that was to assist Ukraine, which had freed itself from the domination of Russia, to fight corruption and to resist Russian aggression. Is that a fair statement, Colonel Vindman?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I think that's a fair characterization, Congressman.\n\n\n\nWELCH: And to give folks a reminder of the extent of corruption, by the way, a legacy of Putin's Russia, is your understanding that when their prior president, Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia into the arms of Mr. Putin, he took with him $30 to $40 billion of that impoverished country?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Those -- there are different estimates, but it's on that scale, yes.\n\n\n\nWELCH: Vast scale for a poor country. And is it your understanding that powerless, but motivated Ukrainians rose up in protest to this incredible graft in theft and abuse by their president?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nWELCH: And that was in the Maidan -- it was called the Maidan Revolution, the Revolution of Dignity, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nWELCH: And young people went into that square in downtown Kiev, and demonstrated for months, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct. And 100 died.\n\n\n\nWELCH: One hundred and six young people died, and older people died, correct? That is in -- in -- in -- between February 18, 2014 and February 22, is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\n[13:15:00]\n\n\n\nWELCH: One hundred and six died, including people who were shot by snipers, kids, and Yanukovych had put snipers on the rooftops of buildings to shoot into that square and kill, murder, slaughter, those young people. Is that your understanding?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nWELCH: In our bipartisan support, and by the way, I want to say to my Republican colleagues, a lot of leadership to have this bipartisan support came from your side, thank you. But our whole commitment was to get rid of corruption and to stop that Russian aggression, is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That amounts to some of the key pillars. WELCH: That's right. And the Giuliani, Sondmand (ph), and it appears, Trump policy was not about that, it was about investigations into a political opponent. Correct? I'll take that question back, we know it.\n\n\n\nAnd you know, I'm going to say this to President Trump, you want to investigate Joe Biden, you want to investigate Hunter Biden, go at it. Do it. Do it hard. Do it dirty. Do it the way you do do it. Just don't do it by asking a foreign leader to help you in your campaign. That's your job, it's not his.\n\n\n\nMy goal in these hearings is two things, one is to get an answer to Colonel Vindman's question. And the second, coming out of this, is for us, as a Congress, to return to the Ukraine policy that Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy both support. It's not investigations, it's the restoration of democracy in Ukraine and the resistance of Russian aggression. I yield back.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Maloney.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: thank you both for being here. You know, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, this may be one of your first Congressional hearings like this, so you may not --\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: And hopefully the last.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nMALONEY: I can't blame you for feeling that way, sir. Particularly when I've been sitting here listening to my Republican colleagues, one of the advantages of being down here at the kids table, is that you get to hear the folks above your ask their questions. And I've been listening closely to my Republican colleagues and I've heard them say just about everything except to contradict any of the substantive testimony you've both given.\n\n\n\nYou may have notices, there's been a lot of complaints and there's been a lot of insinuations and there's been a lot of suggestions maybe that -- that you're -- that you're service is somehow not -- not to be trusted.\n\n\n\nYou know, you were treated to questions about your loyalty because of some half-baked job offer, I guess, the Ukrainians made you, which you, of course, dutifully reported. I guess, Mr. Castor's implying you're -- you've got some dual loyalty, which is, of course, an old smear we've heard many times in our history, to try to demean you as though maybe you're -- you've overstated the your importance of your job.\n\n\n\nBut, of course, you were -- this -- the guy on the National Security Council responsible for directing Ukrainian policy. We've heard the air out some allocations, with no basis improve, but they just want to get them out there and hope maybe some of those strands of spaghetti, I guess, will stick on the wall if they keep throwing them.\n\n\n\nWe've even had a member of this Committee question -- this is my favorite, question why you would wear your dress uniform today. Even though that dress uniform includes a breastplate that has a Combat Infantry badge on it and a Purple Heart metal ribbon.\n\n\n\nSeems like if anybody gets to wear their uniform, it's somebody who's got breastplate with those accommodations on it. So, let's do it again, let's do the substance, can we do that? Because we've had a lot of -- a lot of dust kicked up.\n\n\n\nMs. Williams, you heard the call with your own ears, right?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes sir.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Not second hand, not hear say, you heard the president speak. You heard his voice on the call?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And you conclusion was what he said about investigating the Bidens was your words, unusual and inappropriate, I believe. Am I right?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: That was my testimony.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And Mr. Vindman, you were treated to a July 10th meeting in the White House, where you heard Ambassador Sondland raise investigations, conditioning a White House meeting on that investigations, that you thought were unduly political, I believe that's how you described them. And you went to NSC Council and you reported, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And then later, you too, were on the White House call, am I right? You heard it with your own ears?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Not second hand, not from somebody else, not hear say, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: You heard the president's voice on the call?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And you heard him raise that subject again, that Ambassador Sondland had raised before, about investigating the Bidens, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And I want to ask you, when you heard him say that, what was the first thought that went through your mind?\n\n\n\n[13:20:00]\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Frankly, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. There was probably an element of shock that maybe in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out. And how this was likely to have significant implications for U.S. national security.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And you went immediately and you reported it, didn't you?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Why?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Because that was my duty.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Do you still have your opening statement handy?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Read the last paragraph for me again, not the one -- the very last one, the second to last one. Would you read that one again for me? Because I think the American public deserves to hear it again.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: The dad...\n\n\n\nMALONEY: That's the one.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I think my dad would appreciate this one too.\n\n\n\nDad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: You realize when you came forward out of sense of duty that you are putting yourself in direct opposition to the most powerful person in the world. Do you realize that, sir?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I knew I was assuming a lot of risk.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And I'm struck by that word don't -- that phrase do not worry, you addressed your dad. Was your dad a warrior?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He did serve. It was a different military though.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And he would have worried if you were putting yourself up against the president of the United States, is that right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He deeply worried about it because in his context there was -- it was the ultimate risk.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And why you have confidence that you can do that and tell your dad not to worry?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Congressman, because this is America. This is the country I have served and defended, that all of my brothers have served. And here, right matters.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Thank you, sir. I yield back.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE) SCHIFF: Ms. Demings.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, Ms. Williams, let me thank you for your service to our nation. It truly matters.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Colonel Vindman, I had the honor of speaking to a group of veterans this past weekend. And what I said to them was that no words, no words are really adequate or sufficient to fully express our gratitude for their service to our nation. So, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, today I say to you, there are no words that are sufficient to fully express our gratitude to you for what you have done for our nation and, amazingly, what you are still willing to do for our nation.\n\n\n\nIt is vitally important that the American people understand how President Trumps unethical demand that Ukraine deliver a politically- motivated investigation in exchange for military assistance created a security risk for our, the United States of America, national security. The president was not just playing a political game by upholding military aid and meetings with Ukraine, threatening the hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance that Congress had appropriated has real-life consequences for Ukraine and for the USA.\n\n\n\nIn your test deposition, Colonel Vindman, you testified, and I quote, a strong and independent Ukraine is critical to our security interests. Could you please explain why a strong and independent Ukraine is so critical, and why it is so vital to U.S. interests?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: We sometimes refer to Ukraine as a front-line state. It's on the front-line of Europe. It's -- they have actually described to me, the Ukrainians, that that is -- it is a -- they consider themselves as a barrier between Russian aggression and Europe. And what I have heard them describe is the need for U.S. support in order to serve this role in order to protect European and Western security.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: Lieutenant Colonel, this is not just a theoretical conflict between Ukraine and Russia. You have already said this morning that Russia is actively fighting to expand into Ukraine, that Ukraine is in a hot war with Russia right now, is that correct?\n\n\n\n[13:25:00]\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: It's stable, but it's still a hot war.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: And isn't it true, Lieutenant Colonel, that even if the security assistance was eventually delivered to Ukraine, the fact that it was delayed, just that fact, could signal to Russia that the bond between Ukraine and the U.S. was weakening?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That was the concern of myself and my colleagues.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: And was the risk of even the appearance that the U.S.-Ukraine bond is shaky is that it could embolden Russia to act with more aggression, would you say that is correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I believe that was my testimony.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: Just last month, during an interview, President Putin joked about interfering in our political elections. I can only guess that is what we have become to Russia and its president. I think he felt emboldened by the president's reckless actions, both attempts to hold critical military aid from Ukraine and President Trump's effort to blame Ukraine, not Russia, for election interference.\n\n\n\nMs. Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I can only say that every American, regardless of our politics, should be critically concerned about that. And let me just say this. Yes, we do trust the American people. But you know what, the American people trust us too as members of Congress to support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And we intend to do just that.\n\n\n\nThank you again for your service.\n\n\n\nMr. Chairman, I yield back.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Krishnamoorthi.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Good afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams. Thank you for your service.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Colonel Vindman, I am concerned that your loyalty has been questioned not just because you are bringing forward evidence of wrongdoing against the president, president of United States, but because you are an immigrant. Recently FOX News host Brian Kilmeade said, he, meaning you, were born in the Soviet Union, emigrated with his family young, he tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine. I find this statement reprehensible because it appears that your immigrant heritage is being used against you.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Colonel, I came to this country when I was three months old. Your family fled the Soviet Union and moved to America when you are just three-and-a-half years old, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And I understand that your father worked multiple jobs while also learning English, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Your father stressed the importance of embracing what it means to be an American, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: You and your family faced difficult times during your childhood, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I can relate. That's my story too. But your father went on to become an engineer, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He reestablished himself in his former profession in the United States.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I can relate. I -- I got a B.S. in engineering. Of course some people claim I practice the B.S. part now.\n\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\nYour father never gave up working hard to build his very own American dream, did he?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He did not.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, your father achieved the American dream and so did you and your family. From one immigrant American to another immigrant American, I want to say to you that you and your family represent the very best of America. I assume that you are as proud to be an American as I am, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes, sir.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, I want to turn your attention to Yuriy Lutsenko. You called him a disruptive actor in your opening statement, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Mr. Lutsenko, the former prosecutor general in Ukraine has made various claims about various Americans, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: You are unaware of any factual basis for his accusations against Ambassador Yovanovitch. Right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: He also was a source for an article by John Solomon in The Hill, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you said that key elements of that article as well as his accusations are false. Right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Lutsenko is not a credible source, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\n[13:30:00]\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, the other side claims that there was absolutely no pressure on this July 25 phone call. I think that's what we heard earlier, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I believe so.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you have termed what President Trump asked in terms of investigations on that phone call as a demand. Correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you've pointed out the large power disparity between President Trump on the one hand and President Zelensky on the other. Correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: There was pressure on that phone call, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: The -- the Ukranians needed the meeting. The Ukrainians subsequently when they found out about it needed the security assistance.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: So the pressure was brought to bear on them, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I believe so.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, Colonel Vindman, last week we heard a decorated military veteran namely Ambassador Bill Taylor come before us. You interacted regularly with Ambassador Taylor and you know him to be a man of integrity and he's a patriotic American. Isn't that right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: A superb individual.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I asked Ambassador Taylor a series of questions based on his experience as an infantry commander. I asked him quote, is an officer allowed to hold up action placing his troops at risk until someone provides him a personal benefit? Ambassador Taylor responded, no sir. Colonel Vindman, do you agree with Ambassador Taylor?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I then asked Ambassador Taylor quote, is that because they would be betraying their responsibility to the nation? Ambassador Taylor responded, yes, sir. Colonel Vindman, do you agree with Ambassador Taylor?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I then asked Ambassador Taylor, quote, could that type of conduct trigger a court martial? Ambassador Taylor said yes sir. Do you agree with Ambassador Taylor Colonel Vindman?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you for your service.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: That concludes the member questioning. Representative Nunes, you're recognized for any concluding remarks. NUNES: Well Act 1 of today's circus is over. For those of you who have been watching at home, the democrats are no closer to impeachment then where they were three years ago. In the process they've -- the Department of Justice, FBI, State Department, elements within the I.C., the ICIG have all suffered long-term damage. The democrats can continue to put -- to poison the American people with this nonsense. We sat here all morning without any evidence for impeachment which would be a very serious crime, high crime and misdemeanor as it says in the Constitution. No such thing.\n\n\n\nPolicy disagreements and the democrats failure to acknowledge their involvement in the 2016 election, I would say it's astonishing but that would be putting too little emphasis on their actions. With that I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: I thank the gentleman. I want to thank our witnesses today, Ms. Williams, Colonel Vindman, both of you for your service to the country, for your testimony here today and I just want to address briefly some of the evidence you presented as well as others thus far in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I want to join my colleagues in thanking you Colonel Vindman for your military service and I should tell you that notwithstanding all of the questions you got on why didn't you go talk to your supervisor. Why didn't you go talk to Mr. Morrison? Why did you go to the national security lawyer as if there is something wrong with going to the national security lawyer.\n\n\n\nAre you aware that we asked Mr. Morrison whether he went to the national security lawyer right after the call and that he did.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I am.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: And are you aware also that we asked him, well if you have this problem with Colonel Vindman not going to you instead of the lawyer, naturally you must have got your supervisor in you know what his answer was? He didn't go to his supervisor, either. He went directly to the National Security Council lawyers. I hope my colleagues will give him the same hard time for not following his chain of command that he complained about with you apparently.\n\n\n\nThe president may attack you and has. Others on right-wing TV might attack you, and they have. But I thought you should know and maybe you know already that this is what the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had to say about you Colonel Vindman. He is a professional, competent, patriotic and loyal officer. He has made an extraordinary contribution to the security of our nation in both peacetime and combat. I am sure your dad is proud to hear that.\n\n\n\n[13:35:00]\n\n\n\nMy colleagues have tried to make the argument here today and we've heard it before that the president was just interested in fighting corruption. That's our goal, fighting corruption in Ukraine, this terribly corrupt country. The problem of course with that is there is no evidence of the president trying to fight corruption. The evidence all points in the other direction. The evidence points the direction of the president inviting Ukraine to engage in the corrupt act of investigating a U.S. political opponent.\n\n\n\nAmbassador Yovanovitch was known as a strong fighter of corruption so what does the president do? He recalls her from her post. Ambassador Yovanovitch, in fact, was at a meeting celebrating other anticorruption fighters including a woman who had acid thrown in her face on the day she was told to get on the next plane back to Washington. You prepared talking points for the president's first conversation with Zelensky. He's supposed to talk about rooting out corruption. If this President had such a deep interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, surely he would've brought it up in the call but of course we now know that he did not.\n\n\n\nWe then see Rudy Giuliani not fighting corruption but asking for an investigation of the Bidens and my colleagues say well maybe he was acting on his own. Even though he says he's acting as the President's lawyer, maybe he was really acting on his own but the two investigations that Rudy Giuliani wanted, come up in the meeting you participate in on July 10th at the White House, when Ambassador Sondland brings up the Bidens and Burisma of 2016, tells the Ukrainians who want that meeting at the White House, you've got to do these investigations.\n\n\n\nNow they would say Ambassador Sondland was acting on his own, but that doesn't quite work either because we have the call record from July 25th, which the President was forced to release, in which the President doesn't bring up corruption, he doesn't say how are those anti-corruption courts going or great work at the Rada. Of course not.\n\n\n\nWhat does the President say? I want you to invest the -- investigate the Bidens and this debunked conspiracy theory pushed by Vladimir Putin, that also helps me in my re-election. So much for fighting corruption.\n\n\n\nThe message to Ukraine -- the real message to Ukraine, our U.S. policy message is don't engage in political investigations. The message from the President, however, was the exact opposite -- do engage in political investigations and do it for my re-election.\n\n\n\nAnd it's also made clear they want the White House meeting and ultimately if they want $400 million in U.S. aid, this is what they have to do. The only lament I hear from my colleagues is it wasn't successful, they got caught, they didn't get the political investigations and they still had to release the money. Now, they still haven't gotten the White House meeting but they had to release the money because the whistleblower blew the whistle -- the whistleblower the President wants to punish -- and because Congress announced it was doing investigations, and very soon thereafter, the President was forced to lift the hold on the aid.\n\n\n\nThey argue well this makes it -- this makes it OK, that it was a failed effort to bribe Ukraine, a failed effort to extort Ukraine. That doesn't make it better, it's no less odious because it was discovered and it was stopped. And we have courageous people like yourself who come forward, who report things, who do what they should do, who have a sense, as you put it, Colonel, of duty -- of duty. Not to the person of the President, but to the presidency and to the country, and we thank you for that.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, I think this all comes back to something we heard from another career foreign service officer just last Friday, in a conversation he overheard with the President in a restaurant in Ukraine, in which the President, not Rudy Giuliani, not anyone else, the President of the United States wanted to know are they going to do the investigation? This is the day after that July 25th call -- are they going to do the investigations? And he's ensured by Ambassador Sondland they're going to do it.\n\n\n\nAnd what does Sondland relate to this foreign service officer after he hangs up that call? The President doesn't give a expletive about Ukraine, he only cares about the big things that help his personal interests. That's all you need to know.\n\n\n\nAnd it isn't just about Ukraine. Of course, Ukraine is fighting our fight against the Russians, against their expansionism. That's our fight, too -- that's our fight, too, at least we thought so on a bipartisan basis, that's our fight, too. That's why we support Ukraine with the military aid that we have.\n\n\n\n[13:40:00]\n\n\n\nWell the President may not care about it but we do. We care about our defense, we care about the defense of our allies and we darn well care about our Constitution. We are adjourned. I please ask the -- the audience to allow the witnesses and the members who have to go vote to leave first.\n\n\n\nJAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: I'm Jake Tapper, live in Washington.\n\n\n\nToday's first round of the impeachment hearings for this week is in the books. We just heard from Jennifer Williams. She's a State Department aide to Vice President Mike Pence. We also heard from Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. He is the National Security Council's top Ukraine advisor at the White House.\n\n\n\nHouse Intelligence Democrats have largely focus on the witnesses' impression of that phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky on July 25th, which both of them were listening to, while Republicans have attempted to discredit and undermine the witnesses, especially Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.\n\n\n\nBefore we get to an analysis, I want to play to what could be a key point of this entire investigation of this entire impeachment hearing.\n\n\n\nWhen you strip away the Democrats talking about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's patriotism, his service, his inspiring story as an immigrant to this country when he was a little boy, when you strip away Republicans trying to undermine him, questions about whether or not he followed the chain of command when it came to his concerns about the call, this is really what this hearing is about.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDANIEL GOLDMAN, COUNSEL FOR HOUSE DEMOCRATS: So just to summarize in this July 25th call between the presidents of the United States and Ukraine, President Trump demanded a favor of President Zelensky to conduct investigations that both of you ang acknowledge were for President Trump's political interest, not the national interest, and in return for his promise of a much-desired White House meeting for President Zelensky.\n\n\n\nColonel Vindman, is that an accurate summary of the excerpts we just looked at in.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nGOLDMAN: Miss Williams?\n\n\n\nJENNIFER WILLIAMS, AIDE TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Yes.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Jeffrey Toobin, your response?\n\n\n\nJEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: When you strip away everything, what we have learned over the past month is one thing, which is for the first time in American history, an American president has used taxpayer dollars to persuade, bribe, extort another president for information that will help him get reelected.\n\n\n\nThat was the initial accusation. And that's what's been proven over and over again with all these witnesses.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Dana Bash?\n\n\n\nDANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. And what you haven't heard is any Republican on that day say anything other than that. No Republican has tried, even attempted to poke a hole in that fundamental question, why we are all here, why these hearings are taking place.\n\n\n\nWhat Republicans did instead is question the credibility of the witness, question the story, repeat conspiracy theories that have been debunked by the Intelligence Community.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: About whether or not Russia or Ukraine interfered in the election?\n\n\n\nBASH: Yes. And by the Trump Justice Department, which we can get to in a second. But just keeping it broad, the fact that Republicans didn't even try to go there on the substance of the allegation and what the picture of these witnesses, just like the ones last week, painted, is very, very telling. It goes to the notion of, OK, he did it. And a lot of these\n\n\n\nRepublicans have said in other forums, it wasn't the right thing to do but it's not impeachable and the process is bad.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: John King, during the hearing, President Trump didn't tweet at Lieutenant Colonel Vindman or Jennifer Williams as he has before about both of them.\n\n\n\nBut the White House official account did tweet something -- if we could put that tweet up. The White House official account, paid by your tax dollars, if you're an American watching right now, saying, Tim Morrison, Alex Vindman's former boss, said he had concerns about Vindman's judgement.\n\n\n\nNow that is factually accurate to Morrison, who is no longer on the National Security Council. Did say that he had concerns about whether or not Vindman had the right policy making chops for the job.\n\n\n\nBut it is remarkable to see taxpayer dollars being used to attack a current National Security Council official.\n\n\n\nJOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. First, you had the president do it. He's faced a lot of blowback from Republicans, saying please don't do that, please don't attack these witnesses, we're trying to do this on a different track. Now you have the taxpayer accounts, as you mentioned, doing it here.\n\n\n\nBut it's part of the Republican strategy. Number one -- and you saw some of this in the hearing as well -- Mr. Morrison did say that.\n\n\n\nIf you read the full transcript of Mr. Morrison, he said something damaging about the president. He, too, went to the National Security Council lawyer and reported his concerns about the call.\n\n\n\nThey Republicans are and this is smart politically -- it would be smart in a trial for a lawyer -- they're cherry-picking the information that they believe helps them. They're want challenging the facts. I think that is the most important part.\n\n\n\n[13:45:04]\n\n\n\nWe've now had five witnesses in public hearings, the public impeachment hearings, and the Republicans are not challenging the facts.\n\n\n\nThe facts are being billed that everyone involved, whether they're in Ukraine or the State Department or today inside the West Wing of the White House, thought this was off the rails, thought it was wrong, thought it was improper, though it was possible illegal when you got to the question of putting the hold on the money. The Republicans aren't challenging that.\n\n\n\nWhat they're trying to do is hold the Republicans in line by raising questions about judgment, about loyalty, about maybe political motivations or we're you leaking. It's all a side show, but it's an important side show politically to keep Republicans from breaking. TAPPER: Laura Coates, your take on, this time, not the president but\n\n\n\nthe White House itself attacking a witness -- that's my interpretation -- I should say criticizing, publicly airing critical testimony against one witness while that witness was testifying?\n\n\n\nLAURA COATES, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: What I really have a problem with is this idea in isolation not providing the full context of the statement. When you do that and you use selective quotes, you mislead the public and the job of the White House is not to do just that. It's supposed to guide the public to lead them in genuine fact. In fact, that didn't happen. That led to the quote.\n\n\n\nThe real issue for me is let's compare last week to now. Last week, it was all about, well, he was inappropriate but not outlandish. Now it's, you described an abuse of power, you described a quid pro quo, but you didn't say the words bribery and extortion, therefore, it's not really a problem. That's the only leg they have to stand on.\n\n\n\nThat combined with -- the really offensive one here to me was the idea of, who are you to tell me this information, Vindman? They questioned why he had the audacity to want his name referred to as lieutenant colonel instead of mister. Who do you think you are? You have the audacity to wear your uniform in this courtroom, this professional hearing room. Who do you think you are?\n\n\n\nAnd here you are, taking outside --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: You see Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, who also works in the White House, walking through the halls.\n\n\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n\n\nCOATES: And you have both of them walking the halls and both in positions of real power. But he refused repeatedly to overstate his position. He refused to say that he was somebody who was in charge of policy.\n\n\n\nNobody questioned that he was in charge of policy to the -- that the president of the United States had the prerogative to set foreign policy as the real -- real diplomat. But they tried to attack him for that because they had nothing else there. It was the audacity arguments, the semantics.\n\n\n\nI think it's the most effective unpersuasive and effective here. And one was, as Dana was talking about, if you do not have anything to retort to the actual substance, you have to fire shots at the messenger and take the position of, well, it may be important for the world to have heard this, but you were the wrong person to tell us.\n\n\n\nIf that's the case, Jake, who should it have been?\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI, you know a little about mean tweets from President Trump and the White House.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So without going through your entire history, we heard Ambassador Yovanovitch last week say, in real time, that she found President Trump's tweet intimidating. Republicans have said that mean tweets cannot be intimidating, it just mean tweets, who cares.\n\n\n\nHaving been on the end of it, having been on the end of a negative campaign from President Trump, coming from the White House, what is it like? Is it intimidating? And what do you say to people who say, it's just a negative tweet, who cares?\n\n\n\nANDREW MCCABE, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: First of all, nobody said that to me because that's not what it is. It's absolutely horrifying. I know that from my time still serving in government, while I was serving as deputy director and acting director.\n\n\n\nTo be receiving those sorts of attacks from the president that you serve, while you're in a government position, and therefore not in any position to ever respond or reply or defend yourself in public, it is both horrifying to be turned upon like that by our chief executive of the nation.\n\n\n\nAnd also just oddly -- you just feel so defenseless because there's absolutely nothing you can do to respond to it, to respond in a way with the sort of amplification and clarity that the president has when he speaks about anything.\n\n\n\nIt is absolutely horrifying. It's chilling to your family.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: We heard Lieutenant Colonel Vindman say it's not just about the attacks of the president, it's everything it set off.\n\n\n\nMCCABE: Right, that it sets off. It unleashes a whole torrent of the president's supporters, people who follow him closely, voters and folks like that. But even worse so, people on the Hill, other folks, elected representatives, in positions of authority, who pick up these false narratives and then begin to repeat the lies that the president says about you.\n\n\n\nIt's just -- I can't even adequately describe it. And I know exactly how Ambassador Yovanovitch feels.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So stepping back from that tweet from the White House, John Dean, tell us what you think was effective. What wasn't effective, what point were made?\n\n\n\n[13:50:06]\n\n\n\nJOHN DEAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: If I could just footnote what Andrew said about having been attacked. He knows, I know, you know the basic truth of what happened and efforts to stir up, confuse it. You get a certain comfort in knowing you've told the truth, and attacks just don't affect that.\n\n\n\nI happened to have been in the Witness Protection Program, so I had extra help in protecting myself. But what's happened this morning, to me, was not surprising. There was a lot of speechifying. Republicans found they really had no questions very quickly and posturing, and started posturing, attacking the process. And it shows the weakness of their position overall. The Democrats obviously refuted some of that.\n\n\n\nBig picture, nothing has changed. We're getting more confirmation, the public is getting educated, putting faces on these people and learning what, indeed -- how unprecedented that a president would use his office in this manner to get political advantage over his potential opponent.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Scott Jennings, I want to ask about one point that I thought was not ineffective by Republican Congressman Chris Stewart, of Utah, taking issue with Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's use of the word demand for that part of the call with President Trump, suggesting he'd like a favor and wants President Zelensky to do something for him.\n\n\n\nWe heard Jennifer Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman say they thought it was inappropriate and a demand.\n\n\n\nBut here's Chris Stewart taking issue with that. Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREP. CHRIS STEWART (R-UT): Much has been talked about as we discussed between President Trump and President Zelensky and the word favor and it being interpreted as a basis for impeachment.\n\n\n\nAnd your interpretation of the word favor -- and I'll paraphrase you and feel free to correct me. You said, In the military culture, which you and I are both familiar with, when a superior officer asks for a favor of a subordinate, they will interpret that as a demand.\n\n\n\nIs that a fair synopsis of what you previously stated?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Representative, when a superior makes a request, that's an order.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: OK. In short then you think your interpretation of a favor is a demand based upon your military experience in the military culture?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I think that is correct.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: I think that is correct. Is President Trump a member of the military?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He is not.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: Has he ever served in the military?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Not that I'm aware of.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: Is President Zelensky a member of the military? VINDMAN: I don't believe so.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: The answer is, he's not.\n\n\n\nWould it be fair then to take a person, who has never served in the military, and to take your re-evaluation of their words based on your military experience and your military culture, and to attach that culture and that meaning of those words to someone who's never served?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Representative, I made that judgment, and I stick by that judgment.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: He calls in nonsense. I think that's nonsense, is what Stewart says right after I made that judgment. What do you think?\n\n\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. I thought it was an interesting line of questioning. But it went to the overall assertion by Republicans today that Vindman isn't in a position to know exactly what the president's state of mind was.\n\n\n\nOn other occasions, he says he never met or advised the president directly. He said, quote, I don't know what the president was thinking. He said, quote, I was making a judgment call as a layman.\n\n\n\nWhat Stewart was doing was effective. To say you heard this but, because you don't know the president, you didn't speak to the president, and have a different frame of reference, you're giving your opinion instead of what may be the most important fact, which is what is the president's state of mind.\n\n\n\nIt's fine for Republicans to argue that today and I thought it was effective. That's all going to change tomorrow when Gordon Sondland shows up, because he actually has been talking to the president.\n\n\n\nI view today, Jake, as bit of a bridge day to get to the main event, which is Sondland.\n\n\n\nKING: It is a smart strategy. The Republicans are trying to get that one or two moments that are played on FOX News, that are played on social media, Trump-friendly social media. Where you say, aha, you think it's a demand, because you're a colonel, but the president wouldn't.\n\n\n\nRepublicans want you to focus on that one moment. The other day, it was, well, Ambassador Yovanovitch, if they wanted to remove you so they could be corrupt in Ukraine, why replace you with Bill Taylor, a man of great integrity? They want you to look at the one moment as opposed to the weeks before, the weeks after, which is Sondland, and more on what Rudy Giuliani were up to.\n\n\n\nTOOBIN: Far be it for me to predict what viewers of FOX News will think. But can we talk about what a crazy position Stewart was taking there? This president of Ukraine has people dying from lack of military equipment. He has people dying every day because they don't have military equipment.\n\n\n\n[13:55:00]\n\n\n\nDonald Trump holds in his hand the potential to save the lives of Ukrainians. Do you think maybe he's going to agree to what Donald Trump says about anything to get that money?\n\n\n\nI mean, the idea that this is -- well, it would be nice if you investigated Joe Biden. It's not a request. It's a demand with Ukrainians lives on the line.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Hold that thought. We'll talk about that.\n\n\n\nWe'll take a quick break.\n\n\n\nUp next, the impeachment testimony resumes with two additional witnesses.\n\n\n\nPlus, the president just responded to today's hearing.\n\n\n\nStay with us.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[14:00:00]
Repealing and replacing Obamacare not only would change health coverage and costs for tens of millions of Americans, it would also give a juicy tax gift to the rich.\n\nRolling back Obamacare would provide a nearly $1 trillion tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and businesses.\n\nBut if Republican repeal efforts fail, House Speaker Paul Ryan signaled Tuesday that no one should expect lawmakers to include those tax cuts in tax reform.\n\nIf the health care bill doesn't pass, then that trillion dollars of Obamacare taxes ... we won't incorporate those in tax reform, Ryan said on CNBC's Power Lunch.We will have to put those off to the side and they will have to be gotten to when we get to health care reform.\n\nGiven how hard repealing Obamacare has been so far, there's little reason to assume it will get much easier. So for all intents and purposes those taxes will stand indefinitely. They include a high-income Medicare surtax on investment income and on wages over $200,000 ($250,000 if married).\n\nThe likely reason why tax writers have decided to leave Obamacare tax cuts off the agenda is cost, plain and simple. It would make their efforts to reform the tax code that much more expensive and therefore harder to pay for. And they will need to pay for it as a condition for passing it with a simple majority in the Senate.\n\nAdding $1 trillion to the cost of the tax bill would make it even harder to make it revenue neutral. As it is, it's a heavy lift, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nRelated: Who pays if Congress kills the state and local tax deduction\n\nTax reform will be a heavy lift for many reasons. For starters, there are still big disagreements within the Republican party itself as to how low tax rates should be and whether it's even necessary to pay for tax cuts.\n\nIf they're not paid for, not only would tax reform add substantially to deficits, but under Senate rules, they would expire at the end of the budget window instead of becoming permanent, which is what Ryan wants.\n\nThe White House has been in regular talks with leaders and top tax writers in the House and Senate to come up with a framework for a tax reform bill they can all agree on.\n\nDespite what many skeptics believe, Ryan on Tuesday said after a speech before the National Association of Manufacturers that he's confident there will be a tax reform bill on the floor this fall and passage by the end of the year.
Story highlights Authorities describe how they shut down a Texas sex slave and human trafficking operation Notorious alleged pimp Alfonso Poncho Diaz-Juarez remains on the run\n\nGot a tip about this case? Contact the FBI with any information here.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nEsperanza was waiting for her cousins outside her high school in Mexico one day, when a strange man drove up in a car, forced her inside with him and sped away. At that moment, Esperanza had in effect become a sex slave.\n\nHe beat and raped me, she told CNN's The Hunt with John Walsh.\n\nShe said the man – who called himself Poncho — brought her to a madam who showed Esperanza how to charge clients and how to use a condom.\n\nA few times Esperanza tried — and failed — to escape, but she said Poncho, now age 47, always tracked her down, and then beat her.\n\nEventually, Esperanza realized she was pregnant. Three months later, she said Poncho drove her across the Mexican-US border and on to Houston, Texas, where he forced her to work in a cantina called La Costenita.\n\nShe gave birth to a baby girl, but Poncho took the infant away as insurance that Esperanza would keep working as a sex slave and wouldn't escape.\n\nPHOTO: Photo Illustration/CNN Alfonso Diaz Juarez is accused of human trafficking in a Houston-area prostitution sting.\n\nI really wanted to speak up, to ask the police for help, Esperanza said. But I got caught up by the threats he would make towards my daughter. I didn't want anything to happen to her.\n\nEsperanza — whose real name is being withheld for her protection — had become just like the more than 19,000 sex trafficking cases reported in the US since 2007, according to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center.\n\nThe site says more than 2,600 sex trafficking cases have been reported in the US this year alone, most of them in California. Texas ranks as the nation's number-two sex trafficking state, on the website.\n\nA 'crime that happens in third world countries'\n\nFor the uninitiated, it's hard to imagine that thousands of young people — overwhelmingly women — have been kidnapped in Mexico or elsewhere and taken against their will to the United States, where they serve as sex slaves.\n\nI thought human trafficking was just this crime that happens in third world countries. Until I started to look into my city, said Rachel Alvarez, a human trafficking case worker for the Houston YMCA.\n\nRelated story: How to help sex trafficking victims\n\nTexas authorities first met Esperanza when they raided La Costenita in 2010.\n\nHer initial demeanor was just kind of stoic, remembered Steve Roskey, who took part in the raid when he was an agent with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. But then, all of a sudden, we noticed tears start running down her face. She started telling us her story: how she got here, what she was forced to do.\n\nWhen she told police that her pimp, a man named Alfonso Diaz-Juarez who also went by Poncho, was holding her daughter, authorities sprang into action.\n\nWe knocked on Poncho's family members' houses, we knocked on his friends' houses, Roskey said. It irritated the family and friends so much that (Diaz-Juarez) eventually dropped off the child to a cousin, and at about 3 o'clock in the morning, we got a phone call. The child was safe.\n\nBut Diaz-Juarez was nowhere to be found.\n\nAmerica's human trafficking 'hubs'\n\nPimps will often lure women from Mexico across the border to the US by promising them better lives, perhaps a better job, Alvarez said. These pimps may get help from people the women already know and trust, like a neighbor.\n\nOnce they're kidnapped, these women are no longer viewed as people in the eyes of their handlers. They've been reduced to a commodity that can be bought and sold repeatedly in an open market. In the United States, Houston has become one of those markets.\n\nPeople see Houston as a hub for human trafficking because of its proximity to the border, said FBI special agent Suzanne Bradley. It also has access to the I-10 highway corridor, which goes across the country, so if they're smuggling people in and trying to get them into human trafficking in other areas of the country, it's very easy to get them on that I-10 route and disperse them throughout the country.\n\nRelated story: Why Atlanta is a US hub for sex trafficking\n\n'One of the most violent pimps'\n\nAfter the kidnapped women are brought into the US, the beatings begin as a way to keep them from trying to escape. Their captors threaten to hurt family members. Pimps use fear to keep their sex slaves in bondage.\n\nPoncho was one of the most violent pimps I've come across in the 11 years I've worked human trafficking, said Edwin Chapuseaux, a former investigator with the Harris County Sheriff's Office. He did a lot of brutal things, bordering into torture, to make the girls do what he wanted.\n\nA former sex slave we'll call Laura said Poncho knew her mother's name, her address, everything. He would threaten me, tell me if I talked to anyone that he would hurt my family.\n\nA pimp would have a lot to lose if a girl walked out the door.\n\nIf a pimp has, let's say, four or five girls, and each one is making him, you know, $2,000, $3,000 a week, do the math, tax-free, said Chapuseaux. That works out to a maximum of $780,000 per year.\n\nLaura recalls one night when she counted 70 women working. The usual was 30 men. We each had to tend to 30 clients a night.\n\nTeen girls available for $500 an hour\n\nFor years federal and local authorities had been gathering evidence against a huge Houston-area sex trafficking network led by Raquel Medeles Hortencia-Arguello.\n\nThe woman everyone knew as Tencha owned a brothel called Las Palmas that offered minor-aged girls to customers who would pay up to $500 an hour, according to the FBI.\n\nCoincidentally, as a cautionary move, Tencha had distanced herself from Las Palmas by leasing it to Diaz-Juarez.\n\nWhen police found out, they arrested him on a previous warrant.\n\nDiaz-Juarez pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors that led to his release several months later. Poncho was back on the loose.\n\nFollowing the money\n\nAuthorities continued to gather evidence in the big sex trafficking case.\n\nWe realized early on that we had potential financial crimes, money laundering involved in the case, so we got the [Internal Revenue Service] involved in it, said Bradley. The IRS began following the money, reviewing bank statements, locating assets.\n\nWe did an estimate on how much she made from the room rental, entrance fee, and the condoms for the whole entire period she was operating Las Palmas and that estimated to be about $12.5 million, said IRS Special Agent Lucy Tan.\n\nWhen it was time for police to move in and raid Las Palmas, 13 people were arrested. Diaz-Juarez wasn't among them. But Tencha was.\n\nTwelve pleaded guilty.\n\nProsecutors charged Tencha with one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, one count of conspiracy to harbor aliens, three counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to money launder.\n\nTencha pleaded not guilty.\n\nAnger triggers testimony\n\nWhen Tencha began crying in front of the judge, saying she was innocent and she had no idea what was going on, it stirred something inside the freed women who once worked for her.\n\nThey began to get angry.\n\nOne by one they decided to take the stand and testify against their former captor.\n\nYou didn't have to speak Spanish to see how much pain they had over what had been done to them, and what they had had to do, remembered Bradley. You could just see it in their face, hear it in their voice.\n\nUltimately, the jury found Tencha guilty and the judge sentenced her to life in prison.\n\nDespite the legal victory against Tencha, authorities are disturbed by the fact that Diaz-Juarez remains free.\n\nIt's very important to get Poncho arrested and prosecuted, because he will not stop doing what he does until he is arrested and put behind bars, said Chapuseaux.\n\nLaura, who still fears Poncho, admits she'll feel safer when he is captured. There aren't any words to describe what a terrible person he is.

(Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\nStory highlights Real Madrid take on Liverpool on May 26 Champions League final takes place in Kiev Price of flights & accommodation an issue for fans\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe road to Kiev is set to be a weird but not so wonderful one for thousands of Liverpool and Real Madrid fans attending Saturday's Champions League final in Ukraine.\n\nAstronomical costs of flights, accommodation and tickets have forced some to conjure creative ways to get to Kiev this weekend and though it will be an adventure for many, they are far from happy.\n\nFor Gareth Roberts, editor of the Liverpool fanzine the Anfield Wrap, his will be a two-day journey driving through five countries – France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and Poland – in a coach to reach the Ukrainian capital in time for European football's showpiece event, which starts at 19:45 BST on May 26.\n\nComfort and personal hygiene, he jokes, must be sacrificed to witness the English Premier League side attempt to win a sixth European title.\n\nYet even this cheaper option will set the 41-year-old back £1,000 ($1,345).\n\nThe whole thing has been an absolute joke, the Liverpudlian tells CNN Sport.\n\nWe're leaving Liverpool at 2am Thursday, driving down to Kent, getting on the Eurostar, getting over to France, then it's through Belgium, Holland, Germany – stopping in Berlin – and through Poland into Ukraine.\n\nWe'll stop somewhere else in Ukraine, about 100 miles from Kiev, stay at a hostel, have four hours' sleep, get a shower, then get back and carry on. We think we'll arrive at 8am on the day of the match and the driver wants to be turning around again at 3am.\n\nREAD: Salah wins sixth individual award\n\nREAD: Salah – he's like the Sphinx and the Pyramids\n\nREAD: A day in the life of Mo Salah\n\nPHOTO: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images Liverpool and Real Madrid have been allocated 16,626 tickets each.\n\nAn issue for Britain's Parliament\n\nFans of both clubs have been critical of UEFA, European football's governing body, for allocating 16,626 tickets to each club for an event being held in the 63,000-capacity NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium, while airlines and hotels have also come under fire for raising the cost of flights and accommodation.\n\nThe issue has even been raised in Britain's Parliament, with Liverpool season-ticket holder and lawmaker Derek Twigg describing the situation as appalling.\n\nPHOTO: Joern Pollex/Bongarts/Bongarts/Getty Images The capacity of the stadium has been decreased from 70,000 to 63,000 for the final.\n\nAs of May 21 on Booking.com, a room for one adult at Hotel Verhovina on May 26 was £859 ($1,155), while staying a night in the same hotel on June 2 would set guests back just £16 ($21).\n\nOn the same website, a guesthouse apartment for one person for May 26 was £4,226 ($5,686). Rooms were unavailable at the time of searching in one of Kiev's plushest establishment, the InterContiental Kiev.\n\nSo expensive is the accommodation that generous Kiev residents have mobilized on social media to offer spare rooms and sofas to fans for free.\n\nMeanwhile, a flight to Kiev from London Gatwick on May 25, returning on Sunday May 27, was £1,214 ($1633) when searching SkyScanner on Monday.

Liverpool had to organize a ballot to allocate tickets to fans.\n\nIt all feels unfair that they (a) can't put it in a bigger venue and (b) in a city that's got better infrastructure to cope.\n\nThere's been rooms advertised on the internet for £10,000 ($13,473). Going in the van is the only way we can do it.\n\nYou only have to go online and type in Champions League tickets and you find them from anything from £500 ($672) to £4,000 ($5382).\n\nEven through UEFA, they were selling tickets for £394 ($530). That's ridiculous. That's not fair pricing. That's a tax on loyalty, a tax on passion for your football team.\n\nWho do you think will win the Champions League?

For example, at the final in 2014 in Lisbon with a stadium capacity of 61,000, the finalists received 17,000 tickets each, the spokesperson said.\n\nDefending champions Real Madrid were allocated 892 fewer tickets for Kiev than they did for last year's final in Cardiff.\n\nThe club says 24,268 season-ticket holders applied for the 12,802 Kiev tickets made available to fans by the club via a lottery but, according to the Independent, more than 2,000 Real fans have returned their tickets because of cost.\n\nFor the fans who planned ahead and had supreme belief in their team, however, they will travel to Kiev at a fraction of the cost of those who waited until the conclusion of the semifinals.\n\nNacho Vignote, a Real season-ticket holder for 18 years, booked his flight and accommodation in September. His confidence is perhaps understandable as this is Real's third final in four years.\n\nPHOTO: Matthias Hangst/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images In 2017 Real became the first team in Champions League history to win back-to-back titles.\n\nVignote's flight from Madrid cost 100 euros ($118) – the cheapest flight departing Madrid on May 25 and returning on May 27 was £466 ($627) on SkyScanner on Tuesday.\n\nHe and nine friends have not had to dig deep for accommodation either as they are renting an apartment for four nights for 1,000 euros ($1,181).\n\nI try to book some months in advance and if Real reach the final then perfect for me and if not it's a nice weekend in a city, he tells CNN Sport.\n\nThis year fewer Real fans have applied for tickets, about four times less. The club is still calling for people on the waiting list because a lot of people have rejected tickets.\n\nThe fans are angry with UEFA for the location they have chosen for the final. The cost is because of the location. If it had been anywhere in central Europe it'd be completely different.\n\nAnd all the tickets are just for VIPs and UEFA. This is a party for UEFA instead of a party where fans can go at an affordable price. The real fans have to either stay at home or spend a lot of money.
By now you may have noticed some extra cash in your paycheck because of the new federal tax law.\n\nBut make sure you're not getting too much of a pay bump — or too little.\n\nWhile the new law lowered most income tax rates, it made a lot of other tax changes too.\n\nTo help you figure out if you're getting the right amount of take-home pay, the Treasury Department and the IRS on Wednesday put out a revised withholding calculator and a revised version of its withholding worksheet.\n\nEither can help you determine whether you're still claiming the right number of withholding allowances on the Form W-4 that you filled out for your employer when you started your current job, got married or had kids.\n\nBut the number you chose at the time may not be the right one for 2018. That's because the new tax law changed the underlying structure on which withholding allowances are based, particularly by eliminating the personal exemption and changing the eligibility for a now-expanded child tax credit.\n\nWhile it would be a good idea for everyone to double check their allowances, it's especially recommended if you have a more complex tax situation. For instance, you have more than one job or an outside source of income, you normally take a lot of itemized deductions, or you and your spouse both work and have a few kids.\n\nFor the most comprehensive assessment, use the calculator.\n\nWithholding issues can be complicated, and the calculator is designed to help employees make changes based on their financial situation, said acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter. Taking a few minutes can help taxpayers ensure they don't have too little — or too much — withheld from their paycheck.\n\nRelated: Here's how much paychecks may go up under the new tax law\n\nThe goal, he said, is to avoid surprises when you file your taxes in 2019.\n\nMost tax filers will want to avoid being under-withheld — meaning the number of allowances you used to take is now too high given the tax law changes. In that case, if you don't reduce your withholding allowances for this year, you'll risk owing money to Uncle Sam when you file your 2018 taxes, or at least not getting as big of a refund as you're used to.\n\nThe IRS suggests people at risk of being under-withheld may include those who itemized their deductions in the past, have two or more jobs in their household, or who have dependents age 17 or over. (Note: most wage earners are over-withheld, meaning they take too few allowances and end up getting a refund come tax time.)\n\nRelated: Tax law, bonuses and raises: 5 things you need to know\n\nTo use the IRS calculator, you won't need to fill out your name or any other identifying information such as your Social Security number. And the IRS says it doesn't store the data you enter.\n\nBut you will need to indicate your marital status, the number of jobs you hold, your gross income and whether your children qualify you to take two child tax breaks, plus other details.\n\nFor help providing those other details, the IRS recommends you have on hand your most recent pay stub and a copy of your last filed federal tax return.\n\nIf you decide to change your withholding allowances for this year, you'll need to resubmit another W-4 form to your employer.\n\n-- CNN's Donna Borak contributed to this story
London (CNN Business) The Bank of England has slashed interest rates to a record low and launched other emergency measures as part of a dramatic and coordinated UK response to limit the economic fallout from the coronavirus.\n\nThe central bank said in a statement Wednesday that while the magnitude of the shock from the coronavirus remains highly uncertain, economic activity is likely to weaken materially in the United Kingdom over the coming months.\n\nA few hours later, UK finance minister Rishi Sunak pledged to do whatever it takes to protect the economy. He announced £30 billion ($39 billion) in tax breaks and additional spending, including targeted coronavirus relief measures worth an estimated £12 billion ($15.5 billion).\n\nThe rate cut follows the Federal Reserve's decision to slash US interest rates by half a percentage point in an extraordinary move last week. The European Central Bank, which meets Thursday in Frankfurt, is expected to push interest rates deeper into negative territory and announce other measures to fight economic damage from the virus.\n\nThe Bank of England said that slashing its main interest rate by half a percentage point to 0.25% would help to keep firms in business and people in jobs and help prevent a temporary disruption from causing longer-lasting economic harm.\n\nRead More

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nClifton Broumand has started noticing something is off at the trade shows.\n\nSince 1982, he's been selling medical-grade keyboards and mice produced at his facility in Landover, Maryland, and he's been through a few recessions. Each time, he gets the feeling one's coming when foot traffic seems to be down at the exhibitions he visits to attract new clients.\n\nThis year, he only got half the usual number of leads at an industry conference in Chicago. He knows what happens next.\n\nWhen you start seeing these things, it's like death by a thousand cuts, Broumand says. You see a cut here, a cut there, and all of a sudden it adds up.\n\nMost economic indicators aren't pointing to a downturn on the near horizon. But with seemingly constant chaos in Washington, recent turmoil in the markets and an expansion that's about to be the longest on record, businesses are getting nervous.\n\nIt's notably hard to predict recessions, which are only officially declared well after they've already begun. Eight months into the so-called Great Recession in 2008, many economists were still debating whether the economy was in fact in a recession.\n\nThe fact that the economy is strong right now is no shield against a recession. In fact, recessions typically start when the economy is at its peak and has nowhere to go but down.\n\nMost economists expect slower growth in 2019, but the big question is whether that will morph into a full-blown recession — or if the Federal Reserve can successfully guide the US economy into a soft landing, in which the economy slows but doesn't shift into reverse.\n\nEvery economist has their favorite advance warning system.\n\nBusiness confidence\n\nOne indicator that tends to run well in advance of recessions: The National Federation of Independent Business measure of members' own subjective well-being, known as the small business optimism index. It peaked in the third quarter of 2004, while the American economy was growing faster than it is now, and then started falling until it bottomed out in early 2009.\n\nMore recently, the index spiked after President Donald Trump was elected, reached its highest reading ever in August — and has been sagging since.\n\nSmall business confidence is important because it can determine if those businesses will hire new workers and invest to grow the business, or if they'll start to pull back. And small businesses account for roughly half of the nation's economic activity.\n\nCar sales\n\nBill Dunkelberg, chief economist of the NFIB, keeps an eye on intermediary businesses — anyone who takes orders directly from consumers, and could pick up on any hesitance in the sector responsible for 70% of gross domestic product.\n\nCar dealers are the ones who start to notice, Dunkelberg says. When the car dealer isn't selling, he sends the message up to GM, 'I don't need the cars.'\n\nMotor vehicle sales typically take a turn for the worse at least a few months before recessions officially begin. But recently announced layoffs at GM notwithstanding, car sales have been hovering near historically high levels since early 2015.\n\nWorkers in the auto industry and other supply-chain roles see the signs of a slowdown becoming a downturn even earlier.\n\nWorker hours\n\nA recession may get rolling with a few seemingly anomalous events like the recently-announced GM plant closures. There can also be warning signs in large-scale buyouts, such as those offered to 10,400 Verizon employees a few weeks ago or FedEx buyouts due to a slowdown in trade amid global trade disputes.\n\nBut the more common first step is not being asked to stay late and come in on Saturdays.\n\nWhen manufacturing weakens, the firms wouldn't lay workers off, they would cut back their overtime hours, says economist Ed Leamer, who directs the UCLA/Anderson Business Forecast Project. So far, manufacturing workweeks remain very long by historical standards, after reaching their longest point since World War II in the spring of 2018.\n\nSurprisingly, the low unemployment rate can help accelerate a slide.\n\nThe United States is at what economists consider full employment, with more job openings than workers seeking jobs. But employers unable to find the workers they want are more likely to turn to automation to do the work that they need done.\n\nRising wages, either because of market conditions or increases in minimum wage laws in many states, also makes increased use of automation more attractive. Another factor is the 2017 tax reform, which allows businesses a bigger tax cut on capital spending, such as robots and computer kiosks that can be used by customers, than on new hiring.\n\nThe trouble comes when the economy starts to slow, and it's the workers who are let go, not the machines.\n\nThat's why it can be just a matter of months for a labor market to go from very low unemployment to job losses and a recession, as happened in 2000 and 2001.\n\nThe housing market\n\nHousing has historically been a harbinger of recession — most dramatically in the financial collapse of 2008, which was caused by a real estate bubble fueled by too-easy credit. This time may be different.\n\nHome sales and residential investment have started to sag over the past couple of quarters. But there was no building boom, post-recession mortgage underwriting has been much more solid, and any drop-off in the housing market has been blamed on rising interest rates — as well as high home prices.\n\nStill, home building and real estate accounts for a significant portion of the US economy and a slowdown in housing, for whatever reason, amounts to a slowdown in economic activity, even if it's not the catastrophe of the last recession.\n\nGrowing deficits\n\nMichael Stritch, chief investment officer with BMO Wealth Management, says his clients are mostly concerned that ballooning government deficits may eventually force painful cuts in other areas and lead to political turmoil, even at a time of record corporate profits and low unemployment.\n\nWe don't think it's going to be an acute problem unless people lose faith in the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, Stritch says. It's likely to just eat away at potential GDP growth over time.\n\nThe rising federal deficits, about to crack $1 trillion for the first time, can result in higher interest rates, as the Treasury has to pay more to sell the bonds needed to fund the government. Rising corporate debt can have a similar impact on rates.\n\nAnd the higher bond rates, coupled with the Fed setting its rates higher, can raise the cost of doing business, and the cost of living for households. That in turn serve as a brake on economic growth — especially if deficits are only used to finance tax cuts, rather than priorities like infrastructure and education that would generate a return on the investment over time.\n\nOther pieces of the economy seem more likely to cause a slow drag than to suddenly crater and take the rest of the country with them. Tariffs, for example, have only started to increase prices in a few industries, which may eventually lead to lower orders.\n\nEven though most analysts don't see major imbalances — or bubbles — in the real economy that would internally bring on a recession, every recession is a little different.\n\nAnd this time, it's been long enough since the United States went through a serious downturn that a whole generation of business owners hasn't necessarily experienced one.\n\nFor Clifton Broumand, who's learned through hard experience how to prepare contingency plans as soon as it seems that business might disappear, the fading memories are cause for worry.\n\nA lot of people haven't lived through a recession before, Broumand says. And this is the dangerous part. It's been such a long time, people might not be able to recognize the signs.
First rebate checks sent to taxpayers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government mailed out nearly 8 million tax rebate checks Friday, the first wave of about 92 million checks that will be sent out in the next 10 weeks. The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri. Friday. Bush joined them via satellite from Genoa, Italy, where he is participating in the G8 Summit. Tax rebate schedule Date mailed Last 2 digits of Social Security # July 20 00-09 July 27 10-19 August 3 20-29 August 10 30-39 August 17 40-49 August 24 50-59 August 31 60-69 September 7 70-79 September 14 80-89 September 21 90-99 Source: Internal Revenue Service Bush said the tax rebates will give families a break and should also stimulate the economy. Beginning late last summer and early fall, our economy, especially the manufacturing sector, began slowing, he said. The combination of this tax relief and lower interest rates should help get it moving again. Not everyone will get a rebate check. Those who did not file a return last year, those who had no taxable income and those who can be claimed as dependents on someone else's tax return will not qualify. The amount of some taxpayers' checks may be smaller, too, if they owe any back taxes, child support payments or federal loan payments. The government will deduct those debts from rebate checks before sending them. So how will you spend your rebate check, if you're getting one? About 47 percent of those questioned for a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll said they would pay bills with the money, 32 percent will save it, 17 percent will spend it and 2 percent will donate their check to charity. If you're undecided about how to spend the money, several stores are ready to help you make that crucial decision. At Wal-Mart stores across the country, people can cash their checks on site or spend the amount in the store against the value of the check. Home Depot stores are offering customers credit, based on the expected amounts of their rebates, until their checks come in. Some analysts say that if people immediately spend their checks, it could stimulate the economy. This is not a one shot deal. This is a down payment on future tax cuts, and I think people would be more apt to spend more of it than they would if they were just handed a one-shot rebate check, said Gerald Cohen of Merrill-Lynch. Others disagree. The problem right now is we're likely to see mounting job losses, and that's likely to erode confidence and induce consumers to save and not to spend, said Anirvan Banerji of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. If you filed your 2000 income tax return late, your check will come after the end of September. And if you moved since you sent in that return, make sure you've filed an official change of address form with the U.S. Post Office. The government says the checks will not be counted as taxable income for the 2001 federal tax returns, but residents of some states may have to pay slightly higher state taxes because of the rebates. One of the states -- Iowa -- has already moved to trim the extra taxes. The others affected are Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Oregon. The situation came about because in those eight states taxpayers can deduct the amount they pay in federal taxes -- minus any refunds -- thereby reducing their taxable income. But some state officials, believing people will see only that the rebate will mean higher state taxes, fear a backlash from taxpayers who will think the rebate is being taxed. In Missouri the issue will be a subject of discussion at a special session of the legislature in September. Special sessions are being considered in Alabama and several of the other states, and a Montana official said something could be done in a future year to offset this year's slightly higher tax.

Lynne Sladky/Associated Press\n\nThe French Open organizers won't offer special treatment to Serena Williams should she make the trip to Roland Garros in Paris this summer.\n\nThis year again, tournament officials will establish the list and ranking of the women's seeds based on the WTA ranking, the French Tennis Federation said, per the Associated Press (via ESPN.com). Consequently, [the seeds] will reflect this week's world ranking.\n\nWilliams has competed in just two WTA events this year after returning to the court following the birth of her daughter. Because of that, as well as her absence for almost the entire 2017 campaign, she sits No. 453 in the WTA rankings.\n\nBoth Maria Sharapova and Simona Halep lobbied on Williams' behalf for her to earn a seed at the 2018 French Open.\n\nSharapova said returning from pregnancy requires an incredible effort that can tax a player physically and emotionally, while Halep said it's normal to give birth and good to protect the ranking when someone is giving birth.\n\nWilliams won the 2015 French Open and was the runner-up in 2016. Failing to be seeded this season will leave her hopes of a fourth French Open title in serious jeopardy.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nWilliams received a wild card entry for her return at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, in March. As a result, she played No. 29 Kiki Bertans in the second round and sister Venus, who was seeded eighth, in the third round. Serena lost to Venus in straight sets. In her next event, the Miami Open, a meeting with fourth-seeded Elina Svitolina awaited Williams if she had defeated Naomi Osaka in the first round.\n\nSomething similar could happen again at the French Open without the luxury of a seeding designation.

The good (or 'let's copy Norway')\n\nBritain leaves the EU, but retains its membership in the European Economic Area, a treaty from 1994 that gives three non-member countries access to EU markets.\n\nThat would give it the same status as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, but it would mean continuing to grant EU citizens the right to live and work in Britain, accepting EU regulations, and making payments to the EU budget -- all things many Brexit campaigners want to end.\n\nRelated: The truth about UK immigration\n\nEven under this scenario, finance officials estimate that the U.K. economy would be about 3.8% smaller after 15 years than it would have been with full membership in the EU.\n\nThat equates to lost GDP worth 1,100 pounds ($1,560) per person, and 20 billion pounds ($28.4 billion) in lost tax revenue.\n\n2. The bad (or 'Canada's pretty cool')\n\nThe second alternative would be to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement with the EU, putting the U.K. in a group of countries that includes Canada, Switzerland and Turkey.\n\nOfficials say the negotiations would be extremely complex, and a free trade agreement would provide less access to the EU single market than Option 1 -- particularly in services, which account for nearly 80% of the U.K. economy.\n\nThe damage under this scenario would be greater: The economy would be about 6% smaller by 2030 than it would have been, equivalent to lost GDP of 1,800 pounds ($2,556) per person. Lost tax revenue would amount to 36 billion pounds ($51 billion).\n\n3. The ugly (or 'Britain joins the BRICS')\n\nIf all else fails, the U.K. could rely on a relationship with the EU based on the rules of the World Trade Organization.\n\nCountries such as Brazil, or Russia (when it's not under sanctions), trade with the EU on this basis.\n\nThis is the only scenario that would free Britain completely from the obligations that come with access to the EU single market. But it would also come at the highest price because of the additional barriers to trade.\n\nOfficials estimate the U.K. economy would be about 7.5% smaller after 15 years than it would have been. That's 2,100 pounds ($2,982) per person in terms of annual GDP, and 45 billion ($64 billion) in lost tax revenue.\n\nBrexit campaigners described the government's report as deeply flawed.\n\nIt also ignores the Treasury's own analysis that EU regulation costs the UK economy much more -- a staggering £125 billion a year, said Vote Leave CEO Matthew Elliott.
You've probably heard by now that the new tax reform bill will hit your paycheck as soon as February. But the change may not accurately reflect your ultimate tax bill.\n\nAbout 90% of people will see more take-home pay, according to the U.S. Treasury. That may sound like great news, but here's the problem: There's a chance you'll end up with too much money in your paycheck -- meaning you'll either be stuck paying it back at tax time next year or get a smaller refund.\n\nThere's also a possibility that too much will be withheld, and your paychecks will be smaller than they should be.\n\nFiguring out how much to withhold from your pay is always a bit of a guessing game. It's an estimate based on how you filled out your Form W-4 and calculation tables created by the IRS.\n\nBut in a rush to implement the new law this year, the estimate could be off more than usual.\n\nThat's because the IRS has updated the calculation tables, but not the Form W-4.\n\nWe've done the best we can in the short term to come up with tables that accurately reflect the tax liability of individual taxpayers. Going forward, in order to be more precise, we're going to need a new system, said a senior IRS official on a call with reporters last week.\n\nA new Form W-4 won't be ready for the 2018 tax year. The new calculations were made to work with the existing form, but the form factors in some deductions and credits that no longer exist or have been changed under the new law.\n\nFor most people, the amount withheld throughout the year is usually more than your actual tax bill -- which means you get a refund after your file your tax return. If not enough is withheld, you end up owing money to Uncle Sam. Generally, you want to get as close as possible to breaking even.\n\nThe new tables may result in under-withholding for some employees.\n\nThose who claim a large number of allowances based on their number of dependents, or on itemized deductions that no longer exist, or are limited by the new law, have the most reason to re-examine their withholding status, said Mike O'Toole, the Senior Director of Publications, Education, and Government Relations at American Payroll Association. The group's members represent 17,000 employers.\n\nBut the changes could also result in over-withholding.\n\nThe good news is the withholdings are within your control. You can always update your Form W-4 to change the amount that's withheld from your paycheck.\n\nHere's what you can expect.\n\nWhen will I see a change in my paycheck?\n\nThe IRS has encouraged employers to start using the new withholding tables by February 15, but it may take your employer longer to make the change.\n\nI can't say that this particular change is appreciably more difficult than in other years. But what will be different is the time pressure and the pressure from employees, who are going to be more sensitive to this, said Jonathan Zimmerman, a partner at Morgan Lewis, who helps employers with benefit plans and payroll matters.\n\nDon't expect your employer to advise you on whether you should change your allowances on the W-4, though. Employers should explain the uniqueness of the situation to workers, communicate when the new rates will be implemented, and then suggest consulting with a tax adviser, according to Mike Boro, a partner at the accounting firm PwC.\n\nHow can I make sure my pay is accurate?\n\nWait for your first paycheck that accounts for the new withholding tables before making any changes, said Barbara O'Neill, a CFP and a financial management specialist at the Rutgers Cooperative Extension.\n\nThen, you can estimate what you think it should be and adjust accordingly.\n\nIRS officials said the agency will be publishing a new online calculator by the end of February that can help you decide how to adjust your allowances based on information you provide regarding your income level and number of children under the age of 17.\n\nBut you can also try to estimate your 2018 tax liability yourself. Then divide that amount by however many paychecks you'll receive this year.\n\nIf the math is close, hang tight, O'Neill said.\n\nIf the math is way off, that's when you'll want to make a change to your Form W-4. You can make a change to the number of allowances you've selected, or you can simply change your allowances to zero and write in how much you want withheld exactly, O'Neill said.\n\nThe changes don't need to be made immediately. O'Neill always recommends taking a look mid-year. By then you'll know if you are receiving a raise or if you'll have additional income coming in during the year.\n\nWhat happens if my withholding is still off?\n\nIf too much is withheld, you'll simply get a bigger refund check after filing your 2018 taxes.\n\nThis amounts to an interest-free loan to the government until then, and could tighten your cash flow, said CFP Jim Guarino.\n\nIf too little is withheld, you could owe money after filing and possibly face a tax penalty if the balance is $1,000 or more, Guarino said. Generally, you can avoid paying the penalty in this case if you paid at least 90% of what you owe or at least as much as you owed during the previous tax year.
That free-wheeling attitude made theco-founder renowned inside and outside of his home country. But it also appears to be putting his business empire — and Ma himself — at enormous risk.\n\nThe trouble started in late October after Ma criticized China's regulators at a conference in Shanghai. As Ma's financial tech firm Ant Group was preparing for the world's largest initial public offering , he accused authorities of stifling innovation and blasted the country's banks for having a pawn shop mentality.\n\nMa, meanwhile, hasn't been seen in public since he gave his speech in Shanghai — a notable absence for a man who typically has no issue with the spotlight, and whose businesses now face their biggest threat in years.\n\nI think there's one overall message that the party is really sending, and that is that tech entrepreneurs may be the most glamorous, the most publicly favorable face that China is showing to the world, said Rana Mitter, professor of history and politics of modern China at Oxford University. But there is no one individual, no one company bigger than the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nMany observers of China say Ma is most likely lying low as authorities turn up the heat on his businesses, having gotten the hint about speaking out of turn.\n\nBut it's also not unlike Beijing to dole out severe punishment for prominent Chinese figures who clash with the interests of the Communist Party.\n\nSuperstar actress Fan Bingbing, for example, abruptly dropped out of sight in 2018 before reappearing a year later to apologize for a tax evasion scandal. And real-estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang disappeared for several months last year after he allegedly criticized President Xi Jinping's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He was eventually jailed for 18 years on corruption charges.\n\nA larger-than-life figure\n\nA former English teacher with humble beginnings, Ma has long personified China's economic prosperity and entrepreneurial grit. He built Alibaba into a $500 billion tech empire and amassed a personal fortune of some $50 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index\n\nAs his companies, grew, Ma became the friendly face of China's economic rise. He frequently met with heads of state — Ma has lunched with former President Barack Obama and taken selfies with former UK Prime Minister David Cameron — and last year even donated Covid-19 supplies around the world.\n\nMa's style as an executive at Alibaba was unabashedly flamboyant , too: Once, he sang the 1950s classic  Unchained Melody  on stage at a company conference, often dressed up in costumes and appeared at events with celebrities like David Beckham and Nicole Kidman.\n\nJack Ma performs at Alibaba's 20th-anniversary celebration in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China in 2019.\n\nOn one level, Chinese authorities liked that Ma represented a high-powered and glamorous version of China because one of the things the Chinese Communist Party has found it almost impossible to do is to create soft power in the world, said Mitter, the Oxford professor.\n\nTencent TCEHY Baidu BIDU The government has encouraged the growth of its home-grown tech giants, including Alibaba, Ant Group,and, while shutting out their big American rivals. They're all largely indispensable in China for social interaction, entertainment, commerce and more.\n\nBut authorities in China increasingly view that outsized influence as a risk to the country's political and economic stability . Ant Group, for example, is able to collect lending fees free of the tough regulations imposed on commercial banks.\n\nThe squelching of the big name tech entrepreneurs is part of that wider process by the party to take back control, and really rewrite the narrative of how China's tech innovation takes place only under the circumstances the party will allow, Mitter said.\n\nIn recent months, the government's steps to rein in the industry have gotten more blatant. The Communist Party published an unusually frank set of guidelines in September, for example, that called on its members to educate private businesspeople to weaponize their minds with [Xi's] socialism ideology.\n\nIn the weeks since then, that tightening of the screws has come to pass. In addition to the regulatory demands for Ant Group and investigation into Alibaba, authorities have warned other tech representatives against creating monopolies and abusing consumer data for profit\n\nThe last of his kind\n\nMa, a Communist Party member, remains out of sight. His social media pages have been dormant since October, and he even missed the finale of an African entrepreneurial talent show that he created. (Alibaba said he missed the event because of a  scheduling conflict .)\n\nWhile Beijing hasn't been shy about fining or even jailing executives critical of the government — Ren, the real estate tycoon who was imprisoned last year, allegedly penned an essay that obliquely referred to Xi as a power-hungry clown — tech industry and government observers say Ma may be voluntarily staying out of the spotlight, at least for now.\n\nThe Chinese government wants its narrative about the Ant Group IPO to dominate the public conversation, said Duncan Clark, author of Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built and founder of investment advisory firm BDA China. He added that the company likely knows that it won't help to have any diversity of opinion on the issue.\n\nBut certainly it's remarkable ... the silence is somewhat deafening, Clark said, adding that he expects Ma to eventually come out publicly with a scripted statement about contributing to reform in China.\n\nHe got the signal that 'I spoke too much, that caused me trouble so I need to shut myself up', said Angela Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong who has studied Chinese antitrust enforcement.\n\nLoss of 'soft power'\n\nOne thing, at least, seems clear: As the Chinese Communist Party piles pressure on the country's tech titans, it seems unlikely the industry will see another figure like Ma. Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang, who succeeded Ma as chairman in 2019, struck a conciliatory tone on regulation in November by describing the government's efforts to tighten restrictions on internet companies as  timely and necessary .\n\nThe loss of that kind of voice, though, will have consequences for Beijing, Mitter said. Many countries, particularly in the West, already view China and its businesses as existential threats worthy of heavy sanctions and scrutiny — tensions that stem from fears that Chinese corporations all operate at the behest of the Communist Party. Stifling criticism from those tech leaders at home could make exerting influence abroad even harder.\n\nThe ability of a figure like Jack Ma to speak out will be harder, and I think this will actually create a further problem for China's desire to generate soft power, Mitter said. Nobody really takes seriously figures from any country who go around the world simply spouting the government line.
Dean camp condemns bin Laden ad\n\nCommercial attacks candidate's national security credentials\n\n(CNN) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Howard Dean's campaign called on rivals Wednesday to disavow a television ad that uses an image of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to attack the former Vermont governor's national security credentials.\n\nA group calling itself Americans for Jobs, Healthcare and Progressive Values aired the ad in the early Democratic battlegrounds of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nHoward Dean just cannot compete with George Bush on foreign policy, an announcer intones over a magazine cover featuring bin Laden's visage. It's time for Democrats to think about that, and think about it now.\n\nDean's campaign manager, Joe Trippi, called the ad the kind of fearmongering attack we've come to expect from Republicans, one that panders to the worst in voters.\n\nHe called on Dean's rivals to condemn the ad and demand it be pulled off the air.\n\nThis type of ad represents everything that is wrong with our political process today -- polluting our airwaves with smears on other candidates that have nothing to do with legitimate policy differences, Trippi wrote in a letter to his counterparts in other campaigns.\n\nAds like this are the reason that less than half of the voting population in America bothers to go to the polls.\n\nThe group was founded in November as a nonprofit committee known as a 527 -- named for the section of the tax code that limits its requirement to disclose the source of its funding.\n\nIts leadership includes two people with ties to Dean's Democratic rivals -- David Jones, a former aide to Rep. Dick Gephardt, and Robert Gibbs, a former spokesman for Sen. John Kerry's campaign.\n\nJones issued a statement Wednesday saying the ad was meant to raise the issue of Dean's national security and foreign policy experience.\n\nThat is the ad's intention and that is what it does, he said.\n\nIn a Tuesday conference call with reporters, Gephardt denied any knowledge of the ad and called on the group to disclose its donors.\n\nI wish they weren't running the ads, he said. I'm sorry they're doing this, but there's nothing I can do about it. But I would call on them and any other 527s to reveal their donors in a timely manner.\n\nBut a spokesman for Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who has hammered Dean's opposition to the war since the weekend capture of fugitive Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, echoed its criticism while denouncing its tone.\n\nWe agree with Joe Trippi that this ad is produced and presented in a way that is over the top, said Brian Hardwick, Lieberman's deputy campaign director.\n\nBut we also agree that it's exactly the kind of ad that Republicans would run. And that's precisely the problem. Simply put: The Democratic nominee will not win in 2004 if he appears weak on defense.\n\nIn August on Larry King Live, Dean deflected criticism of his opposition to the war. I think it's great that Saddam Hussein is not in power, but I would have approached it in a very different way, he said.\n\nAfghanistan, he said, deserves more attention, because the alliance between al Qaeda and the Taliban was an issue for the national security of the United States.\n\nPresidential hopeful Howard Dean. The ad attacks his anti-war stance.\n\nThis past weekend, Dean called the capture of Saddam, a great day of pride in the American military and a great day for the Iraqis and a great day for the American people.\n\nThe 527 committee's funding has come in part from labor unions, but a spokesman for one of those unions disavowed the spot Wednesday.\n\nIf it was up to me, I'd ask for a refund, said Rick Sloan, communications director for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which donated $50,000 to the group.\n\nThe union has endorsed Gephardt, the Missouri congressman and former House minority leader. But Sloan said the union did not discuss the commercial with Gephardt, and said it could backfire big time.\n\nI think this has done more damage to Gephardt than any of his opponents ever could have done. The day after the primary or caucus, the Democrats have to go back to living with each other and working with each other, Sloan said.\n\nThis kind of attack ad just drives them crazy, and rightfully so. It makes the job of pulling back together all that much harder. I don't know what they were using for brains -- lug nuts?
Bitcoin and four other cryptocurrencies surgerd on Thursday, with the approach of tax day in the United States.\n\nBitcoin jumped 10% in just one hour, adding nearly $1,000 and surging above $7,000 for the first time since Sunday.\n\nOther popular cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash, made double-digit gains as well, ending a month-long sell-off.\n\nCryptocurrency experts say there are several factors driving the rally, but the most significant is April 17, the deadline to file taxes in the United States.\n\nRyan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core, which provides software used by Dash traders, said that investors are jumping back into the cryptocurrency market at the end of a tax-related sell-off. He said they've been unloading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent weeks to pay their looming tax bills. But with tax day, April 17, rapidly approaching, most of these investors have paid their tax bills, he said, and some investors have received tax returns that they're spending on cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe selling pressure associated with tax day has subsided right now, said Taylor. As people get their tax returns, there may be new money entering the market.\n\nRelated: What is bitcoin?\n\nIt appears that investors are warming back up to bitcoin after a dramatic slump that's been dragging down prices since they peaked at $19,086 on Dec. 17, 2017.\n\nNolan Bauerle, director of research for CoinDesk, a company that tracks cryptocurrency activity, said that short selling has dried up dramatically just since Wednesday, when 44,000 short positions were open for bitcoin. He said that number dropped to 26,000 short positions on Thursday.\n\nThere was definitely a short squeeze, said Bauerle. We do know that this huge volume of short positions closed up simultaneously to that spike in price.\n\nGarrick Hileman, co-founder of the cryptocurrency research firm Mosaic, said that in addition to the end of tax season related selling and the short squeeze, the surge in digital currency might also be driven by heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\nHe said that President Trump's rhetoric about bombing Syria might be contributing to the cryptocurrency rally.\n\nCoinDesk's Bauerle said the threat of war and other threats of instability, like the Brexit vote in 2016, have driven the price of cryptocurreny in the past.\n\nWe have noticed the trend of bitcoin acting as a crisis currency, he said.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)\n\nThe UK government is attempting to justify flagship legislation that critics say would hand the police and ministers powers that could seriously curb the ability of citizens to protest at a very difficult time. The legislation is being debated in Parliament just days after officers from London's Metropolitan Police forcefully broke up a peaceful demonstration mourning the death of a young woman, Sarah Everard.\n\nEditor's Note: Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nOn Tuesday evening, members of Parliament voted in favor of preventing the UK exiting the European Union without a deal. On Wednesday, MPs voted to give the Prime Minister just three days to come up with an alternative plan if, as expected, her own carefully negotiated deal, is rejected by the Commons next week.\n\nAfter a series of bruising defeats last month, it seems the Prime Minister is starting the New Year continuing to be thwarted by a parliament trying to exert its sovereignty.\n\nAnd yet, as MPs prepare to begin a five-day debate ahead of that vote on the May deal next week, we are no closer to discovering what MPs actually want.\n\nWe know, after Tuesday's vote, that there is a majority in favor of blocking a no deal. But there is little evidence of a majority in support of anything else – not May's Brexit plan, nor an alternative Norway-style model for a future relationship with the EU, nor for a second referendum to allow the country to reject Brexit altogether.\n\nCrucially, the attempt to block a no deal is, on closer scrutiny, flawed – because without an alternative, no deal is the default, no matter what Parliament says. If May's plan is voted down next week and no other plan is put forward, Britain is leaving the EU without a deal, on the starkest of terms. The May plan is more than just a plan – it is a legal withdrawal agreement with the EU.\n\nIt is right that, after months of the government trying to force an unpopular version of Brexit on the Commons, MPs try to scrutinize the process of Britain's departure as much as they can. Originally, May had tried to force Parliament into accepting her plan without a meaningful vote before that plan was even finalized with Brussels in November.\n\n02:12 - Source: CNN As Brexit deadline looms, protests turn nasty\n\nWhen the vote was slated for December, she postponed it, to the anger of MPs from all parties who suspected she was trying to run down the clock and make her deal a fait accompli by not allowing enough parliamentary time for a debate on any alternative. Brexit is happening on March 29, in 79 days – but in parliamentary terms, the timeframe is much tighter because of weekends and breaks, and there are only around 40 days left for debate.\n\nYet despite this obstructive approach from May and her government, the House of Commons has been confused over what the alternative should be. MPs need to have a better, more constructive plan than simply opposing a no deal.\n\nBut the truth is there is no consensus around an alternative, an incontrovertible fact in keeping with the divisive nature of Brexit. What's more, while the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU needs to be ratified by the UK parliament – as well as all the other EU nations – it is not in Parliament's gift to amend that deal.\n\nAny changes they demand over the next few days and weeks need to be approved by Brussels. And, given the withdrawal agreement came after months of hardball negotiation with the EU, it is unlikely Brussels will give any substantial ground. Above all, Brussels will not move on one of the key demands of Brexiteers, that the Northern Ireland backstop be removed from the agreement.\n\nEven the technical procedure which MPs used to try to block a no deal, by amending the Finance Bill – a keystone of government legislation – could have dramatic real-world implications, because it means if a no deal does actually take place, the government's tax-raising powers will be restricted.\n\nIt is healthier for democracy that that meaningful vote will take place next week. But, if as is likely, the Prime Minister loses that vote and her plan dies, there needs to be a hardheaded and urgent alternative strategy ready to go, and the Commons needs to find a consensus.\n\nIf MPs get their way, they could force May to return to Parliament within three days of that vote with an alternative. But even then, this alternative must be approved by the EU. In this current Brexit stalemate, the UK Parliament may think it is sovereign, but ultimately it is the EU which retains the whip hand.
IRAs are a powerful tool for retirement savers to get lucrative tax breaks to help them reach their long-term financial goals.\n\nWhen it comes to safety and security, IRAs are as safe as you make them, and although some regulatory protections safeguard your retirement accounts, it's up to you to invest your IRA assets prudently. By using a smart strategy for your investing, you can ensure that your IRA will be as safe as possible while still achieving its underlying purpose.\n\nHow regulators protect your IRA\n\nIRAs get the same regulatory protection that applies to the investment vehicle you use to open your retirement account. For instance, if you invest your IRA in a bank certificate of deposit or savings account, then you'll receive interest in the same way a regular banking customer would, and your IRA will have the full protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's $250,000 deposit insurance.\n\nFor those who use brokerage accounts to invest, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation offers protection of up to $500,000 for securities and cash, including a $250,000 cash limit. IRAs get the same protection as other brokerage accounts. But it's important to understand that while FDIC insurance actually protects your principal from risk of loss, SIPC insurance only protects you against problems with the brokerage company you use. When a broker gets into financial trouble and has to liquidate, SIPC makes sure the assets in each investor's account are present and accounted for. If cash or securities are missing, then the SIPC makes investors whole, up to the dollar limit protected.\n\nWhat the SIPC doesn't do is to prevent you from suffering market losses. If you buy a stock and its value goes to zero, don't look to the SIPC to bail you out, because it won't.\n\nManaging risk with your IRA investing\n\nTo keep your IRA safe, you'll have to take a smart approach to your investing decisions. There are several things you can do to try to balance the returns that your IRA investment portfolio can produce against the risks that you face anytime you invest.\n\nFirst, diversifying your portfolio across several different types of investments can help you avoid catastrophic losses if one of your holdings suffers a setback. Diversification can take many different forms, such as holding many different broad asset classes including stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments. It can also mean selecting several different options within a particular asset class, such as buying stocks in various sectors to offer more broad-based exposure.\n\nSecond, be aware of your time horizon. If you're already in retirement, then you'll generally want to be somewhat more conservative in your investing philosophy, because you're in a less favorable position to endure market downturns that could hurt the value of your portfolio.\n\nBy contrast, if you have decades to go before you need to tap your retirement assets, then investing your IRA in more aggressive investments can produce the best returns over the long run.\n\nFinally, make sure you acknowledge some of the risks that many investors neglect. Being conservative with your retirement account can minimize the risk of market losses, but being too conservative comes with the attendant risk that inflation will erode the purchasing power of your retirement nest egg and keep you from being financially secure when you retire.\n\nSimilarly, selecting investments that come with higher management fees creates the risk that even if your return on investment is good, the net value of your nest egg at retirement could still be insufficient due to the thousands of dollars in inflated fees that your financial institution took out of your IRA over the course of your career.\n\nSponsored Content from The Motley Fool:\n\n• 5 Years From Now, You'll Probably Wish You Grabbed These Stocks\n\n• Kansas Man Turns $10,000 into $8 Million\n\n• Shark Tank Just Revealed a Trillion-Dollar Idea\n\nIRAs are extremely valuable for retirement investors, and you can do your part to make them as safe as possible. Although you can't eliminate IRA risk, you can manage it effectively and still reach the financial goals you set for yourself.
As if filing taxes weren't stressful enough, one aspect of the process that really shakes workers to their core is the prospect of getting audited.\n\nStatistically speaking, your chances of getting audited are pretty low, as less than 1% of all returns land on the IRS's list each year.\n\nThat said, in preparing your tax return, you could end up making certain moves that increase your audit risk without realizing it. Here are a few that could subject you to further IRS scrutiny.\n\n1. Rushing through your taxes\n\nSome people wind up filing their taxes at the very last minute because they're forced to wait on key information or are at the mercy of their CPA friend who's supposed to be helping out. But in many cases, folks who end up sweating it out right around the deadline are those who simply procrastinate.\n\nEither way, you should know that rushing through the process is a good way to inadvertently increase your audit risk, since, in doing so, you're more likely to omit key information or enter the wrong data.\n\nA better bet? Pledge to start tackling your tax return a minimum of one month prior to the deadline, which falls on April 17 this year. That's right — you get a couple of extra days, which means you have even less of an excuse to run out of time.\n\n2. Filing on paper\n\nIf you're the old school type, you may decide to file your taxes on paper this year rather than do so electronically. Bad move. Filing on paper means you're far more likely to make a mistake, and if that happens, your return could land on that audit list faster than you can say whoops.\n\nConsider this: The IRS reports that the error rate for paper returns is 21%, which means that one in five tax filers who go this route manages to muck something up. The error rate for electronic returns, on the other hand, is less than 1%. Remember, we're all human, and therefore subject to the occasional blunder. But if that slip-up results in an IRS audit, you'll be kicking yourself for not doing everything possible to lower your risk.\n\n3. Guessing at numbers -- even if you're close\n\nIf there's one thing the IRS is big on, it's accuracy. So as you sit down to file your taxes, make sure you're dealing with hard numbers. Guessing at data or deductions is a great way to raise your audit risk, and it doesn't matter if you're reasonably close — the IRS wants those numbers exact. This means that if you did freelance work last year but are missing that 1099 form that summarizes your income, don't just throw out a number you think is correct. Get on the phone with that client, insist on a copy of that tax form, and get that figure just right.\n\nSimilarly, if you lost a 1099, contact the issuer and find out what exact number that document contained. Remember, every time you get a 1099, the IRS receives a copy as well, and if your return doesn't match its records precisely, you'll automatically boost your audit risk.\n\n4. Being careless with deductions\n\nThe IRS offers a host of deductions that, if you're itemizing, could lower your tax burden significantly. But proceed with caution when claiming deductions, because if you don't, the IRS might choose to take a closer look at your return.\n\nFor one thing, avoid round numbers unless your deductions happen to work out that way. If you racked up, say, $6,966 in medical expenses, don't claim $7,000 for convenience purposes. Not only is that technically a lie, but having too clean a number, so to speak, will likely raise an eyebrow.\n\nFurthermore, try to avoid claiming disproportionately high deductions relative to your income. While it's one thing to list $5,000 in charitable contributions with a $60,000 income, if you claim a $15,000 deduction, it's apt to look suspicious. Of course, if you're looking at an exceptionally high deduction that's perfectly legitimate, by all means, claim it — just be sure to have meticulous documentation to back it up, because chances are, the IRS will ask for it.\n\nRelated links:\n\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nWhile plenty of taxpayers get audited for reasons other than these, avoiding these mistakes could help you stay off that dreaded list.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe blue wave, powered in large part by voters who said they did so in opposition to the President, means the House is full of new Democratic members with a firm mandate to attack Trump frequently.\n\nPHOTO: CNN Errol Louis\n\nAlready, incoming freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan told supporters that Trump's days are numbered because We're going to impeach the m*****f****r. And when her comments sparked a furor, she declined to apologize and her office released a statement that read, The Congresswoman absolutely believes he needs to be impeached. She ran and won by making this very clear to the voters in her district, the statement said.\n\nTrump has already responded to the jibe, calling it disgraceful before turning to Twitter to attack Democrats. He wrote, They only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020, too much success!\n\nWhether impeachment proceedings will actually take place is a question perhaps best left to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nPelosi has so far downplayed talks of impeachment, although the option certainly remains on the table. We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report. We shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn't avoid impeachment for a political reason, she told NBC.\n\nResponding to Tlaib's comments, Nadler said on CNN, I don't really like that language. But more to the point, I disagree with what she said. It is too early to talk about that intelligently. We have to follow the facts, we have to get the facts. That's why it is important to protect the Mueller investigation, that's why it's important to do our own inquiry. We have to get the facts. We will see where the facts lead. Maybe that will lead to impeachment. Maybe it won't. It is much too early.\n\nBut even if impeachment is currently on hold, a criminal indictment could theoretically lead to severe financial penalties or even imprisonment – something no president has ever faced.\n\nOn the hot-button question of whether a president can be indicted while in office – a matter on which constitutional scholars disagree – Pelosi said on NBC that she doesn't consider Trump immune from criminal prosecution.\n\nWhen reminded that internal Justice Department memos advise against the idea of prosecuting a sitting president, Pelosi said I do not think that that is conclusive. She later added, I think that that is an open discussion. I think that is an open discussion in terms of the law.\n\nNadler went a step further when he told CNN's Jake Tapper in early December, I disagree with the Office of Special Counsel and the Department of Justice. There is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits the President from being indicted. Nobody, not the President, not anybody else, can be above the law. There's no reason to think that the President should not be indicted.\n\nWhether an indictment would guarantee impeachment, however, is another story. Nadler said, There are several things you have to look at. One, were there impeachable offenses committed, how many, etcetera. And secondly, how important were they? Do they rise to the gravity where you should undertake an impeachment?\n\nRegardless of whether the House initiates impeachment proceedings, Pelosi now has a great deal of power to make Trump's life miserable – both legally and politically – as the leader of a Democratic-led House with the power to hold hearings, subpoena witnesses and dig into Trump's tax records. And she knows it.\n\nBefore her colleagues even voted to make her the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi let President Trump know that his days of dominating the national political agenda with bluff, bluster and bullsh** have come to an end.\n\nWhen asked whether she thought Trump deals with her differently because she's a woman, she said, I have no idea. We'll see how he will deal with the speaker of the House. … I hope he recognizes that a new day has dawned in America.\n\nIt's unclear whether Trump has grasped the full meaning of the new environment in Washington. For the past two years, as special prosecutor Robert Mueller has racked up indictments, convictions and guilty pleas from Trump associates, the President has defended himself with a key assist from Republican members of Congress.\n\nSeveral of the more outspoken members – whom Trump calls his warriors – have acted as political bodyguards by publicly attacking Mueller, calling for criminal prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey and appearing on right-wing media outlets to argue Trump's case.\n\nWhat a difference an election makes.\n\nFor the moment, talk of these grave legal matters is still hypothetical. We still haven't seen Mueller's findings and it will take a considerable amount of time for Pelosi, Nadler and other Democratic leaders to hire staff, hold hearings and begin playing catch-up on investigations that began years ago.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAnd a decision about whether to indict Trump is one that's up to the Department of Justice, which has a long-standing view that presidents are immune to criminal prosecution during their terms in office.\n\nBut the talk from Pelosi and Nadler about being open to the idea of indictment is a warning to the White House: The days of Congress defending the Trump administration at every turn have ended. And new political and legal problems for the President could just be beginning.

Aired 11a-12p ET\n\nAired December 15, 2018 - 11:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[11:00:44] ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning. I'm Alex Marquardt, in for Fredricka Whitfield this Saturday. Thanks for joining us.\n\n\n\nWe are following a number of breaking stories this morning.\n\n\n\nFirst, the Trump administration losing yet another cabinet member. Just moments ago, the President announced on Twitter that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has resigned and will leave the administration at the end of the year. Zinke departs amid growing scrutiny over a number of ethics investigations during his time heading up the Interior Department. We will have much more on Zinke's resignation in a few moments.\n\n\n\nBut right now we move on to our other breaking story of the morning -- the future of health care for millions of Americans is once again up in the air.\n\n\n\nA federal judge in Texas striking down Obamacare, a controversial ruling that is setting the scene for a major legal battle ahead. This could once again leave the fate of President Obama's landmark health care law in the hands of the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nNow the Texas judge's decision centers round the individual coverage mandate which requires all Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty. Congress effectively eliminated that penalty as part of the 2017 tax cut bill. Now the judge is saying that mandate is unconstitutional. So the entire law, he says, is invalid.\n\n\n\nMany states in reaction are vowing to fight back and appeal that calling the ruling an assault while President Trump who campaigned vociferously against Obamacare is taking a victory lap on Twitter touting that new ruling.\n\n\n\nSo for more, we are joined by our Supreme Court reporter, Ariane de Vogue.\n\n\n\nAriane -- break this down for us. Obamacare, signing up for that ends at midnight. Millions have signed up for Obamacare for 2019. But this really will not affect -- will not immediately affect them? ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORT: Right, it won't. But this\n\n\n\nis a really broad ruling. This judge said not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional. He said the entire law must go.\n\n\n\nNow it's just one judge right, Reed O'Connor --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: It can be appealed on this. But boy, it sends into doubt the future of a lot of people thinking about health care. He said it can remain in effect pending appeal.\n\n\n\nBut let me walk you through just a bit the history of it --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Yes.\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: -- so we understand how we got to today. Remember back in 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Remember it was Chief Justice John Roberts, he said it was ok under the taxing power.\n\n\n\nFlash forward to 2017, Congress acts to get rid of the tax penalty. So this judge last night says, look, you got rid of the tax penalty. That's the legal underpinning of this Supreme Court opinion. So now, not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional, but everything else must fall. That is a huge win for critics of Obamacare.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And as you and I were discussing right before the show this goes well beyond what the Trump administration had even wanted.\n\n\n\nSo game this out for us. It will go through an appeals process but it could make its way to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court has now shifted dramatically since the last ruling. So how does this all play out?\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: Well, first of all, remember, the Trump administration they've declined to defend this law. So California and a group of other states, they stepped in and last night they said we are going to the Fifth Circuit. That's a very conservative federal appeals court in Texas.\n\n\n\nSo the Fifth Circuit will look at it. And if it upholds exactly what O'Connor did then this thing will shoot right to the Supreme Court because that's so broad. The Fifth Circuit could scale back a little bit and so maybe it wouldn't go to the court. But the court likes to hear things when they are big. national laws like this.\n\n\n\nWe do have this new, solidified, conservative majority but we also might have a concern about what is called severability, really kind of jibes by knocking down one provision, take the whole thing. That might be at issue at the court, too. So they will have to look at it if it gets to them.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: A lot of moving parts. But the important part to remember is nothing changes immediately --\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: Right.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: -- but it is once again in jeopardy.\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: Yes.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So a lot of drama ahead probably.\n\n\n\nAriane de Vogue -- thanks so much for joining us and explaining that.\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: Thank you.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Well, the Affordable Care Act was, as we mentioned, one President Obama's biggest achievement while in office. This latest ruling threatens to wipe away the protection for people with pre-existing conditions, as you just heard from Ariane\n\n\n\n[11:04:59] That is a major staple of the law which was widely featured in the 2018 midterm campaign on both sides among Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\n\nSo joining me now is one of the architects of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber. Jonathan -- thanks so much for joining us this morning.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, what is your reaction to this ruling out of Texas?\n\n\n\nJONATHAN GRUBER, ARCHITECT OF OBAMACARE: Well, I think it's really disappointing. I mean essentially a perversion of representative democracy.\n\n\n\nRepublicans controlled the Congress. They had a chance to strike down Obamacare. They said no, we are going to leave Obamacare and strike down the tax penalty. So they have literally said it is severable. Republicans have spoken. They said it's severable.\n\n\n\nYet, this judge is saying, no, I don't believe what the representative democracy delivered. I'm going to declare it unseverable.\n\n\n\nSo that's why legal experts, even legal experts who were opposed to the Affordable Care Act in previous cases are saying this is just ridiculous.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And the judge did say that because the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the whole law is as well. That mandate as we know is what they called as central and inseverable, as you were just discussing, from the remainder of Obamacare. So do you agree?\n\n\n\nGRUBER: Well look, I think when the law passed we all thought the mandate was a very important part of the law. We have now basically been proven that it's important but not as important as we thought because look, we now have experience of the law without it, they removed the mandate. And we are seeing it weakens the law, it raises premiums, but the law still remains quite strong, albeit not as strong as it would have been.\n\n\n\nSo we have seen empirically that the law -- that it is severable. The law still works without it. Congress in its wisdom has declared that it's severable, has said, look, we're going to keep the law but remove the mandate penalty.\n\n\n\nSo really there is just no basis for a judge in Texas to just say despite what the body that represents the American people have said, I'm going to decide this is not severable. There's just no reason to do it.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Are you confident in the appeals process that this won't go any farther?\n\n\n\nGRUBER: No, I'm not confident. Previous cases on the Affordable Care Act have all been clearly, by an objective standard, easy wins for the Affordable Care Act, and yet they've all passed by the skin of their teeth.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court clearly does not represent the constitutional expertise of the broad Senate constitutional experts, who for example in 2012 by about an 80 percent to 90 percent margin said the mandate was constitutional. Yet the Supreme Court found it wasn't.\n\n\n\nSo I'm nervous. What's fortunate is the Supreme Court I think does care about the opinion of the American people. The American people have spoken. They believe that protecting people with pre-existing conditions against insurance market discrimination is a key contribution of this law. And indeed it is.\n\n\n\nAnd I think hopefully the Supreme Court will see that that's something that matters to people. And that because of some obscure severability clause --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nGRUBER: -- Or lack of severability --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nGRUBER: -- they will not go against the will of the Congress.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: You say you are nervous. At the same time you say that the Supreme Court listens to the will of the American people. But now we have a Supreme Court that has two new conservative justices in Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on it. So if this makes its way to the Supreme Court, do you have any sense of how you think they might rule or how the whole court would rule?\n\n\n\nGRUBER: I honestly don't. I just hope that they will look and realize that even without the individual mandate, we are talking about a law that provided insurance to 17 million people, and for the 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, it's saying don't worry, if you lose health insurance you can go buy it on the exchange.\n\n\n\nIf this law goes away, we return to a day where people who are sick can't get health insurance, which defeats the whole purpose of the product.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Jonathan Gruber -- thanks so much for joining us this morning. GRUBER: You bet. >\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Joining me now is NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell, and assistant editor at the Washington Post and CNN political commentator David Swerdlick.\n\n\n\nDavid -- let's start with you. Protecting those with pre-existing conditions was a focal point of the midterm campaigns and did help Democrats take back the House. What do you think are the political consequences of this ruling?\n\n\n\nDAVID SWERDLICK, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: So, good morning -- Alex.\n\n\n\nI think the political consequences are that Republicans have now basically done the equivalent of playing Jenga. They pulled the bottom block out of something hoping it will collapse. It's not going to go away yet because as your previous guest has said it's going to have to go up to the Supreme Court probably to resolve this.\n\n\n\nBut if the Affordable Care Act eventually does fall apart, then you have a divided Congress that's not going to be able to agree on how to proceed with health care and that will leave millions of Americans who depended on the Affordable Care Act sort of in the lurch.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are moving left toward Medicare for all. Republicans have been unable to pass their plans, which are a version of, you know, market-based health care where states can choose what kind of plans they have. The two sides are far apart.\n\n\n\n[11:10:02] I don't think Democrats in the immediate future are going to be able to deliver on this because they don't have the Senate. And I think Republicans are going to have to answer in the coming months why they want to take this apart if they don't have a plan in place that can replace it that's clearly better.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And Kelsey -- picking up on that, the soon-to-be House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi has slammed this ruling. Is there anything that she can do?\n\n\n\nKELSEY SNELL, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, NPR: Well, she is very capable for bringing up bills to vote on her Congress at this point so that the House could potentially take a vote and uphold portions of the law or even bring back the penalty for the individual mandate that was zeroed out by Republicans last year.\n\n\n\nBut I think it's very important that this is a big political issue for Pelosi. She firmly believes and has strong evidence for the fact that Republicans lost many, many congressional races in states like New Jersey and in Florida and California based on messaging on the Affordable Care Act because voters really started to like this law.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: They may not like it being branded as Obamacare but they really do like the protections that are in the law.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nDavid -- a point that I have been trying to get at with some of our guests is --\n\n\n\nSWERDLICK: -- if we play this -- if we game this out and it gets to the Supreme Court and now you have the Supreme Court that is firmly conservative with the nominations of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh -- how does that impact things? Because the Chief Justice John Roberts was the key vote, the key voice last time and now you've got solid five to four conservative majority. So how is that going to affect things?\n\n\n\nSWERDLICK: Yes. No -- I think we're going to -- it's a little bit of a wait and see. I mean this Texas federal judge has a reasonable if not ultimately winning point that if the Supreme Court in 2012, you know, premised its upholding of the Affordable Care Act on the idea that this was part of Congress's taxing power but now the law does not include the penalty or the tax then that premise is gone.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the idea I think Ariane was talking about the severability problem earlier in your program -- the problem is does this make the entire law fail. And you know, I can't get into the minds of the Supreme Court justices, including Justice Roberts who is a conservative Bush appointee who's the chief justice, but who I think in 2012 clearly saw what would happen if the Supreme Court intervened to essentially undo the will of Congress. So I have to go with wait and see right now -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Wait and see it is.\n\n\n\nAll right. Well, he have a lot more to discuss. David and Kelsey -- please stay with us.\n\n\n\nWe're going to take a quick break.\n\n\n\nStill ahead, turmoil inside the White House. Just after President Trump names Mick Mulvaney as his acting chief of staff, his Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke steps down amid several ethics investigations.\n\n\n\nWe will be live from the White House, next.\n\n\n\n[11:12:45] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: President Trump has lost yet another cabinet member after naming an acting chief of staff. In a tweet this morning the President announcing the resignation of his embattled Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Trump tweeting that Zinke is stepping down and will leave his administration at the end of the year. Zinke was under growing pressure over a number of ethics enquiries.\n\n\n\nThe President has also announced on Twitter that Mick Mulvaney will become the acting chief of staff at the end of the year. Mulvaney will also somehow continue in his job as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the OMB.\n\n\n\nSo for more let's bring in CNN's Sarah Westwood at the White House. Sarah -- Zinke was in trouble because of all these investigations but his departure didn't seem imminent, did it? Why did all this happen today?\n\n\n\nSARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, Alex -- Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is someone whose fate within the administration had been was unclear for several months now given some of the headlines that he's generated in the White House responding to those by saying they'd look into the problems facing Zinke but the timing of his departure comes amid a massive staff shake-up across the West Wing in the cabinet.\n\n\n\nNow Zinke had been embattled for weeks now. He was facing a number of probes from the Department of Interiors inspector general over allegations that he used his post to enrich himself, that he perhaps had a relationship with the chairman of Haliburton that was under investigation. His dealing in a casino project in Connecticut also being looked at by the agency's inspector general. Abuse potentially of agency resources.\n\n\n\nAnd CNN reported in October, that the Department of Justice was looking into some of the Zinke's conduct after the inspector general referred some of its work to the Justice Department.\n\n\n\nNow, Zinke's departure does perhaps prevent some headaches for this White House because now he won't really be in a position to be dragged before Congress. Democrats had been vowing to bring him in to ask him questions about some of these scandals -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Sarah -- switching over to Mulvaney for a second, he has been named acting chief of staff, emphasis on the acting. And somehow he is going to do that incredibly difficult and time-consuming job while also holding on to his job as the head of OMB?\n\n\n\nWESTWOOD: That's right. That's what this administration says, although the day-to-day work will be taken over by a deputy. It won't even be the first time Mulvaney is pulling double duty. He also took over as head of the CFPB earlier in the Trump president -- something that was a little controversial at the time.\n\n\n\nBut the President is accepting Mulvaney in this position, in an acting capacity is a remarkable shift from just a couple of weeks ago when the President ultimately wasn't able to come to an agreement with his first choice for the position, Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, because Ayers wanted to hold it on a temporary basis as well. But the President is suddenly ok with having an acting chief of staff to fill this vacancy -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Sarah Westwood at the White House. Thanks for breaking that all down.\n\n\n\nSo back with me to discuss more are David Swerdlick and Kelsey Snell.\n\n\n\nKelsey -- Sarah was just hitting on the point that I wanted to start with you, the fact that the first choice for chief of staff, Nick Ayers, who is Vice President's Pence's chief of staff. [11:20:05] The reason those talks broke down is because he wanted the acting title and Trump didn't. So why do you think he's accepted it with Mulvaney? Is it just to sort of quash any perception that no one wants the job?\n\n\n\nSNELL: It may just be that because, as you know, there have been other candidates who have said no or who have been turned down since Ayers decided that this wasn't the job for him. Like Mark Meadows --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: -- the Freedom Caucus chairman. And you know, it may also be to put a little bit of ease with people in Congress because Mulvaney has an odd relationship with folks up there, particularly with Democrats.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Congressman for six years.\n\n\n\nSNELL: He was. And there are Democrats who are already out there saying that Trump is picking Mulvaney because he wants to have a bigger shutdown fight and that's something that Mulvaney has always been a kind of a critic of government spending and he was one of the Republicans who always fought to keep spending limited. So it's entirely possible that he is trying to calm the waters.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And he's a true partisan and true supporter of the President so it's unlikely that he's going to be that middle ground, that moderating diplomat with Democrats on Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\nSNELL: That is not the expectation that people have for the type of chief of staff that we would see from Mick Mulvaney.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: David, to you -- like many Republicans the President's new acting chief of staff has not had kind words for the President in the past, specifically before the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nAnd overnight there's new video that we found of Mulvaney before election Day and in it Mulvaney actually explains why he is reluctantly supporting Trump. Let's take a quick listen to that and we'll talk on the other side.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMICK MULVANEY, OMB DIRECTOR: Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump. I'm doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact that he's a terrible human being. But the choice on the other side is just as bad.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: He's a terrible human being. I wonder if the President has actually seen that piece of video. Assuming he does at some point, do you think that Mulvaney will actually become the permanent chief of staff?\n\n\n\nSWERDLICK: No idea. But -- and I haven't seen that video yet -- Alex. But I have two reactions to it. One is that even though it's a little more blunt than most would put it, in some ways I think that is an articulation of the bargain that a lot of Republicans in Congress and a lot of Republican voters made with President Trump in 2016.\n\n\n\nThat they didn't think he was great on issues of personal character or comportment but they preferred him to Secretary Clinton. They liked his agenda and they wanted a Republican in the White House with a Republican Congress so they made that deal and they went with them and now here they are.\n\n\n\nAnd now here Congressman Mulvaney or rather Director Mulvaney is now. He's a loyal Trump soldier now, served as OMB director, CFPB as Sarah just reported.\n\n\n\nHe's got the right resume but I agree with what Kelsey said to you a minute ago. The fact that you have to take him on an interim basis just shows how much people don't want this job.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Kelsey -- when you hear -- to David's point -- that people don't want this job and yet you see the President saying that many people wanted this job, which is true? Are people actually lining up to try to be the chief of staff in this White House at this time?\n\n\n\nSNELL: Not as far as we have seen. There are some people who enjoyed having their names out there or were, you know, were not discouraging that conversation --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: -- about their candidacy. We haven't seen a lot of people come forward. It would be a very difficult job. We have seen that through the number of people who have gone through it already.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Very difficult because we have the Democrats coming in to taking over the House, and we're at possibly the end of the Mueller investigation. So this is a White House that's under fire.\n\n\n\nSNELL: Yes, this is a time when things are about to get a little bit stickier.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. David, back to you -- how could Mulvaney help Trump navigate this Russia investigation. We've seen a number of events this week with regards to Michael Flynn and Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. So there is a sense that Robert Mueller might be wrapping things up in the early months of next year. How do you think Mulvaney is going to help with that?\n\n\n\nSWEDLICK: You know, I think at a minimum, he knows Congress as a former member of Congress so he can at least help the President with the ins and outs of the committee process even if he, as Kelsey said earlier, is not on the best of terms with all the Democrats in Congress. That's the book on Mulvaney.\n\n\n\nHe has a fresh start here, right. With some bad blood brewing between the President and General Kelly. The President didn't have confidence in Reince Priebus, his first chief of staff. So at a minimum, he's able to turn the page and say ok, where do we go from here, fresh start?\n\n\n\nBut the President is looking at the Mueller investigation coming to a conclusion perhaps sometime in the next few months. The President is looking at a situation where he's already done a tax cut into a full employment environment. So if there's a recession, let's say, what stimulative things can he approach Congress with at this point? It is going to be a tough sled for any chief of staff for any White House in this next Congress, I think.\n\n\n\n[11:24:54] MARQUARDT: And Kelsey -- with Mulvaney coming in as acting, that is kind of plugging one hole in the boat but at the same time, you've got John Kelly widely respected, leaving. You now have Ryan Zinke leaving under this cloud of ethics investigations. That, of course, follows Scott Pruitt and Tom Price.\n\n\n\nI mean how battered does the White House become with these two high- profile departures after this long string of other departures?\n\n\n\nSNELL: Well, this is not necessarily something that's going to calm critics down. It's also not a situation that makes it any easier on the Senate because they are going to have to confirm replacements for Zinke --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: -- and for another attorney general.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: This has been very difficult for them to get through controversial nominees. We've seen a lot of nominees get through on very narrow votes. We've seen the Vice President have to break more ties his than several of his predecessors combined.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: So this is creating a serious backlog and a serious issue for the White House in the very beginning of next year.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So much to discuss, we could spend hours on it but unfortunately we have to go.\n\n\n\nKelsey, David Swerdlick in New York -- thank you so much.\n\n\n\nComing up, interview showdown. Sources telling CNN that the special counsel's team continues to be interested in sitting down with the President, but will the President give in?\n\n\n\n[11:26:03] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: The special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation still wants a face-to-face meeting with President Trump, but the President's lawyers are saying a sit-down interview is not going to happen. The development follows a new slam by Robert Mueller involving General Michael Flynn, the former national security advisor. The special counsel is dismissing suggestions by Flynn's lawyers that\n\n\n\nhe lied to the FBI because he was set up. The memo caps a head- spinning week of revelations that shows the legal walls are closing in on Trump and the people around him.\n\n\n\nThese are the current active investigations in and around Trump's orbit. Take a look at this. The Trump campaign, the Trump transition team, the Trump inaugural committee, the Trump Foundation, and the Trump Organization and, of course, the Trump administration itself.\n\n\n\nCNN's Erica Orden is following all of this. Erica -- let's start with Michael Flynn. This was a fascinating moment because both sides, the Flynn legal team and the Mueller legal team had said that Michael Flynn deserves no jail time because of his extensive cooperation. Now we see the Mueller coming out swinging saying that Michael Flynn's version of the facts is untrue and he should have known that lying to federal investigators is against the law.\n\n\n\nERICA ORDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. So, as you pointed out, one of the important things to keep in mind is that both sides have asked for little to no prison time for Michael Flynn. However the prosecutors had been pushing back against some of Flynn's claims.\n\n\n\nAnd one effect that all of this may have in terms of the sentencing is that the judge has brought up in his court filings and, you know, you've seen the judge order prosecutors and lawyers and from the special counsel's office to file additional material in response to some of those claims.\n\n\n\nSo what you may see during sentencing is the judge seek to elicit more information on some of these issues from both sides -- from Flynn's attorneys and from the special counsel team.\n\n\n\nAnd you may see the judge enquire with Flynn and with his attorneys about why Flynn is bringing up some of these -- some of these claims right now just before -- just prior to his sentencing.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So how do you think that actually plays into the sentencing which is on Tuesday? Flynn could face up to six months. I understand his legal team has asked for probation. They've offered 200 hours of community service. But given that Flynn has now clearly irked the Mueller folks, does that make it more likely that he could face some prison time?\n\n\n\nORDEN: He does seem to have irked them but given again that both sides have asked for little to no prison time, and that the Mueller team has gone into detail about -- although some of it has been redacted in court filings -- has gone into detail about Flynn's level of cooperation and his willingness to assist the special counsel investigation. It doesn't seem likely that these kinds of claims will substantively change the ultimate sentence for him.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And of course, the major question, what did Michael Flynn actually tell the prosecutors in more than 62 hours of conversations about President Trump.\n\n\n\nEric Orden -- thanks so much for breaking that down for us.\n\n\n\nORDEN: Thanks .\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So for more, let's bring in Elie Honig who is a former federal prosecutor and state prosecutor.\n\n\n\nMueller says that this won't change his recommendation, that Flynn will receive no jail time. So Elie -- what does this tell us about Mueller's process and what were Flynn's lawyers doing calling out the FBI in the first place in that sentencing memo?\n\n\n\nELIE HONIG, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Yes. I do not think this will change Mueller's recommendation of no jail time. I think -- but I do think Flynn's lawyers overstepped here. They went down a road that they didn't need to.\n\n\n\nTheir guy was perfectly situated to get a no jail time sentence.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right. That was the defense recommendation. That was Mueller's recommendation. It was a done deal.\n\n\n\nI don't know why they poked this bear. They did not need to. And the arguments they're making are silly. They are not correct as a matter of law. They're not correct as a matter of common sense.\n\n\n\nThe FBI has no obligation to tell someone in this situation that they ought to get a lawyer because the interrogation was not in FBI custody. So that's different from like a Miranda setting. The FBI did not have to warn Michael Flynn, hey if you lie to us, that's a crime.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way of all people who should know that it should be the incoming national security adviser. So I don't know why the lawyers went down this path. I don't see any benefit to it for Flynn.\n\n\n\n[11:35:01] Now the judge has shown some interest, as you said before -- Alex. And I don't -- that could mean either thing. That could meant the judge is thinking about throwing the case out. I don't think that's likely. It could mean that the judge on the opposite side is ticked off and think that Flynn has not truly accepted responsibility now which could result in a slightly higher sentence.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right. Let's just remind our viewers what happened is that Flynn was questioned by FBI agents, that those FBI agents did not tell him explicitly that lying to the FBI is illegal.\n\n\n\nHONIG: Right.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And the Mueller's team response was someone who spent this much time heading up an intelligence agency in the military at this highest level of U.S. government should know that.\n\n\n\nSo Elie -- Flynn was one of the first people in Trump's inner circle to cooperate extensively as both his team and the Mueller have said at the highest level. He was cooperating. He was part of the campaign. He's part of the transition. He's part of the administration. Does it looks like this is a test case for other potential cooperators?\n\n\n\nHONIG: It could be. Look, I always approach cooperators from the point of view that the other potential cooperators are watching. And that's why I think Mueller has been smart.\n\n\n\nThe cooperators who have come through, who've been honest, who've been truthful, who've given him good information he's gone to bat for. Michael Flynn being one of them.\n\n\n\nThe cooperators who have messed around and played games and stretched the truth he's thrown out. Papadopoulos, right, Mueller put in a very negative sentencing memo on Papadopoulos. And of course, Paul Manafort who Mueller threw out of the prop room altogether. And now Manafort is looking at an extremely high sentence.\n\n\n\nSo I think there is important messages to be sent which is if you cooperate and you do it right and you do it fully and you do it truthfully you will get a benefit. But if you come in here and play games it's going to back fire.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And Elie, now this news that the special counsel says he still wants to interview President Trump on the Russia investigation. Of course, his lawyers have pushed back and say they are opposed. They don't want to do that.\n\n\n\nHere is what President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said about the President's truthfulness. Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: The special counsel did say that you were doing your best to tell the truth about everything related to their investigation, everything related to Russia. Do you think President Trump is telling the truth about that?\n\n\n\nMICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: No.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So very simply, is it in President Trump's interest to sit down with Robert Mueller?\n\n\n\nHONIG: No, if I was representing the President I would fight that at all costs. But there's two ways this can go. They can agree to terms of an interview between Mueller and Trump's team. I don't think that will happen because I don't believe Trump lawyers are willing to walk him into a room with Mueller and let him answer questions.\n\n\n\nAnd if not then the ball moves over to Mueller's court, is he going to issue a subpoena? And if he does, we're going to end up in the courts and we're going to have I think a very close contest up to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And if he issues a subpoena, of course, that is to be approved by Mueller's bosses -- Rod Rosenstein, the acting attorney general Matt Whitaker until there's actually a new attorney general. So it's unclear whether that subpoena would actually come into effect.\n\n\n\nBut Elie -- the last question to you. The Trump entities as we highlighted at the top there are under investigation across the board. It does feel like to some extent that the walls are closing in on the President. What does it mean for Trump legally, personally himself? Should he be scared at this moment more so than in the past?\n\n\n\nHONIG: He should. He's got exposure on various levels. Let's start with I DO think it's unlikely that the Department of Justice indicts the sitting president. There is existing DOJ guidance saying that DOJ will not do that.\n\n\n\nThat said there are plenty of people very close to the President, including potentially relatives of his who could be in criminal legal jeopardy. And he's going to have all manner of civil problems. The Trump Org is going to have to deal with all sort of civil lawsuits as well. So yes, I wouldn't be resting easy by any means.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Elie Honig, always appreciate your expertise.\n\n\n\nHONIG: Thanks -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Thanks for joining us. >\n\n\n\nAll right. Up next, we're going to hear from the family of a 7-year- old migrant girl who died in U.S. custody. And what U.S. officials are saying about how exactly this tragedy happened.\n\n\n\n[11:38:59] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: A protest is planned this afternoon in El Paso, Texas after a 7-year-old migrant girl from Guatemala died in U.S. custody. She was detained with her father in a remote part of New Mexico on December 6th. Officials say she was medically cleared to be taken to a detention facility with the rest of her group which included another 50 unaccompanied children.\n\n\n\nThe next day she got seriously ill and was airlifted to a hospital where she went into cardiac arrest and died a short time later. An autopsy is being performed, but an initial hospital report says that the girl died of septic shock.\n\n\n\nFor more let's bring in CNN's Ed Lavandera who is in El Paso. Ed -- what are we now hearing from the girl's family?\n\n\n\nED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, they are simply devastated. We've been able to reach the family in Guatemala, the extended family and mother and grandfather who spoke about how devastated and horrified they are by the news of what has happened to this young girl.\n\n\n\nThe grandfather of Jacqueline spoke with us -- our CNN colleagues from CNN Espanol who were down in Guatemala speaking with them. And this is what they had to share. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDOMINGO CAAL, GRANDFATHER OF GIRL WHO DIED IN U.S. CUSTODY: I'm not going to speak that much because I can barely take it. It's difficult for us. This happened because we are very much in need. The girl would jump in happiness that she would get to go to the United States, very happy and content. But she didn't know. For us it's very difficult.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\n[11:45:02] LAVANDERA: The family talked about how it was desperation that drove them to make that long journey. And of course, there has been a great deal of debate about the very trek that they made.\n\n\n\nTrump administration officials have been very critical of the father in particular for, quote, choosing to cross illegally into the United States. That has been pushed back on very intensely from immigrant rights activist, especially here in El Paso who say it's the Trump administration's policies and immigration stance that is driving many of these people to cross into the country illegally.\n\n\n\nThis father and daughter were part of a large group of migrants who had crossed into a border checkpoint in the far remote areas of western New Mexico. This was hundreds of miles from many things where they would have been able to provide quick medical care in this situation.\n\n\n\nSo a great deal of debate and a lot of finger-pointing as to how all of this could have happened -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: One of the disturbing things, Ed, in this whole story is that this happened more than a week ago so why did it take so long for this to come to light?\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: That's a big question, you know. And there has been a number of critics who really kind of fault the transparency or the lack of transparency on the part of the Trump administration.\n\n\n\nEl Paso Congressman Beto O'Rourke basically faulted the Department of Homeland Security for not being transparent enough. The leader of the Customs and Border Protection testified before Congress on Tuesday several days after this young girl had passed away and made no mention of this particular case.\n\n\n\nSo there is a great number of criticism of the administration for essentially having to count on a news report to break thins story and bring it to light.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Ed Lavandera in El Paso, Texas -- thanks so much.\n\n\n\nNow, remember the deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland Florida back in February? The panel investigating the attacks now wants a new law allowing teachers to carry guns. Details and reactions coming up next. [11:47:09] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: This week we saw a new controversial push to put guns in classrooms to try to avoid tragedies like the Parkland massacre. It's been ten months since 17 people, 14 of them children, were gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\n\nNow the school safety committee formed after that shooting has voted to recommend a state law be passed that allows teachers to be armed with guns. Those teachers would have to volunteer and undergo a background check.\n\n\n\nNow, this comes as a new report from the CDC shows that nearly 40,000 people were killed by guns last year. That's the highest number since at least 1979 when firearm deaths were first recorded -- 40,000.\n\n\n\nJoining me now is CNN correspondent Polo Sandoval. Polo -- what can you tell us about this recommendation to arm teachers?\n\n\n\nPOLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, first off, Alex -- that commission is certainly still remembering those 17 people whose lives were cut short, their families continue to grieve today and they likely will the rest of their lives.\n\n\n\nBut for the last eight months, members of the commission that was appointed to try to come up with a solution has been meeting trying to figure out a way of preventing something like this from happening again.\n\n\n\nAnd what's interesting here is that is a majority of them, about 14 of the 15 members of that panel all came to an agreement in the last few days. And all of them believe that perhaps the solution is to allow more teachers to carry weapons in the classroom.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nBOB GUALTIERI, PINELLAS COUNTY SHERIFF: Such as participating on the threat assessment teams.\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission is recommending teachers be allowed to carry guns on school campuses. The controversial proposal part of a 407-page preliminary report. It addresses failures by Broward County law enforcement during the massacre as well as recommendations on how to counter future school violence.\n\n\n\nChairing the commission, Pinellas County sheriff Bob Gualtieri who supports the measure.\n\n\n\nGUALTIERI: We have to give people a fighting chance so we've got to give them an opportunity to protect themselves in my view. We don't have enough to put cops in every school or multiple cops in every school and we're not maximizing the use of the guardian program. and one person, one good guy with a gun on every campus is not adequate.\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: The proposal has yet to go before the governor or state lawmakers. If approved, teachers who want to carry would be required to go through training and background checks before arming themselves.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here's the issue -- districts and schools need to act now.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They need to act now. They need to act now.\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: Currently only some teachers and school staff are allowed to carry firearms. Since the Parkland shooting, at least 14 other states have introduced similar measures. The changes have been met with some support in states where rural communities lack funding and resources to respond to a school shooter.\n\n\n\nMax Schachter is the only person on the advisory commission opposing the arming of Florida teachers.\n\n\n\nMAX SCHACHTER, PARENT: I don't think teachers should be carrying guns. I think they have enough on their plate. I think their priority is teaching. It just creates a lot of host of problems.\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: With the recommendation still tentative, more debate is likely about how to face a school's worst nightmare.\n\n\n\nGUALTIERI: What we got right now isn't working. So we need to do something differently.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\n[11:54:54] SANDOVAL: And though this measure has large support within that public safety commission, there is a plenty of opposition outside of it, particularly some of these pro-gun reform groups, including Every Town for Gun Safety, a volunteer with that group strongly condemning it.\n\n\n\nAlex -- I want to read you a small portion of the statement that he published the week following the release of this draft report. Gay Valemont (ph) a volunteer with this group, writing There is no evidence that arming teachers makes kids safer. He went on to write Our children deserve real solutions to keep them safe from gun violence, like a criminal background check on every gun sale.\n\n\n\nSo even though this is still a draft report, still has to go to the governor, Alex, still also has to go to legislators, this obviously is still making for quite a bit of debate there in Florida to try to keep something like this from happening again.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And of course this is the kind of policy that the President has trumpeted numerous times --\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: Right.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: -- after this horrific massacres that we've seen.\n\n\n\nPolo Sandoval, thanks so much for that report. All right. Still ahead, a federal judge has struck down the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare marking a win for President Trump but potentially putting the health care of millions of Americans in jeopardy.\n\n\n\n[11:55:59] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
A Message of Discontent from Wisconsin (TIME, April 17, 1972) -- Like some metaphysical lottery, with hazards of sudden political death or prizes of resurrection, the American primary system ramshackled through Wisconsin last week to the end of its first phase -- and a pause before the next series, starting April 25, in such crucial industrial states as Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. The Wisconsin primary left the eventual outcome of the long spring campaign more enigmatic than ever, but some of the election results were startling: -- George McGovern, hitherto regarded as a one-issue antiwar champion of the liberal-left, exploited his own superb organization in the state, tapped deep wells of economic discontent and, by winning a 30% plurality, transformed himself at last into a major candidate. In Wisconsin his support was astonishingly broad, bracketing liberals, conservatives, blue- collar workers, farmers, suburbanites and the young. -- George Wallace, with the help of 35% of the G.O.P. voters who crossed over to vote Democratic, similarly appealed to a restive mood of the little man. Although he campaigned for only eight days in Wisconsin, Wallace came in second, with 22% of the vote. Adding the Wallace and McGovern totals, 52% of the voters cast ballots for anti-Establishment candidates. -- Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey, who had counted on his longtime popularity in neighboring Wisconsin to catapult him into the Democratic lead, came in third, with 21%. It was a serious, though by no means fatal blow for Humphrey, who has yet to win a presidential primary. -- Edmund Muskie, limping into fourth place with only 10% of the vote, was the real loser. Once regarded as the front runner, Muskie's defeats in Florida and Wisconsin have deflated his trust and confidence campaign. In an almost breathtaking descent, Muskie in a matter of weeks has become merely another contender. At least one candidate did not survive Wisconsin at all. New York Mayor John Lindsay, with a dismal 7% showing on top of his 7% in Florida, declared himself out of the race. A Muskie aide who had earlier called Lindsay the wild card in this campaign remarked last week: He turned out to be a deuce. Washington Senator Henry Jackson, who won 8% in Wisconsin, remained the darkest of horses, suffering from a massive problem of nonrecognition; on primary day last week, his workers were still distributing a leaflet headlined WHO IS SENATOR JACKSON? On the Republican ballot, Richard Nixon was opposed by Ohio's conservative Congressman John Ashbrook, who got 1% of the vote. California's liberal Republican Congressman Paul McCloskey, who had already withdrawn from the race, also got 1%. The President scored 97%. The Wisconsin campaign was a furious montage of political styles. With mod glasses and carefully darkened hair, 61-year-old Humphrey bounced through 19-hour days. We can sleep next year, he told his workers. Everywhere, except among college students, he found deep affection, but the warmth did not always convert to votes. At times, his campaign savored of last hurrah. In Milwaukee, a woman wearing a McGovern button told H.H.H.: We love you. But you're voting for McGovern, replied Humphrey. Said the woman: Yes, but we love Hubert Humphrey. George Wallace planned only a minimal campaign in Wisconsin, where busing was not an issue, and he had virtually no organization. But when he sensed the crowd's mood at his first rally in Milwaukee on March 23, Wallace abruptly changed his schedule. Suddenly all his earlier explanations about our inability to rent halls because of basketball games became academic. Wallace sought his little man with eleven rallies in eight days and a flurry of local television interviews. He repeatedly brought up busing as a philosophical issue. He complained that the other candidates were horning in on his populist issues: I dig the bone up and throw it out there, and the big dogs grab it. I'm just a little dog from Alabama. McGovern's television commercials confirmed the Wallace complaint. If you want lower property taxes, you want George McGovern, said one. It's as simple as that. But McGovern emphasized direct campaigning. In oblique reference to Lindsay's stylish and futile TV campaigns in Florida and Wisconsin, one McGovern press release claimed: The day of the media candidate is over. People have stopped watching television commercials and started listening to details. Top-Heavy. Despite his efforts to sharpen his stand on issues, Muskie failed to come across clearly on any topic. His organization, top-heavy with endorsements and contributors, never took root on the local levels where primaries are won. He failed to define a constituency. The overall message from Wisconsin is of a contrary mood, an impatience with more traditional candidates and a deep undercurrent of economic dismay. Most specifically, Wisconsin signaled a massive discontent with taxes and inflation -- the pocketbook issues that McGovern and Wallace hit the hardest. In a study of TIME, the attitude research firm of Daniel Yankelovich Inc. found that four of the five top issues that influenced Wisconsin voters were economic. The sixth was the Vietnam War, and McGovern made that into an economic issue as well, emphasizing its continuing costs. According to the survey, 82% of those interviewed said that the Administration's wage and price policies are not working. Fifty-two percent called for overall tax reform, with 41% complaining about high prices and 36% about high unemployment. McGovern and Humphrey both hammered away on the issue of tax reform, of giving the little taxpayer and the working man a fairer break. They shared the rewards: well over half of McGovern's voters and almost two-thirds of Wallace's assailed tax loopholes. The issue cut across both party and ideological grounds, attracting liberals as well as conservatives, Republicans as well as Democrats. The Yankelovich pollsters found a surprising degree of second-choice support for McGovern among the Wallace voters -- support rooted in McGovern's broad anti-Establishment campaign. It was not that Wisconsin voters were running to ideological extremes at the expense of centrist candidates, but rather that both McGovern and Wallace seem to have located an authentic area of concern that the other candidates failed to articulate. Significantly, the survey found that voters still saw Centrist Humphrey as the Democrat with the best chance to be nominated and, if nominated, to beat Nixon. According to the TIME/Yankelovich survey, McGovern trailed both Wallace and Humphrey among blue-collar workers and union members, but he still got 25% of their votes. More than any other, McGovern came through as someone you can trust. Improbably, he won the Fourth Congressional District, on the blue-collar and ethnic south side of Milwaukee, with the largest concentration of Poles in the state. Muskie, who had emphasized his Polish ancestry, finished fourth. Cross-Overs. Wallace and McGovern worked the same vein of economic distress, but the McGovern vote was moderate-liberal, according to the survey, while the Wallace vote was essentially moderate- conservative. McGovern fared well with young voters (47%); Wallace did poorly. The final results were complicated, of course, by the fact that 26% of the votes cast in the Democratic primary came from Republicans and Independents. The cross-overs cost Humphrey a second-place finish, since most of them went to Wallace. Yankelovich found, however, that most of the cross-overs came not as spoilers but as voters anxious to make their views known on the economy and other issues. Wisconsin served to prolong and compound the suspense of the race. It established the major Democratic theme -- a profound economic disgruntlement -- but not a party leader. It's kind of a scramble now, Humphrey said last week. Coming out of Wisconsin, Muskie still led in committed delegate votes, with 96 1/2. McGovern, gaining 54 in Wisconsin, had a total of 89 1/2, trailed by Wallace with 75 and Humphrey with 19. With the delegate-rich primaries in Pennsylvania (182), Massachusetts (102), New York (278) and California (271) still to come, all the candidates are still far from the 1,509 needed for nomination in Miami Beach. For the moment, Wisconsin seemed to have reduced it to a three-man contest among Muskie, Humphrey and McGovern. Although McGovern now ranks as a heavyweight contender, he must still establish that Wisconsin was not a fluke in which the candidate was secondary to the issues. McGovern displayed surprising strength among labor's rank and file in Wisconsin, but his comparative radicalism and long anti-war record have earned him the hostility of many labor leaders as well as Democratic professionals. If McGovern begins to seem a serious threat, many of the regulars might mount a counterattack in favor of Humphrey. Some Democrats fear that a McGovern candidacy might be the equivalent of Barry Goldwater's campaign in 1964 -- an ideological debacle -- and they are already poor-mouthing his victory on the grounds that his excellent Wisconsin organization and Republican cross-over votes distorted the natural outcome. Scenarios. These primaries, said McGovern last week, are going to go on from state to state, from battle to battle. His most optimistic scenario now is to win Massachusetts, where his liberal following is strong, on April 25, then Nebraska on May 9, run well enough (meaning third behind Humphrey and Wallace) in Michigan on May 16 and then go on to take Oregon, California and New York. For Humphrey and Muskie, April 25 will be critical. That is the date of both the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania primaries. Humphrey, badly needing a victory, will count on his support among organized labor for a win in Pennsylvania. Despite Wisconsin, Humphrey's camp insists that McGovern is not really a factor -- This is a race between Humphrey and Muskie. McGovern's advisers, meantime, regard Muskie as a political corpse, seeing the race as a head-on collision between McGovern and Humphrey. Muskie had planned to run in Pennsylvania against Humphrey and in Massachusetts against McGovern, to regain momentum. Last week, however, his advisers were discussing a stop-Humphrey ploy with McGovern's forces -- Muskie would concentrate on winning in Pennsylvania while leaving Massachusetts to McGovern. With each future contest, the political equations will change and the pressures increase. It is now highly likely that after all the bloodshed of the primaries, no one will go to Miami Beach with a lock on the nomination. If so, it will be a fascinating week in July. A deadlock would probably eliminate McGovern as too leftward and experimental, even though that might provoke a fourth-party rebellion. Humphrey might also be unacceptable: too much like 1968...a loser's image. That might leave Muskie as a reconciliation candidate. Or is it possible, as some politicians have already begun to fantasize, that stalemated delegates from all factions of the party will send up a cry from the floor: Kennedy! Kennedy! Success at Last for George I believe the people of this country are tired of the old rhetoric, the unmet promise, the image makers and the practitioners of the expedient. The people are not centrist or liberal or conservative. Rather, they seek a way out of the wilderness. So said Senator McGovern as he officially hit the campaign trail 15 long months ago -- and all but disappeared into the political wilderness. As the earliest declared candidate for the presidential nomination in recent memory, he had a plan: challenge Edmund Muskie before he built up an insurmountable lead, go all out to make a credible showing in the New Hampshire primary, and then, gathering momentum, overtake the field in Wisconsin. Back then, his strategy seemed dreamy, if not downright doomed. Few political leaders took his candidacy seriously, dismissing him as a self-appointed conscience of the party or a stalking horse for Ted Kennedy. The Margin. The professional polls had clearly underestimated George Stanley McGovern, 49, child of the plains, minister's son, college-debate champion, World War II bomber pilot, former history professor, father of five and, according to Robert Kennedy, the most decent man in the Senate. Decency and doggedness -- traits that served him well when he first ran for Congress in 1956, traveling the dusty side roads for one-to-one meetings in farmhouses and general stores. Taken singly, the encounters were insignificant; taken together, they meant the margin of victory. Recalls Journalist Harl Andersen, who covered the campaign for the Associated Press: George only builds a stone at a time. After a while, though, it begins to show up. In 1962 he moved on to the Senate, winning a seat by only 597 votes. One of the earliest and most persistent antiwar Senators, McGovern began building a small but strong following with his co- sponsorship of the 1968 McGovern-Hatfield resolution calling for an end to the war. Though unsuccessful, the legislation occasioned a rare flash of fire from the quiet man. Every Senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. McGovern fumed. This chamber reeks of blood! When Robert Kennedy was assassinated, McGovern sought to keep Bobby's antiwar supporters together by entering the race in his stead less than three weeks before the 1968 convention. Though he polled only 146 1/2 of the 2,622 delegate votes, the effort gave McGovern the presidential bug. The candidate of 1972 has changed little; he is still the personable but plodding campaigner. McGovern's success is a combination of his persistence and a new, high-powered, appealingly unprofessional organization. Without the aggressiveness of Bobby Kennedy or the aloofness of Eugene McCarthy, McGovern has forged a coalition of followers from both camps. On one flank are such Kennedy men as Advisers John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., former Kennedy Press Secretaries Pierre Salinger and Frank Mankiewicz, Writers Richard Goodwin and Adam Walinsky. (His principal financial contributors are Max Palevsky, chairman of the Xerox Executive Committee, and Henry Kimelman, board chairman of West Indies Corp.) On the other are legions of young staffers and student volunteers bristling with go-for-George enthusiasm. The spectacle of the old Kennedy pros followed by McGovern's young crusaders, says Eugene McCarthy, is like German officers leading Irish troops. Index Cards. But they march well together. Typical of McGovern's young minions is Gene Pokorny, 26, a scholarly Nebraskan who, says Campaign Manager Gary Hart, has the mind of a revolutionist in the body of Henry Aldrich. Dispatched to Wisconsin a year ago on a salary of $200 a month, he tirelessly crisscrossed the state with clipboard and index cards in hand, organizing and opening 39 McGovern headquarters. When it was discovered that voting day fell during campus spring vacations, Pokorny ran forms in students newspapers which could be exchanged for absentee ballots. By election day an estimated 70% of the students cast their votes for McGovern and the number of workers had grown from 80 to 10,000. McGovern, say staffers, is no softie, despite his easygoing ways. He's a classic Clark Kent, says Aide Ted Van Dyk. All calmness on the outside -- serene -- but when crisis strikes, it's into the phone booth. He has other useful traits as well. Accused at a University of Wisconsin rally of being a warmonger for voting for passage of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, McGovern did not turn peevish as Muskie has done in the face of similar baiting. Instead, McGovern asked that those who believed the charge raise their hands; when less than six hands shot up, McGovern moved on to other matters. He has successfully overcome his image as a one-issue peace candidate by promoting his stands on income distribution, tax, reform and decreased defense spending. McGovern projects simplicity, honesty and candor. He remains confident despite the many Democratic leaders who still dismiss his candidacy. Meanwhile, stone by stone, George moves on. What Happened to Muskie? In just one month, Maine's Ed Muskie slipped from the position of the serene front runner to that of an embattled man on the verge of being knocked completely out of the race for his party's nomination for President. Before the plunge, much of the press (including TIME) and many politicians saw him as almost a certain first-ballot winner at the Democratic Convention in July. Now he could easily turn out to be what President Nixon derisively termed him after the 1970 Congressional elections: the George Romney of the Democratic Party. What went wrong? No single reason, or incident, can be cited to explain Muskie's decline. There was, in fact, a whole series of mistakes made by political pros, journalists, Muskie strategists and Muskie himself. In the first place, he probably should never have been rated so far ahead. That status was based largely on the fact that national surveys showed him to be the Democrat with the best chance to defeat Nixon -- but those polls do not translate into strength in state primaries. Yet that impression of Muskie's popularity had never really been tested in voting booths nationwide. Muskie had looked cool and impressive as Hubert Humphrey's running mate in 1968, and he exuded much more of a presidential aura than did his G.O.P. counterpart, Spiro Agnew. Yet few voters select a President primarily by looking at the vice presidential candidates, and Muskie's appeal was not really an issue in that election. Muskie was now recognized by most Democratic voters all right, but how did they really feel about him? No one could be sure. Euphoric. Nevertheless, Muskie and his advisers almost euphorically accepted the pleasant notion that he was far ahead of the field -- and they designed a campaign based on that assumption. He would speak cautiously, even vaguely, if need be, on most issues, so as not to antagonize any large blocs of voters. Ignoring his rivals for the nomination, he would campaign against the President. The essence of that campaign would be to portray Nixon as an excitable, expedient politician whose statements were rarely credible. By contrast, voters were urged to trust Muskie, the man of integrity. That strategy might have been sound if the premises had been right. Muskie at his best is far more inspiring than Nixon, who does have credibility problems and is unpredictable. Nixon had sounded shrill and unfair as he tried to link Democrats with crime, drugs and antiwar violence during the 1970 congressional campaigns, while Muskie on that election eve effectively deplored such tactics and appealed for a return to reason. Perhaps the voters did long for a calmer, loftier leader. To further the bandwagon psychology, the Muskie strategists won endorsements from big names in the party: California Senator John Tunney, Ohio Governor John Gilligan, Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson III, Iowa Senator Harold Hughes, Pennsylvania Governor Milton Shapp. Each new name made the nomination seem that much more inevitable. This was organizing the party drive from the top down, rather than from the bottom up. Suddenly, the edifice began to crumble, and the entire strategy was shattered. Democratic voters showed that in primaries, at least, they were not all that concerned about finding a contrast with Nixon. They were not looking for a unifier and mollifier. They were in a balky, grumpy mood. They wanted specific answers to specific problems that plagued them. They were more interested in voting against the status quo, and men like George McGovern and George Wallace seemed to offer that chance to protest. Moreover Muskie hurt his own image as the judicious, controlled candidate by sobbing in the snows of New Hampshire, ironically at the very time that Nixon in Peking was acting as the healer of international passions. This outburst was partly the result of Muskie's emotional and physical fatigue. Trying to be all things to all people, and torn by his commitments to so many primary campaigns, he lost his sense of direction, creating doubts about his ability to stand up under pressure. Fed Up. Muskie's overconfident staff had also erred badly in ignoring grass-roots organizational work. In a primary, voters have to be coaxed to go to the polls and persuaded to select a particular name out of a crowded field. In New Hampshire, the Muskie camp had to send out-of-state organizers in at the last minute to get out a favorable vote. Muskie now concedes that entering the Florida primary was a mistake; once Wallace had entered, he should have known it was hopeless and avoided that first big blow to his front-running status. He relied heavily for support in Florida upon its Democratic state legislators -- but they were tied down by their duties in Tallahassee and were of little help. Muskie came out of his Florida defeat in a new fighting mood. He tackled specific issues, such as taxes and the economy, and began berating his competitors. Yet the turnabout gave Muskie the impression of a man lashing out in desperation, seeking a new image. Muskie's dilemma is painfully difficult. He has come across as a fuzzy Establishment kind of politician in a year when voters seem in revolt, and has been unable to put his brand on any issue that can attract that fed-up, turned-off voter. If he cannot beat such lesser-known Democrats, how can he be seen as the man to beat Nixon? He's got to find the ways to tap the anger and frustration that people have about big government and big business, says Senator Tunney, one of his now-disillusioned supporters. I know Muskie favors reform of institutions, but he hasn't been able to convey that. There is perhaps one consolation in all of the Muskie miscalculations so far. If the voters are as unpredictable as they early primaries indicate, similar troubles could lie ahead for the other candidates. Muskie may be no more finished now than he was a shoo-in in January.

An HSA combines the best features of all the various tax-advantaged retirement accounts available. If used correctly, money goes in tax-free, grows tax-free, and comes out tax-free.\n\nSound too good to be true? Read on to find out how it can be done and how you might qualify for one.\n\nWho is eligible for an HSA?\n\nIn order to qualify for an HSA, you must have a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). For 2017, your annual health insurance deductible must be at least $1,300 for single coverage (with an out-of-pocket maximum of $6,550) or $2,600 for family coverage (with an out-of-pocket maximum of $13,100).\n\nIn addition, you cannot be covered by another type of health insurance plan, be on Medicare, or be claimed as a dependent on someone's tax return.\n\nWhat is an HSA account?\n\nA health savings account is a triple-tax-advantaged account that allows individuals to save for current and future healthcare costs. You can open an HSA account through a bank, an insurance company, or another IRS-approved trustee.\n\nFor 2017, you can contribute $3,400 to an HSA if you have a high-deductible individual health insurance plan or $6,750 if you have a family plan. And individuals 55 or older can contribute an extra $1,000. Contributions are deductible from taxable income, the money grows tax-deferred, and the distributions are tax-free -- as long as they are used for qualified healthcare expenses. Individuals can also make a one-time transfer from an IRA to fund an HSA.\n\nAccording to the IRS, a high-deductible health insurance plan may cover some preventive care without a deductible. Otherwise, an individual can use the funds in an HSA to cover prescription drugs and other medical expenses. For a better understanding of what qualifies as a medical benefit, and for a list of examples of what is considered a qualified medical expense, see IRS Publication 502.\n\nFinally, if you withdraw funds from an HSA for non-medical expenses, you will owe income tax and pay a 20% penalty. But once you turn 65, an HSA mimics a traditional 401(k) or IRA: You can withdraw funds for any purpose, and you'll only owe income taxes.\n\nHow to use an HSA as part of your retirement strategy\n\nChoosing a health insurance plan for you and your family is a serious financial decision. Among other things, you must consider the health of you and your family, along with your available resources and ability to pay for medical care. If you're eligible for an HSA and can afford to pay for all or most of your increased out-of-pocket medical bills now, including meeting the higher deductible, then saving in an HSA for your retirement might make sense.\n\nAn HSA account is similar to other retirement accounts in that the account is portable and moves with you, the funds roll over from year to year, and you can invest the money in the account for the long term. Even if you use some of the funds during the year and are able to save only a portion of your yearly contribution, you can invest the balance, making this another opportunity to save for your retirement years.\n\nSponsored Content from The Motley Fool:\n\n• 5 Years From Now, You'll Probably Wish You Grabbed These Stocks\n\n• Kansas Man Turns $10,000 into $8 Million\n\n• Shark Tank Just Revealed a Trillion-Dollar Idea\n\nAccording to a recent study by Fidelity, a couple in retirement today may need $260,000 to cover healthcare costs -- that's in addition to other living expenses. As we plan for retirement, we must continually look for new vehicles to help us achieve our goals using the most effective and tax-efficient methods available to us. And saving in an HSA can be a smart option.

Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984 Walter Mondale throws down gauntlet in run against Reagan My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans: I accept your nomination. Behind us now is the most wide open race in political history. It was noisy - but our voices were heard. It was long - but our stamina was tested. It was hot - but the heat was passion, and not anger. It was a roller coaster - but it made me a better candidate, and it will make me a stronger president of the United States. I do not envy the drowsy harmony of the Republican Party. They squelch debate; we welcome it. They deny differences; we bridge them. The are uniform; we are united. They are a portrait of privilege; we are a mirror of America. Just look at us at here tonight: Black and white, Asian and Hispanic, Native and immigrant, young and old, urban and rural, male and female - from yuppie to lunchpail, from sea to shining sea. We're all here tonight in this convention speaking for America. And when we in this hall speak for America, it is America speaking. When we speak of family, the voice is Mario Cuomo's. When we speak of change, the words are Gary Hart's. When we speak of hope, the fire is Jesse Jackson's. When we speak of caring, the spirit is Ted Kennedy's. When we speak of patriotism, the strength is John Glenn's. When we speak of the future, the message is Geraldine Ferraro. And now we leave San Francisco - together. Future of America And over the next hundred days, in every word we say, and every life we touch, we will be fighting for the future of America. Joan and I are parents of three wonderful children who will live much of their lives in the twenty-first century. This election is a referendum on their future - and on ours. So tonight I'd like to speak to the young people of America - and to their parents and to their grandparents. I'm Walter Mondale. You may have heard of me - but you may not really know me. I grew up in the farm towns of southern Minnesota. My dad was a preacher, and my mom was a music teacher. We never had a dime. But we were rich in the values that were important; and I've carried those values with me ever since. They taught me to work hard; to stand on my own; to play by the rules; to tell the truth; to obey the law; to care for others; to love our country; to cherish our faith. My story isn't unique. In the last few weeks, I've deepened my admiration for someone who shares those same values. Her immigrant father loved our country. Her widowed mother sacrificed for her family. And her own career is an American classic: Doing your work. Earning your way. Paying your dues. Rising on merit. My presidency will be about those values. My vice president will be Geraldine Ferraro. Tonight, we open a new door to the future. Mr. Reagan calls it tokenism. We call it America. Ever since I graduated from Elmore High, I've been a Democrat. I was attorney general of my state; then a U.S. senator. Then, an honest, caring man - Jimmy Carter - picked me as his running mate and in 1976 I was elected vice president. And in 1980, Ronald Reagan beat the pants off us. So tonight, I want to say something to those of you across our country who voted for Mr. Reagan - Republicans, Independents, and yes, some Democrats: I heard you. And our party heard you. After we lost we didn't tell the American people that they were wrong. Instead, we began asking you what our mistakes had been. And for four years, I listened to all of the people of our country. I traveled everywhere. It seemed like I had visited every acre of America. It wasn't easy. I remember late one night, as I headed from a speech in one city to a hotel a thousand miles away, someone said to me, Fritz, I saw you on TV. Are those bags under your eyes natural? And I said, No, I got them the old-fashioned way. I earned them. To the thousands of Americans who welcomed me into your homes and into your businesses, your churches and synagogues: I thank you. You confirmed my belief in our country's values. And you helped me learn and grow. New Realism So, tonight we come to you with a new realism: Ready for the future, and recapturing the best in our tradition. We know that America must have a strong defense, and a sober view of the Soviets. We know that government must be as well-managed as it is well-meaning. We know that a healthy, growing private economy is the key to the future. We know that Harry Truman spoke the truth when he said: A President . . . has to be able to say yes and no, but mostly no. Look at our platform. There are no defense cuts that weaken our security; no business taxes that weaken our economy; no laundry lists that raid our Treasury. We are wiser, stronger, and focused on the future. If Mr. Reagan wants to re-run the 1980 campaign: Fine. Let them fight over the past. We're fighting for the American future - and that's why we're going to win this campaign. One last word to those who voted for Mr. Reagan. I know what you were saying. But I also know what you were not saying. You did not vote for a $200 billion deficit. You did not vote for an arms race. You did not vote to turn the heavens into a battleground. You did not vote to savage Social Security and Medicare. You did not vote to destroy family farming. You did not vote to trash the civil rights laws. You did not vote to poison the environment. You did not vote to assault the poor, the sick, and the disabled. And you did not vote to pay fifty bucks for a fifty-cent light bulb. Four years ago, many of you voted for Mr. Reagan because he promised you'd be better off. And today, the rich are better off. But working Americans are worse off, and the middle class is standing on a trap door. Lincoln once said that ours is to be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. What we have today is a government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. And we're going to make a change in November. Look at the record. Reagan Record First, there was Mr. Reagan's tax program. What happened was, he gave each of his rich friends enough tax relief to buy a Rolls Royce - and then he asked your family to pay for the hub caps. Then they looked the other way at the rip-offs, soaring utility bills, phone bills, medical bills. Then they crimped our future. They let us be routed in international competition, and now the help-wanted ads are full of listings for executives, and for dishwashers - but not much in between. Then they socked it to workers. They encouraged executives to vote themselves huge bonuses - while using King Kong tactics to make workers take Hong Kong wages. Mr. Reagan believes that the genius of America is in the boardrooms and exclusive country clubs. I believe that the greatness can be found in the men and women who built our nation; do its work; and defend our freedom. Truth About The Future If this administration has a plan for a better future, they're keeping it a secret. Here is the truth about the future: We are living on borrowed money and borrowed time. These deficits hike interest rates, clobber exports, stunt investment, kill jobs, undermine growth, cheat our kids, and shrink our future. Whoever is inaugurated in January, the American people will have to pay Mr. Reagan's bills. The budget will be squeezed. Taxes will go up. And anyone who says they won't is not telling the truth to the American people. I mean business. By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two-thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did. There's another difference. When he raises taxes, it won't be done fairly. He will sock it to average-income families again, and leave his rich friends alone. And I won't stand for it. And neither will you and neither will the American people. To the corporations and freeloaders who play the loopholes or pay no taxes, my message is: Your free ride is over. To the Congress, my message is: We must cut spending and pay as we go. If you don't hold the line, I will: That's what the veto is for. Now that's my plan to cut the deficit. Mr. Reagan is keeping his plan secret until after the election. That's not leadership; that's salesmanship. And I think the American people know the difference. I challenge tonight, I challenge Mr. Reagan to put his plan on the table next to mine - and then let's debate it on national television before the American people. Americans want the truth about the future - not after the election. When the American economy leads the world, the jobs are here, the prosperity is here for our children. But that's not what's happening today. This is the worst trade year in American history. Three million of our best jobs have gone overseas. Mr. Reagan has done nothing about it. They have no plan to get our competitive edge back. But we do. We will cut the deficits, reduce interest rates, make our exports affordable, and make America number one again in the world economy. We will launch a renaissance in education, in science, and learning. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. And this must be the best-educated, best-trained generation in American history. And I will lead our nation forward to the best system that this nation has ever seen. We must do it, we must do it. It is time for America to have a season of excellence. Parents must turn off that television; students must do their homework; teachers must teach; and America compete. We'll be number one if we follow those rules; let's get with it in America again. To big companies that send our jobs overseas, my message is: We need those jobs here at home. And our country won't help your business - unless your business helps our country. To countries that close their markets to us, my message is: We will not be pushed around any more. We will have a president who stands up for American workers and American businesses and American farmers in international trade. When I grew up, and people asked us to imagine the future we were full of dreams. But a few months ago, when I visited a grade school class in Texas and asked the children to imagine the future, they talked to me about nuclear war. As we've neared the election, this administration has begun to talk about a safer world. But there's a big difference: As president, I will work for peace from my first day in office - and not from my first day campaigning for re-election. As president, I will reassert American values. I'll press for human rights in Central America, and for the removal of all foreign forces from the region. And in my first hundred days, I will stop the illegal war in Nicaragua. We know the deep differences with the Soviets. And America condemns their repression of dissidents and Jews; their suppression of Solidarity; their invasion of Afghanistan; their meddling around the world. But the truth is that between us, we have the capacity to destroy the planet. Every president since the bomb went off understood that and talked with the Soviets and negotiated arms control. Why has this administration failed? Why haven't they tried? Why can't they understand the cry of Americans and human beings for sense and sanity in control of these God awful weapons? Why, why? Why can't we meet in summit conferences with the Soviet Union at least once a year? Why can't we reach agreements to save this earth? The truth is, we can. President Kennedy was right when he said: We must never negotiate out of fear. But we must never fear to negotiate. For the sake of civilization we must negotiate a mutual, verifiable nuclear freeze before those weapons destroy us all. A Second Mondale Term The second term of the Mondale-Ferraro Administration will begin in 1989. By the start of the next decade, I want to ask our children their dreams, and hear not one word about nuclear nightmares. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any classroom in America and hear some of the brightest students say, I want to be a teacher. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any public health clinic in America and hear the doctor say, We haven't seen a hungry child this year. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any store in America and pick up the best product, of the best quality, at the best price; and turn it over; and read, Made in the U.S.A. By the start of the next decade, I want to meet with the most successful business leaders anywhere in America, and see as many minorities and women in that room as I see here in this room tonight. By the start of the next decade, I want to point to the Supreme Court and say, Justice is in good hands. Before the start of the next decade, I want to go to my second Inaugural, and raise my right hand, and swear to preserve, protect, and defend a Constitution that includes the Equal Rights Amendment. My friends, America is a future each generation must enlarge; a door each generation must open; a promise each generation must keep. For the rest of my life, I want to talk to young people about their future. And whatever their race, whatever their religion, whatever their sex, I want to hear some of them say what I say - with joy and reverence - tonight: I want to be president of the United States. Thank you very much. (This is the Associated Press text of former Vice President Walter F. Mondale's July 19 speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination as delivered at the Democratic National Convention, in San Francisco.)
It's always a little surprising. In good times and bad, at least 75 million US households have ended up owing nothing in federal income taxes in recent years.\n\nThey're not dodging their tax obligations. It's just the way the US tax code works.\n\nThis year, an estimated 45% of tax filers — or just under 79 million households — are likely to have zero federal income tax liability, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nIf the new tax law hadn't gone into effect, the percent would have been closer to 43%. Put another way, the law added another 2.3 million households to the rolls of non-payers.\n\nBoth figures, however, come in below the 50% of non-payers recorded in 2009.\n\n[That] was the peak both because of the effects of the recession on employment and incomes, but also partly a result of temporary tax policies like the Making Work Pay tax credit that further reduced income tax liabilities, said Joe Rosenberg, senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nLooking ahead, TPC estimates between 44% and 45% of households — or roughly 80 million — will pay no federal income tax for the next several years.\n\nGetting to zero on your 1040\n\nThe ranks of non-payers are dominated by low- and middle-income households for several reasons.\n\nThe tax code is progressive so those who make very little don't end up owing tax.\n\nRelated: We asked how Trump's tax cuts were affecting CNNMoney readers. Hundreds responded.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, don't make a lot and can eliminate their federal income taxes through the use of the (now nearly doubled) standard deduction and some key credits such as the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, which offset your tax bill dollar-for-dollar.\n\nAnd lower income retirees who live primarily off Social Security don't pay taxes on their benefits.\n\nBut there are non-payers in the upper-income ranks too. TPC estimates this year about 7% of filers with total incomes between $86,000 and $150,000, and about 1% of filers making more than that won't owe anything.\n\nThey may whittle their tax bill to zero by taking a lot in itemized deductions, even though those options are narrowed under the new law.\n\nVery high income non-payers may get lot of income from tax-exempt investments or carry a lot of losses from prior years if they're involved in a business or partnership. Such losses can offset your current taxes.\n\nThe payroll tax tab\n\nThe majority of tax filers who don't pay federal income tax still owe payroll taxes, however.\n\nFor instance, only about 12% of those in the lowest income group (making less than $25,000 all in) will end up owing income taxes this year, but 58% will owe payroll taxes, TPC estimates. The 42% in the group who don't end up owing payroll taxes typically don't earn a wage or are retired.\n\nRelated: Why the new tax law could make your state tax bill go up\n\nIndividuals with jobs will pay 6.2% of wage and salary income up to $128,700 into Social Security this year. And they will pay 1.45% of all their earned income for Medicare. Their employers will match those amounts, but economists say the employer payroll tax burden is ultimately borne by the worker, too, through lower wages.\n\nAll in, TPC estimates three-quarters of all filers will pay payroll taxes this year. And many who end up owing both income and payroll taxes will end up paying more in payroll taxes.
The new federal tax law created a lot of confusion over whether tax filers may still deduct the interest they pay on their home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.\n\nThe new law suspends the deduction for interest on home equity indebtedness for the next eight years.\n\nBut it turns out the suspension does not apply to all home equity loans (HELs) and lines of credit (HELOCs).\n\nIt just applies to those that are used to pay for non-home-related things, like paying off your credit card or buying a car.\n\nBut you can still deduct home equity loan interest that is used to pay for home improvements.\n\nUntil this year, you had been allowed to deduct the interest you paid on up to $100,000 in HELs and HELOCs, regardless of how you used the money.\n\nRelated: It's getting more expensive to buy a home\n\nTo clear up the confusion the IRS recently issued some clarifying guidance to let people know that in many cases you may continue to deduct the interest you pay when you borrow against your home equity.\n\nHere's the deal:\n\nDespite their names, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are not considered home equity indebtedness under the law when they're used for acquiring, constructing or improving your primary residence and are secured by your home.\n\nIndeed, when the money is used to build or improve your home, the loans are considered acquisition debt like the mortgage you got to buy your house.\n\nAnd the new tax law still allows you to deduct the interest you pay on acquisition debt.\n\nRelated: Is your paycheck being taxed enough? Check the new IRS calculator\n\nBut it does limit that deduction going forward.\n\nFor loans taken out between now and December 31, 2025, after which the suspension ends, you may only deduct the interest you pay on up to $750,000 of acquisition debt. That limit applies to your mortgage and home equity loans or lines of credit combined.\n\nSo if you go out tomorrow and get a $750,000 mortgage then a few months later take out a $100,000 HEL to build an addition and replace your roof, you may only deduct the interest on your total debt up to $750,000.\n\nIf, however, you had taken out that same mortgage and HEL on or before December 15, 2017, the applicable limit for acquisition indebtedness is $1 million, so you could deduct all your interest.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposed taxing the wealthy as high as 70% to fund a climate change plan she's pushing called the Green New Deal.\n\nThere's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes, the freshman New York lawmaker said in an interview with Anderson Cooper that's slated to air Sunday on CBS' 60 Minutes.\n\nIn a clip of the interview that was released on Friday, Cooper asked Ocasio-Cortez about the specifics of the Green New Deal, a plan that calls for reducing carbon emissions to zero and moving the country off of fossil fuels in 10 years.\n\nOnce you get to the tippie-tops, on your $10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60% or 70%. That doesn't mean all $10 million dollars are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more, Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nShe also acknowledged that her goal is ambitious.\n\nIt's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now, she told Cooper. What is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent possible?\n\nBut she added, I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country, citing President Abraham Lincoln's issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation and President Franklin Roosevelt pushing for the passage of Social Security.\n\nAsked if she considers herself a radical, Ocasio-Cortez replied, Yeah, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, the youngest woman elected to Congress, was sworn into the US House on Thursday. A Democratic-Socialist, she has also pushed Medicare for all, tuition-free public college, canceling all student loan debt and housing as a federal right.
The start of a new year is a good time to update your budget -- or create one in the first place. But as you review your budget and, hopefully, adjust it for your raise, here are a few more changes you should really think about making.\n\n1. Carve out room for savings\n\nYour budget should include a line item for each spending category you encounter, from housing to cable to healthcare. But many people forget to incorporate one key line item: savings. If your budget doesn't have any wiggle room for savings, then it's time to reallocate your income so that savings come first. Ideally, you should aim to put away 10% or more of each paycheck, but if that's not feasible right now, then start slowly and work your way up.\n\nNo matter your age or income, you need an emergency fund with enough money to cover three to six months of living expenses. If you've yet to hit this target, any money you save should go directly toward an emergency account. Once you have enough short-term savings, shift your focus to long-term goals, like retirement or the house you're hoping to buy.\n\n2. Factor in one-time expenses\n\nMany of us have bills that creep up just once a year, like that annual heating maintenance fee or warehouse club renewal. If your budget doesn't already allow for these, look at your records from the past few years and identify the different one-off expenses you encountered. Then add those numbers up, divide the total by 12, and factor that amount into your budget each month.\n\nLet's say you spent $100 last year on a gutter cleaning in January, $400 in April on your annual lawn treatment, and another $100 in June to renew your warehouse club membership. In that case, you'll need to add a $50 line item each month to cover these sporadic expenses. If you pay your homeowners' or renters' insurance all at once, that's another cost to allocate over the course of 12 months.\n\n3. Eat out less often\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American household spends $3,008 a year, or $250 a month, on restaurants and takeout. But because most food establishments charge a 300% markup on what they serve, spending that much each year means throwing away a good $2,000 all-in. If you were to cut that spending in half, you'd have an extra $1,000 a year to save, invest, or use to pay down debt.\n\n4. Unload your vehicle\n\nOwning your own vehicle can be a nice convenience, and in some places, it's truly a must. But if you live in or near a city with ample public transportation, you might consider getting rid of that automobile, relying more on buses, trains, or a bicycle, and pocketing the savings. AAA estimates that it costs $8,700 a year, or $725 a month, to own a vehicle. On the other hand, according to LendingTree, the most expensive public-transportation commute in the nation -- in our capital of Washington, D.C. -- costs $237 a month. Compared to $725, that's a $488 monthly savings.\n\nEven if you were to take an Uber back and forth to work every day in New York City, you'd spend just $705 a month on average, which might still be slightly cheaper than owning a vehicle. Plus, you wouldn't have to assume the risk of major breakdowns or worry about parking.\n\n5. Stop banking on that bonus or tax refund\n\nMaybe you've gotten a bonus or tax refund over the past few years -- perhaps even consistently. But if you're including that money in your budget, then you're making a big mistake. Bonuses in particular are by no means guaranteed, and if your company has a bad year or you don't meet certain goals, you might not see that extra income this time around.\n\nTax refunds can be tricky, too. First of all, in an ideal world, you shouldn't be getting a significant refund in the first place, because that's just loaning the government money for free. But even if you've snagged a sizable refund over the past few years, it can be tough to figure out where it came from unless you're really in tune with your finances. It could be, for example, that you were eligible for certain tax credits or deductions in the past that no longer apply. That's why banking on a bonus or tax refund can really hurt you. If you count on money that never comes your way, you'll risk overspending and taking on debt.\n\nSponsored Content from The Motley Fool:\n\n• 5 Years From Now, You'll Probably Wish You Grabbed These Stocks\n\n• Kansas Man Turns $10,000 into $8 Million\n\n• Shark Tank Just Revealed a Trillion-Dollar Idea\n\nThe more precise and strategic you are with your budget, the better your chances of saving money and staying on top of your finances.

The Amex Gold card is ideal for foodies who spend money both eating in and dining out, and it comes with up to $240 in credits each year.\n\nStory highlights Thanks to up to $240 in annual credits, the American Express® Gold Card can almost pay for itself Amex Membership Rewards points earned with the card are extremely valuable when redeemed for travel The card is ideal for people who spend lots of money at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets\n\n(CNN) —\n\nCNN Underscored reviews financial products such as credit cards and bank accounts based on their overall value. We may receive a commission through the LendingTree affiliate network if you apply and are approved for a card, but our reporting is always independent and objective.\n\nOur quick take: The American Express® Gold Card is a foodie's dream, allowing you to rack up plenty of Membership Rewards points with its bonus categories on dining worldwide and at US supermarkets. The popular limited-edition Rose Gold design is now back as a permanent option, and thanks to new credits that have been added for 2021, the card almost pays for itself every year.\n\nPros:\n\nWith up to $240 in included credits each year, card members can effectively get and keep the card for just $10 annually.\n\nEarn an industry-leading 4 points for every dollar you spend on dining worldwide.\n\nEarn 4 points per dollar at US supermarkets up to $25,000 per year (1 point per dollar thereafter).\n\nEarn 3 points per dollar on flights booked directly with airlines.\n\nCons:\n\nCredits require planning and strategy to maximize.\n\nOther cards may be better for everyday purchases.\n\n$250 annual fee.\n\nCurrent welcome bonus: Earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on eligible purchases within the first six months after opening the account.\n\nBest for: Points-minded travelers who spend significant money each month on dining, groceries and travel.\n\nDigging into the American Express Gold\n\nThe American Express Gold is a standout card, largely due to its clear efforts to be top-of-wallet in a few categories that are significant to many US households. Take a look at your budget — do you spend a fair amount of your cash on food right now? Chances are, the answer is yes.\n\nAmex designed the Gold Card to cater to those who spend nontrivial amounts at restaurants and on groceries, offering 4 points for every dollar you spend at eateries worldwide and at supermarkets in the United States. You'll also net 3 points per dollar on flights booked directly with airlines, which isn't too shabby.\n\nThe current 60,000-point welcome bonus — available after you spend $4,000 on purchases in your first six months of card membership — is the highest bonus offer we've ever seen available on this card. And those Membership Rewards points are worth at least $600 when you redeem them via Amex Travel for airfare, and potentially a lot more than that with Amex's transfer partners.\n\nAlso, in 2018, American Express introduced a limited-time Rose Gold design for the Amex Gold, which was so popular that it was brought back again for a short while in 2019. Now, the issuer has announced that Rose Gold will be a permanent option for new card members going forward. That means you can choose between either the original Gold or Rose Gold design when you're approved for the card.\n\nBut here's the best part: When you combine the bonus with up to $120 in annual dining credits on the card and up to $120 in Uber Cash each year, American Express is literally almost paying you to hold this card.\n\nClick here for the bonus offer on the American Express Gold card.\n\nAdvantages of the American Express Gold\n\nThe biggest long-term advantage of the American Express Gold is its superior earning rate at US supermarkets and restaurants worldwide. With no foreign transaction fees, this should be your go-to card for dining everywhere you go. In fact, those bonus categories are so strong that it may be worth holding this card even if you only ever use it for dining and groceries.\n\nGiven that this is very much a food lover's card, it comes as no surprise to see up to $120 in annual statement credits are available for select dining spots as well. You can earn up to $10 in statement credits each month (so, $120 annually) when you pay with the Gold Card at Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Boxed and participating Shake Shack locations.\n\nPHOTO: Grubhub Get up to $10 in credits each month for purchases at Grubhub and other select dining establishments.\n\nBut that's only the half of it. The Amex Gold also now comes with both a complimentary Uber Eats Pass membership for up to 12 months when you enroll by December 31, 2021, and $10 in Uber Cash each month. Uber Cash can be used either for Uber rides, or on food delivery orders made with Uber Eats.\n\nAdd it all together, and you're getting up to $240 in credits every 12 months. Since the Amex Gold has an annual fee of $250, if you can use all the credits, you're effectively paying only $10 for the card each year.\n\nAnd then there are the points. How much potential value can you get with the Membership Rewards points you earn with the Amex Gold? While you can exchange points for cash in order to pay down the balance due on your statement, each point nets you just 0.6 cents when you redeem them that way.\n\nYou can also shop at Amazon with Amex points at a rate of 0.7 cents apiece, or redeem for an array of gift cards or for airfare at Amex Travel at around 1 cent per point. Plus, Amazon sometimes offers additional discounts on purchases when using Amex points to pay for even a part of your order.\n\nRelated: Get up to $50 off at Amazon with targeted American Express cards.\n\nBut while the above options are easy — and yes, it's important to have easy options — savvy travelers will want to utilize Amex's 21 transfer partners for remarkable redemptions. Amex has partnerships with myriad hotels and airlines, enabling Membership Rewards points to be used for travel that would be prohibitively expensive if paid for in cash.\n\nAmex also includes a baggage insurance plan on the Gold Card, covering eligible lost, damaged or stolen baggage when you purchase the entire fare for a plane, train, ship or bus ticket with the card. In addition, you'll get secondary car rental loss and damage insurance for most vehicle types and in most countries.\n\nAnd the Amex Gold also comes with trip delay insurance, meaning if your trip is delayed more than 12 hours due to a covered reason, you can get up to $300 in unexpected expenses reimbursed.\n\nRelated: Having a credit card with trip insurance could save you thousands on your next vacation.\n\nA couple of overlooked-but-useful perks: American Express cardholders are often eligible for early access to tickets through Ticketmaster. While obviously there aren't any concerts happening at the moment, when the pandemic ends, getting a head start on ticket sales might be the difference between an enviable seat and a chair in the nosebleeds.\n\nAlso, Amex Offers have been quite stout of late. This is a rotating selection of discounts, covering everything from clothing to tax preparation software to travel. Those who make a habit of watching new ones pop up can save hundreds per year on purchases they were planning to make anyway.\n\nGet almost as much in annual credits as you pay for the American Express Gold card.\n\nDisadvantages of the American Express Gold\n\nPHOTO: iStock The Amex Gold is a good choice for dining and at supermarkets, but not as an everyday card.\n\nThe American Express Gold is a specialized card. Beyond dining, supermarkets and airfare, you'll earn only 1 point for every dollar you spend on everything else. This means the card works best when paired with a card like our benchmark credit card, the Citi® Double Cash Card, for purchases that don't fall into the Gold Card's bonus categories.\n\nRelated: Read CNN Underscored's review of the Citi Double Cash Card.\n\nWhile the included credits are worth almost as much as the annual fee each year, they take a bit of strategy to use. The credits are capped at $10 per month, so you can't just use them in one fell swoop. Plus, the list of eligible restaurants is small. If you live in an urban area where Grubhub and Seamless are available, utilizing this credit becomes easier. But if you don't, maximizing the dining credit can be a challenge.\n\nAlso, while this won't impact many families, the 4x return at US supermarkets is capped at $25,000 per calendar year with the Gold Card. If you spend more than that on groceries in a year, you'll earn just 1 point per dollar after that.\n\nFinally, it's worth mentioning that Membership Rewards points take some studying and effort to really maximize. Managing transfer partners and dealing with dynamic award charts may feel like too much work for many, and you can't easily transfer Amex points to friends who may view this as a hobby. If you're looking for travel rewards that are easier to redeem, you'll likely want to pick a card like the Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card or Chase Sapphire Preferred Card as an alternative.\n\nStacking up the American Express Gold against our benchmark\n\nCNN Underscored has chosen the Citi Double Cash card as our benchmark credit card. That doesn't mean it's the best credit card on the market — rather, it means we use it as a basic standard to compare other credit cards and see where they score better, and where they're worse.\n\nHere's how the Amex Gold scores against our benchmark. The features of each card in the below chart are colored in green, red or white. Green indicates a card feature that is better than our benchmark. Red indicates the feature is worse than our benchmark, and white indicates the feature is either equivalent or cannot be directly compared to our benchmark.\n\nKEY DETAILS Citi Double Cash Card American Express Gold Card Card type Mastercard American Express Sign-up bonus None 60,000 points after spending $4,000 in the first six months REWARDS Earning rate 2% on all purchases (1% when you buy, 1% when you pay it off) 4 points per dollar on dining worldwide, 4 points per dollar at U.S. supermarkets up to $25,000 per year (1x thereafter), 3 points per dollar on airfare booked directly, 1 point per dollar on all other purchases Redemption value 1 cent (cash back) Up to 1 cent per point when booking through American Express Travel, 2.0 cents per point for transfers* Ease of basic redemptions Easy Easy Advanced redemption options Can convert cash back to ThankYou points that transfer to 16 airline partners if you also have the Citi Premier℠ or Citi Prestige® Yes, transfer to 21 airline and hotel partners Quality of advanced redemptions Good Great FEES Annual fee $0 $250 Foreign transaction fee 3% 0% BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS Travel perks None None Purchase protections None Purchase Protection, Return Protection, Extended Warranty Travel protections None Secondary Auto Coverage, Trip Delay Reimbursement, Lost Baggage Insurance Other perks None Up to $120 in annual dining credits and up to $120 in annual Uber Cash INTEREST RATES ON PURCHASES AND BALANCE TRANSFERS Introductory purchase interest rate None None Introductory purchase interest length N/A N/A Standard purchase interest rate 13.99%-23.99% variable None — Charge Card Introductory balance transfer rate 0% None Introductory balance transfer length 18 months N/A Introductory balance transfer fee 3% or $5, whichever is greater N/A * Based on point valuations calculated by frequent flyer website The Points Guy.\n\nWhen reviewing other credit cards, we use this format and these criteria to compare them with our benchmark.

This cash back credit card has a $95 annual fee and offers unlimited 4% cash back on dining and entertainment, 2% cash back at grocery stores and 1% cash back on all other purchases. If you prefer cash back over travel points or miles, the Savor card may be the way to go — particularly if you can't easily leverage the annual credits on the Amex Gold.\n\nHowever, while cash back is infinitely more flexible than travel rewards — you can spend cash anywhere — you also can't increase the value of cash back the way you potentially can with points or miles. Membership Rewards points can be used with Amex's transfer partners to score premium trips for much less than you'd normally pay in cash, effectively increasing the value of your points when you redeem them.\n\nAlso, although it may not be immediately apparent, folks who are fond of the bonus categories on the Amex Gold should also look at the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card. With a $95 annual fee, this card earns 6 Hilton Honors points for every dollar you spend at US restaurants, US supermarkets and US gas stations.\n\nBut keep in mind that points aren't all created equal. According to the point valuations of frequent flyer website The Points Guy, American Express points are worth 2 cents apiece, while Hilton points are only worth 0.6 cents each. That makes 4 points on the Amex Gold worth 8 cents, while 6 Hilton points are worth just 3.6 cents.\n\nShould you get the American Express Gold?\n\nPHOTO: American Express Get the American Express Gold card with either the Gold or Rose Gold design.\n\nThe American Express Gold is a must-have for those who know they'll spend heavily at restaurants and US supermarkets, and who also have the patience to maximize their Membership Rewards points through Amex's transfer partners. While cards like the Capital One Savor have a lower annual fee and no hoops to jump through to redeem your cash back, the 60,000-point bonus on the Amex Gold and credits that can be worth almost as much as the annual fee make it the winner right now.\n\nSo if you're looking to redeem credit card rewards for exotic travel once the pandemic is over, and you spend a lot of your time eating in or dining out, the Amex Gold could be a great fit for you. And if you decide it's a card that should be in your wallet, make sure to grab it now and get it with the highest welcome bonus offer we've ever seen for it, and credits that make the card almost pay for itself.\n\nLearn more and apply for the American Express Gold Card.\n\nFind out which cards CNN Underscored chose as our best credit cards of 2021.\n\nGet all the latest personal finance deals, news and advice at CNN Underscored Money.
Angela Merkel will be German chancellor for a fourth term. But she won't have an easy ride.\n\nThe rise of the far-right, and other small parties, in Sunday's election has made it tough for Merkel to form a government that commands a majority in parliament.\n\nThe euro sagged against the dollar on Monday on the prospect of months of political wrangling before the future direction of Europe's biggest economy becomes clear.\n\nHere's what the vote could mean for Germany, Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nA new government by Christmas?\n\nWith Germany's second biggest party -- the Social Democrats -- heading for a spell in opposition, Merkel has only one real option: a three-way coalition between her conservative CDU-CSU bloc and two smaller parties -- the liberal FDP and the Greens.\n\nThe parties have never governed together at national level, but earlier this year struck a deal to run the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nCoalition talks will be difficult, they always are, said Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank. But Merkel is good at bridging such differences.\n\nRegardless of those skills, it will take time. Serious talks on forming a new government are unlikely to start until the middle of October, once the result of elections in the German state of Lower Saxony are known.\n\nThat means it may be December, or even early January, before the new government takes office.\n\nRelated: German inequality may have fueled far-right surge\n\nIt could be good for the economy\n\nThe three-way coalition could give an extra boost to the German and European economies.\n\nMerkel's party and the FDP are likely to prioritize policies that favor business and trade, and all three have promised tax cuts. The Greens also want the government to spend more money supporting families.\n\nRelated: Germans are falling out of love with their carmakers\n\nThese policies would boost consumer spending, which could in turn lower Germany's trade surplus -- something that would please the country's European partners, as well as President Trump.\n\nStill, any shift in overall economic policy is likely to be small.\n\nThe big picture is that any fiscal boost will be modest, said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics. None of the three parties plans to invest as much as the [Social Democrats] advocated and all of the major parties want to keep a balanced budget.\n\n...but possibly bad for the car industry\n\nThe Greens are likely to push hard for their environmental policies. That could spell problems for German car makers, already shaken by the Volkswagen (VLKAY) diesel scandal and claims that they were operating a cartel.\n\nMorgan Stanley economists said dealing with the fallout from these issues was likely to take center stage in German politics, given the importance of the automotive industry to the economy.\n\nOn the whole, the Greens pursue more ambitious goals and a more radical response to the diesel scandal, Elga Bartsch and Jan Kozak wrote in a research note.\n\nThe Greens want to ban the registration of cars with combustion engines from 2030 -- a decade earlier than Britain and France have proposed. Merkel has hinted she could support a ban but has given no indication of the timing.\n\nShares in Volkswagen and BMW (BMWYY) slipped on Monday, despite narrow gains on German stock markets.\n\nRelated: Infrastructure is Germany's weak link\n\nEuropean integration could slow\n\nThe new government might take a more cautious approach to further integration between Europe's economies.\n\nNew French President Emmanuel Macron wants to push through radical reforms of the European Union. He argues that closer cooperation between countries that share the euro currency -- such as the introduction of a common finance minister and budget -- would make Europe stronger and more stable.\n\nBefore Sunday's election, Merkel had appeared willing to work with Macron on finding a consensus for reform. Now that might be harder for her, given the liberal FDP are skeptical.\n\nA final compromise should still see European integration move forward in the coming years. That said, it is likely to be at a slower pace than currently envisaged by Merkel and [Emmanuel] Macron, said Ricardo Garcia, economist at UBS.
New Delhi (CNN) Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a complete lockdown for India's 1.3 billion people on Tuesday, warning that many families will be destroyed forever if the country didn't get to grips with its coronavirus outbreak in the next three weeks.\n\nModi said the lockdown would start at midnight local time, would last for a minimum of 21 days, and would apply to all of India's 36 states and territories.\n\nYou have seen the worldwide situations arising from the coronavirus pandemic in the news. You have also seen how the most powerful nations have become helpless in the face of this pandemic, Modi said in a live televised address to the nation on Tuesday evening ahead of the deadline.\n\nIndia is the world's second most populous country and the fifth biggest economy, but so far, it has appeared to avoid the full hit of the pandemic. The country has confirmed 519 coronavirus cases , including 10 deaths and 39 patients who have been cured, according to the Ministry of Health.\n\nA number of Indian states have ordered lockdowns in the past few days, in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading. International borders have been shut to most travelers coming from the Europe.\n\nA protest against the country's Citizenship Amendment Act at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh was cleared by the police on Tuesday after the government prohibited all public gatherings in the city. Hundreds of women have been protesting at the site for months , expressing their solidarity with protesters who have been allegedly assaulted by police.\n\nModi said that the measures are necessary to protect the population, and referred to experience from other countries.\n\nWhat the experts are saying is that social distancing is the only option to combat coronavirus. That is to remain apart from each other and stay confined to within your homes. There is no other way to remain safe from coronavirus. If we have to stop the spread, we have to break the cycle of infection, he said.\n\nFrom 12 midnight today, the entire country will go under a complete lockdown to save India and for every Indian, there will be a total ban on venturing out of your homes. Therefore, I request you to remain wherever you are in this country, Modi added.\n\nOnly essential services will be operational. These include water, electricity, health services, fire services, groceries and municipal services.\n\nAll shops, commercial establishments, factories, workshops, offices, markets and places of worship will be closed and interstate buses and metros will be suspended. Construction activity will also be on a halt during this period.\n\nModi said if the outbreak was not dealt with properly it could set the country back decades.\n\nAccording to health experts, a minimum of 21 days is most crucial to break the cycle of infection. If we are not able to manage this pandemic in the next 21 days, the country and your family will be setback by 21 years. If we are not able to manage the next 21 days, then many families will be destroyed forever, Modi said.\n\nTo soften the economic blow from the shutdown, the Indian government announced a number of measures on Tuesday.\n\nDeadlines to file tax returns have been extended by three months, charges on minimum bank balances have been waived and no fees will be charged for using other banks' ATMs.\n\nThe threshold for invoking insolvency has been raised to $131,000 from $1,300, India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at a news conference earlier on Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, India's Labor Ministry has advised all territories to to help construction workers who are out of work because of the outbreak. The vast majority of the country's construction workers are considered as informal labor and earn their livelihood through daily wages. Around 35 million construction workers across the country are registered with construction welfare boards.
Like most of us, you're probably still trying to figure out how the federal tax overhaul will change what you'll owe Uncle Sam.\n\nBut the new law could affect how much you'll pay in state taxes as well.\n\nOf the 41 states that impose an income tax, all but five (Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, New Jersey and Pennsylvania) directly tie parts of their tax code to elements in the federal code.\n\nThey may use as their starting point a filer's federal adjusted gross income or federal taxable income. And they may adopt some of the same exemptions and deductions used at the federal level.\n\nBottom line: The more a state conforms to features in the federal code, the more their residents could feel an impact at the state level.\n\nThat is, unless their state makes changes. Some have started to, but many more are currently debating what to do.\n\nMany states have preliminarily estimated that they'll end up getting more revenue if they do nothing, meaning your state tax bill could grow, even though your state government hasn't done anything to raise your taxes.\n\nRelated: New York OKs plan to skirt controversial provision of GOP tax law\n\nSo legislatures across the country are debating what to do with the extra cash. They have three choices: Use it to make investments or fill budget holes. Provide offsetting tax cuts to residents. Or some combination of the two.\n\nColorado, for instance, estimates that it will collect hundreds of millions of dollars more each year between 2018 and 2025.\n\nOne reason is that the elimination of the federal personal and dependent exemptions could increase a Colorado resident's state tax bill by $191 per family member on one's return, according to estimates from staff economists of Colorado's legislative council.\n\nWhile Colorado lawmakers have introduced some bills — including one to expand a child care expense tax credit — to offset the loss of the personal exemption, it's not clear where the state will end up.\n\nMaryland estimated it could get an additional $500 million by doing nothing. Its lawmakers have decided to keep $200 million to invest in education. But this week, they struck an agreement in principle to make $100 million worth of tax changes to offset some of the state tax increases residents might owe as result of the federal changes.\n\nIdaho lawmakers, meanwhile, passed a bill lowering income tax rates to the tune of $100 million to offset their estimated revenue increase.\n\nBut that won't protect everyone in Idaho from a higher state tax bill. While the legislation will lower taxes for a lot of people, it would raise taxes on many large families, Richard Auxier, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center, noted in TaxVox.\n\nThat's because Idaho residents have been able to claim the full federal personal exemption and standard deduction on their state returns. The new federal law nearly doubled the standard deduction — which may reduce a filer's state tax burden. But it's not enough to offset the loss of personal exemptions for low- and middle-income parents with several kids.\n\nLawmakers have recently crafted a partial fix to the problem by increasing the newly created state child tax credit.\n\nRelated: 2018 federal tax cuts by state\n\nMeanwhile, some other states are trying to make a few technical corrections to address potential tax increases, said John Hicks, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers.\n\nNebraska lawmakers, for instance, have advanced a bill to create a state personal exemption to offset the loss of the federal one.\n\nIf you do face a higher state tax bill because your lawmakers don't act, Hicks thinks it's unlikely that the increase would wipe out the tax cuts you might see on your federal tax return.\n\nIt will still be a net tax cut, Hicks said.\n\nUnless, of course, you're in the minority of filers in 2018 who are also facing a federal tax increase.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nBecause any self-respecting institutionalist who has devoted his life to the defense of the Constitution and separation of powers should be able to recognize how dangerous and disingenuous lawyer Alan Dershowitz's argument is on behalf of President Trump.\n\nIf a president did something that he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment, Dershowitz said on Wednesday.\n\nWith this argument, Dershowitz completely conflates a president's self-interest with the national interest. If a president thinks 'I'm the greatest president there ever was. If I'm not elected the national interest will suffer greatly,' Dershowitz believes that cannot be impeachable.\n\nThis is not consistent with the vision of the founders. It guts the system of checks and balances and it defies common sense. But we might be waiting a while to hear the cries of outrage from small-government constitutional conservatives like Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee -- despite the fact that this is the most breathtaking argument for an imperial presidency that could possibly be imagined.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dana Bash shuts down GOP senator over Dershowitz's claim Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dana Bash shuts down GOP senator over Dershowitz's claim 03:49\n\nThat's because hyper-partisanship and polarization have lulled politicians into staying silent when it is politically convenient. As a reality check, just imagine how the Republicans would respond if a Democratic president's legal counsel advanced that argument. They would be outraged. And they'd be right.\n\nThere's been a full court press to roll back Dershowitz's comments. Don't buy it. It appears he said what he meant. Trump's legal team seems to recognize he went too far and could scare off swing votes. That's because the ideas he articulated are worth being alarmed about. If the Republican senators roll over for Dershowitz's argument, they won't get a do-over when similar circumstances emerge under a Democratic president. This will set a precedent for virtually unlimited executive power.\n\nUnder this logic, President Richard Nixon could have been justified for covering up Watergate because he sincerely felt that his re-election was in the national interest. If that seems like a stretch, former White House Counsel and star Watergate witness John Dean facetiously applied that logic to Nixon and wrote , All Nixon was doing was obstructing justice and abusing power because he thought he was the best person for the USA to be POTUS.... Seriously, that was his motive!\n\nEarlier in the week, Dershowitz also argued that abuse of power could not be considered an impeachable offense: It is inconceivable that the framers would have intended so politically loaded and promiscuously deployed a term as abuse of power to be weaponized as a tool of impeachment.\n\nActually, it is entirely conceivable that that was their clear intent. Because that's what Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 65 : The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\n\nSo don't be swayed by Dershowitz's Harvard law-professor credentials -- this isn't some novel reading of the Constitution. It is self-serving nonsense. And that's why every single one of the four legal experts who testified during the House impeachment hearing -- including Republicans' favorite Jonathan Turley -- say that impeachment does not require a crime\n\nThe real danger of the President's defense is clear when you consider the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime. This leaves impeachment as the only remedy to hold the President accountable for serious misconduct. The two-thirds threshold to convict and remove a president is already a high bar to meet -- even more so in an age of polarization. Dershowitz's argument would essentially take it off the table, and allow a president to do almost anything to ensure his re-election -- including asking a foreign power to intervene on his behalf.\n\nGeorge Washington would have thought that argument absurd. In his Farewell Address in 1796, he said: Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be useful must be impartial.\n\nIt's worth remembering that George Washington was obsessed with the virtue of being of disinterested. It's not a word we use very often anymore, but it means not being driven by self-interest, because self-interest distorts judgment and can't be trusted.\n\nTrump's legal team is advancing exactly the opposite argument, to a sinister extent.\n\nDonald Trump raised eyebrows when he bragged during the 2016 campaign that his followers were so devoted that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing support. Nobody thought, then, that it would be the basis of a legal argument advanced by the President. But that's exactly the argument Trump's lawyer William Consovoy made in federal appeals court while trying to block the release of Trump's tax returns in October 2019. He argued that the President could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not be charged until he is out of office.\n\nThis absurd argument belongs in the legal hall of shame right alongside that of Nixon lawyer James St. Clair, who sounded a bit embarrassed when he told the US Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit:  The President wants me to argue that he is as powerful a monarch as Louis XIV, only four years at a time, and is not subject to the processes of any court in the land except the court of impeachment.\n\nSt. Clair's absurd defense at least made an exception for impeachment. Now Trump's legal team is taking it a step further -- by saying that he is effectively immune from a court of impeachment.\n\nThis is the King Trump defense. And it is an insult to our Constitution and separation of powers.\n\nAnyone who professes to care about the Constitution should recognize the danger of this argument. And if senators remain silent out of fealty or fear of a president from their party, they should not be allowed to forget it. History is watching and they will be establishing a new precedent that goes against their alleged principles.\n\nBut at this moment, it appears that even asking for additional information -- from credible conservatives like former National Security Adviser John Bolton -- is too much to ask. Here we have a direct witness who is willing to testify and who states in the unpublished manuscript of his forthcoming book that the President told him directly that he wanted to continue withholding congressionally appropriated military aid to Ukraine until they announced an investigation into his most formidable political rival.\n\nHearing from Bolton would force the Republican senators to confront uncomfortable facts. Instead, they seem eager to accept the word of a President who many acknowledge to be a liar and pretend that the highly relevant new information is not worth further investigation. Dershowitz's argument gives them a whisper of an argument to justify their complicity in a Trump coverup.\n\nThis is an insult to the trust put in them by the founding fathers. The Senate -- as articulated by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 65 -- was expected to be a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent...to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality in an impeachment trial.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Mitt Romney, who have hinted they could vote to hear from witnesses -- to uphold that standard. As of Thursday morning, Lamar said he was still undecided . Either way, his legacy will be written by the result of this vote.\n\nThe closing questions and debates in this impeachment trial represent much more than a partisan fight over power. They represent a fundamental challenge to the rule of law and the separation of powers. If hyper-partisan polarization is enough to make senators forget their oaths and even their own power as a co-equal branch of government, they will be setting a dangerous precedent that takes aim at the heart of our democracy at a time when autocracies are on the rise around the world.\n\nIn its place will be a President of low character who will be unleashed in pursuing his re-election by any means necessary.\n\nThis is happening right under the chief justice's nose -- and the question is whether he will let it happen without uttering a word of warning about the massively destabilizing impact it could have on the Constitution he has devoted his life to defending.
President Donald Trump said that members of his administration's coronavirus task force would be meeting with Congress to discuss a payroll tax cut relief and relief for hourly workers.\n\nWe are going to be asking tomorrow, we're seeing the Senate. We're going to be meeting with House Republicans, Mitch McConnell, everybody discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief, Trump told reporters at a briefing Monday.\n\nWe're also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position where they're not going to ever miss a paycheck, he added.\n\nTrump added that he is working with leaders in the cruise ship and airline industry very strongly for potential relief from coronavirus-related losses.\n\nWe want people to travel to certain locations and not to other locations at this moment, he said. We're working with the industries.\n\nTrump also said the administration is in communication with the hotel industry, saying that some places actually will do very well, but others may not.

Now, investors will see if those gains can hold under Joe Biden, who will be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday.\n\nA look back: Shares shot up after Trump's 2017 tax cuts supercharged corporate earnings, then plunged at record speed when Covid-19 began battering the United States. Since then, however, they've been rocketing higher, repeatedly reaching all-time highs. Deep political polarization and a worsening pandemic have not been enough to hold Wall Street back.\n\nDespite this sharp rally, stocks under President Donald Trump have not performed as well as they did during the first terms of Presidents Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, according to an analysis by my CNN Business colleagues Matt Egan, Annalyn Kurtz and Tal Yellin.\n\nAnd some of the recent increases can be attributed to Biden's win, which investors believe will generate substantial government spending to boost the economy. Stocks have gained about 13% since Election Day as of Tuesday — the best post-election market performance for a new president in modern history, according to CFRA Research.\n\nBiden has not put as much emphasis as Trump on stocks as a gauge of the country's strength or wellbeing.\n\nThe idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening, Biden said of Trump in the final presidential debate in October. Where I come from in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. (Per the latest Gallup poll, 55% of Americans have some exposure to the stock market, many through retirement accounts.)\n\nEven so, Wall Street will be watching to see if market momentum can be maintained. Chatter has increased in recent weeks that corporate valuations, particularly in the tech sector, have jumped too high.\n\nMany investors worry that the equity market has rebounded too far and too fast and that there are signs of excess starting to emerge in parts of the financial system, Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman Sachs' chief global equity strategist, told clients this week. This is a reasonable concern given that the rebound in equities since the bear market trough in March of last year has been remarkable.\n\nOppenheimer said that while a correction — or a 10% decline in stocks from their recent peak — looks increasingly likely, the odds that stocks will enter a new bear market, dropping 20% from recent highs, in the next year appear fairly low.\n\nHe points to expectations of strong global economic growth in 2021 as the pandemic eases, as well as unprecedented policy support.\n\nOn that front, however, unknowns remain. While Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that interest rates could remain at historic lows for the foreseeable future, the fate of Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package will rely on his ability to generate some Republican support. In a divided Washington, that will be no easy task.\n\nNetflix comes of age as it hits 200 million subscribers\n\nNetflix NFLX has come a long way since it launched in 1997 to send customers DVDs in the mail.\n\nThe latest: The streaming service told investors on Tuesday that it now has more than 200 million subscribers globally, after adding 8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 — beating its own expectations.\n\nIt wasn't the only sign that Netflix has developed into a mature player in Hollywood and on Wall Street.\n\nThe company also said that it will no longer need to borrow money to finance day-to-day operations, and that it will explore returning cash to shareholders through stock buybacks.\n\nInvestor insight: Shares are up 13% in premarket trading, teeing them up to hit an all time high on Wednesday.\n\nCompetition in the streaming market remains fierce, of course. ViacomCBS' newly rebranded streaming service, Paramount+, will go live in early March, the company said Tuesday — joining an increasingly crowded field that also includes Disney+, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, Comcast's Peacock, AT&T's HBO Max, and more.\n\nBut investors think Netflix appears to be in a good position to maintain its spot at the front of the pack. UBS, for example, upgraded the company's shares to a buy rating after it posted earnings, citing continued strong global subscriber growth even [against] rising competition [and] robust growth in the first half of 2020.\n\nRich Greenfield of LightShed Partners pointed out on Twitter that while investors previously seemed worried about how Netflix was going to finance its massive content production machine, the tone has shifted.\n\nThe question now, he says: What are you going to do with all the cash you will start generating in 2022 and beyond?\n\nJanet Yellen previews Biden's tough stance on China\n\nJanet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Treasury Department, has made clear the incoming administration will maintain a tough approach to dealing with China — setting the stage for prolonged tensions between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday , Yellen promised to take on China's abusive, unfair and illegal practices.\n\nChina is undercutting American companies by dumping products, erecting trade barriers and giving away subsidies to corporations, she said.\n\nYellen added that while the Biden team would work with US allies, as opposed to acting unilaterally, she is prepared to use the full array of tools to address such concerns. Biden has said that he will not quickly eliminate Trump-era tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nThe stance was echoed by Antony Blinken, Biden's nominee to lead the State Department, in his comments Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nPresident Trump was right in taking a tougher approach to China, Blinken said. I disagree, very much, with the way that he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one.\n\nWhat it means: The battle between the United States and China on trade and technology has been a key source of uncertainty for investors over the past four years. Under Biden, that's not going away.\n\nUp next\n\nJoe Biden will be sworn in as the next president of the United States at 12 p.m. ET.\n\nMorgan Stanley MS Procter & Gamble PG UnitedHealth UNH Alcoa AA United Airlines UAL Also today: BNY Mellon,andreport earnings before US markets open.andfollow after the close.\n\nComing tomorrow: Economists expect another 910,000 first-time claims for unemployment benefits, a sign of US labor market weakness.

Bush, implicitly Appeals court Judge Jay Bybee, an appointee of President George W. Bush, implicitly calls out Trump's tirade against Robart and other judges: The personal attacks on the distinguished district judge (Robart) and our colleagues were out of all bounds of civic and persuasive discourse -- particularly when they came from the parties. ...

He brushes aside dissenting justices' reminders of Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric and says the court must consider the authority of the Presidency itself.\n\nJune 27: Justice Anthony Kennedy, a 1988 appointee of President Ronald Reagan, Justice Anthony Kennedy, a 1988 appointee of President Ronald Reagan, announces his retirement\n\nJuly 9: Trump nominates appeals court Judge Brett Kavanaugh to succeed Kennedy.\n\nOct. 6: The The Senate confirms Kavanaugh in a 50-48 vote following weeks of partisan divisions, including over claims by a California psychology professor, Christine Blasey Ford, that he sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers.\n\nOct. 8: Trump holds a ceremonial investiture for Kavanaugh in the White House's East Room, at which he Trump holds a ceremonial investiture for Kavanaugh in the White House's East Room, at which he apologizes to Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation, saying, You, sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent.

One of the most powerful Democratic City Council members in Chicago has been charged with extortion, accused of trying to shake down a fast-food restaurant seeking remodeling permits, said a federal complaint unsealed Thursday.\n\nAlderman Ed Burke, 75, is charged with one count of attempted extortion for conveying to company executives of a Burger King in 2017 that they'd get the permits if they signed on as clients at his private property tax law firm, the 37-page complaint said.\n\nA conviction carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBurke made an initial appearance on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Chicago. A preliminary hearing is set for the afternoon of Jan 18.\n\nThe Democrat's law firm, Klafter & Burke, represented the high-rise tower that bears President Trump's name. There's no indication the case is at all tied to his firm's work for Trump.\n\nKlafter & Burke specializes in property tax appeals, and its former clients included Trump's luxury tower in downtown Chicago.\n\nNewly elected Rep. Jesus Chuy Garcia and other Burke critics in Chicago's Hispanic community have drawn attention to that tax work in a bid to hurt Burke politically.\n\nBurke joins a long list of Chicago lawmakers charged criminally, including former Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who is serving a 14-year prison term on multiple federal corruption convictions.\n\nBurke has been on the council in Chicago for 50 years and has chaired its finance committee for the last three decades, Fox 32 reported.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune added that Mayor Rahm Emanuel has said it's unacceptable for Burke to continue in his role as chairman of the finance committee; a vote to force him out may take place at the City Council's next meeting Jan. 23.\n\nBurke's wife, Anne, is an Illinois Supreme Court justice. His father also was influential in Democratic circles in Chicago until his death in the 1960s. Other Burke relatives also have been involved in Illinois politics.\n\nSince the 1970s, nearly three dozen aldermen have been convicted. A common joke in Chicago is that so many aldermen had gone to prison that when they saw each other behind bars they'd holler, Quorum call!\n\nBurke is associated by Chicagoans with insider benefits long accorded alderman. A city inspectors report in 2016 found snow removal crews plowed the street where he lived far more often than other streets after a 2015 storm. They worked his street 46 times in five days, the report said.\n\nCHICAGO REDUCES MURDER RATE IN 2018 BUT STILL OUSTRIPS LOS ANGELES AND NEW YORK COMBINED\n\nBurke said after FBI raids on his offices at City Hall and in his Southwest Side ward in November that he was sure agents wouldn't find anything amiss.\n\nThe complaint, which did not identify the fast-food company or the executives allegedly squeezed, included excerpts from wiretaps of Burke's phone and emails seized in the raids.\n\nWhen the executives didn't give Burke's law firm the business he wanted, Burke spoke with one of his ward employees about how they would play hard ball with the company, the complaint said.\n\nFox News' Jim Murphy and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
House Democrats are working on legislation that would permanently expand the child tax credit to provide thousands per year per child to tens of millions of Americans in the form of monthly recurring payments.\n\nUnder the American Family Act, tax credits would be fully refundable and the IRS would send $300 monthly checks for families with a child under 6 and $250 payments for children between 6 and 17. That would amount to $3,600 per year for children under 6 and $3,000 for older children.\n\nReps. Suzanne Delbene, D-Wash., and Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., are working on introducing the bill, according to The Hill.\n\nSQUAD MEMBERS URGE BIDEN TO COMMUTE THE SENTENCES OF DEATH ROW INMATES\n\nThe bill was introduced in the last Congress and earned the support of 38 of 47 Democrats and 187 of 232 House Democrats. President Biden has since out in support of an expansion of the tax credit as part of a coronavirus relief package, but only for one year.\n\nA one-year expansion would cost about $120 billion, according to the nonpartisan fiscal watchdog Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Republicans are generally expected to oppose the measure due to its price tag.\n\nReps. DelBene and DeLauro are planning to reintroduce the American Family Act soon. We are currently working through technical changes to the bill, including discussions with the Biden administration on how this would be implemented to get benefits to families quickly and efficiently, Nick Martin, a DelBene spokesperson, said.\n\nOMAR CALLS ON BIDEN TO BACK 'RECURRING CASH PAYMENTS'\n\nThe president's support for this policy is a game-changer. The one-year expansion is important pandemic relief policy but permanently expanding the benefit could give millions of children the opportunity to succeed. The permanent expansion is estimated to lift 4 million children out of poverty and cut deep poverty among children in half, he added.\n\nThe current child tax credit is up to $2,000 per child 16 and under, and it reduces taxes on a dollar-for-dollar basis rather than in the form of a check. Up to $1,400 of the Child Tax Credit is refundable, meaning if taxes are reduced to zero for lower-income families they can get a refund on what is left over.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe credit phases out for single parents who make over $200,000 or couples who make over $400,000. The 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act increased the size of the credit for many families and the amount that is refundable. Such changes were pushed by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
In just one day, the fate of the Senate -- and the nation -- will be decided by Georgia voters. While the ballots and votes cast will determine if Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue deserve to be re-elected -- and it's undeniably clear that they do -- the Georgia runoff elections have far greater implications.\n\nIn the first two years of President Barack Obama's first term, we watched as a unified Congress controlled by Democrats rammed through ObamaCare and other liberal pieces of legislation, confirmed radical nominees to critical executive branch positions and promulgated progressive regulations that harmed our economy and our workers.\n\nRepublicans in Congress were powerless to stop this liberal assault on our values and institutions.\n\nIt wasn't until the 2010 elections — when I first ran for Senate — when Americans overwhelmingly rejected Obama's agenda and took back control of the House that Republicans in Congress could prevent further damage.\n\nSEN. DAVID PERDUE: GEORGIANS SHOULD VOTE FOR ME & SEN. LOEFFLER TO STOP DEMS' RADICAL SOCIALIST AGENDA\n\nIf Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are elected on January 5th, the Democrats' impending socialist assault on our nation will make President Obama's first two years in office look moderate by comparison.\n\nIf Democrats are successful in the Georgia runoff elections on Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will have the power to enact the radical left's socialist agenda that has become mainstream in today's Democratic Party. The Green New Deal, socialized medicine with care decided by unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington, European-style taxes on American industry and workers, radical regulations that will harm small businesses, and capitulation to the Chinese Communist Party will all be on the agenda.\n\nAnd make no mistake, the two Democratic candidates — Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — have no business representing any state in Congress. Despite the legacy media's attempts to bury any negative evidence of their checkered pasts, it's clear that both Warnock and Ossoff are wholly unqualified to be U.S. senators. Georgia voters would be right to reject their candidacies outright even if the balance of the Senate wasn't on the ballot.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSince President Trump's victory in the 2016 election, Republicans in Congress have worked with the administration to pass historic tax cuts for workers, families, and small businesses.\n\nWe have made progress in holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its continued assault on American workers and businesses. And we have confirmed a new generation of well-qualified nominees to our nation's judicial system who believe in the rule of law and the Constitution.\n\nOf course, the legacy media would have every American believe that the last four years have been a disaster. But no amount of hit pieces, negative articles, or tirades from cable news anchors can erase what our strong, conservative Republican majority has been able to accomplish.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGeorgia voters are quite literally our nation's last line of defense in protecting this legacy.\n\nOn January 5th, the entire nation will be watching. If Georgians believe in our democracy and our nation's institutions, they will reject Warnock and Ossoff. And in so doing, they will give Senate Republicans the power to prevent the socialist onslaught that the radical left is actively planning.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN. MARCO RUBIO
There are a lot of questions awaiting President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, in his scheduled appearance Feb. 7 before the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nHowever, the most immediate question will be whether Cohen's taking of the oath to testify will be followed by the usual comedic two drums and a cymbal riff. After a long and documented history as a liar and felon, Cohen's taking of any oath deserves proper musical accompaniment.\n\nNevertheless, Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., is right to call Cohen to testify. And to their credit, Republicans in the Senate are also considering calling Cohen before he goes off to prison.\n\nJONATHAN TURLEY: COHEN LIED, BROKE THE LAW AND USED TRUMP TO GET RICH --AND NOW BLAMES TRUMP FOR HIS TROUBLES\n\nCohen is not the first thoroughly discredited person to testify before Congress. The list ranges from mobster Frank Costello and quiz show fraud Charles Van Doren in the 1950s to drug gouger Martin Shkreli in 2016.\n\nHowever, even liars can supply details of criminal conduct. Now that Cohen has accused President Trump of involvement in criminal conduct, the American people deserve to hear Cohen's claims in greater detail. Moreover, the public has the right to see Cohen examined on those details and his own credibility in making these allegations.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty in federal court in August to tax fraud, making false statements to a bank and a campaign finance violation. He said the campaign finance violation involved a payment made during Trump's presidential campaign to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in return for her agreement not to publicize her allegation that she had an extramarital affair with Trump years earlier.\n\nCohen said he was directed by Trump to make the payment to Daniels. The president has denied he had an affair with Daniels and denied any wrongdoing regarding the payment.\n\nIn addition, Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about how long negotiations for a Trump Tower project in Moscow went on in 2016. No deal was reached on building the tower.\n\nNow that Cohen has accused President Trump of involvement in criminal conduct, the American people deserve to hear Cohen's claims in greater detail.\n\nCohen is heading to prison as a result of his guilty pleas – but not for as long as he deserves. U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III called Cohen's history a veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct and said each of the crimes involved deception and each appears to have been motivated by personal greed and ambition.\n\nNew York federal prosecutors denounced Cohen as a manipulating liar with a long history of being a legal thug. Yet Pauley gave Cohen an extremely generous deal of just three years in prison. It was not half of what he deserved, but Cohen has lived his life from one scam to another.\n\nCohen is likely to try to portray himself now as a redemptive sinner – an act that is almost an affront to sin. For those who have long been critics of his infamous career (and the failure of the New York Bar to take action against him), the act will be as infuriating as it is unbelievable.\n\nCohen made himself rich victimizing more vulnerable people. In 2015, when Harvard Lampoon staffers played a prank on Trump by having him sit in the stolen president's chair from the Harvard Crimson for a photo and an endorsement, Cohen threatened the students with ruin.\n\nCohen was quoted by a student on the Harvard Lampoon staff as saying: I'm gonna come up to Harvard. You're all gonna get expelled. If this photo gets out, you'll be outta that school faster than you know it. I can be up there tomorrow.\n\nWhile some reporters are actively rehabilitating Cohen now that he is a foe to President Trump, Cohen previously lied to and threatened journalists on behalf of Trump. When former Daily Beast reporter Tim Mak wrote about a biography that included allegations from Trump's first wife, Ivana, that Trump raped her, Cohen did not hesitate to attack.\n\nIn a phone call recorded by Mak, Cohen told the reporter: You're talking about Donald Trump, you're talking about the frontrunner for the GOP, a presidential candidate, as well as private individual, who never raped anybody and, of course, understand that by the very definition you can't rape your spouse.\n\nAs a matter of law, it is a crime to rape anyone – including a spouse.\n\nCohen added in the recorded call: Mark my words for it, I will make sure that you and I meet ne day over in the courthouse and I will take you for every penny you still don't have, and I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else.\n\nSo why would anyone want to hear anything from a guy who couldn't lie straight in bed? Because Trump selected Cohen to be his lawyer and employed him from 2006 until last year. Cohen served as a vice president of The Trump Organization and later as Trump's personal attorney.\n\nMore importantly, Cohen's allegations concerning the payoffs have some independent corroboration. Hush-money payments were made to Daniels and to another woman alleging an affair with Trump. Other people have reportedly supported the account that the payment to Daniels was made to suppress news that could have hurt Trump's chances of winning the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump picked not just Cohen but Paul Manafort – two of the deepest bottom feeders in the New York-Washington corridor. (Manafort served as chairman of the Trump presidential campaign and was convicted in August of eight charges of tax and bank fraud unrelated to his work on the Trump campaign. He also pleaded guilty in September to two conspiracy charges.)\n\nThis is the cost of such poor judgment by Trump regarding the people he has hired.\n\nThat does not make the payments a clear criminal act. As I have previously stated, there are strong defenses that Trump can raise over his motivations in the payments. Such a violation would ordinarily be handled as a civil matter with a fine rather than with a criminal charge.\n\nHowever, that does not mean that the allegations are not serious. Last year, I wrote columns saying that the payoffs represented the greatest threat to this White House and that Trump was facing an existential threat by keeping Cohen as his lawyer.\n\nObviously, anything Cohen says in his congressional testimony will have to be accepted with an asterisk denoting the sources as a serial liar. However, truth can sometimes be mined from a sinkhole of lies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWill Cohen testify truthfully before Congress? It's impossible to say but it would be an exercise of hope over experience.\n\nWe need to have that truth. The cost is dealing with disreputable individuals like Cohen. In this case, we might want to proceed under President Reagan's famous pledge to trust but verify. With Cohen, however, I recommend dropping the trust part.
The Ford Mustang Mach-E California Route 1 is living up to its road trip-inspired name.\n\nThe mid-level model of the electric SUV has earned a 305-mile range from the EPA, which is more than any other Mach-E. Just.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive vehicle comes with the largest battery pack available, a special set of aerodynamic wheels and a few other tweaks to help improve its efficiency over the Mach-E Premium, which is rated at 300 miles in the same configuration. The California Route 1 is more powerful, however, with a 290 hp motor to the Premium's 266 hp unit.\n\nThe California Route 1 starts at $50,900 and the Premium at $53,100, but both qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit. Subtracting that brings the California Route 1 down to $43,400. The lowest-priced Tesla Model Y is currently the Rear-Wheel Drive Standard Range version, which delivers a 244-mile range for $43,190.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOf course, a cruise up the California coast can be a lot longer than that. A trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco on Route 1 running over 450 miles, which would require one stop for charging. According to Ford, the Mach-E's pack can be filled to 80 percent in about 45 minutes at a public DC fast charging station.
It is doubtful that the House and Senate could tackle the next COVID-19 package until the first week of March, Fox News has learned. But, the process to put a COVID relief measure on the floors of both the House and Senate begins next week.\n\nHere's the problem: How does the Senate move such a measure (still unwritten) and avoid a filibuster? That requires 60 yeas. Moreover, how do Democrats advance a plan in a 50/50 Senate? The answer is budget reconciliation. It is an arcane, one-year fiscal process that curbs debate in the Senate to only 20 hours. No filibusters allowed. And it only needs 51 votes to pass.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS ON DEMS GETTING LEGISLATION THROUGH WITH FILIBUSTER: 'DAMN RIGHT WE WILL'\n\nFox News has learned that the House Budget Committee will prepare a budget vehicle on Feb. 1. The measure would likely go to the House floor on Feb. 3. This vehicle is the essential first step. You can't do the substance of the coronavirus bill unless you have the reconciliation vehicle that allows the Senate to consider the actual package under these special rules.\n\nFox is told the Senate will likely move its budget reconciliation vehicle on Feb. 5.\n\nIn other words, this is the bus that will hold contents of the next COVID package -- and allow it to bypass filibusters.\n\nSANDERS THREATENS TO ADVANCE CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS WITH RECONCILIATION IF REPUBLICANS REFUSE SUPPORT\n\nFox News is told it will still take a couple of weeks to get the next coronavirus bill together, and that will likely hit the first week of March. But it could go earlier if the measure is ready.\n\nDemocrats used budget reconciliation to pass ObamaCare in 2010 because they couldn't get 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Republicans unsuccessfully used reconciliation to try to do undo ObamaCare. And, Republicans also used reconciliation to approve tax reform.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, many Americans have not yet received their $600 stimulus checks that were approved as part of the $900 billion relief package passed in December. Most Americans received $1,200 stimulus checks as part of the first relief bill back in April.\n\nFox News' Evie Fordham contributed to this report.
This is a rush transcript from The Ingraham Angle, February 13, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Malignant dictatorships we've hated in our foreign policy since WWII. Unfortunately you're insane Alec. We'll always seek the truth, we'll never be the media mob.\n\nPlease set your DVR every night. Let not your heart be troubled because Laura Ingraham's here. Hi.\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Hannity, I'm always glad when that dry ice special effect comes up and I'm not the villain of the day. I'm always happy.\n\nHANNITY: Come on really?\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: All right, so you really think that one day I'm going to choose you as the--\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: You believe that.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes and then I'll make sure just let's cut corners, at least my staff will get to pitch fork and everything.\n\nHANNITY: If you do something that deserves it, that's it. You're going to be middle of the day but you're going to have to earn it. Alec Baldwin's tough to beat.\n\nINGRAHAM: But Hannity, I want to actually get real dry ice for your studio. I mean if you're going to do it, you got to do it right.\n\nHANNITY: You want like a concert.\n\nINGRAHAM: You got a fancy set up over there. I want the flames and the - I want the whole deal OK?\n\nHANNITY: You have the fanciest set up - you have as fancy a set up as I do. You have the same exact fancy.\n\nINGRAHAM: Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? I love our set. I'm not going to say anything else. We have a great set here. Tech people, you know the people when you ski, you go skiing, you don't ski but I'll just tell you the--\n\nHANNITY: These sets cost millions of dollars to build these things.\n\nINGRAHAM: Listen when someone goes skiing, right? And they have that $1000 pair of skis, it's fun to be on a pair of really old you know, old dogs on your feet and then you go whizzing right by because people are really nice studios. Then you have a rudimentary studio and you're number one. You're number one.\n\nHANNITY: Something like that. Whatever you say. I don't care.\n\nINGRAHAM: Hannity have a great night.\n\nHANNITY: Have a good show.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from DC tonight. The Left is so overcome with their zeal to eject Trump from office that they're abandoning all their supposed principles to back perhaps a plutocrat like Mike Bloomberg. No. But will he sell out America to China?\n\nMy Angle explains how he might already have done it and speaking of Mini Mike, despite his old thoughts on stop and frisk resurfacing. We're hearing those tapes, the mayor made a pitch to black voters in Houston tonight. Did it work?\n\nWell, we sent a special guest inside and he went into the event. You know who it is. I'm not going to tell you who it is. Oh, you see him on the screen. Dinesh D'Souza. Already shock. I wanted you to have a little trick there. All right, the exclusive video that we got ahead.\n\nPlus, we were the only show to report on that deranged leftist who drove a van into a Trump voter registration tent in Florida and we have an important update on that story for you tonight.\n\nBut first, the big news today was Bill Barr defending decision to scale back Roger Stone's outrageous sentencing recommendation. Earlier today, the Attorney General told ABC news this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBILL BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: When I first saw the news reports, I said, gee, the news is spinning this. This is not what we were going to do.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you were surprised?\n\nBARR: I was very surprised. I said that night to my staff that we had to get ready because we had to do something in the morning to a man that can clarify what our position was. I had made a decision that I thought was fair and reasonable in this particular case.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Now Barr's right of course. Whatever your feelings about Roger Stone, he doesn't deserve nearly a decade in jail for lying about activity that's not even illegal. And on top of that Stone is 67 years old and has no criminal history.\n\nBut the media they're not interested in that part of the interview. No. Facts and details bore the chattering class. They unsurprisingly found this to be the big takeaway.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARR: To have public statements and tweets made about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending in the department and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Ah ha, a comment that almost everyone in Trump's orbit has said before is suddenly the new bomb shell.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST: News here from what can only be described now as the besieged Attorney General of the United States.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: In his warped imagination, this is a terrible disloyal thing to do and these people must be punished.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does Bill Barr have enough goodwill with the President and political capital that he can do something like this and get away with it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He fired Sessions after almost two full years of simmering. We might get Barr leaving on his own.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: She always looks happy but like so many others, they misread what's really going on. The White House released a statement shortly after the interview reading in part, the President wasn't bothered by the comments at all and he has the right just like any other American citizen to publicly offer his opinions.\n\nThe president has full faith and confidence in AG Barr to do his job and uphold the law. The White House denial second matter to Democrat so they're going to still try to use the Stone case to make up for their embarrassing impeachment failure.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Something egregious like this demands that the Inspector General investigate.\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What Barr has done should mean that we are demanding a resignation. In effect, I won't resign from the House should start impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nSEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Attorney General William Barr ought to be ashamed and be embarrassed and resign.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: And the media playing right along.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's almost every big decision that is coming through the Justice Department now has to be sent through the White House and checkout with the President and then do what the President - to the President bidding. We've never - we didn't see that in Watergate. This is why this is more sinister.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: It always goes back to being more sinister than Watergate. I mean they just have stock phrases. They just pull them off the shelf and spit him out on TV. Joining me now, John Eastman, Clairemont Institute Senior Fellow, constitutional scholar and Darrell Issa, former Chair of the House Oversight Committee that oversees the DOJ.\n\nAll right John, the media sees the sexy story of Trump versus Barr but they miss the fact that Barr was basically telling Trump, don't worry I got this.\n\nJOHN EASTMAN, SENIOR FELLOW, CLAREMONT INSTITUTE: I got this and you know, the Democrats to seem to overlook article two of the constitution. The executive powers vested in the President.\n\nThe top law enforcement officer is the Attorney General. If he wants to counteract decisions of the line prosecutor, that is their job. There's nothing wrong with this. And what was wrong with it is the egregious you know, pre-dawn raid on Roger Stone and throwing the book at this guy because they don't like his politics.\n\nINGRAHAM: And I have to say this Congressman Issa, that tweeting about a pending case, John and I know this, you know this, it is going to be a problematic thing because it's not - it's not going to necessarily affect any outcome nor should it.\n\nHowever, it does put the Attorney General in a bit of a pickle, does it not? Because then - wait a second - he's pressured. He wasn't pressured. He's doing what he thought was right but hence, the tweet hangs out over his shoulder and it makes it a little trickier for him.\n\nSo I do get that point.\n\nDARRELL ISSA (R-CA), FORMER CONGRESSMAN: Well, you know there's been no communicator in our history like Donald Trump and President Trump's need and desire and effectiveness to say what people are thinking including the unfair treatment of Roger Stone.\n\nTo be honest Trump's all these other things so yes, I understand how every member of the cabinet would prefer to have the Chief Executive just say, you've got this but in some cases like Eddie Gallagher who was unfairly treated, the navy seals or in the case of Roger Stone, the President having an opinion and if appropriate, the President using his ability to give clemency or pardoning, those are his rights.\n\nAnd so I don't think there's any question and I don't see a rift between the Attorney General and the President. Just the opposite. I see the Attorney General doing what he needs to do and not being afraid to say that the line attorneys and by the way, a very questionable federal judge in Amy Berman Jackson, you might remember, she's the one that gave Eric Holder, an extra two years to slow walk, fast and furious.\n\nI don't blame the President for doing what he's doing which is communicating to American people because they want to hear it now.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, John again, it's just so you - remind everyone what happened here. Roger Stone, the jury foreman, Tomeka Hart who is in the Roger Stone jury called Roger Stone, racist, pre-trial. Called Trump supporters, racist. Likened Trump to the KKK. The foreperson on the jury praised the Mueller investigation and ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Democrat.\n\nNow is there a reason the President should be unhappy about this?\n\nEASTMAN: Yes and in fact she lied in her - to the judge when she said she had no really - hadn't been following the Miller investigation. She had been tweeting about it the whole time. Look, there's another thing aspect of this and that's the gross double standard. President Obama gives a speech, exonerating Hillary Clinton before her Department of Justice lawyers do anything with Hillary Clinton and nobody's talking about that.\n\nTrump tweets out something on a decision that's already going to be made and all of a sudden, it's a new impeachable offense. I mean this is laughable.\n\nINGRAHAM: Now, I don't remember the media getting all bent out of shape when Obama weighed in on a myriad of legal cases.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The police acted stupidly.\n\nIf I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you know about Hillary Clinton's use of private email server?\n\nOBAMA: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: While she was Secretary of State?\n\nOBAMA: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think it posed a national security problem?\n\nOBAMA: I don't think it posed a national security problem.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Remember that Congressman, you were in Congress when Obama was doing all this.\n\nEASTMAN: The double standards.\n\nISSA: Exactly, the double standard and by the way the double standard for Eric Holder. They clearly got away with this, you know Clapper and Comey and plenty of people have lied to Congress and have not been held accountable.\n\nYou know I'm on the campaign trail and everyday people ask me one thing, which is you know, you were effective chairman. You held these people accountable but nothing happened. The fact is under the last administration, they made sure that none of the people who lied to Congress, none of the people who did much worse things were actually prosecuted.\n\nEven Eric Holder who was referred for criminal contempt, the President bailed him out by claiming executive privilege only to later admit that those documents were never privileged documents but that's - that's forgotten by the so-called mainstream media and it's something that President Trump is not going to fail to say in real time because the American people need to hear it in real.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, speaking of which I want to show everybody this. You were talking about Eric Holder, former AG for Obama. This is what he had to say about Barr in a tweet. He said, Do not underestimate the danger of the situation. The political appointees and the DOJ are involving themselves in an appropriate way in cases involving political allies of the President. This affects the rule of law and respect for it. Unprecedented. John.\n\nEASTMAN: Unprecedented except for what he did when he was head of the DOJ. He launched the most political efforts in the Department of Justice in our nation's history. He was cited for contempt of Congress, the first attorney General.\n\nINGRAHAM: Fast and furious.\n\nEASTMAN: Yes. Fast and furious for lying to Congress, for withholding documents without a bases and a privilege and he politicized every aspect of the Department of Justice.\n\nINGRAHAM: Remember when he did his first speech to the employees of the Department of Justice, let's see, a little quiz on the Ingraham Angle. You know what his first speech was to the employees?\n\nEASTMAN: I don't.\n\nINGRAHAM: We're a nation of cowards.\n\nEASTMAN: Oh, that's right.\n\nINGRAHAM: On the issue of race.\n\nEASTMAN: That's right.\n\nINGRAHAM: It was all about race and how the country's initiative - so that's how he introduced himself to the department.\n\nEASTMAN: Right and worse, they got a lot of those guys in his political appointees and then they converted them to career appointees who are still there in the deep state, working against the elected president.\n\nINGRAHAM: Congressman, how concerned are you that some of these same people are still burrowed in at DOJ and in agencies like the National Security Council.\n\nISSA: Well, I'm not just concerned that national security is - it's very clear that people see it. But the DOJ, I'm very concerned. You know, I talked to border patrol agents, rank and file, all the way up to their heads and they're frustrated that they're still being thwarted to do their job by those very people that were left embedded.\n\nYou know, one of the other things that Eric Holder should be remembered for, he came before Congress and asked about being the Chief Law Enforcement. He looked us in the eye and he said I wear two hats and in follow up, it became clear the two hats he wears, one is the chief law enforcement.\n\nThe other is a political appointee of President Obama.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nISSA: That's something that Bill Barr never said and if he had said it, the Senate would have - the Democrats in the Senate would have had a hay day and yet openly, Eric Holder thought he was a political appointee and acted like one.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, all right gentlemen, thank you so much. Great to see both of you tonight and the President today lambasted the lead juror in that case as I mentioned earlier. It looks like she did hide her anti-Trump bias during jury selection in the Roger Stone case.\n\nBut have no fear because the media quickly rode in to her defense.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was so struck by the President going after the foreperson on that jury today because you know, this is someone who has done their civic duty.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You see him interfering today, chastising the jurors in the Roger Stone case.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: His allies are waging a war against the jury itself who convicted Roger Stone.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump has also attacked a Roger Stone juror, that's an American citizen, alleging without evidence, significant biased.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're seeing jury nullification at a presidential level.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Joining me now is former Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. General Whitaker, was Trump justified in being outraged about this juror?\n\nMATT WHITAKER, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL, UNITED STATES: Yes, this is an extraordinary moment and really, I remember when I was U.S. attorney and we'd have trials where there was allegations that jurors--\n\nINGRAHAM: U.S. attorney in Iowa for people who don't know your resume.\n\nWHITAKER: In Des Moines, Iowa. So well-qualified to talk about these issues. Both, have been the Attorney General plus have been a U.S. attorney and what I - what I know is that you know that once a juror is corrupt or has a bias that the whole system falls apart and this - and really you know, I think we should be concerned about jurors and especially here unfortunately in the district of Columbia, where they kind of game the system in and have biases that they aren't willing to admit.\n\nThis person clearly had maybe not prejudged the case but certainly, had a preferred outcome and opinions on the case.\n\nINGRAHAM: Is there any way to go back in and try to - I mean, you are saying it was jury nullification on the part of Trump. Is there any way to go back in and try to overturn this you know, this case at this point? Under just because of the juror?\n\nWHITAKER: Yes, so once the jury has rendered their decision, obviously there's all sorts of procedural things that attach and undoing a jury verdict is now is--\n\nINGRAHAM: No, very hard.\n\nWHITAKER: - is hard but not impossible.\n\nINGRAHAM: The DC circuit. You have to go to the DC circuit.\n\nWHITAKER: There's going to have to be a showing that it was bias and that you know, the outcome - it's harder. It's better to win a trial than to lose a trial and then try to appeal on various theories.\n\nBut - but there is - there is - the system will work and if this you know, person is demonstrated to have had these anti-Trump biases and anti-Stone biases, that can be undone.\n\nINGRAHAM: Just going back to the Bill Bar thing for a moment. I mean, you've known Bill Barr for a long time. I certainly have as well. Are you surprised by the way the media is playing this? I mean Barr - Barr is just like a - he's a no nonsense guy.\n\nHe wants to do the job and get his job done but he's been incredibly supportive of the President's agenda and incredibly phenomenal cabinet secretary over at justice but it's like they're trying to put a wedge in the relationship and President is like I have no problem with this.\n\nWHITAKER: There's no way. The president should and does have full confidence in Bill Barr. He's the perfect person to be Attorney General this time and let's - I mean, this idea that somehow the Attorney General is impotent to insert himself in the most important cases, highest profile cases facing the Department of Justice is just not true.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, don't they work under him?\n\nWHITAKER: Absolutely. They - all of them are.\n\nINGRAHAM: These guys who quit in other words, were they justified - we're quitting because Bill Barr, were they political actors?\n\nWHITAKER: It's been clear from his interview that they had told him, they were going to do quite the opposite and then did exactly what he had said no, let's go another direction or decision had been made and they went the other direction anyway.\n\nThis seems to be a little bit of a - of a setup to cause this exact kerfuffle.\n\nINGRAHAM: Choreographed?\n\nWHITAKER: Yes, very much choreographed and you know, fundamentally, all of their powers derivative from the President and the Attorney General and if the Attorney General was led to believe and says, we should recommend - make this recommendation and they don't, you know, they shouldn't really resign, they should be concerned about being removed because that's a - that's an insubordinate act.\n\nINGRAHAM: I mean, this is article two. The President is the head of the executive branch. I mean this gets lost on a lot of people. It's like these runaway detailees from the CIA or from some other department or one prosecutor gets to run the show.\n\nWHITAKER: And just remember, career doesn't mean nonpartisan. We keep using that as inter-changeable terms and it just is not true.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, Mr. Attorney General, great to see you.\n\nWHITAKER: Good to see you.\n\nINGRAHAM: Always great to see you. And coming up, the Democrat and media establishment seem to be warming to Mike Bloomberg but why won't they tell his full story? Up next, my Angle exposes how the former New York City Mayor has put China's interests perhaps ahead of ours.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: In Bloomberg's China cabinet. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. After I was counting chaos and slim wins for Pete and Bernie in the first two nominating contest and after Biden's campaign collapsed, you can kind of feel things changing in the Democratic Party.\n\nYou can feel it and you can hear it. I'm talking about the murmurs for Mike, the banter for Bloomy.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A big winner last night could be Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bloomberg looks well-positioned now to swoop in.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He wasn't given his money like Donald Trump was. He earned it the old fashioned way.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's done more to reduce violence, not only in his own city but cities across America, more than any single living person.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mike Bloomberg can win this campaign. Donald Trump knows it. He's afraid.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, Bloomberg in a way is everything that they love. Where Trump is a proud nationalist, Bloomberg's a citizen of the world. He's a globalist from Manhattan who is phase by mass abortions but agonizes over the climate.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No matter what you think of climate change that it really has the potential to destroy our world. Which means stopping polluting and all those kinds of things.\n\nIf you want 32 ounces, take two cups to your seed, if you want 64 carry four but our hope is if you only take one, you won't go back.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Oh, this is going to be fun. What's not to like? Well, a lot actually and it's not just that he's bad on guns, bad on immigration, terrible on healthcare and our food choices. Bloomberg's really bad when it comes to our chief economic and military threat.\n\nI'm talking about China. In fact, he can't even bring himself to use the correct words to describe their government.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBLOOMBERG: The communist party wants to stay in power in China and they listen to the public. When the public says, I can't breathe the air, Xi Jinping is not a dictator, he has to satisfy his constituents or he's not going to survive.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's not a dictator?\n\nBLOOMBERG: No, he has to - he has a constituency to answer to. No government survives without the will of the majority of its people.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The idea that the Chinese government is responsive to sort of the democratic expression of fresh air, clean air.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Oh, come on, of course they are.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: That, in and of itself should tell us all, he should never be President. They're responsive, the Chinese government? Oh, not to the people. To the dictatorship, oh OK, that makes it OK.\n\nNow and he said this, remember China was in the midst of a brutal suppressing of the pro-democracy demonstration at Hong Kong and as we were just learning at the time, the true extent of China's vast array of concentration camps for those Uighur Muslims.\n\nBloomberg has been getting increasingly tight with the Chinese for years. He loves their massive market place and they love his money and influence in the United States.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBLOOMBERG: I first met him 15 years ago at a dinner in my house when he was the Mayor of Beijing. Today he is the most influential political figure in China and in the world. Please join me in welcoming the Vice President of China, Wang Qishan.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: He's gushing over China's Vice President. Took place at the New Economy Forum that Bloomberg's company holds every year. Now, guess where they hosted this 2019 conference?\n\nWhy Beijing, of course. Of course. I'm telling you, keep your eye on Bloomberg's business activities in China. They're actually increasing as he's running for President.\n\nDemocrats might not be asking any questions about this but Newt Gingrich sure is.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: What percent of his fortune came from cutting deals with the dictatorship in China? What share of the money he's going to spend to try to buy the presidency actually came from China because of his willingness to be cozy with a dictatorship?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: While China was cheating at trades, stealing our intellectual property and putting American companies out of business, Bloomberg was helping Beijing get richer and more powerful.\n\nThe Washington Post is reporting, Bloomberg while showering praise on the Communist Party leaders whose goodwill is required to play a role in the fast-growing market, led efforts since 2015 to make it easier for U.S. companies to trade in Chinese currency and expanded one of his company's financial indexes which could steer $150 billion into China while earning his firm on undisclosed amount in fees.\n\nOh, my friends we're talking billions and billions of dollars in fees made in communist China and here's a fun little fact, Bloomberg's operations rake in more money each year from China and Hong Kong than all of the businesses of the Trump organization combined that they made in all of 2018.\n\nSo with all this, whom do you think China's rooting for in November? Do they want the current president who's forced them to make concessions on trade, the one who slapped tariffs on them or would they want the guy who will basically give them everything they want?\n\nFollow the tweets from the Mayor's media company for any length of time and you'll see it's constantly pushing a pro-China agenda. They've even been called out for spiking stories critical of Beijing over at Bloomberg. Look at this headline about the coronavirus from last week.\n\nChina sacrifices a province to save the world from coronavirus. And this one. The U.S. charges a leading nanoscientist with lying about his work with the Thousand Talents program. Will China's most brilliant minds balk at coming to America? So you get the idea.\n\nNow, it will be hilarious but not completely surprising if it ends up being Bloomberg versus Trump. Now think about it. Democrats, the self-anointed champions of human rights choosing a pro-China guy as their nominate. They're also supposedly pro-American worker.\n\nSo how would it look to pick a guy who will just end up making it easier for companies here to ship jobs over there? And my goodness, how will it make the squad feel if their party runs one New York billionaire against another billionaire? The answer. Now well.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): It's physically impossible. The whole thing is a joke.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You guys are crazy.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is simply a disruption and a distraction.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: You get the point. They're not going to be happy and that's the Angle. All right, joining me now, Richard Goodstein, Attorney, former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton along with Charlie Hurt, Opinion Editor for The Washington Times and a Fox news contributor.\n\nAll right Richard, if it means beating Trump, will Democrats defend Bloomberg's remarks and business ties to China which are vast?\n\nRICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER ADVISER TO BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON: Yes, so the short answer is of course. That's you know, Democrats are so intent on beating Donald Trump, I think that they would be happy to have Michael Bloomberg and indeed, they're probably thrilled to see in this Quinnipiac poll that I've seen cited repeatedly over the past few days on Fox news, Michael Bloomberg beating Donald Trump by nine points today.\n\nThis is after these best few weeks of Donald Trump's political life.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, stay on track. Stay on track what I'm focused on. The Democrat party has prided itself on being the party of human rights. Divestment in South Africa. They blast Israel with a boycott, divestment deal on college campuses and yet, there is a thought they may embrace this guy who can't even call the Chinese government, a Chinese dictatorship, a communist government system and is cosying up to the dictators over there and to the way that he is.\n\nI mean how does that work Richard? How do you square that?\n\nGOODSTEIN: So I actually agree with something that Newt Gingrich said on that tape that you ran, which is let's see how much business Mike Bloomberg made from China and there's a way to get to the bottom of it.\n\nSame with Donald Trump, release your tax returns. OK? That's how we'll actually know how much is talk and how much is nonsense. And incidentally, running $1 trillion deficits is not exactly the way to get leverage over the Chinese. That's actually helps --\n\nINGRAHAM: So, again, Charlie, I'm trying to just get my head wrapped around this. Michael Bloomberg, who makes billions of dollars in China, is going to be tougher on China than Donald Trump has been? Are you kidding me? These people hated tariffs. They hated his tariffs.\n\nCHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, WASHINGTON TIMES: And that is exactly the point. Whatever investment the Trump companies have had in China, Donald Trump has been tougher on China than any president we have had in three decades.\n\nAnd I'm so grateful to you, Laura, for running that package right there, because it is so important. Not only is it a wonderful precursor to what we are going to see in ads from the Trump against a candidate like Bloomberg, but it is also very important reminder -- and you were one of the few people in the media industry who caught onto this early. One of the most powerful platforms Donald Trump ran on was his opposition to China. He understood what people in regular America thought about China, what they had seen China doing to regular Americans' jobs over the past three decades that politicians in both parties had ignored for decades. And Donald Trump is the first one to call them on it. And we have seen in his first term he is willing to confront them on it. And that right there speaks --\n\nINGRAHAM: Bernie Sanders is pretty good on China. It goes from Marco Rubio to Bernie Sanders. Republicans and Democrats are now waking up to the China threat. This is not some minor issue. The 21st century is either going to be ours or it's going to be China's. No doubt about it. And yet Bloomberg, he can't bring himself to say communist dictatorship. I don't know what you do.\n\nGOODSTEIN: I love the fact that Donald Trump has imposed tens of billions of dollars of taxes, tariffs we'll call them, on American consumers. We know that. That is not disputable.\n\nHURT: By standing up to China?\n\nGOODSTEIN: And ostensibly that is opposing some hardship on China.\n\nHURT: By standing up to China?\n\nGOODSTEIN: And meanwhile, the bailout of our auto industry was a pittance compared to what we have now had to bail out our farmers because Donald Trump has basically imposed these tariffs to make their lives miserable.\n\nHURT: Tariffs for selling goods into our country? I don't think -- that is not a tax on American people. That is actually money coming into the government coffers.\n\nGOODSTEIN: But Chinese imports -- listen, goods coming from China into the United States are being tariffed.\n\nINGRAHAM: Hold on, let's do a little economics. Why aren't we having inflation now then? Where's our inflation? If what you are saying is true, where are all the inflationary pressures on buying in the United States? They're not there. The answer is there is no inflationary tendency in this market right now.\n\nGOODSTEIN: Yes. And the fact of the matter is if the public was so thrilled with the state of the economy, Donald Trump wouldn't be down nine points down to Michael Bloomberg, Republicans would not be minus eight in the generic ballot. Donald Trump would not be under water by --\n\nINGRAHAM: Hillary was up by, what, 15 points nationally?\n\nGOODSTEIN: I agree that polls can be off.\n\nINGRAHAM: Your people were up 15 points, Hillary was up 15 points, and that went down in flames. This will too, as well. But Michael Bloomberg is a crafty person. He's very smart obviously, but this is the quintessential struggle, America versus China. Gentlemen, great conversation.\n\nSpeaking of Mike Bloomberg, fresh off his stop and frisk controversy, he held an event in Houston tonight to woo African-American voters. So what did they think? We sent Dinesh D'Souza inside to find out, and he has the video next. And then Herman Cain responds.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: Mike Bloomberg is making his pitch to African-Americans in Houston, Texas, tonight, and this comes after years old videos resurfacing showing Bloomberg saying un-woke things about stop and frisk and redlining. Bloomberg repudiated these past remarks, but what people at his campaign event tonight, what do they think? We sent conservative author and filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza to find out, and he joins us now. Dinesh, here is a conversation you had with two ladies. Let's watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER: You've heard about Bloomberg and the stop and frisk program. Is that something that bothers you about Mike, or are you OK with Mike's position on stop and frisk?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maybe with good intentions, but you can't implicate policies that are going to ostracize certain populations.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm a mother of a young black boy. I have an eight- year-old son. And ultimately, I don't want him to be judged just by what he has on or the color of his skin. So stop and frisk, do I agree with it? Absolutely not.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: So Dinesh, those ladies were not happy about stop and frisk, but he apologized for it. He went to a church and he did a big mea culpa. And was that the common response tonight?\n\nDINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER: Yes, I think this was a crowd of Democratic activists. There was a kind of skeptical openness to Bloomberg, not real enthusiasm I don't think, but a willingness to hear him out. I think the issues that they are concerned about is hypocrisy, because Bloomberg saying one thing and doing another.\n\nAnd so my send, it was funny, because as I tried to interview people, I realized that half the people there worked for Bloomberg. So one after the other, I work for Bloomberg, I work for Bloomberg. I wouldn't be surprised if a fourth of the audience works for Bloomberg. I couldn't find people who were not on Bloomberg payroll to talk to. And the mood was open-minded, but a little doubtful.\n\nINGRAHAM: Dinesh, is that a Bloomberg pin you have on I'm noticing on your lapel? What is that all about? Is that how you got in there?\n\nD'SOUZA: I don't think I can keep it on much longer because I came here right from the event, but as I walked in, they slapped it on me. Everyone has to have one of these to get in. So this was the price of admission. I don't think it's good for my career for me to keep it on too long.\n\nINGRAHAM: One of the more troubling interactions tonight was about black unemployment numbers. I want to play that. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't believe those numbers are reflective of what is actually happening with the employment situation.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: How does the president combat that disinformation? The economy has never been better for black America, and yet there are people in that audience saying I don't believe those numbers.\n\nD'SOUZA: I think it is just sheer cognitive dissonance, because these are people who have been bombarded with anti-Trump propaganda. And so then when they see Trump at the State of the Union recite this litany of great things one after the other -- a strong economy, an economy that is disproportionately benefiting the working class and African-Americans and other minorities, it's almost as if, how can that be? And so a certain kind of dissonance I think creeps in which you are forced to deny the facts in order to support the hypothesis that you have been force-fed over many, many years.\n\nINGRAHAM: Dinesh, the Quinnipiac poll that just came out, black support in the Democratic primary, Biden is at 27, he's fallen quite a bit, though, Bloomberg is at 22 percent, Sanders, 19, Buttigieg is at four. Poor little Amy is at zero, not sure what is going on there. But does that comport with what you saw tonight? This is after this tape was played, and Trump has been slamming him, but he seems pretty popular among African-Americans according to that poll.\n\nD'SOUZA: The crowd I saw was -- they were all these local -- Houston is a Democratic city. People think because it's Texas, it's got to be conservative. No. It's a Democratic city, and all the Democratic local officials were there. They had rustled up their local audiences. There were like 25 speakers before Bloomberg got to the podium. So this was one of those coming together moments. And Bloomberg has got the money. Maybe there is a feeling that the cash ultimately will deliver the goods with Bloomberg. and I think ultimately Bloomberg may just be the beneficiary of Biden's rapid political hemorrhaging, which seems to be occurring on all fronts.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, Dinesh, thanks so much for going out tonight.\n\nAnd as Bloomberg pitches black voters in Houston, major African-American donors are airing their grievances about the 2020 field. Politico reporting that The Democratic Party's black donor class believes the candidates aren't doing enough to court the black community. I wonder why they are so worried.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There are things we can and should do right away that could deal with black money. I'm sorry, dark money.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: African-American money.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I'm always happy to take black money contributions.\n\nBLOOMBERG: I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little.\n\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Oh, my gosh, that is quite a montage.\n\nJoining me now is Herman Cain, former 2012 GOP presidential candidate, and Scott Bolden, attorney, former chair of the D.C. Democrat Party. Herman, is this an opening for President Trump to woo black voters given these various missteps, some of which you just saw.\n\nHERMAN CAIN (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think it is an opening for president Trump to woo black voters because President Trump is trying to woo the United States of America. The results that this president has been able to achieve have helped all people. That is the difference. The Democrats and the liberals continue to think that there are specific things that they can say or do that's going to woo black voters. The only thing that black voters and brown voters have in common is that they are black and brown. They are not politically aligned. They are not ideologically aligned. They're no monolithic. So to try to put them in a homogeneous group as one group all the time is a mistake. And all you have to do is look at the reputable polls, and you will see that the support for President Trump from black people has grown and grown and grown.\n\nINGRAHAM: Scott, your response?\n\nSCOTT BOLDEN, FORMER D.C. DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIRMAN: I don't think the polls are very credible just based on not just anecdotal, but the mythology that somehow Donald Trump, because of the economy and because of black unemployment at its lowest level is going to translate into votes for Donald Trump. Every poll, Quinnipiac or otherwise, has him in the single digits, and that is not going to change.\n\nWhat's driving black support and black donors not giving isn't because they believe they've been taken for granted. We agree with Republicans that the Democrats take black people for granted and our money for granted. What the reason the money is being held right now is because the number one priority is beating Donald Trump, and none of the Democratic candidates at this point, given how early it is, no one is convinced as to who that nominee is going to be who is going to get Donald Trump one-on-one.\n\nAnd so you're going to have a lot of money held up. I'm a black donor. I sit on the Democratic Business Council. I haven't given to a Democratic presidential candidate yet because ultimately beating Donald Trump and who is that nominee going to be, we are way early on this.\n\nINGRAHAM: You've got to make a decision.\n\nI want to play something that Elizabeth Warren had said going back to this Bloomberg issue where he does this mea culpa for standing up for stop and frisk, and makes comments about disproportionate crime. Then he walks them back, and he's just throwing money into this race, $150 million already spent, going to spend half-a-billion, I guess, on this race. This is what she said about Bloomberg. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Michael Bloomberg is saying, in effect, that the 2008 financial crash was caused because the banks weren't permitted to discriminate against black and brown people.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: It is getting ugly out there, Herman Cain. Warren doesn't have much of a chance at this point, but she is staying in it, and she is going to pick up Bloomberg quite a bit on this race run. Does he have enough money to overcome it?\n\nCAIN: No, he does not have enough money to overcome it. I have said this before and on your show -- many black people have left the Democrat plantation and they are not going back. They are not going to be swayed by Michael Bloomberg having a lot of money to go up against Donald Trump.\n\nAnd I agree with your guest on one thing. Beat Trump, that is not a strategy. The reason that Joe Biden is falling and falling and falling in favor with the base is because they don't have an alternative to the policies that have proven to work so well. And I happen to believe that some of the black people who don't believe these low black unemployment numbers are simply victims of brainwashing by the news and the cable outlets that they watch. So no, I don't buy it. And there are some credible polls out there. Emerson is a credible poll, and Gallup is a credible poll, and they both came up with the same results.\n\nINGRAHAM: We've got to roll, guys.\n\nBOLDEN: Maybe, maybe not. But the bottom line is that black people aren't voting for Donald Trump in numbers. And when we get a Democratic nominee, black people are not going to leave Bloomberg or any of the other potential nominees simply because there is no litmus test on race or stop and frisk. There are no perfect white candidates who address all the African-American issues. They are all flawed.\n\nINGRAHAM: They address the American issues, which is everybody's issues. Health, security, the border, and economic concerns.\n\nBOLDEN: That's true, and beating Trump is the Democratic number one priority.\n\nINGRAHAM: Herman and Scott, great to see you both tonight.\n\nAnd coming up, last weekend a radical leftist plowed his van into supporters for Trump tent registering to vote. And this was in Florida over the weekend, so why isn't the media talking about this? For what reason? We have an update on that story. Plus, yet another act of political violence against Trump supporters. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: Now the latest on that disturbing van attack on a GOP voter registration tent in Jacksonville, Florida, over the weekend. As I predicted, the driver, a man named Gregory Timm, admitted he was motivated by his dislike, his hatred for President Trump.\n\nJoining me now is Dean Black, Duval County GOP chair. Dean, after it was confirmed this was politically motivated, there haven't been any media follow-ups on this story by the big three network, MSNBC and CNN as well. Why do you think that is?\n\nDEAN BLACK, DUVAL COUNTY GOP CHAIRMAN: We know exactly why that is, Laura. Dinesh D'Souza said it a few moments ago. We will call it cognitive dissonance. Clearly, they are biased. Clearly, the mainstream media isn't interested in doing the job of journalism in this country. They would rather point the finger at us when it's their own house that's on fire.\n\nAnd this violence is actually occurring all over the country. This is not just a Jacksonville thing, it's happened up in Maine, there was another incident down south of here. It happens all the time. And they refused to acknowledge it.\n\nINGRAHAM: There was actually another act of political violence in New Hampshire. I don't know if it's being tolerated, and then OK, I can do something and nothing is going to happen to me, or because the media doesn't cover it, but this is just going to keep happening.\n\nBLACK: That's right. And if they don't, like I said the other night, Laura, we are nine months away from the election. People are going to get more and more excited. And right now they have a duty to their profession and to the country to call this out, because this has no place in our electoral system. And no one, thankfully, was injured in Jacksonville.\n\nINGRAHAM: It could've been, Dean. We've got to roll.\n\nBLACK: It could've been.\n\nINGRAHAM: But unbelievable story. Media very dishonest about it.\n\nWhen we come back, the return of the Twitter smackdown.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The American Constitution is sexist by its very design. This country's laws have historically treated us like second class citizens. We still face tremendous barriers to our full participation in society.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: I had to bring back the Twitter smack down of the day after seeing that atrocity tweeted out by Pressley herself. Since facts are inconvenient to the Squad, I thought I would provide them the following facts.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The White House announced Thursday morning that President Biden will sign an executive order rescinding a rule known as the Mexico City policy which prohibits foreign non-governmental organizations from receiving U.S. funding if they promote or perform abortion as a method of family planning.\n\nThe policy, first turned into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1985 and announced at a UN conference in Mexico City, has been repealed by Democratic presidents and reinstated by Republicans for decades. Biden's order will come almost four years to the day since former President Donald Trump signed an order that revived it.\n\nBIDEN TO SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDERS EXPANDING ACCESS, STRENGTHENING OBAMACARE THROUGH SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD\n\nAcross the country and around the world, people -- particularly women, Black, Indigenous and other people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and those with low incomes -- have been denied access to reproductive health care, the White House said in a statement announcing that Biden will protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health care through a presidential memorandum. The memorandum reflects the policy of the Biden-Harris Administration to support women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States, as well as globally.\n\nTrump's 2017 memorandum had revived the policy under President George W. Bush, which prohibited the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from giving money to foreign NGOs that performed or promoted abortion, with exceptions for rape, incest, or when needed to save a life.\n\nBIDEN SEES SHARP PARTISAN DIVIDE OVER PERFORMANCE ONE WEEK INTO PRESIDENCY: POLL\n\nTrump's memo directed the State Department to extend this to all federal departments and agencies. According to a 2020 State Department report, only eight out of 1,340 prime awardees who received funding between May 2017 and September 2018 declined to adhere to the expanded policy.\n\nA new poll from Marist and the Knights of Columbus showed that 58% of Americans oppose or strongly oppose using taxpayer dollars to support abortion. That included a 65% of Independents and 31% of Democrats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe poll indicated some kind of opposition to overseas funding of abortion, asking more broadly: Do you strongly support, support, oppose, or strongly oppose using tax dollars to support abortion in other countries?\n\nA majority of Americans (77%) opposed or strongly opposed that proposition, including 64% who identified as pro-choice.\n\nFox News' Sam Dorman contributed to this report.
Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was among 70 people who had their prison sentences commuted by President Trump early Wednesday, just hours before the end of the president's term in office.\n\nThe commutation had been long sought by Kilpatrick, 50, who has served roughly seven years of a 28-year sentence for public corruption crimes on which he was convicted in 2013.\n\nAs a result of President Trump's decision, Kilpatrick will be released from prison early.\n\nSeventy-three other people, including former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, received pardons from the president.\n\nWhat was his road to commutation?\n\nKilpatrick, a Detroit native and Democrat, was a Michigan state representative from 1997 to 2002 before serving as the mayor of Detroit from 2002 to 2008.\n\nTRUMP PARDONS STEVE BANNON, LIL WAYNE, DOZENS OF OTHERS; ALSO COMMUTES SENTENCES\n\nThe former mayor's downfall began when the Detroit Free Press published text messages between him and his female chief of staff that appeared to show he lied during a police whistleblower trial while denying an affair between the pair. He resigned from office in 2008.\n\nKilpatrick was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison in 2013 after he was convicted of racketeering conspiracy, fraud, extortion, and tax crimes related to shaking down contractors and rewarding his allies. The government called the scheme the Kilpatrick enterprise.\n\nHe has maintained his innocence and been fighting his sentence ever since. However, all of his appeals have failed over the years.\n\nThe 6th Circuit Court of Appeals had denied his original appeal of his conviction and sentence in 2015, according to Detroit's WDIV-TV.\n\nHe filed another motion in 2017 to vacate his prison sentence, which was denied by a district court judge, the station reported.\n\nHe later asked Trump for a presidential pardon and clemency in a blog post back in 2018.\n\nBy God's grace, I have received a pardon from Him, through Christ Jesus. I pray that I will receive the opportunity for Pardon/Clemency from the President of the United States as well, he wrote on the Free Kwame Project website, according to FOX 2 of Detroit.\n\nEX-DETROIT MAYOR KWAME KILPATRICK WILL BE RELEASED FROM PRISON THIS WEEK, SISTER CLAIMS\n\nIn 2019, he was denied again by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, reports said. The U.S. Supreme Court even refused to hear his case, according to the Detroit Free Press.\n\nLast year, rumors spread that he was going to be freed early and allowed to live in home confinement in Georgia, the paper reported.\n\nIn November, Michigan state Rep. Karen Whitsett and family members said Kilpatrick would be released -- after claiming in May that he would be out due to the coronavirus. Both never happened.\n\nIn a February letter to President Trump, the Ebony Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to combating mass incarceration, argued that Kilpatrick's lengthy sentence was not appropriate for his crimes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKilpatrick has been incarcerated at a low-security prison in Louisiana and was originally scheduled to be released in January 2037 before Trump's commutation order was announced early Wednesday.\n\nFox News' Brie Stimson and Louis Casiano contributed to this report.
The Mega Millions lottery is still looking for a winner to claim the second-largest grand prize in the game's history.\n\nThe pot has grown to rarified territory, with the jackpot reaching an estimated $850 million after no winner was declared during Friday's drawing.\n\nMEGA MILLIONS $750M JACKPOT: HERE'S THE TAX HIT\n\nLottery winners can either opt for a cash option -- a one-time, lump-sum payment -- or an annuity paid out over the course of about 30 years.\n\nThe cash option is estimated at about $628.2 million.\n\nNot only does this mark the second-largest prize in the game's history, but it's also the third-largest prize in American lottery history.\n\nTo date, the world-record Powerball jackpot is still $1.586 billion, which was claimed in January 2016.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, the Mega Millions record sits at $1.537 billion, which was claimed two years later in October of 2018.\n\nThe numbers that were drawn Friday night were 3, 11, 12, 38 and 43 as well as the gold Mega Ball of 15.\n\nAlthough no one hit the big jackpot, there were more than 4.6 million winning tickets at all prize levels, officials said. Eight tickets even matched the five white balls and won the game's second prize of $1 million.
Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...\n\n\n\nMigrant caravan member cites Biden's pledge to suspend deportations for 100 days as reason for traveling to US\n\nA migrant traveling with a caravan that left Honduras on Friday told a reporter he was headed to the U.S. because soon-to-be President Joe Biden is giving us 100 days to get to the U.S.\n\nThe migrant, seen in an interview shared by The Hill, did not provide his name but said he was from Roatán, a tourist island off the northern coast of Honduras.\n\n\n\nHe appeared to be citing Biden's pledge to place a 100-day moratorium on deportations – one of several items on his agenda that will reverse some of President Donald Trump's signature policies.\n\n\n\nThe migrant told a reporter he was fleeing a bad situation that was made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, hurricanes, and a president who is not helping the people.\n\nWhen asked what he wanted, the migrant said it was to get to the U.S. because they're having a new president.\n\nHe's gonna help all of us, the migrant said of President-elect Joe Biden. He's giving us 100 days to get to the U.S. to get legal status and get a better life for our kids and family.\n\nBiden has promised a pathway to legal permanent residency for those in the country illegally and a suspension on deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

She said the president had other agendas while in the White House and hopes that one day it becomes known who exactly the president was beholden to and who pulls his strings.\n\n\n\nI would love to see his phone records to see if he was talking to Putin the day the insurgents invaded our Capitol, she said.

Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has accused White House senior adviser and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner of a political hit job by engineering his ouster from Trump's transition team following the 2016 election.\n\nChristie writes in his forthcoming book, Let Me Finish (excerpts of which were published by The Guardian on Tuesday) that while future White House chief strategist Steve Bannon was tasked with informing Christie of his dismissal days after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, Bannon made clear to me that one person and one person only was responsible for the faceless execution that Steve was now attempting to carry out. Jared Kushner, still apparently seething over events that had occurred a decade ago.\n\nThat's a reference to Christie's prosecution of Kushner's father, Charles, while Christie was U.S. attorney for New Jersey in 2005. The elder Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering and served 14 months in federal prison. As part of the plea deal, Charles Kushner admitted recording a sexual encounter between his brother-in-law and a prostitute and sending the tape to his sister in retaliation for what he believed was their cooperation with prosecutors.\n\nHOUSE DEMS TO PROBE IVANKA TRUMP, JARED KUSHNER AND USE OF PERSONAL EMAIL ACCOUNTS\n\nThe kid's been taking an ax to your head with the boss [Trump] ever since I got here, Christie has Bannon telling him.\n\nChristie, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate who endorsed Trump after withdrawing from the race, claims that Kushner pleaded with Trump in Christie's presence not to make him head of the transition team in April 2016.\n\nHe implied I had acted unethically and inappropriately but didn't state one fact to back that up, writes Christie, who says Kushner's ire was based on very raw feelings that had been simmering for a dozen years.\n\nEX-TRUMP AIDE ADMITS HE MADE UP STORY ABOUT CHRIS CHRISTIE BEING SENT TO PICK UP MCDONALD'S\n\nChristie also describes being told by a high-ranking Trump staffer that the candidate's family was very upset about the possibility that Trump might pick Christie as his running mate, a role that ultimately went to then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Christie was also passed over for the posts of attorney general (in favor of then-Sen. Jeff Sessions) and chair of the Republican National Committee (in favor of Ronna McDaniel). Christie is particularly critical of Sessions, whom he describes as not ready for prime time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHaving been denied his choice of administration posts, Christie writes that he turned down offers to be secretary of labor, secretary of homeland security, ambassador to Italy and ambassador to Vatican City. Christie also turned down the role of special assistant to the president in the White House, which he says Trump offered him personally.\n\nLet Me Finish: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics is due out Jan. 29.\n\nClick for more from The Guardian.
Teachers in Los Angeles public schools went on strike last week, holding 500,000 kids and their parents hostage as they demand more money for the lousy job their system does at providing an education.\n\nThe Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) boasts of graduating about 80 percent of students. But only 60 percent of those who graduated actually completed the necessary coursework, reflecting an unfortunate practice of passing students who don't actually make the grade.\n\nIn 2017, only 40 percent of students in the school district met national standards for literacy. Only an abysmal 30 percent met math standards.\n\nIS THE LOS ANGELES TEACHER STRIKE REALLY ABOUT THE KIDS?\n\nWhile the public school system claimed it only spent $12,073 per pupil in 2017, this number excludes the cost of buildings and other depreciable assets. A study noted that were these expenses to be included, the per-pupil cost would more than double the official figure. In other words, the lousy education that Los Angeles public schools provides actually costs taxpayers more than sending students to most private schools. The problem isn't money; it's government incompetence.\n\nNow the teachers' union is demanding still more money even as the number of students instructors have to teach declines. The district has lost 245,000 students over the past fifteen years. As education researcher Lisa Snell of the Reason Foundation noted, even as it was losing students, the number of total LAUSD employees grew by 5 percent over the last five years, primarily thanks to a nearly 16 percent increase in administrators. Snell also found that employee benefit costs increased 110 percent in just the last four years, and the school district's long-term debt liability jumped from $8 billion in 2007 to a whopping $25 billion in 2017.\n\nThat's more government bloat for less education.\n\nThe lousy education that Los Angeles public schools provides actually costs taxpayers more than sending students to most private schools.\n\nTo the extent they are allowed, parents of LA's kids are voting with their feet, opting in ever-larger numbers to send their kids to charter schools. Some 138,000 Los Angeles students now attend charter schools, which deliver unambiguously better results. Naturally, the teachers' union hates this competition. In addition to seeking higher salaries as part of their strike demands, they also want more regulations to stifle the growth of charter schools.\n\nThis presents a conundrum for politicians in Los Angeles, a one-party town in a one-party state dominated by Democrats. Do they stand with parents and taxpayers or with government unions? If history is any guide, they'll side with the government unions.\n\nOverall, the crisis is par for the course in California. Government unions demand ever higher benefits, especially fat pensions that vastly exceed what is available to private sector workers. Politicians who depend on votes and donations from the government unions are all too eager to say yes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat is one reason why California has ended up with government debt that is at least $1.3 trillion and may actually be closer $2.3 trillion. The state's pension liability alone is $1 trillion. Plus California is still racking up new liabilities for pet projects like former Governor Jerry Brown's $100 billion high-speed train to nowhere. The new governor, Gavin Newsome, has promised to provide health care for illegal immigrants, which won't be cheap. And yet with the nation's highest top income tax rate, there are few feasible new sources of revenue.\n\nThe best solution for Los Angeles in this strike would be to emulate New Orleans, which when its public school system failed, decided to convert all its schools to charters. Better still would be vouchers that allow students to attend private schools. Surely anyone who spends five minutes at the DMV or Post Office understands that the private sector does things better than government. Education is no exception. But don't expect common sense to prevail in California.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM CHRISTIAN WHITON
There's a health care reform idea making the rounds and garnering significant attention these days. It is the very plausible sounding Medicare-for-all. Who could argue with expanding a program that America's seniors generally like and indeed have come to rely on? After all, if it's good enough for the grandparents, isn't it good enough for everyone else?\n\nWell, just as not every shiny thing has value when you're panning, this idea truly is fool's gold.\n\nCensus data shows a majority of Americans obtain their health insurance from their employers (56 percent). This is followed by Medicaid (19.3 percent), Medicare (17.2 percent), direct-purchase coverage (16.0 percent), and military coverage (4.8 percent).\n\nTRUMP HAS BROKEN FREE OF OBAMACARE'S GRIP, BUT MORE REFORMS CAN AND MUST BE MADE\n\nIt's important to note that the current Medicare program is not self-sufficient. Payroll taxes collected from workers and employers and all of the premiums paid by those enrolled cover only about half of Medicare's costs. Taxpayers subsidize the rest.\n\nWhen it comes to those with employer-provided health plans, a 2018 survey released by America's Health Insurance Plans shows 71 percent are satisfied with their current coverage. Why then would anyone advocate expanding a program headed for insolvency in 2026 according to the Medicare Board of Trustees, while simultaneously upending the employer provided plans that Americans like?\n\nMedicare-for-all threatens to make the same exact mistake ObamaCare made – expanding health care coverage over controlling health care costs. But think for a moment. Why do millions of Americans, even after years of ObamaCare, still lack health insurance? The answer is simple: It is too expensive.\n\nNumerous experts have estimated the cost of Medicare-for-all, including former Medicare Board of Trustees member Charles Blahous. He estimates the cost to the federal budget at $32.6 trillion. The Urban Institute estimated $32 trillion over10 years as well. Medicare-for-all would double the size of federal government spending. Even a doubling of corporate and individual income taxes would fail to cover its costs.\n\nBut cost is just one issue. Medicare-for-all is mandatory, single-payer national health insurance. There is no opt-out provision, and there are no private health plans, as competition with the government would be illegal. It would replace the Medicare tailored exclusively for seniors with a one-size-fits-all plan that would even wipe out the current and popular Medicare Advantage plans, with enrollees responsible for 20 percent of the cost.\n\nBesides paying more for health care, patients would undoubtedly receive inferior care. Extensive wait times seen in countries like Canada and the U.K. would now be the norm in the U.S. Current wait times in Canada are 47 weeks for neurosurgery, 38 weeks for orthopedic surgery, and 29 weeks for ophthalmology, to name just three.\n\nAnd, with current Medicare payments already 40 percent below private payments, more hospitals would close if this payment scheme were thrust on the entire system. The current physician shortage would worsen as reimbursement rates and pay were capped to control costs. Anyone who ever lived through or read about war time rationing would see a return to the ugly side of an economy of shortages.\n\nMore incremental and market-based approaches are achievable at much less expense, and with the potential to truly control costs, which is the main problem in the U.S. health care system. The Association of Mature American Citizens (AMAC) supports expansion of health savings accounts (HSAs) with their triple tax advantages, more transparency with prescription and medical procedure pricing, and eliminating the middle men when it comes to drug pricing.\n\nAMAC has been a strong advocate of The Good Samaritan Charitable Services Act, which would allow doctors to treat up to 20 patients free of charge (pro bono) in exchange for a small tax deduction (capped at $50). Billions in annual Medicaid costs would be saved, and families would have a doctor/patient relationship rather than using expensive emergency rooms as their primary source of health care.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt's important to have all the facts. Some polls show support for Medicare-for-all. But when those polled are informed of the doubling of taxes required to fund such a scheme, support collapses. No wonder advocates choose not to discuss costs.\n\nJust remember, not everything that is shiny and superficially attractive has value. Or as William Shakespeare put it, All that glitters is not gold.\n\nJeff Szymanski works in political communications for The Association of Mature American Citizens.
On a day when New York's governor did an about-face and embraced mobile sports betting as a way to deal with financial losses stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, a company that tracks gambling legislation and performance predicted that revenue from legal sports betting could reach $3.1 billion in 2021 and as much as $10 billion within five years.\n\nVIXIO GamblingCompliance issued a report Wednesday projecting that at least six and as many as 14 additional states will legalize or expand sports betting in 2021. That fits with projections by numerous analysts that nearly half the country may have legalized sports betting by the end of this year.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe company estimated that revenue from sports betting would reach $2.6 billion to $3.1 billion this year, an increase of as much as 100% over the $1.55 billion it estimates will have been generated from sports betting in 2020 (December figures have not yet been reported from most states).\n\nBy 2025, that figure could hit $10 billion, the report said.\n\nSports betting revenue represents money remaining after sportsbooks pay off winning bets and other expenses. It is separate from — and much less than — the total amount wagered on sports, which is called handle. States collect taxes on the amount of money their sportsbooks retain from sports betting, not on the total amount wagered.\n\nThe report came as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reversed his long-held opposition to mobile sports betting, opening the possibility of a lucrative new market in one of the nation's most populous states. It also could take a big bite out of New Jersey's leading position in the national sports betting market; about 20% of New Jersey's sports bets are placed by New Yorkers crossing the state line.\n\nAt a news conference, the Democratic governor proposed having New York run sports betting operations to maximize tax revenue.\n\nAt a time when New York faces a historic budget deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the current online sports wagering structure incentivizes a large segment of New York residents to travel out of state to make online sports wagers or continue to patronize black markets, he said. New York has the potential to be the largest sports wagering market in the United States, and by legalizing online sports betting, we aim to keep millions of dollars in revenue here at home, which will only strengthen our ability to rebuild from the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nHe called on the New York State Gaming Commission to issue a request for proposals to select and license a sports operator or platform to offer mobile sports wagering in the state.\n\nYaniv Sherman, head of commercial development at 888 Holdings, a sports betting company, welcomed a possible full-scale entrance of New York to the national market.\n\nNew York has always been the critical, strategic and much-anticipated component of any U.S. online gambling agenda, and it represents one of the top three states in terms of economic potential, he said. It's no surprise that this is moving on the back of budget deficits in states like New York, and I think it's a great way of bringing tax dollars from offshore operations to the city and state coffers.\n\nLikewise, Adam Greenblatt, CEO of BetMGM, said his company is eager to enter New York's expanded market, saying Cuomo's move has the potential to bring leaking tax dollars back to New York from offshore books and nearby states.\n\nSara Slane, a gambling analyst and former official with the American Gaming Association, predicted New York quickly would become a top-tier state in the sports betting market.\n\nGov. Cuomo's embrace of mobile sports betting immediately positions New York to soon lead all other states and generate significant revenue for state coffers, she said. New York, with a population of nearly 20 million, dwarfs any other state with legal betting and should have no problem regularly topping $1 billion a month in wagers.\n\nNew York, like most states, expects to have a smoking crater where its budget used to be due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. That is expected to play a large part in additional states considering or enacting sports betting legislation this year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe report predicted an aggressive campaign to legalize online sports betting in Texas this year, with team owners allied with DraftKings, FanDuel and BetMGM to press for legalization. That would require a constitutional amendment and a stateside referendum.\n\nIt forecast renewed legislative efforts to enact sports betting in Massachusetts, Georgia, Ohio and North Carolina, among others, while noting that sports betting efforts in Florida and California remain complicated by the impact they would have on tribal gambling operations and rights.
In its common definition, the job of president of the United States is to deliver peace and prosperity. Donald Trump is doing well on both fronts, so let's impeach the bastard!\n\nAs insane as it sounds, that and only that is what many Democrats have in mind. Impeachment, or death by a thousand investigations, is the heart of their plan.\n\nFor proof, eliminate their desire to remove Trump from office and see if you can pinpoint anything else with broad Dem support. Some advocate for open borders, others for tax hikes or Medicare-for-all, but ending the Trump presidency ASAP is the glue holding the party together.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt unites the leadership with the rank and file, including many of the socialist-leaning newcomers. Its migration from the far-out fringe to a daily talking point among party faithful and their national media lapdogs represents a breathtaking development.\n\nThe implications are staggering — and a potential disaster for America.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING MICHAEL GOODWIN ON THE NEW YORK POST.
A majority of voters support a proposal floated by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to dramatically increase the highest tax rate on the wealthiest Americans to as high as 70 percent.\n\nAround 59 percent of registered voters support the idea, according to a Hill-HarrisX survey, which was conducted Jan. 12-13 after the New York Democrat set off a nationwide debate with her comments on CBS's 60 Minutes that she would support the increase to fund her climate change plan.\n\nThe proposed tax hike would affect those making $10 million or more, she said.\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ QUESTIONS TRUMP'S WEALTH AFTER PRESIDENTIAL SWIPE\n\nThat doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more, Ocasio-Cortez said during the interview.\n\nHARRY REID SWIPES AT OCASIO-CORTEZ TAX HIKE PROPOSAL, SAYING AMERICANS WON'T ACCEPT 'RADICAL CHANGE QUICKLY'\n\nWomen supported the proposal by 62-38 percent and men favored it by 55-45 percent, according to the Hill. Southerners back the concept by a 57 to 43 percent margin and 45 percent of Republican voters also viewed it positively.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDuring the 60 Minutes interview, Ocasio-Cortez referenced tax rates returning to levels seen in the 1950s and 1960s, when the richest Americans were taxed at up to 90 percent.
For the first time in prime time since President Trump took office, all eyes are on the Oval Office.\n\nTrump is preparing to deliver his first-ever evening address from the storied room in the White House's West Wing at 9 p.m. ET, amid a protracted partial government shutdown over funding for his proposed southern border wall, Meanwhile, Democratic leaders have been prepping an immediate response, while top Republican senators made clear they don't know exactly what to expect.\n\nWith the nation's second-longest government shutdown in history entering its 17th day and rhetoric reaching an apparent inflection point, media prognosticators and political analysts on Tuesday raised a series of pivotal but unanswered questions. Will some networks choose not to air Trump's speech in full, or attempt to fact-check his statements live?\n\nAnd will Trump, as he has suggested repeatedly in recented days, announce that he will use his emergency powers to build the wall even without congressional funding?\n\nHow will Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi handle their unusual, nationally televised tandem response to Trump's remarks?\n\nThe White House requested eight minutes to make Trump's case on television. It invited representatives from cable news outlets to a White House lunch with Trump ahead of the address, a gesture that is typically reserved for the lead-up to State of the Union speeches.\n\nRegardless of what transpires, negotiations are slated to continue throughout the week to resolve the shutdown, which has furloughed 380,000 federal workers and forced an additional 420,000 to work without pay. On Wednesday, Fox News learned, Trump will head to Capitol Hill for a policy lunch with Senate Republicans. Congressional leaders from both parties have been invited to the White House for a 3 p.m. ET sit-down afterward.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump plans a personal visit to the Mexican border, where his administration says an illegal immigration crisis is worsening by the day.\n\nThe number of illegal border crossings is down from 1.6 million in 2000 to less than 400,000 last year. But the number of families coming over the border has risen sharply, putting a strain on health care and immigration services that came into sharp focus with the deaths of two migrant children in December. Administration figures show that 161,000 family units crossed the border in fiscal 2018, a remarkable 50 percent increase from the year before. Homeland Security officials have also said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 percent increase.\n\nBORDER CRISIS INTENSIFIES AMID SHUTDOWN: MASSIVE INCREASE IN FAMILY UNITS CROSSED BORDER ILLEGALLY IN 2018\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox News that he doesn't know what Trump will say during his prime-time address. But Graham added that Trump ideally will not use his presidential emergency powers to order the military to construct a border wall, saying that passing a spending bill in Congress is the better way to tackle the issue.\n\nSouth Dakota GOP Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the GOP whip, said he doesn't think the emergency declaration is the right move and that I prefer that we get this resolved the old-fashioned way.\n\nAnd Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-.Ky., who met with Vice President Mike Pencc on Capitol Hill earlier in the day, did not answer when asked by Fox News on Tuesday whether he thought declaring a national emergency would be a good idea. But in a statement and remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell emphasized his support for the White House's aggressive tack.\n\nCAN TRUMP USE EMERGENCY POWERS TO BUILD A BORDER WALL?\n\nIn light of the urgent humanitarian and security crisis on our border, the president is requesting $5.7 billion for physical barriers and border security, McConnell said. For some context, that is just about one tenth of one percent of federal spending. One tenth of one percent -- for physical barriers like the fences and barriers which already exist, which Democrats have previously voted for with enthusiasm.\n\nHouse GOP leaders, after speaking with Pence, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Tuesday, seemed similarly aligned.\n\nGOP Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, reiterated to Fox News that he thinks a congressional compromise -- rather than emergency military spending -- is the best way to build the wall.\n\nAnd House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said the president may take whatever action he needs to fund the wall.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway seemed optimistic, giving a thumbs-up sign to reporters after the meeting.\n\nAfter a sit-down with Democrats over the weekend, the White House issued a series of budget demands, including a new request for $800,000 for humanitarian needs. But mostly Trump still wants his wall, which Democrats describe as immoral as well as no solution to illegal immigration.\n\nIn a pre-emptive move, the White House said Monday that tax refunds would be paid despite the shutdown. That shutdown exemption would break from past practice and could be challenged.\n\nEmphasizing that he's not abandoning his security argument, Trump said in a fundraising email Tuesday: I want to make one thing clear to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi: Your safety is not a political game or a negotiation tactic!\n\nPelosi, for her part, has also sparred openly with the White House. She reportedly engaged in a tense confrontation with Nielsen on Wednesday in the Situation Room, with the California Democrat interrupting Nielsen's presentation on border security and illegal immigration, telling her I reject your facts.\n\nLeaning on Senate Republicans, some of whom are growing anxious about the impact of the shutdown, Pelosi said the House would begin passing individual bills this week to reopen shuttered federal agencies, starting with the Treasury Department to ensure Americans receive their tax refunds.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile Tuesday night promised to be a historic night and a kind of political prime-time prizefight, television viewers who were hoping to have a less political evening still have options.\n\nIf you're looking for anything even remotely worth watching tonight at 9pm EST, I will be folding laundry in my underwear for 8 minutes on Instagram live, porn star Stormy Daniels, whose protracted legal battle with the president has dominated national headlines, wrote Tuesday afternooon on Twitter.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Alex Pappas, Jason Donner, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
In these last hours before the Jan. 5 runoff for the U.S. Senate seats in Georgia, I have only one message.\n\nVote as if America depends on it – because it does.\n\nJan. 5 is the most consequential runoff election in American history.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: MY PREDICTIONS FOR NEXT 10 YEARS — I EXPECT THESE BIG CHANGES\n\nIf Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler win, the Republican majority in the Senate will be empowered to moderate the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris administration. It will be able to stop virtually every radical appointment to government and proposal for legislation.\n\nIf the two radicals, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, win, then Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., will be able, with the help of Vice President Harris (who will serve as president of the Senate), to push through radical appointments and legislation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFurthermore, the difference in service to Georgia communities between Perdue-Loeffler and Warnock-Ossoff is enormous.\n\nWarnock has already proven he will be attentive to radicals and those in the Black community who agree with him (but not those who disagree with him). However, since Warnock describes people who want to cut taxes as baby killers in the tradition of King Herod, it is difficult to see how he can serve the majority of Georgians, who prefer lower taxes to higher taxes.\n\nSimilarly, Warnock is openly, proudly and noisily for abortion on-demand – even in the ninth month – and for tax-paid abortions. It is hard to see how he is going to reach out and work with the millions of Georgians who are pro-life.\n\nOssoff will clearly be focused more on the San Francisco values of Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., than on the issues that matter to Georgia. Ossoff raises far more money in California than in Georgia. It was no accident that he and Warnock had their first joint fundraiser in a restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nIn fact, both Ossoff and Warnock raise the overwhelming bulk of their money from non-Georgians, and they are clearly the candidates of liberals and radicals across the country.\n\nSymbolically, it was revealing when New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at his press conference just before Christmas that he could not finalize his city budget (which is more than $3 billion in deficit for this year alone) until the Georgia Senate races were decided. The mayor is hoping an Ossoff-Warnock victory will open the way for New York City to reach into Georgians' wallets to bail out his bankrupt administration.\n\nMake sure every person you know votes on Jan. 5. To boycott the election is to surrender America's future.\n\nBy contrast, we know from six years of Perdue's hard work that he has helped Georgians across the state. In town after town, there are people, companies and causes that Perdue has helped. He fought to cut taxes for every Georgia family. He voted to strengthen and train – not defund – our police officers. He worked to roll back unnecessary and expensive regulations on Georgia's farmers. And he supported the CARES Act to help Georgia fight the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nSimilarly, it is clear from her first year in office that Loeffler has a clear focus on Georgia. She has been crisscrossing the state helping solve problems and cutting red tape in the federal government to get aid to Georgia communities and businesses. In the Senate, she fought for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which helped return agriculture and manufacturing jobs to Georgia. She has fought against radical pro-abortion proposals. And her work on the Veterans Affairs Committee has helped ensure Georgia's veterans get the health care they deserve – and the training and education they need to succeed after their military service.\n\nBoth Sens. Perdue and Loeffler have clear records of voting conservative and standing firm for the values of more freedom, more jobs, lower taxes and less bureaucracy. Their records are a clear contrast with the Warnock-Ossuf record of radicalism.\n\nThe choice is clear.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMake sure every person you know votes on Jan. 5.

Embattled New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio took aim at the city's wealthiest residents on Thursday, calling for taxes that will redistribute the wealth and fund recovery efforts following the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDe Blasio outlined his revitalization plans during his final State of the City address. The mayor argued that higher taxes on the rich would generate revenue to aid an overhaul of a local economy reeling from the pandemic.\n\nWe're going to work constantly for a fairer economy, and that means we must tax the wealthy and we must redistribute the wealth of this city to those who do the work, de Blasio said in the address. Even during the height of the pandemic, we saw the stock market boom. We saw 120 New York billionaires grow their net worth by $77 billion.\n\nDe Blasio called for wealth distribution even as he faces criticism from local business leaders over his handling of the pandemic. Advocates for New York City's restaurant industry and local small businesses have argued that Democratic leaders imposed strict lockdowns and failed to provide adequate support, contributing to hundreds of closures.\n\nProgressive New York lawmakers, including de Blasio and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have repeatedly called for increased taxes on the rich as a means to aid struggling Americans.\n\nEarlier this month, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned the state could raise taxes to address a historic budget crunch without additional federal aid. An estimated 70,000 net residents left New York City from the start of the pandemic in March until last December, costing an estimated $34 billion in lost income, according to a study from analytics firm Unacast.\n\nDe Blasio said his administration would join the fight for higher taxes for the wealthy and a new billionaire's tax, adding that initiatives would give us the resources that can build a recovery for all of us.\n\nAside from his call for higher taxes on the wealthy, de Blasio detailed the launch of a recovery tax credit for small businesses as well as a loan program for entrepreneurs attempting to recover from the pandemic.\n\nHe touted the success of his Open Restaurants program for outdoor dining, which he said allowed the city to bring those restaurants back and save 100,000 jobs. Indoor dining is currently banned in New York City, though it is expected to restart soon.\n\nThe mayor spoke at length about his plans to combat climate change, arguing that New York City has to lead the way in ending the use of fossil fuels. De Blasio pledged to commit $50 billion in city pension resources toward renewable energy investments over the next 15 years while pulling any remaining funding for fossil fuel companies.\n\nNew York City will add two-way bike lanes to the Brooklyn and Queensboro Bridges, add bike boulevards throughout the five boroughs and open more streets to pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThese are the kinds of changes that allow us to move out of the era of fossil fuels and the era of the automobile and into a green future as part of our commitment to the New York City Green New Deal, de Blasio said.\n\nDe Blasio said New York has set a goal of vaccinating five million city residents by June and of fully reopening schools by September. Additionally, City Hall plans to use federal stimulus funds to create a City Cleanup Corps, which de Blasio likened to a program from former President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program during the Great Depression.\n\nDe Blasio will exit the mayor's office at the end of 2021 due to term limits.
PHILADELPHIA -- Kevin Walter and his wife, Melissa, opened their dream brewhouse in the Callowhill section of Philadelphia less than a year ago. But for the past month they, like other craft brewery owners, have been on edge as the federal government shutdown has turned off the tap for many breweries across the nation.\n\nWithout having our labels approved we can't produce new beer, which means we can't sell new beer, Walter said. And selling new beer is sort of a craft brewers niche, it's what our customers want.\n\nThe shutdown affecting more than 800,000 federal workers has frozen activity for the Treasury Department's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the government entity that regulates alcoholic beverages.\n\nSENATE PANEL RELEASES TEXT OF BILL TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT, INCLUDED WALL MONEY\n\nSo for more than 30 days, Love City Brewing and roughly 7,000 local and independently owned breweries nationwide have been squeezed – new releases have been placed on hold, interstate shipments have been halted and grand openings pushed back.\n\nNew, now, next is what keeps us going, Walter said.\n\nBob Pease, president of the Colorado-based Brewers Association, a not-for-profit trade association, said the industry cannot afford the squeeze.\n\nThe margin of error is so small for these entrepreneurs that the prospect for economic hardship is likely and may be significant during this shutdown, Pease said.\n\nBrewers are increasingly nervous that they will lose money if brewery openings and seasonal beers are delayed much longer in the dispute over President Donald Trump's demand for a taxpayer-funded wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe shutdown that began Dec. 22 pinches primarily craft brewers, which offer wider varieties of beer and selections that change constantly. The biggest brewers are largely unaffected because they already have government approval for their top national brands.\n\nSMALL BUSINESS BEER DISTRIBUTOR LOSES UPWARDS OF $2K/ DAY OVER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nUncertainty is going to cause small and independent breweries to not hire people, cancel seasonal releases, or – even more frightening – lay off workers, said Pease.\n\nAccording to a report by the Brewers Association, small and independent craft brewers account for more than 135,000 jobs in 2017, which is an increase of 6,000 from the previous year. Small and independently owned craft breweries account for 98 percent of all U.S. operating breweries.\n\nPlacing owners like Walter in a bind.\n\nWithout label approval from the treasury department, Love City Brewing can't release new canned beers—a function he said is essential to the business' growth.\n\nIf we can't have a portion of our seasonal product in cans, then it's going to be very difficult for us to compete, Walter said.\n\nThe pain is also being felt across town at Dock Street Brewery in West Philadelphia. A veteran brewhouse known for its outlandish beer formulas, like goat brain-brewed beer that is an ode to the Walking Dead series, has already missed two new launches and may have to reschedule or scrap its entire winter product lineup.\n\nIt's just a shame because it's January and people would maybe like some entertainment to get through the winter, said Marilyn Candeloro, manager of Dock Street Brewery.\n\nCandelora said the formulas have to be approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau before the brewhouse can move forward with new labels.\n\nIt's the artist and the printer who would have made the label, the distributor who would have sold the beer and the consumer who would like to drink it, said Candeloro.\n\nBrewers said that even after the shutdown ends, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau could be saddled with a months-long backlog in approval requests.\n\nSmall business is the backbone of America's economy, and brewers are a part of that backbone, Pease said. So for owners not to be able to innovate and live out their dream due to due to difficulties at the federal level – that is just incredibly frustrating.
Mike The Situation Sorrentino has apparently received quite the bit of fan mail after reporting to prison earlier this week.\n\nThe Jersey Shore alum's wife, Lauren Pesce, reached out to her husband's Twitter followers Thursday, thanking them for their show of support.\n\nAnd part of that support has come through the mail as Sorrentino has received thousands of letters, she tweeted.\n\n'JERSEY SHORE' STAR MIKE 'THE SITUATION' SORRENTINO CELEBRATES CHRISTMAS WITH WIFE BEFORE PRISON\n\nMike would like to thank all of his fans worldwide for the unbelievable outpouring of love & support. We speak everyday & he's doing great, Pesce wrote. He's received thousands of letters, he won't be able to respond to everyone but wanted to express his gratitude to each and everyone of you. Thank you from the both of us; it is truly heartwarming to have this support during this time.\n\nThe reality star was scheduled to report to Otisville Federal Correctional Institution in upstate New York on Tuesday to begin serving an eight-month sentence for tax fraud. He posted details about his mailing address on his Facebook page.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe reality star and his brother, Marc, pleaded guilty last January to similar charges. They were charged in 2014 with tax offenses related to nearly $9 million in income.\n\nSorrentino married Pesce on Nov. 1 ahead of the start of his prison sentence.\n\nFox News' Sasha Savitsky contributed to this report.

We are live from Georgia International Plaza for the battle for\n\nthe Senate.\n\n\n\nTwo runoff races two days from now that will determine the balance of power\n\nin Washington. If both Democrats, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, win,\n\ntheir party will control the House, the Senate, and the White House. If\n\neither Republican Kelly Loeffler or David Perdue is reelected, Mitch\n\nMcConnell would retain control and be able to block much of the Biden\n\nadministration's agenda. A record 3 million Georgians have already cast\n\ntheir votes in these crucial races.\n\n\n\nMeantime, President Trump continues to cast doubt on the legitimacy of\n\nGeorgia's election system after losing the state to Joe Biden. In a moment,\n\nwe'll speak with one of the Republican candidates, incumbent Senator Kelly\n\nLoeffler.\n\n\n\nBut first, to Peter Doocy in Savannah with the closing arguments on the\n\ncampaign trail -- Peter.\n\n\n\nPETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, early voting data shows\n\nRepublicans will need a strong showing north of Atlanta, so that's where\n\nPresident Trump is going tomorrow and Democrats are going to try to run up\n\nthe score in Atlanta, so that's where Joe Biden is going, but first, a\n\nvisit by Kamala Harris here in Savannah.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nOSSOFF: But see, now Georgia has the opportunity to define the next\n\nchapter in American history.\n\n\n\nDOOCY (voice-over): Republican candidates agree, but for different\n\nreasons.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: We're going to show America that Georgia is a red state, we're\n\ngoing to stop socialism and we're going to save this country.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: In one runoff, Republican Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Raphael\n\nWarnock.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Dangerous, radical Raphael Warnock has not answered for\n\ninvestigations into child abuse, domestic abuse.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: Warnock argues recent allegations are irrelevant.\n\n\n\nWARNOCK: Kelly Loeffler doesn't have a case to make for why she should be\n\nsitting in that seat.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: And the other runoff, the Republican David Perdue, is quarantining\n\nafter her close contact with a COVID-19-infected staffer but still accusing\n\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff of hiding transactions with a business linked to China.\n\n\n\nPERDUE: This is a ripening scandal, as we now know. He -- he is involved\n\nwith the communist Chinese party during his primary.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: Ossoff claims David Perdue is the corrupt one.\n\n\n\nOSSOFF: We have two United States senators who, when they learned about\n\nthe threat that COVID-19 posed to their own constituents, their first call\n\nwas to their broker.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nDOOCY (on camera): Campaigns are trying hard to stick with people that\n\nthey come across. For example, yesterday at a campus launch, organizers\n\nsent volunteers away with this chant. Door knock for Warnock, vote your\n\nOss-off -- Bret.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right. Peter Doocy reporting from Savannah -- Peter, thanks.\n\n\n\nJoining me here now, Senator Kelly Loeffler.\n\n\n\nGood morning, Senator. Welcome to FOX News Sunday.\n\n\n\nSEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA): Good morning. Great to be with you, Bret.\n\n\n\nBAIER: We should point out. We invited your opponent, Raphael Warnock, on\n\nas well. He declined.\n\n\n\nThank you for being here.\n\n\n\nIt's a little cold for Atlanta.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: That's okay, it's going to warm up.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yeah, that's right.\n\n\n\nSenator, you've been all over the state since November 3rd. And, you -- we\n\nare now two days from this runoff. As we mentioned, more than 3 million\n\nGeorgians have already voted.\n\n\n\nWhere did you and your team see this race right now?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, Bret, Georgians are fired up. They are ready to get\n\nout and vote on Tuesday because they know the future of the country is on\n\nthe ballot here in Georgia. It's a choice. It's a stark contrast between\n\nthe freedoms, our way of life here in Georgia, or socialism, government\n\ncontrol.\n\n\n\nWe know the agenda of the left because Chuck Schumer told us he was going\n\nto take Georgia and then change America. And we know that radical agenda is\n\nnot just high taxes, open borders, defunding the police, government-run\n\nhealth care. But he has radical candidates in this race, his agents of\n\nchange.\n\n\n\nRadical liberal Raphael Warnock is my opponent. He is someone that would\n\nfundamentally change this country. His values are out of step with Georgia.\n\n\n\nBAIER: We are going to talk about that in a minute.\n\n\n\nAre you worried about Republican turnout because of the current ongoing\n\nchallenge to the election?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, Republicans, Democrats, everyone, they need to know\n\nthat we can trust this process that we are working hard to make sure that\n\nthis is a fair, trusted election. We have 8,000 poll watchers.\n\n\n\nBut from what I've seen as I've crisscrossed the state nonstop over the\n\nlast nine weeks, Georgians are fired up to vote and we've seen that in\n\nearly voting. Three million votes shattering records for previous runoffs\n\nand we know that on Tuesday, just two days away here, we are going to see a\n\nrecord turnout for this runoff election and I'm confident that we will win\n\nif our voters turnout.\n\n\n\nBAIER: This weekend, Senator Ted Cruz campaigned for you. He and ten other\n\nRepublican senators and senators-elect say they will join Senator Josh\n\nHawley in a vote against certifying Electoral College votes if there isn't\n\nan audit of disputed states votes, including this one. Now, you are not on\n\nthat list.\n\n\n\nWhy not?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, I've said from the start, everything is on the table here,\n\nand I'm seriously looking at that. We have to make sure that Georgia and\n\nall of Americans trust our voting process. But my number one objective\n\nright now has to be winning on January 5th so that we can get to the bottom\n\nof what happened in these elections.\n\n\n\nWe know that Democrats will never get to the bottom of it. That's what\n\nwe're fighting here for, and I'm continuing to fight for this president.\n\nHe's fought for us and so we're going to stay on top of that.\n\n\n\nBAIER: So, the president says this election was stolen. In fact, he\n\ntweeted this weekend that because of how the process was done here in\n\nGeorgia, the election, including the Senate run, was, quote, illegal and\n\ninvalid.\n\n\n\nDo you agree with that?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, the president has been very consistent. He came down\n\nto Georgia in December and said you have to get out and vote for David\n\nPerdue and Kelly Loeffler. You have to exercise your right to vote.\n\n\n\nHe's coming back here tomorrow night, to Dalton, Georgia, and he's going to\n\ntell voters the same thing, you have to get out and vote, Georgia, because\n\nthis is too important. The country is on the line. They are counting on us.\n\n\n\nWe won't get a second chance. If we lose this election, we could lose the\n\nfuture of the country because we know Chuck Schumer wants to abolish the\n\nfilibuster, get rid of the Electoral College, have D.C. statehood, raise\n\nour taxes, and the list goes on.\n\n\n\nGeorgians -- that's out of step with Georgia.\n\n\n\nBAIER: But I guess -- and I know you're focused on January 5th, but\n\nJanuary 6th, you have to make that decision. And so, today, can you say\n\nwhether you will certify the Electoral College votes or not, maybe\n\nspecifically from Georgia?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, I'm looking very, very closely at it, and I've been one of\n\nthe first to say, everything is on the table. I'm fighting for this\n\npresident because he's fought for us. He's our president and we are going\n\nto keep making sure that this is a fair election and I'm looking very\n\nclosely at it. But again, none of it matters if I can't win on January 5th.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Right. Well, some of your other Republican colleagues have called\n\nthese overturned election efforts bad for your party, bad for the country.\n\nSenators Romney, Toomey have talked out about it. Senator Toomey releasing\n\na statement about the senator's efforts, Senators Cruz and Hawley.\n\n\n\nThey failed to acknowledge that these allegations have been adjudicated in\n\ncourtrooms across America and were found to be unsupported by evidence. I\n\nacknowledge that this past election, like all elections, had\n\nirregularities, but the evidence is overwhelming that Joe Biden won this\n\nelection.\n\n\n\nIs he right?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, we have every right to take these votes in a way\n\nthat we believe reflects our constituency and our state, and that's what\n\nI'm going to do. I'm going to speak for the people of Georgia.\n\n\n\nBut the worst thing for a party is if David Perdue and I don't win on\n\nTuesday. We have to win because we have to be able to get to that next\n\nstep, to be able to vote our conscience and what is right on January 6th,\n\nand then we have to be able to pursue holding people accountable for how\n\nthese elections were handled.\n\n\n\nBAIER: But have you seen evidence, enough evidence of fraud to overturn\n\nany state's election, as a senator and what you've seen so far?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, certainly, here in Georgia, we have upwards of 200 open\n\ninvestigations. We're in the courts right now. We have heard and seen too\n\nmuch. We need to get to the bottom of it.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBAIER: And, Senator, you know there have been 60-plus court cases that\n\nhave been -- gone before judges, some of them Trump-appointed judges, where\n\nthey haven't found that evidence.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, these cases haven't been heard. They deserve to be heard.\n\nWe need to make sure that we get to the bottom of this because the\n\nintegrity of voting is at the core of our democracy. We have to protect\n\nthat. We have to have people who are willing to fight for it and defend it,\n\nand that's what I'm looking at right now.\n\n\n\nThis is a big decision for the 6th, but I have to stay laser focused on the\n\n5th because if we don't win the 5fth, we will lose the country.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Let's talk about this race, specifically our opponent. On the\n\ncampaign trail when he's pressed about anything that he's -- you know\n\nyou're charging him with, he comes back with pretty much the same attack on\n\nyou. It's very consistent. Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nRAPHALE WARNOCK (D), GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE: When she heard about the\n\ncoronavirus pandemic, she got busy making sure that she protected her own\n\nwealth. She is the wealthiest member of Congress. She dumped $3 million\n\nworth of stock, meanwhile telling you there was nothing to worry about.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right, so your response to that? The direct charge that he says\n\nover and over again on the trail?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, this is a political attack that has been completely\n\ndebunked. It's a left-wing media attack, totally debunked and it's a lie.\n\nThe mainstream media continued to carry it and now they've been embarrassed\n\nbecause it's completely debunked.\n\n\n\nBAIER: So it didn't happen?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Absolutely not, and I've proven that over and over. And, look,\n\nthis is a distraction. This is -- the Democrats don't want to answer for\n\ntheir radical policies to change America.\n\n\n\nThe radical agenda of Raphael Warnock and his own -- his own facts are that\n\nhe's been involved in a child abuse investigation that he obstructed. He\n\nwas arrested for obstructing it. He's been involved in a domestic abuse. He\n\nwon't answer those questions.\n\n\n\nThat's what the mainstream media has refused to focus on. That's why I'm\n\nhaving to raise those types of questions and why has he refused to denounce\n\nMarxism and socialism? He refused to do that in our debate. He's attacked\n\nour police officers, calling them gangsters, thugs, and bullies.\n\n\n\nHe said that you can't serve God and the military. He's praised Fidel\n\nCastro, Karl Marx. And Georgians need to know who he is, because he is out\n\nof step with Georgia's values.\n\n\n\nBAIER: A lot of people look at this race and think President Trump may\n\nhave put you in Senator Perdue in a box first when he threatened to not\n\nsign the COVID stimulus and government funding and then he signed it. Then\n\nby after that demanding or calling for additional direct payments, which he\n\nthen supported, and then by vetoing the national defense bill, which you\n\noriginally supported and voted for.\n\n\n\nWhy didn't you vote on the veto override Friday in the Senate?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I stood with the president 100 percent of the time.\n\nHe's putting America first. He's fought for our men and women in the\n\nmilitary. He restored our strength in our Department of Defense and our\n\nnational security.\n\n\n\nBut, look, I have to be out across the state campaigning to make sure that\n\nGeorgians turn out and vote on January 5th because none of this will matter\n\nif we don't win on the 5th.\n\n\n\nLook, Chuck Schumer has said is going to defund our military by 25 percent.\n\nRaphael Warnock, Jon Ossoff, they would be rubber-stamps for defunding the\n\nmilitary, the police, raising taxes, ushering in government-run health\n\ncare, weakening our Second Amendment rights, opposing or religious freedom.\n\n\n\nThat's all on the ballot here in Georgia, January 5th. That's what I'm\n\nfighting for, is to preserve the future of our country.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Understanding the campaigning is important, if you're saying how\n\nimportant this election is on January 5th, but obviously, Georgia is a big\n\ndefense state, current and former military here, defense business here.\n\n\n\nHow would you have voted had you voted on that veto override?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I voted to support the NDAA. The bill that came out\n\nof conference was very different from what we've been promised. So, I don't\n\nknow. I was here in Georgia working across the state and I will continue to\n\nstand with our men and women in the military.\n\n\n\nRaphael Warnock will not stand for our military. He's attacked them. He\n\nsaid you can't serve God and serve in the military.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Right, but you would have sustained the veto, the president's veto\n\non the NDAA?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Look, what's at stake here is our military and our freedoms.\n\nThose are what's on the ballot right now.\n\n\n\nI'm the daughter and granddaughter of veterans. We're the fifth largest\n\nstate for veterans and active-duty military here in Georgia. I have fought\n\nfor our military and made sure that we get the funding we need and we are\n\ngoing to continue to do that.\n\n\n\nBut if we don't win on January 5th, our military will be defunded and\n\nworse.\n\n\n\nBAIER: I won't belabor it but that's not a yes or no whether you would\n\nsustain the veto or not.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: That's right.\n\n\n\nBAIER: OK, you're not answering that.\n\n\n\nListen, Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat from West Virginia, has said voters\n\nin this runoff should not be scared that Chuck Schumer will get unlimited\n\npower because Manchin, according to him and maybe others, will not vote to\n\nkill the filibuster.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to Senator Manchin and others who are saying that?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, we know what Chuck Schumer said. He's going to take\n\nGeorgia and change America. He's told us exactly what he's going to do.\n\nHe's going to make D.C. a state, would have to go Democrat senators, it\n\nwould be impossible for Republicans to win the majority again, he would\n\nabolish the filibuster and the Electoral College. He'd structurally change\n\nthis country, pack the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nMy opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock, refused to answer questions\n\nabout court packing because we know that he would pack the court with\n\nliberal justices. So it would overturn the Constitution and the rule of\n\nlaw. It would eliminate our religious freedom, free speech, everything\n\nthat's under attack right now by the left.\n\n\n\nSo we know what's at stake here in Georgia. If we lose this election, we\n\nwon't get a second chance.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Senator, as a senator, you deal with a lot of different things.\n\nThis is an issue that's today. Today is the one-year anniversary of the\n\nU.S. killing Iran's most powerful general, the head of Iran's militias\n\ninside Iraq. It appears according to intelligence that Iran proxy forces\n\nare preparing to carry out more attacks on Americans.\n\n\n\nWhat should the response be if that happens?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I have stood with this president, the decisions he's\n\nmade to keep America safe, have done that. He's led peace deals for the\n\nfirst time in decades. He stood with Israel, stood against the dangerous\n\nJCPOA, the Iran deal, that shipped pallets of cash to Iran.\n\n\n\nSo we have to continue to be tough, secure our national defense. That's our\n\nfocus and Americans have seen that. We have been kept safe, thanks to this\n\npresident, and I'll continue to support his actions there.\n\n\n\nBAIER: And again, the president in North Georgia tomorrow.\n\n\n\nSenator, you'll be campaigning and we will be her covering it. Thank you\n\nvery much for your time.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Thank you, Bret.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Well, we will have complete coverage Tuesday night.\n\n\n\nUp next, we'll bring in the Sunday panel to discuss what's at stake in\n\nthese runoffs.\n\n\n\nPlus, as we mentioned, a growing number of Trump allies signing on to\n\ncontest the election results -- as FOX News Sunday continues from the\n\nGeorgia International Plaza in downtown Atlanta.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): You've got 74 million people that feel that, A,\n\nmany of them feel they've been disenfranchised, they feel they've not been\n\nheard, and January 6th is the only opportunity that I've got to speak up\n\nfor my constituents in this process.\n\n\n\nSEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): This is just grossly responsible by Senator\n\nHawley, going and undermining even more about public confidence in our\n\ndemocratic process.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Republican Senator Josh Hawley on his plans to object to\n\ncertification of the Electoral College votes for Joe Biden on Wednesday and\n\nthen Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen's slamming those plans.\n\n\n\nIt's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason\n\nChaffetz. Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for The Wall Street\n\nJournal, and FOX News political analyst Juan Williams.\n\n\n\nJason, let me start with you. This is the joint statement from these GOP\n\nsenators and senators-elect. It says Congress should immediately point and\n\nelectoral commission with full investigatory and fact-finding authority to\n\nconduct an emergency ten-day audit of the election returns in the disputed\n\nstates. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission\n\n'his findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a\n\nchange in their vote if needed.\n\n\n\nYour thoughts on this move?\n\n\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, if they're going to ask\n\nCongress whether or not they're going to certify the results, there's no\n\nreason why members can't go out and express their own personal views on it.\n\nThat's the way we do it in this country. We have these types of debates and\n\nI think there are a lot of people in both the Senate and in the House who\n\nare concerned about it.\n\n\n\nNow, I think it's a futile attempt. I don't think it's going to pass, but I\n\ndon't think we should be afraid of the debate in the discussion, because\n\nthere are anomalies and there are things that need to be investigated and\n\nlooked at. And I have respect what these senators and members in the House\n\nare doing.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yeah, Juan, you know, you heard Senator Loeffler not really answer\n\nwhat side she'll be on as far as that vote comes down. But obviously,\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr before he left his position said he did not see\n\nenough widespread fraud to overturn any vote in any state. But the pressure\n\nis still on Trump allies.\n\n\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Look, let's just take the\n\nvarnish off this, Bret. This is an effort to overturn an election and as\n\nsuch, it is doing tremendous damage to democracy. Senator Pat Toomey, the\n\nRepublican of Pennsylvania, said the essence of democracy is the people\n\nchoosing their leaders and this is an effort to undermine the people's\n\nright to choose their leadership, and they elected Joe Biden.\n\n\n\nThis is, to me, and effort that really comes down -- you know, it's\n\nshocking. You know, Jason Chaffetz says let's put the evidence out there.\n\nWhy not let people express their opinions and investigate? Well, as you\n\npointed out in your interview with Senator Loeffler, 60 courts, more than\n\n90 judges, many of them Trump-appointed judges, have looked at this and\n\nfound that there is no basis for, in fact, challenging any of these\n\nelection results no matter what small anomalies or irregularities might\n\nhave existed.\n\n\n\nNothing that would change the results of the election, but it does\n\nundermine the incoming Biden administration and it does do damage to the\n\ncredibility of our democracy. This is very serious business. If the\n\nDemocrats were doing this, the Republicans would yell treason.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Catherine, thoughts on this and the politics of this?\n\n\n\nCATHERINE LUCEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, Bret. I think you're\n\nabsolutely right that for a lot of senators, this really has -- and House\n\nmembers -- this has become a political moment as much as anything else.\n\nWhat we are hearing from sources on the Hill is that a lot of these members\n\nare feeling tremendous pressure from their districts, from their\n\nconstituents, from local elected officials that they need to be, you know,\n\ntaking a stand and defending the president and we know the president has\n\nbeen very vocal about his frustration with the outcome, about wanting\n\npeople to challenge it publicly, his frustration with the outcomes in the\n\ncourts.\n\n\n\nAnd so, they are feeling like they need to -- and this is -- this is sort\n\nof turning into a litmus test for your defense for the president and you're\n\nseeing people make calculations around their midterm elections if they are\n\nup then and well as people who are looking ahead to potential runs in 2024\n\nand how this might play for them then.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Jason, you said it's going to be futile and, you know, the votes\n\neventually, they could have a long debate on the floor, but January 6th\n\neventually is going to lead to inauguration on January 20th. As it's\n\nwritten right now, the president doesn't seem to be tweeting that.\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: Well, again, I do believe it's futile. I don't think it will go\n\nthere, but I think the nation, having a debate -- because there are\n\nmillions of people who do not believe that the process ultimately was fair\n\nand honorable in the way it was discharged, and so why can't they express\n\nthat? Why can't we have that debate in this country?\n\n\n\nI don't like the idea that they want to just shut down the debate and say,\n\nyou know, just go exactly the way you're supposed to go. It's okay for us\n\nas a nation for a few hours to have this debate. Ultimately I don't think\n\nit will pass.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Well -- here's what Senators Romney and Toomey and others are\n\nsaying and you just heard it from Juan, is that the way to debate this is\n\nin court and the Trump campaign tried in more than 60 courts to do this and\n\nthe substance of it even in front of Trump judges never lead to any one\n\njudge saying there was enough evidence to overturn that state's votes.\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: But there is a reason why -- this question goes before Congress\n\nand that's part of the -- this is what's amazing about the United States of\n\nAmerica. It's what separates him from all the other nations on the Earth.\n\nThey actually posed this question to Congress.\n\n\n\nAnd so, each member gets to vote how they want to vote and if they want to\n\nobject, they can object. That's how we do things in this country. It's not\n\njust the courts that decide this. Congress has a role in this as well.\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right. So, Juan, for Trump supporter's who say, listen, we do\n\nthink that there is something fishy here, how politically are Republicans\n\ngoing to keep all of them ahead of this Georgia runoff on the 5th and to\n\ncome out and vote and what they consider really a crucial moment for the\n\nparty?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: I guess it's just got to be loyalty to President Trump at this\n\njuncture and it's ironic that the president over the weekend as you\n\nmentioned earlier has said he considers this election illegal and invalid.\n\n\n\nWell, if that's the case, why bother to vote? Why support, you know, sort\n\nof an extra-legal corrupt exercise? Why would anybody go out and vote? I\n\ndon't get it.\n\n\n\nBut he's going there tomorrow to campaign and I guess you just have to say\n\nas we heard in your interview with Senator Loeffler, she is just loyal to\n\nPresident Trump. She doesn't have her own agenda. She didn't lay out any\n\nagenda with regard to any issue. Back and forth with regard to the stimulus\n\nspending, not willing to answer with regard to supporting the president's\n\nveto of the defense appropriation, which was overridden by her fellow\n\nRepublicans.\n\n\n\nSo, it's just about Trump at this juncture and I think that when we look at\n\nthe effort that's going to take place in the Senate, again, it's about\n\nRepublicans who are early entries into the 2024 GOP primary. I don't think\n\nthose people are loyal to Trump, obviously, because they are preparing to\n\nchallenge him in 2024, but they are making a play for the base that you're\n\ntalking about, Bret, and saying to that base I'll buy into the conspiracy\n\ntheories, I'll support your doubts and your cynicism about American\n\npolitics when it doesn't go our way.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yeah, Senators Loeffler and Perdue are hoping the president can\n\ntake those supporters across the finish line for the 5th.\n\n\n\nPanel, stand by if you would. We'll see a little bit later in the show.\n\n\n\nComing up, we talked to Hakeem Jeffries with the Democratic caucus about\n\nwhat the next Congress will look like and Speaker Pelosi's chances.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Coming up, debate over increased stimulus checks makes for strange\n\nbedfellows.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Trump is right in saying that's not enough. We\n\nneed to go to $2,000. I didn't say he was visionary. He's right on this\n\nissue.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: We'll ask Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries where the relief\n\nchecks stand next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We're back now in Atlanta.\n\n\n\nThis afternoon in Washington, the 117th Congress gets sworn in and\n\nlawmakers in the House will elect their new speaker. Nancy Pelosi, who has\n\nserved 17 years as the Democrat's leader, is running unopposed, but her\n\npath to victory is a narrow one.\n\n\n\nJoining us now from D.C., one of the top Democrats in the house, Hakeem\n\nJeffries.\n\n\n\nCongressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\n\n\n\nREP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY) Good morning. Happy New Year.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yes, Happy New Year to you.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to voters here in Georgia who say, listen, we think divided\n\ngovernment works better. And, frankly, they say they're scared of a senator\n\n-- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, your party controlling all the\n\nHouse, Senate, and the White House, and progressives having control of the\n\nlegislative agenda? What do you say to those voters?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, those very same Georgia voters saw fit to elect Joe Biden\n\nis the next president of the United States of America, believing that he\n\nhas the heart and the experience and the compassion and the empathy to\n\naddress the challenges that are facing everyday Americans.\n\n\n\nJoe Biden will be the leader of the Democratic Party. More importantly, as\n\nthe next president of the United States, Joe Biden, as he has indicated, is\n\ngoing to be the president for all Americans, both those who voted for him\n\nand those who didn't.\n\n\n\nAnd here in the House, we look forward to working closely with him, as well\n\nas Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans to get things done on behalf of\n\nthe American people.\n\n\n\nBAIER: As I mentioned at the top, Speaker Pelosi is running unopposed for\n\nthat speakership, but how many votes in the House do you think Nancy Pelosi\n\nwill lose?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the United States\n\nHouse of Representatives and I look forward to placing her name into\n\nnomination as part of my responsibilities as chair of the House Democratic\n\nCaucus. There is incredible enthusiasm for Speaker Pelosi because she's\n\ndone the work and she's been an historic, legendary legislative leader\n\nthrough incredibly turbulent times. We've been through a lot of trials and\n\ntribulations as Americans. Nancy Pelosi, as speaker of the House, has\n\nhelped to guide us through that and we look forward to her continuing in\n\nthat capacity.\n\n\n\nBAIER: You said Joe Biden is going to be the leader of the party, but how\n\ndoes Nancy Pelosi control the left part of your caucus, the progressives,\n\nand steer legislation through the House with a much more narrow path\n\nbecause of the votes that you have?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, we are a very big family in terms of the House Democratic\n\nCaucus. We are a diverse family. We're an enthusiastic family. We believe\n\nin the House that our charge is to reflect the hopes, the dreams, the\n\naspirations, the passions of the American people that's consistent with the\n\nUnited States Constitution. And Speaker Pelosi understands that a big tent\n\napproach to getting things done on behalf of the American people is\n\nincredibly important.\n\n\n\nWe've taken that approach, not just internally, but externally over the\n\nlast several years. We've worked closely with President Trump on issues\n\nlike criminal justice reform, with the passage of the historic First Step\n\nAct. We worked closely with President Trump with respect to the United\n\nStates Mexico Canada trade agreement, which was an historic trade agreement\n\nthat protected good paying American jobs. We worked closely with President\n\nTrump to end the practice of surprise billing on behalf of the American\n\npeople and we continue to stand with President Trump, for instance, as he\n\npushes for $2,000 direct stimulus payments.\n\n\n\nAnd so we're always going to govern, not in a partisan way, but in a\n\npractical way that gets things done on behalf of the American people. That\n\napplies to the House Democratic Caucus. That applies to the House. That\n\napplies to the Senate. That applies to the presidency, whether it's a\n\nRepublican or a Democrat.\n\n\n\nBAIER: It's interesting that you point out all of the things that you --\n\nthe House worked with President Trump. There is also a new rules package\n\nfor the new Congress and in it Democrats widen their subpoena and\n\ninvestigative powers, essentially forecasting that this is going to lead to\n\n-- there's also a rules change about gender-neutral terms, he or she\n\nwould become member or delegate or resident commissioner. Father\n\nand mother would become parent, while brother and sister would\n\nbecome sibling.\n\n\n\nAre these the things that are the priority going after the Trump\n\nadministration in investigations and changing the way people talk about\n\ngender-neutral terms?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, the top priority of House Democrats is going to be to crush\n\nthe virus, continue to provide direct assistance to everyday Americans who\n\nare struggling and ultimately supercharge our economy for the good of\n\neveryone. I know that will be a priority of President Biden in his first\n\n100 days. That will continue to be our focus.\n\n\n\nThis is a once in a century pandemic. It requires a once in a century\n\ncontinuing, comprehensive and compassionate congressional response. And so\n\nthat's going to be our focus as we move forward. That has been our focus\n\nover the last year, and that continues until we can put this deadly\n\npandemic behind us.\n\n\n\nBAIER: OK. Then why expand the subpoena investigative powers?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, the House is a separate and co-equal branch of government\n\nat the end of the day. We don't work for any president, whether that's a\n\nDemocrat or a Republican, whether it's Donald Trump or Joe Biden. And we\n\nhave a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance on any\n\nexecutive branch.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't interpret any change in rules as an effort to look backward with\n\nrespect to Donald Trump's presidency.\n\n\n\nWhen we felt it was the right thing to do, consistent with our\n\nconstitutional responsibilities to hold this president accountable, we took\n\nthat step. But as we move forward, I think our concern is going to be\n\nfocused on kitchen table, pocketbook issues, dealing with the health care\n\nchallenges of the American people, making sure that we can bring good\n\npaying jobs, prosperity in every single zip code I think should be our\n\nguiding principle. And, of course, working closely with Joe Biden and\n\nKamala Harris to build back better for the people.\n\n\n\nBAIER: And then the rule about changing -- imposing more gender-neutral\n\nlanguage, I guess critics would say that this is not the message from the\n\nelection. Democrats lost a number of seats that they were thinking they\n\nwere going to win. Traditionally, you know, there would be critics that say\n\nthey're -- Democrats are too focused on political correctness and that this\n\nis an example of that. How would you respond to that?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: This is just an example of making sure that we are as inclusive\n\nas possible. You know, the framers of the Constitution envisioned the House\n\nat the institution that was the closest to the people and, in their words,\n\nthat would reflect the passions of the American people. It's the reason why\n\nwe have two-year terms as opposed to four years of the presidency, six\n\nyears in the Senate, life tenure for the Supreme Court. And so I think that\n\nthe rules should reflect our values as an institution that is the most\n\ninclusive as possible, that reflects the gorgeous mosaic in every possible\n\nway of the American people.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Speaker Pelosi, you mentioned the stimulus checks and the direct\n\npayment. She has characterized direct payments to Americans different ways,\n\nbeginning with the direct payments from the Trump tax cuts, then the\n\nnegotiated stimulus deal that she negotiated at first and then this new\n\neffort to get more direct payments.\n\n\n\nTake a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): In terms of the bonus that corporate America\n\nreceived versus the crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put\n\nthe schmooze on is so pathetic.\n\n\n\nI would like them to have been bigger, but they are significant and they\n\nwill be going out soon.\n\n\n\nWho is holding up that distribution to the American people? Mitch McConnell\n\nand the Senate Republicans.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Congressman, there's a lot to digest there. The $1,000 direct\n\npayment was crumbs. $600 was significant. And then the $2,000 was being\n\nheld up by the Senate. But she negotiated with Secretary Mnuchin and\n\nSenator McConnell for that original stimulus deal.\n\n\n\nSo people looking at that scratch their heads.\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: The most important thing that Speaker Pelosi indicated is that\n\nMitch McConnell is holding up direct payment checks that are more robust to\n\nthe American people. We agree with President Trump. Republicans in the\n\nHouse of Representatives agree that we should increase those direct\n\npayments to $2,000 per American because the American people are hurting in\n\na tremendous way.\n\n\n\nNow, when it comes to the tax cuts from 2017, we all, on the Democratic\n\nside, had a big problem with that because we went into $2 trillion worth of\n\ndebt for tax cuts were 83 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1\n\npercent, to the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected. That was not\n\ngood public policy in my humble opinion.\n\n\n\nI think, at the current moment, what we need to do is make sure that we're\n\nproviding relief to middle-class Americans, to those who aspire to be part\n\nof the middle class, to working families, to the poor and the sick and the\n\nafflicted, those who have been impacted the most by this pandemic. That's\n\nwhat we're trying to do. And we're asking Mitch McConnell to join the\n\nAmerican people, join President Trump, join House Democrats and many House\n\nRepublicans in getting this done.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Congressman, thank you for your time. Thanks for joining us on this\n\nholiday weekend. Happy New Year.\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Thank you. Happy New Year, again, to you and your viewers.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Up next, we'll discuss how the incoming Congress will work with the\n\nBiden administration when the panel returns as we count down to the\n\ncritical Georgia runoffs from Atlanta.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. JIM INHOFE (R-OK): People are talking about the Democrats and\n\nRepublicans don't do things together. This has been an example of what can\n\nhappen in government.\n\n\n\nSEN. JACK REED (D-RI): We provide for the support of our service men and\n\nwomen and their families. Think about them and their families and you'll\n\nappreciate, I think, more of what they do every day.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Senate Armed Services Chair James Inhofe and Ranking Member Jack\n\nReed on the New Year's Day override of President Trump's veto of the\n\ndefense spending bill.\n\n\n\nAnd we're back with our panel.\n\n\n\nCatherine, that veto override was a moment of bipartisanship. We heard\n\nSenator Loeffler not really answer that question, what she would do about\n\nthat vote. Neither Loeffler or Perdue voted for that veto override.\n\n\n\nAs you look to Georgia, how significant is that, or is it more about\n\ncontrol of the U.S. Senate and how that plays here?\n\n\n\nCATHERINE LUCEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, it was interesting, Bret,\n\nhow senator Loeffler was very careful to avoid that question. She,\n\nobviously, is focused on the runoff and the fact that they need President\n\nTrump to come and help them get voters out for Election Day. Republicans\n\nknow that they're at a deficit in early voting and they really need a huge\n\nturnout for Election Day.\n\n\n\nI think a thing to think about also with that override is obviously it was\n\na notable moment in President Trump's tenure. It's the first time we've\n\nseen that. And it does speak to the fact that even as, you know, a lot of\n\nsenators are lining up to support his efforts to, you know, contest the\n\nelection results and are, you know, a growing number are looking to do\n\nthat, that there are still moments in which his party is prepared to buck\n\nhim. And this -- obviously, this is a long-standing, you know, bipartisan\n\npiece of legislation. They take a lot of pride in. They're very concerned\n\nabout support for the military and this was one of those moments.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Jason, depending on how Tuesday comes out here and control of the\n\nSenate, either way we're going to see Washington operate differently after\n\nJanuary 20th.\n\n\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN (R-UT) AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes,\n\nthe margins are so razor-thin, both in the Senate -- you have one or two\n\nsenators going one direction or another. That changes the equation. And\n\neven in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi has the run of her life\n\nto run the gauntlet today. I don't know that she can actually get there,\n\nbut she probably will. History shows that she pulls that off. But every\n\nsingle vote is going to come down to four or five people to sway that and\n\nreally be in a power position to try to negotiate something else.\n\n\n\nI think Washington's going to have a very difficult time moving legislation\n\nif the Senate goes to the Republicans' hands. That's the best conservative\n\nmove we can have is to elect the two Republican senators in Georgia.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Does that suggest, Jason, that if you were still in Congress, that\n\nthere would be -- you would try to make an effort to work with moderates to\n\nget legislation through if you're dealing with the Biden administration? I\n\nmean is -- is that what we're going to see, a kind of a rise of the\n\nmoderates?\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: If there were any moderates left. I think most of the moderates\n\nactually lost. I think the progressive far radical left side of the party\n\nhas taken that over. I think the AOCs, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the\n\nsquad, and more left-leaning members have really got Nancy Pelosi over the\n\nbarrel. I think you're going to see the House of Representatives, under\n\nNancy Pelosi, further to the left than we've ever seen.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Juan, paint the picture of the two different results of Tuesday and\n\nhow Washington operates if the Republicans hold on and win one of the two\n\nand McConnell stays Senate majority leader or if Democrats pick up two and\n\nits Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think that Mitch\n\nMcConnell is a shrewd tactician, Bret, and his goal will be to block much\n\nof what Joe Biden and the Democrats, especially as they paint it, you know,\n\nthese radical Democrats want to do. So if -- if McConnell maintains hold of\n\nthe gavel as the Senate majority leader, look for that. I think he may have\n\nto make some concessions, as you were suggesting, dealing with moderates\n\nbecause his margins are smaller.\n\n\n\nOn the House side, I think that's also the case.\n\n\n\nNow, you know, Nancy Pelosi, we were talking earlier about whether or not\n\nshe'll be the next speaker. I think the only question today is whether or\n\nnot enough Democrats are able to come in a day early to vote for her. But\n\nshe has proven to be very tough, able to go toe-to-toe with McConnell, even\n\nwith Trump, and I think hold that caucus together, which also will be a\n\nvery slim Democratic majority, much as McConnell will have a slimmer\n\nRepublican majority in the Senate.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yes, Catherine, I mean that's a key point. In the House it's going\n\nto be tight for any -- really any piece of legislation. Four members\n\nshifting could change the dynamic for the majority.\n\n\n\nLUCEY: That's right. It's very tight. And I think a look to, as we move\n\nforward is, you know, for the president-elect, Joe Biden really ran on the\n\nidea that he's someone who understands The Hill, he can work there, he has\n\nrelationships, you know, on both sides of the aisle. He and Pelosi go back\n\na very long way.\n\n\n\nBut he's also laid out an ambitious agenda of things he would like to do,\n\nyou know, around climate change, around immigration, around tax cuts -- you\n\nknow, taxes. So how he's going to do that with these narrow majorities and\n\nparticularly if they do not win back the majority in the Senate, it remains\n\nto be seen.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yes,\n\n\n\nAnd, finally, Jason, what do you think Tuesday comes down to here?\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: Turn out. I don't think there's anybody that's undecided. I think\n\nRepublicans have given a mixed message. Hey, the system is corrupt, but get\n\nout and vote. Donald Trump has got to deliver on Monday night. Republicans\n\nhave to show up. If Republicans show up, I think they will win and the --\n\nthe wildcard in all this are the libertarians. One hundred thousand\n\nlibertarians in the presidential election, which direction do they go? Do\n\nthey show up and vote? Voter turnout is everything.\n\n\n\nBAIER: But does the disaffected election challenge voter not show up\n\nbecause they're angry?\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: I think that's the big threat. I think that's the mixed message.\n\nI think that's been the unfortunate part of the message coming out. You've\n\neven had key Trump supporter is going out there and saying don't vote. But\n\nthat's the exact opposite of what needs to happen. It's one of the big\n\nconcerns. It has been a mixed message, but people need to get out and vote.\n\nEvery vote will count. It's going to be a razor-thin margin one way or the\n\nother.\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right, panel, thank you. We'll cover it all. We'll see you next\n\nSunday.\n\n\n\nUp next, our Power Player of the Week. Alan Alda played a wise guy on the\n\nTV series M*A*S*H. Now he's sharing some wisdom in a fascinating second\n\nact.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Well, he brought laughter to generations as Hawkeye Pierce on the TV\n\nclassic M*A*S*H.

It's past time for the media to begin asking President Obama tough questions about the IRS conservative targeting scandal. After all he was involved, publicly, from the beginning.\n\nLast Friday, the American Center for Law and Justice (where I serve as Chief Counsel) filed its Second Amended Complaint against the United States, the IRS, and a legion of IRS officials. This Complaint, in which we represent 41 organizations in 22 states, presents perhaps the most complete story yet of the IRS conservative targeting scandal.\n\nAnd it is an ugly story indeed.\n\nWhat was sold to the American public as a low-level scandal perpetrated by a few rogue employees – a scandal stopped after senior officials became aware and asserted control – is now (to borrow a Watergate phrase) no longer operative.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nInstead, we detail a long-running assault on the Tea Party, beginning shortly after its emergence in 2009, that is empowered, encouraged, and orchestrated not only by senior IRS officials in Washington, but also through outright targeting by the White House, Congressional Democrats, and the mainstream media.\n\nIn fact, the IRS was doing little more than focusing its attention exactly where the president of the United States told it to focus – on the groups the president himself identified as a threat to democracy.\n\nConsider President Obama's aggressive public statements – made just as we now know senior IRS officials were intentionally and aggressively scrutinizing conservative groups' applications for tax exemption.\n\nOn August 9, 2010 the president warned of attack ads run by shadowy groups with harmless-sounding names during his weekly radio address. The President said: We don't know who's behind these ads and we don't know who's paying for them . . . you don't know if it's a foreign controlled corporation. ... The only people who don't want to disclose the truth are people with something to hide.\n\nOn September 16, 2010, President Obama once again warned that some unidentified foreign-controlled entity could be providing millions of dollars for attack ads. Less than one week later, he complained that nobody knows the identities of the individuals who support conservative groups.\n\nOn September 22, 2010, President Obama warned of groups opposing his policies pos[ing] as non-for-profit social and welfare trade groups and he claimed such groups were guided by seasoned Republican political operatives and potentially supported by some unidentified foreign controlled entity.\n\nOn October 14, 2010, President Obama called organizations with benign sounding names a problem for democracy; the next week he complained about individuals who hide behind those front groups, called such groups a threat to our democracy, and claimed such groups were engaged in unsupervised spending.\n\nNext, consider the IRS's actions following those statements. Not only did the IRS continue its targeting, it issued broad questionnaires that made unconstitutionally-intrusive inquiries designed to get answers to exactly the questions President Obama posed.\n\nWho are your donors?\n\nWhat is the political activity of your family and associates?\n\nWhat are the passwords for your websites?\n\nAfter all, according to the president, you're only afraid to answer these questions if you've got something to hide.\n\nThe demagoguery is breathtaking. Not only does he raise the wholly-unsubstantiated possibility of shadowy foreign involvement in the Tea Party groups, a charge incredible on its face, but he goes the extra mile of calling such groups, a threat to our democracy.\n\nWhen the president of the United States declares these groups a threat to our democracy is it any surprise that his enthusiastic supporters (and donors) within the IRS responded with an unprecedented campaign of selective targeting, intimidation, and governmental intrusion?\n\nOne grows weary of stating the obvious, but if President Bush had declared a specific category of citizen groups a threat to democracy potentially run by political operatives or foreign-controlled, and the IRS launched an unprecedented campaign of targeting and intrusive questioning, the mainstream media would have been relentless not only in its independent investigations but in its calls for accountability – at the highest levels.\n\nWas the president of the United States involved in the IRS scandal? He was the one who identified the targets – in the most public manner possible.\n\nA president singling out citizens groups for targeting and intrusive questioning merely because he dislikes their message and fears their political influence?\n\nNow that is a threat to democracy.

ROBYN BECK/Getty Images Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, right, did not get a chance to litigate his criticism of former Vice President Joe Biden's Social Security record at a debate this past Tuesday.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is finally firing back at Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' depiction of him as a longtime proponent of Social Security cuts, following a Tuesday debate in Des Moines, Iowa, that omitted the issue entirely.\n\nBut in seeking to reassure voters about his commitment to protecting Social Security, Biden is mischaracterizing Sanders' tactics.\n\nBiden inaccurately claimed on Saturday that a video circulated by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign had been doctored to make him seem more supportive of Social Security cuts than he really is.\n\nThe Sanders campaign has circulated video of part of a speech Biden delivered to the Brookings Institution in April 2018 in which he discusses his views about Social Security and appears to credit then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) for zeroing in on the program's financial problems. Below is a version of the clip that Sanders advisor Warren Gunnels shared.\n\nEver since Paul Ryan 1st proposed paying for Trump's tax breaks to the top 1% by cutting Social Security & Medicare, I've been proud to be by @BernieSanders side fighting against it.\n\n\n\nTo hear Biden say Ryan was correct to go after Social Security & Medicare is soul-wrenching. https://t.co/kfZz9qlqJd — Warren Gunnels (@GunnelsWarren) January 2, 2020\n\nHere is the clip with more context. Watch the full speech at C-SPAN.\n\nSanders adviser David Sirota has also referenced the speech in the Jan. 7 edition of his email newsletter, Bern Notice, claiming that Biden had lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare.\n\nPaul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code. What's the first thing he decided we had to go after? Social Security and Medicare, Biden said at the time. That's the only way you can find room to pay for it.\n\nWe need a pro-growth, progressive tax code that treats workers as job creators, as well, not just investors; that gets rid of un-protective loopholes like stepped-up basis; and it raises enough revenue to make sure that the Social Security and Medicare can stay, it still needs adjustments, but can stay; and pay for the things we all acknowledge will grow the country, he added.\n\nA voter asked Biden at a campaign event in Indianola, Iowa, on Saturday about claims she had heard in phone calls that Biden supports Social Security cuts.\n\nPolitifacts [sic] looked at it and they doctored the photo, they doctored the piece and it's acknowledged that it's a fake, Biden responded. What we're doing is we're putting out what the actual exchange between [former House Speaker] Paul Ryan and I were. And I have been a gigantic supporter of Social Security from the beginning.\n\nThe fact-checking site PolitiFact indeed rated Sirota's claims in his newsletter false, because Sirota omitted some words from Biden's speech to Brookings. Sirota, and a video that PolitiFact does not directly address, do not include Biden's insistence that a progressive tax code must raise enough revenue to make sure that the Social Security and Medicare can stay though those programs still needs adjustments.\n\nBut doctoring a video such that it could be considered a fake, generally refers to footage that is fabricated or tampered with, rather than a video excerpt that is simply lacking the full context.\n\nWhat's more, Biden's uses the term adjustments in reference to Social Security after going on a riff about whether affluent Americans actually need their benefits, making it sound as if he implicitly is interested in some form of means-testing or income-based benefit reductions.\n\nBiden's campaign maintains that the plan on his campaign website, which would increase benefits, is what he meant by adjustments. Biden would not so much as consider cutting Social Security benefits in any way, according to the campaign.\n\nNow, I don't know a whole lot of people in the top one-tenth of 1 percent or the top 1 percent who are relying on Social Security when they retire. I don't know a lot of them. Maybe you guys do, he said in his speech to Brookings, before launching into his plans for a pro-growth, progressive tax code.\n\nAs Biden notes in his conversation with the voter on Saturday, his Social Security plan would increase benefits and extend the program's solvency by lifting the cap on taxable income for Social Security purposes. The benefit increases he proposes include the creation of a minimum benefit at 125% of the federal poverty level, tackling poverty in late old age through a benefit bump-up for people collecting benefits for 20 years or more, and a change allowing surviving spouses to keep a larger share of benefits.\n\nBut in the past, some proposals to reform the program that have included at least one of these benefit increases also cut benefits in other ways.\n\nJoe Biden has a 40-year history of trying to cut Social Security, and he is doing everything he can to hide that record from voters. You can see Biden's record right here for yourself in 3 videos:\n\n\n\n1. https://t.co/HAJGvAjKMe\n\n\n\n2. https://t.co/ixQattKIXy\n\n\n\n3. https://t.co/k5G0fI5iXc https://t.co/kKMsRjbOVI — David Sirota (@davidsirota) January 18, 2020\n\nAnd as the Sanders campaign is fond of noting, Biden has a long history of endorsing Social Security benefit cuts dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nAs then-President Barack Obama's vice president, Biden served as Obama's liaison to Senate Republicans at a time when Obama had put a cut to Social Security cost-of-living adjustment on the table in pursuit of grand bargain that would also increase tax revenue. Obama would make that technical change, the chained consumer price index, part of his 2013 budget resolution, prompting a White House protest where Sanders spoke.\n\nJoe Biden should be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security. The facts are very clear: Biden not only pushed to cut Social Security ― he is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement on Saturday evening. The vice president must stop dodging questions about his record, and start explaining why he has so aggressively pushed to slash one of the most significant and successful social programs in American history, which millions of Americans rely on for survival.\n\nWhen asked for comment, Biden campaign staffer Andrew Bates said, As Bernie Sanders himself said in 2015: 'Joe Biden is a man who has devoted his entire life to public service and to the wellbeing of working families and the middle class.'
The New York attorney whose verbal harassment of two Spanish-speaking women went viral last week is now attempting to make amends for the racist rant.\n\nAaron Schlossberg posted an apology on Twitter on Tuesday for his behavior and insisted the manner in which I expressed myself is unacceptable and not the person I am.\n\nIn the rant, which was posted on Facebook by Edward Suazo, Schlossberg angrily confronted a restaurant employee for speaking Spanish in America.\n\nHe then threatened to get non-English speakers in the restaurant deported:\n\nMy guess is, they're not documented, so my next call is to ICE to have each one of [them] kicked out of my country. They have the balls to come here and live off of my money. I pay for their welfare, I pay for their ability to be here. The least they could do, the least they could do is speak English.\n\nSince the rant went public, the Trump-supporting Schlossberg has become a social pariah in multicultural New York.\n\nNot only was he evicted from his law offices, named in a disciplinary complaint and chased by reporters, but he was also trashed on Yelp and singled out for a mariachi band serenade.\n\nAs a result, many people speculated that Schlossberg's apology may come from a place of damage control and not sincere regret ― especially since a video from last year showed him yelling You are not a Jew at Jewish people supporting Palestinian rights, according to APlus.com.\n\n. Translation: I'm sorry people who know what a racist dick I am were able to ID me. I got booted from my office and I'm afraid to go home. I want you to THINK I'm sorry and hope you won't read between the lines to see that I'm not sorry for what I said, just that I got caught. — Diane Pavia (@diane_pavia) May 22, 2018\n\nYou're only apologizing because your career is being impacted.\n\n\n\nLet's see what the New York attorney disciplinary board thinks about your years-long pattern of harassment and bigotry... — Pé Resists (@4everNeverTrump) May 22, 2018\n\nYou suggest you don't want your money paying for their welfare. I don't want my tax dollars protecting you. Find a rock and hide beneath it until you have a sincere change of heart. I hope you see and hear Mariachi bands in your dreams. — Adrienne Nicodemus (@NicoEdCoach) May 22, 2018\n\nActually you are a racist (there are MULTIPLE videos confirming this) You're also a disgusting piece of shit who deserves no praise for this fake apology. Look deep inside yourself and work on the obvious issues you have with privilege, entitlement, and blind hatred. — Tacos Are Tasty (@JessicaSiler) May 22, 2018\n\nIf you aren't racist, why do you consistently go on huge racist rants? Why do you consistently harass people and call them racist names?\n\n\n\nIf this is an apology, it's shit and it's not accepted. You massive racist! 🌂 😡 — Jo Phillips (@joglasg) May 22, 2018\n\nHuffPost reached out to Schlossberg and to Suazo, the man who posted the video, neither of whom immediately responded.
WASHINGTON ― Live by the Sharpie. Die by the ballpoint.\n\nFrom the border wall with Mexico to the ban on transgender people in the military to travel prohibitions on majority-Muslim countries to the withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, many of former President Donald Trump's proudest accomplishments have been undone in just the first days of successor Joe Biden's administration.\n\nTrump's failure to codify his preferred policies through legislation, relying instead on a black Sharpie marker to scrawl his signature onto executive actions and then show them off for the cameras, left them vulnerable to Biden's signature on countermanding orders. And so far, the new president has signed dozens of them ― albeit with a ballpoint pen and less flourish, but every bit as effective ― wiping out much of Trump's legacy in a matter of days.\n\nElections have consequences, said a former Trump adviser on condition of anonymity.\n\nAP Photo/Susan Walsh President Donald Trump signs an executive order during a news conference at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Aug. 8, 2020.\n\nBiden took office at noon last Wednesday and did not arrive at the White House until nearly 4 p.m. Yet within two hours, he had signed 17 executive actions, including orders reentering the United States into the Paris agreement to combat climate change, ending the national emergency that Trump had declared to let him raid money for his border wall from the military construction budget, suspending Trump's ban on travel from a group of majority-Muslim nations, revoking Trump's order blocking the counting of undocumented immigrants in the 2020 census, and reinstating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that halts deportation of many immigrants who came into the country illegally as young children.\n\nIn the following days, Biden restored collective bargaining power for federal employees and ordered the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to find ways to keep workers across a range of industries safe from COVID-19.\n\nAnd on Monday, the new president rescinded the ban that Trump had imposed on transgender people serving in the military.\n\nIt's simple: America is safer when everyone qualified to serve can do so openly and with pride, Biden said in an Oval Office ceremony.\n\nThe rapid-fire reversals highlight Trump's reliance on implementing change on his own rather than building support for his ideas in Congress in order to pass laws.\n\nOn his promise to build a wall along the southern border, for example, Trump neglected it entirely during the two years Republicans controlled both the House and Senate, then triggered a monthlong government shutdown to try to coerce Congress into giving him funds to construct it, and finally declared a national emergency that provided a justification for him to raid military construction budgets ― taking money that otherwise would have gone for such things as schools and on-base housing for service members and their families. Doing so allowed him to build 453 miles of new steel fencing along the 2,000-mile Mexican border, although only about 80 miles are in stretches where no previous barrier existed. (Trump had promised hundreds of times during his 2016 campaign that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, but in four years he never made that request even once, and Mexico never paid a dime.)\n\nOne former White House official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that in Trump's first year, after failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the White House focused on passing the tax cut bill. They got it through while he had both houses of Congress, the former official said.\n\nCutting taxes, though, is a perennial priority for Republicans and almost certainly would have passed a GOP-controlled Congress with or without Trump's backing. Legislation pushing Trump's own agenda, on the other hand, was almost nonexistent.\n\nIndeed, the one notable exception was in 2018, when Trump's proposal to severely restrict immigration ― long a priority of top policy aide Stephen Miller ― was given a vote on the Senate floor and received just 41 yeas, the fewest of any of the plans under consideration that day.\n\nThe former White House aide said that vote pretty much ended Trump's interest in immigration legislation. That ship sailed after that first effort, he said.\n\nBiden, for his part, acknowledged that executive orders and memorandums can only get him so far.\n\nI'm proud of today's executive actions, and I'm going to start by keeping the promises I made to the American people, he said in the Oval Office on Inauguration Day, a tall brown stack of binders on his desk awaiting his signature. These are just executive actions. They are important, but we're going to need legislation for a lot of the things we're going to do.
After supporting trillions of dollars in new federal spending under President Donald Trump, Republicans in Congress are now worried about the national debt.\n\nCoincidentally, a Democrat is about to occupy the White House.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion worth of new spending on things like direct payments to households, unemployment benefits and a national program for vaccinating people against COVID-19. The Biden plan would support the economy at a time when employers are shedding jobs and an out-of-control pandemic is still killing more than 3,000 Americans daily.\n\nRepublicans supported trillions in pandemic relief spending last year, but at a confirmation hearing for Biden's Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen, Republicans prodded the former chair of the Federal Reserve about how much spending is too much.\n\nThe one thing that concerns me that nobody seems to be talking about anymore is the massive amount of debt that we continue to rack up as a nation and in fact, the president-elect has proposed a couple trillion dollars fiscal plan on top of that which we've already done, said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). Nobody seems to care much about it.\n\nYellen said that while the federal budget ought to be on a path that's sustainable, now is not the time to cut back.\n\nThe most important thing in my view that we can do today to put us on a path of fiscal sustainability is to defeat the pandemic, to provide relief to American people, Yellen said. To avoid doing what we need to do now to address the pandemic and the economic damage that it is causing would likely leave us in a worse place fiscally with respect to our debt situation.\n\nThe national debt is the sum of the federal government's past budget deficits, which result from the government spending more money than it raises through taxes in a given year. Economists have said that too much government borrowing could hurt the economy at some point or limit the government's ability to respond to a crisis, but the ever-widening deficits of the Trump years, which have pushed the national debt to historic levels, do not appear to have caused any problems ― or that much concern among Republicans.\n\nEven before the pandemic, with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, and no recession or national emergency, Republicans abandoned their prior calls for fiscal discipline and added nearly $4 trillion to the national debt through tax cuts and new spending.\n\nIn response to a question from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) about what economic metric might offer a clue that the government is borrowing too much, Yellen pointed to the amount that the government spends on interest on the debt. As a percentage of the U.S. economy, interest costs have risen much more slowly than the debt itself, reflecting the continued willingness of financial institutions to loan money to the government. Net interest outlays actually declined last year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, despite a surge of pandemic borrowing.\n\nLankford seemed unimpressed.\n\nI would submit that we have to find an earlier warning sign because once interest rates start kicking up, in some ways it is too late, Lankford said.\n\nRepublicans sometimes dislike federal spending for other reasons that are less theoretical than the debt burden. Business owners complain that federal unemployment benefits put upward pressure on wages, and a booming economy will make it harder for Republicans to retake the White House in 2024.\n\nDuring Barack Obama's presidency, Republicans often insisted that any spending on relief for workers be offset by cuts to other parts of the budget, even though the sums at stake typically represented a tiny fraction of what Republicans approved in the Trump years.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) warned low interest rates could rise, that the federal budget deficit is frightening and that Yellen should be a voice of fiscal sanity within the administration.\n\nYellen pledged to be that voice, but said fiscal restraint is for later. Right now, short-term, I feel that we can afford what it takes to get the economy back on its feet, to get us through the pandemic, and to relieve the burdens that it is placing on households and small businesses, she said, adding that helping a weak economy can result in a lower debt burden long-term.\n\nThe debt threat is relatively remote stacked against the threat of plague-related job loss and poverty facing millions of Americans. In her prepared testimony, Yellen anticipated the debt concerns but said they were not a good reason for lawmakers not to mitigate pointless human suffering.\n\nThe smartest thing we can do is act big, she said. In the long run, I believe the benefits will far outweigh the costs, especially if we care about helping people who have been struggling for a very long time.

AFP PHOTO / CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP / Chandan Khanna (Photo credit should read CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella will be sitting in the House gallery as an honored guest at the State of the Union (SOTU) address tonight. By all rights, he be should sitting before a Congressional committee instead, answering for his company's blatant tax avoidance.\n\nMicrosoft is playing a game called Global Tax Dodge. But don't look for it on the company's Xbox video system. It's only available to Microsoft's accountants and high-priced lawyers. Even though the rest of us can't play, we all foot the company's $34 billion price tag.\n\nThat's about the amount of tax revenue Microsoft is not paying because it has stashed $108 billion in profits offshore. As revealed in a Seattle Times report last month, Microsoft uses a web of overseas subsidiaries to dodge U.S. taxes, knocking its tax rate down to a minuscule 4.5 per cent on its offshore profits. That's lower than most working families pay.\n\nThe money you fork over for that Xbox or Office suite at the local mall takes a circuitous route to Microsoft's bottom line, stopping in tax havens (Bermuda twice) just long enough to shake off tax liability.\n\nMicrosoft began building this tax avoidance maze more than 20 years ago when it shifted software royalty rights to a dummy corporation in Nevada to avoid a levy in its home state of Washington. That first domestic dodge eventually grew into the company's current system of tax avoidance based in tax havens around the world.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the biggest offshore tax dodgers, but a handful of other huge companies play the same game. American corporations have more than $2 trillion in untaxed earnings packed away overseas. Altogether, they owe us some $600 billion.\n\nImagine the items we could check off our list of public needs if we collected all those unpaid corporate taxes: shortening commutes by improving highways and transit systems; easing overcrowding in schools; finding the next big medical cure.\n\nPresident Obama may well outline plans to address some of those public challenges in his SOTU speech. The audience, including the Congressional leadership and Microsoft CEO Nadella, will doubtless applaud.\n\nBut if Nadella really wanted to show his support, he'd stop his company's tax dodging. And Congressional leaders would make true corporate tax reform a priority, forcing big corporations to finally start paying their fair share.\n\nUnfortunately, most tax reform talk these days focuses on the supposed need to lower America's official corporate tax rate of 35 per cent. But as the example of Microsoft proves, that rate is easily sidestepped. Numerous studies have found that, after all their deductions, credits and other breaks, corporations actually pay only about half the official rate. And all those profits stashed offshore have only been taxed at 6 per cent, because they are mostly in tax havens. A huge loophole lets U.S. corporations avoid income taxes on those profits until they are brought home--which may never happen.\n\nSome companies zero out their tax obligation altogether. Boeing, General Electric and PriceLine.com are among two dozen profitable U.S. firms that went five years without paying a nickel in federal income taxes, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.\n\nAnd yet big corporations like Microsoft still want more. They are fighting for legislation in Congress that would exempt all of their offshore profits from any U.S. taxes. Known as a territorial tax system, this will create even more incentives to shift profits--and jobs -offshore. Instead, U.S. corporations should pay the same tax rate on profits no matter where they are earned.\n\nIf Nadella ever does take that seat at a committee witness table, he'd be following the Microsoft tax executive who testified about the company's offshore tax dodging before the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations three years ago. That panel outlined Microsoft's offshore tax dodging maze back in 2012; the recent newspaper report added important details, but the basic structure was already known.\n\nThe Subcommittee, using Microsoft as Exhibit 1 of corporate tax abuse, called for real reforms. But nothing happened because corporate lobbyists control the agenda. Reform that makes corporations pay their fair share might get a needed boost if President Obama endorsed it in his speech--even if one of the invited guests doesn't clap.\n\n\n\nFrank Clemente is executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness.
Nope. His core promise was that Mexico would pay for the wall. Now he has shut down the government for 29 days because he cannot get us to pay for it. More than 800,000 people are without a paycheck. When you lie for him, you are killing the Republican Party.
WASHINGTON (AP) — After days out of sight following the Capitol siege, President Donald Trump travels to Texas to trumpet one of the pillars of his presidency: his campaign against illegal immigration.\n\nTrump will be flying Tuesday to Alamo, Texas, a city in the Rio Grande Valley near the U.S-Mexican border. The city is named after the San Antonio mission where a small group of Texan independence-fighters fended off Mexican forces during a 13-day siege. Most of them died but the mission became a symbol of resistance for Texans, who eventually defeated the Mexican army.\n\nTrump's visit — no doubt a symbol of the president's defiance — comes as he spends the final days of his presidency isolated, aggrieved and staring down the prospect of a second impeachment after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol last week in an effort to halt the peaceful transition of power.\n\nAides have been urging the president to instead use the days he has left in office to highlight what they see as the chief accomplishments of his presidency: a massive tax cut, his efforts to roll back federal regulations and the transformation of federal courts with the appointment of conservative judges. But Trump has repeatedly resisted their efforts as he has remained ensconced in the White House, behind closed doors, consumed by baseless allegations of voter fraud and conspiracies.\n\nIndeed, the trip will mark the first time Trump has been seen in public since the speech he delivered to his supporters Wednesday, egging them on to fight before the Capitol violence.\n\nTrump is expected to deliver remarks highlighting his administration's efforts to curb illegal immigration and the progress made on his signature 2016 campaign promise: building a big, beautiful wall across the length of the southern border — an imposing structure made of concrete and reinforced steel. Over time, Trump demanded modifications that have been largely rejected: He wanted it painted black to burn the hands of those who touched it; he wanted it adorned with deadly spikes; he even wanted to surround it with an alligator-filled moat.\n\nIn the end, his administration has overseen the construction of roughly 450 miles of border wall construction — likely reaching 475 miles by Inauguration Day. The vast majority of that wall replaces smaller barriers that had already existed, though the new wall is considerably more difficult to bypass.\n\nOver the last four years, Trump and his administration have taken extreme — and often unlawful — action to try to curb both illegal and legal immigration. Their efforts were aided in his final year by the coronavirus pandemic, which ground international travel to a halt. But the number of people stopped trying to cross the southern border illegally has been creeping back up in recent months. Figures from December show nearly 74,000 encounters at the southwest border, up 3% from November and up 81% from a year earlier.\n\nMark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has warned the next administration that easing Trump administration policies, including a halt to wall construction, would lead to a surge of people seeking to cross the border, creating an unmitigated crisis in the first few weeks.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has said he'd halt construction of the border wall and take executive action where possible to reverse some of Trump's restrictions on legal immigration and asylum seekers. But Biden and his aides have acknowledged the possibility of a new crisis at the border if they act too quickly, and Biden has said it could take six months for his administration to secure funding and put in place the necessary infrastructure to loosen Trump-era restrictions.\n\nMissing from the trip will be Chad Wolf, Trump's acting Department of Homeland Security secretary. He abruptly resigned Monday, days after he pledged to serve out Trump's full term.\n\nAfter the Capitol violence, groups including the Southern Poverty Law Center urged Trump to call off his visit.\n\nThe violence Trump incited last week, and the violence his anti-immigrant policies cause stem from the alarming mainstreaming of white nationalist ideology that our country must reckon with and fight to uproot, said Efrén Olivares, deputy legal director of the center's Immigrant Justice Project. The president's planned trip to the border will only further the harm and beget more violence.\n\n___ Associated Press writers Ben Fox and Alexandra Jaffe in Washington and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.
Sean Hannity is losing it over progressive Democrats' Green New Deal, a policy proposal that would push the country toward 100 percent renewable energy over about a decade.\n\nHe is particularly upset about an idea from freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to finance the plan by introducing a marginal tax rate of up to 70 percent for the nation's wealthiest people. Doing so would have dreadful effects on the very rich, Hannity said Tuesday in an at-times nonsensical rant on his radio program.\n\nIf wealthy Americans were taxed more ― or, in Hannity's words, if their wealth were confiscated ― rich people are not going to remodel their homes, they're not going to build new homes, he claimed.\n\nThe contractor, the electrician, the plumber, the carpenters ― they're the ones that benefit when rich people spend money on their homes, continued Hannity, who has been linked to shell companies that spent tens of millions investing in residential real estate over the last decade.\n\nThe idea that wealth trickles down from the richest to those less privileged has been bashed by none other than billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has argued that people like him should pay more in taxes.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has floated the tax hike only on income in excess of $10 million. Hannity earned $36 million last year, according to Forbes.\n\nCar manufacturers, the host said, would also hurt if multimillionaires were asked to contribute more to benefit social programs.\n\nHe continued, bizarrely: All of a sudden, 'Well, maybe I'm going to hang on to that old clunker for another five years because I can't afford another new home because the government's taking a bigger portion of my income every year.'\n\nThe Fox News personality made similar claims on his radio show last week, when he said that Ocasio-Cortez would prevent wealthy people from buying boats that they like recreationally.\n\nOn Tuesday, he doubled down.\n\nPeople got mad at me, they said, 'Hannity, you were talking about, well, rich people won't buy boats.' No, rich people won't go to restaurants, because they won't have the money, he claimed without evidence. Rich people won't invest in companies, that means they're not going to hire people.\n\nOcasio-Cortez and other proponents of the Green New Deal have argued that the program would help alleviate inequality through public spending on sustainable energy sources aimed at curbing the devastating effects of climate change on low-income communities. Precisely how much the plan would cost, however, has not yet been hashed out.
Last week, we all watched the ultimate David vs. Goliath battle play out. Members of the subreddit r/WallStreetBets drove up the stock prices for a handful of dying companies, including GameStop, BlackBerry and AMC, thwarting a hedge fund's plans to short sell these stocks for massive profits.\n\nThe short-squeeze of GameStop in particular caused shares to shoot up nearly 2,000% from the beginning of January, though it has since dropped significantly. Some of the young day traders of Reddit were made millionaires overnight ― on paper, anyway. Short sellers, well, lost their shorts.\n\nClearly, both sides are playing a giant game, with the stock market as the game board, said Pam Krueger, founder and CEO of Wealthramp, a referral service for financial advisers.\n\nHedge funds have been gambling like this with leverage forever, unfettered, she said, adding that Robinhood, the commission-free trading app favored by many Redditors, has been inciting these day traders to play the game.\n\nFor the average investor, however, it's a dangerous world to get involved in.\n\nSo many younger people who are betting their 401(k)s and house down payments on GameStop will not have a seat at the table when the music finally stops, Krueger said. The truth is that Main Street investors shouldn't get swept up in headlines and worry about what a handful people are doing in the stock market. After all, this type of market speculation isn't investing, it's gambling.\n\nSo if you've been feeling some serious FOMO amid the GameStop market hype, here's why you should let it go and focus on a long-term ― and boring ― investment strategy.\n\nDon't Try This At Home\n\nIt's easy to get swept up in the GameStop success stories. One Redditor claimed to use his stock market profits to pay off his student loans. Another paid for his dog's lifesaving surgery. But that doesn't mean anyone with a Reddit account and some cash to burn should get into the same kind of day trading activity.\n\nHistory shows that timing the market is extremely difficult to do, said Brittney Castro, in-house certified financial planner for the personal finance company Mint. It's a high risk for potential high return, but you can think of it like gambling in the sense that most of the time, you'll probably lose.\n\nIn fact, only 1% of investors who attempt to time the market do so successfully.\n\nLike we saw last week with GameStop and AMC, at any given point, there are a number of factors that can come in and completely change the direction of any given stock or market index that may be completely irrelevant to the fundamentals of investing, such as investing in companies with strong balance sheets, Castro said. Those types of curveballs make successfully timing the market on a consistent basis nearly impossible.\n\nThe investors who manipulated the market and made money off a few stocks got lucky, to say the least. But plenty more missed the mark, including YouTuber David Dobrik, who lost $85,000 trying to ride the GameStop wave.\n\nThere are also a few financial considerations when it comes to day trading that newbie traders might not think about. Taxes, for example, are a big one.\n\nWhen you sell investments in a nonretirement account at a profit, you have to pay a capital gains tax. In 2020, the capital gains rate is either 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on your income and filing status ― that is, unless you held the asset for less than a year. In that case, your earnings are taxed as ordinary income according to current tax brackets. And keep in mind that your stock market earnings could bump you into a higher bracket.\n\nSo what does make sense as an investment strategy?\n\nIf you want to pick stocks, ask yourself what companies are poised for long-term growth, said Trevor Ward, a certified public accountant and financial planner at Kinetic Financial. Consider what competitive edge that company has and how it is changing its industry. Ward also recommended looking at its finances ― compare debt to assets and stock price to earnings. You should also understand who makes up the management team.\n\nIf You Must Engage In High-Risk Trading …\n\nIf you are going to dabble in high-risk trading, Castro said you should have a few other things in order first.\n\nWell-funded emergency savings: Before you start investing too heavily, it's important to have an emergency fund to fall back on. After all, you should never invest money you might need to pay bills or cover an unexpected expense. Having those emergency savings set aside can help you avoid falling into debt if the rest of your cash is tied up in the market.\n\nAdequate insurance: You should also make sure you have insurance in place, such as health, life, home, etc., before getting involved in the complexities of day trading. Make sure you have ways to protect your money, your assets and yourself, Castro said.
As a result of profit declines three quarters in a row, Bloomberg claims that the US is slipping into a profit recession. Some believe this is a result of a slump in crude oil prices and a sharp rise of the dollar. Of course, it is easy to point to those or even a slowdown of the Chinese economy. Instead of looking at the glass is half empty, some argue that these might be good things. There are definitely trade-offs. To increase profits, too many businesses focus on cutting expenses. That's the easier thing to do, and is one way to greater profits if there is not a corresponding decline in quality. Unfortunately, too many expense cuts come with quality declines -- especially when inferior materials are substituted or labor cuts cause drops in customer service.\n\nLower expenses financed by those that work for a living\n\nSince the financial meltdown, salaried employees have financed the cutting of expenses. Too many jobs and profits have gone bye bye. According to Bloomberg, US companies are keeping $2.1 trillion overseas to avoid taxes. Some pay less income tax than you and I. When consumers have less money to spend, this creates a vicious cycle, which hurts these companies too. To help avoid these problems, many believe it is preferably to focus on revenue to increase profits because that can produce more win-win situations where all boats rise. Where does revenue come from? It's the result of price times quantity (Revenue = Price x Quantity).\n\nPricing\n\nPricing is one of the fundamental building blocks of marketing. Many believe price is easy to understand when, in fact, it is one of the most difficult. McKinsey points out in an article entitled Shedding the commodity mind-set, too many companies leave large amounts of money on the table. Pricing experts know that setting the right price is difficult because, in addition to the physical factors of cost and profit, price is subject to psychological factors. The best companies can do to have control over these psychological factors is to do a great job of branding. And to get the branding right, companies have to know how to develop the right underlying corporate image and positioning strategies. In short, creating a brand image of the product that is impossible, or extremely difficult, to copy is the key to having control over your pricing strategies. If you are able to do that, you will be able to employ the most powerful and effective of all pricing strategies -- What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB).\n\nWhat the Market Will Bear\n\nIn markets where there is little or no competition, companies can employ a pricing strategy that optimizes profits. It is often called a What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB) price. This strategy sets the price based on the maximum price the market will pay for the product. On the one hand, the company wants to realize the highest profits possible in the shortest amount of time to help recoup high start-up costs, such R&D (research and development), production, and marketing costs. On the other, it may not want its profits to be so attractive as to entice cutthroat competition to enter the market within the time window it needs to build market share and establish a leadership position. This strategy typically works because those likely to buy a new product -- the Innovators and Early Adopters -- are not particularly price sensitive. If there is considerable uniqueness and desirability built into the product brand, your company can employ a WTMWB strategy. If not, you might consider other effective pricing strategies.\n\nGross Profit Margin Target\n\nIn almost all cases, pricing strategies should begin with a Gross Profit Margin Target (GPMT) strategy. Companies typically know the gross profit margin they need to pay back their expenses and generate positive net income and cash flow. Once your company knows the cost of sales (cost of goods and services sold) of a particular product and the Gross Profit Margin Target it wants, it can easily employ a GPMT strategy. Gross Profit Margin is defined by the formula (P-C)/P, where P=Price and C=Cost of Sales. Anybody can put this formula into a spreadsheet program, and as costs change, recalculate the price that will produce the targeted Gross Profit Margin. Most companies know the GPMT they want. If you don't, there are some common guidelines you can follow.\n\nManufacturers typically aim for a GPMT of 50%\n\nDistributors (Wholesalers) usually need a GPM of 10 to 15%\n\nDealers (Retailers) require a GPM of 30 to 50% (the higher percentage is for retailers that have to train people (customers and employees) to use the product and the lower margin is for retailers that are selling a product that does not require after-sale support.\n\nThe price, or marked-up cost, to achieve these target GPMs is as follows:\n\nManufacturers P=2C so the formula is (2C-C)/2C = 0.5, yielding a GPM of 50%\n\nDistributors P=1.18C so the formula is (1.18C-C)/1.18, which will give them a 15% GPM\n\nDealers P=1.5C so the formula is (1.5C-C)/1.5C, for a 33% GPM.\n\nWhen I develop pricing strategies for a client that is a manufacturer, I always start with a GPMT pricing strategy that is twice their cost, or 2C, since that is an easy calculation that will give them their GPMT of 50%.\n\nMost Significant Digit Pricing\n\nFor products that will be sold to consumers, most companies employ a Most Significant Digit (MSD) pricing strategy. Why? Studies and experience show that sales will be significantly higher if a product is priced at say $29.95 or $29.99 instead of $30. Most humans focus on the most significant digit - the 2 in this case. To them $29.95 or $29.99 seems a lot less than $30 even though it is only 1 to 5¢ less. Even expensive homes in Beverly Hills might sell for $7,995,000 rather than $8 million. There are exceptions. In upscale restaurants, it is usually a mistake to price an entrée at $31.95. Instead it will be priced at $32-. For some reason, people do not think the food is as good if MSD pricing is used in a high-end restaurant.\n\nCombining all three\n\nIf a product is positioned as unique, smart marketing companies will typically use all three of these strategies in combination. For example, Apple has priced its new iPad Air and iPad Pro starting at $499 and $799 respectively. Apple is using a MSD strategy in addition to a WTMWB strategy because the iPhone has uniqueness built-in since Apple controls the platform. It also aims for a GPMT, which is not officially published, but which is in the 30 to 50% GPM range of well-positioned products in competitive markets. When Johnson & Johnson launched a margarine developed in Finland that lowers cholesterol, it priced a tub of this margarine at between $5.79 and $5.99. At the same time, a tub of regular margarine sold for 99¢. Based on this pricing, which used MSD and WTMWB strategies, many speculated that J&J priced the product at 8C, which gave it a GPMT of roughly 87.5%.\n\nPricing your products\n\nWhen you are pricing your products, what gives you control over the price is the uniqueness built into your positioning, or branding, strategy. If you have created a product image that is impossible, or very difficult, to copy, you can employ a WTMWB price that will give you a good GPM that enables you to achieve your desired GPMT. And, if you sell your product in a consumer market, it would be a good idea to also employ an MSD pricing strategy. For example, if you are a manufacturer that is targeting a GPM of 50% and your cost of sales is $15, you might consider selling the product for $29.99 - a penny less than the price of 2C. Best of luck.
Just weeks before the severity of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the United States became unmistakable, President Donald Trump's administration offered states a way to make significant cuts to their Medicaid programs, which provide health care coverage for just over 20% of the population.\n\nThe rapid spread of the disease is now making a clear case for why this initiative would be harmful to vulnerable Americans. According to one estimate, the cost of COVID-19 treatment can exceed $20,000.\n\nThe policy, which the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services calls Healthy Adult Opportunity, is the Trump administration's attempt to accomplish a long-held Republican goal: to shrink Medicaid by establishing annual caps on how much federal money goes to state Medicaid programs.\n\nThat would be a massive change from how the program currently works, with federal and state governments together spending whatever it costs to treat beneficiaries. This setup allows Medicaid funding to expand during economic downturns and public health emergencies.\n\nProponents of the new policy tout the flexibility it provides states to remake their health care programs for low-income people, but the reality is that flexibility would translate into states cutting enrollment, cutting benefits or both.\n\nIt is code for doing less, said John Holahan, a health policy researcher and fellow at the Urban Institute. It would be literally cuts, of one form or another, if they couldn't live within the caps that they agreed to, which in this situation where we are today, they clearly couldn't. Holahan published a policy brief on Wednesday outlining the negative effects of limiting federal Medicaid spending during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nRepublicans generally favor reducing government spending and enrollment in safety net programs. But kicking people off benefits is unpopular, so it's politically easier to push reforms that sound bureaucratic and benign. The new policy's block grants, for instance, are an administrative maneuver masking a clear goal: reduced spending and fewer people getting benefits. In the 1990s, the Republican Congress and Democratic President Bill Clinton converted cash welfare into block grants, resulting in significantly less aid being provided to low-income families.\n\nMore than 70 million people in the United States were covered by Medicaid as of December, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. About 30 million potentially could be subject to the new Trump limits on the program's funding, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and the recession that's very likely to hit the U.S. economy offer a case study in how this kind of financing scheme puts Americans who earn very little at risk of getting sick or losing a job ― or both ― during a crisis.\n\nA Poorly Timed Bad Idea\n\nThe concept behind block grants and similar proposals for Medicaid is simple: Instead of open-ended federal funding to cover whatever costs the state's Medicaid beneficiaries require, the state gets a flat amount of money it must stretch over the year. And that amount is less than states get now.\n\nThe Trump initiative would allow states to choose between receiving a block grant ― a flat dollar amount per year ― that increases slightly faster than medical price inflation or a per-capita cap based on the number of current Medicaid enrollees that rises at the same rate as medical inflation. The per-capita cap option is less problematic than the block grants and offers states more financial leeway, but both would result in benefit and enrollment cuts, Holahan said.\n\nAs the Urban Institute policy brief illustrates, this financing mechanism wouldn't be adequate to cover current costs, let alone higher expenses associated with growth in the number of people using Medicaid or the costs of COVID-19 treatments. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected last year that Medicaid spending would increase 6% annually between 2019 and 2027. By contrast, medical inflation has risen less than 3% in recent years, according to the brief.\n\nWhile states that participate may request additional federal Medicaid funds during an emergency, those funds are not guaranteed and would require swift approval to be useful to states during crises. Under traditional Medicaid, the funding would automatically flow.\n\nUnder the Trump policy, announced in January, a state facing increasing Medicaid enrollment or higher spending on medical care for enrollees could choose to jettison people from the program or eliminate covered benefits. The alternative would be for the state to increase its own spending to maintain coverage and benefits, which would be significantly challenging because nearly all states must balance their budgets and can't turn to deficit spending. And given that this proposal is designed to appeal to Republican state officials, tax increases to finance additional spending would be unlikely.\n\nIt would put [states] in a horrendous position if they have a significant outbreak, Holahan said. It would either be bad for them fiscally if they decide to serve everybody or it would be bad for people if they decide that they couldn't because they agreed to this capped amount of federal money.\n\nNevertheless, the Republican governors of Oklahoma and Tennessee are still seeking federal approval to accept more limited federal funding for their Medicaid programs, respectively known as SoonerCare and TennCare.\n\nThe Anticipated Rise In Medicaid Enrollment\n\nTimes of rising unemployment and shrinking incomes tend to lead to large increases in Medicaid enrollment as people find themselves with less or no earnings and become eligible for the program. That leads to higher Medicaid spending. And a nationwide outbreak of a highly contagious virus that can lead to tens of thousands of dollars in medical costs will drive spending even higher this time. During the recession that began at the end of the last decade, millions of Americans enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nIn fact, Congress has already recognized these realities. The first coronavirus emergency bill that Trump signed includes additional Medicaid funding for states as a means of shoring up their budgets. That law also forbids states from cutting enrollment or benefits as a condition for receiving the temporary bonus funds. Extra Medicaid funding is a common form of helping state budgets and providing economic stimulus during recessions.\n\nAnd even as the Trump administration continues to support its Healthy Adult Opportunity initiative, federal authorities are taking other steps to shore up the Medicaid program amid the outbreak. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is swiftly approving states' requests to relax Medicaid enrollment rules to make it easier for qualified individuals to sign up.\n\nBut a catastrophic epidemic is unlikely to dissuade Republicans who have been clamoring to substantially curtail Medicaid. The GOP's failed Obamacare replacement bill in 2017 included a similar block grants proposal and the party has been trying to impose one since the 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan backed a version of the policy.\n\nThe Trump administration's new Medicaid funding plan is based on the same principles as those previous versions.\n\nToday, Medicaid is an entitlement program, like Medicare and Social Security, meaning that spending automatically rises to cover the costs incurred for medical care. The federal government finances more than half of Medicaid expenses, with states picking up the remaining share, which eases the fiscal burden on states, especially when the economy is poor. But states that adopt the Healthy Adult Opportunity program would give up that open-ended guarantee of federal funding.\n\nIn exchange for accepting less federal money, these states would gain new authorities to alter their Medicaid programs without seeking further federal approval. Depending on a state's specific plan, it could impose eligibility and benefit cuts, cost-sharing and other burdens on a subset of adult Medicaid enrollees.\n\nThat includes parents, pregnant women who earn just over the poverty level, and adults who live in states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The lowest-income pregnant women are exempt, as are people over 65, patients in long-term care, and individuals who receive federal disability benefits.\n\nMedicaid enrollees in states that adopt a block grant or per-capita cap could face new barriers to care, including monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and they could be kicked off the program for failing to pay.\n\nStates could also limit access to certain medications, or eliminate Medicaid's retroactive eligibility standard that covers recent medical expenses accumulated by new enrollees prior to signing up, or impose asset tests that block benefits for people who own homes or cars or other property, regardless how low their incomes are. That would be especially burdensome on newly jobless people, who still possess their assets but no longer have incomes.\n\nArthur Delaney contributed reporting.
Habitual smoking in China is set to kill more than 200 million people this century, a new report from the World Health Organization and United Nations Development Program said.\n\nThe deaths will come from primarily poor areas of the country, unless critical steps are taken to reduce China's dependency on tobacco, the report, released Friday, said.\n\nThose steps could be difficult in a country that is also the world's largest producer and consumer of tobacco, according to WHO. Forty-four percent of the world's cigarettes are smoked in China, and the profits show. In 2015, the smoking industry in China recorded $160 billion in revenue, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nCarlos Barria / Reuters A girl stands on a sidewalk after putting an unlit cigarette in her mouth, which she picked up from the ground, in Shanghai July 31, 2014.\n\nDr. Bernhard Schwartländer, China's WHO representative, said there needs to be more smoke-free policies across the country.\n\nIf nothing is done to reduce these numbers and introduce more progressive policies, the consequences could be devastating not just for the health of people across the country, but also for China's economy as a whole, Schwartländer said.\n\nCigarettes have become increasingly more affordable, according to the report. A 50 percent tax increase on cigarettes could see 47 million fewer male smokers and 20 million fewer premature deaths over 50 years.\n\nRaising tobacco taxes is one of the most cost-effective measures to reduce tobacco consumption, while also generating substantial revenue for health and other essential programs – investments that ultimately benefit the entire population, said Bert Hofman, World Bank Country Director for China, Mongolia and Korea, in the WHO press release.
You've heard all about pre-existing conditions, and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance policies. But if you want to understand what Republican plans to replace the Affordable Care Act would mean for the country, and perhaps for you individually, pay close attention to the money.\n\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, the federal government now spends tens of billions of dollars each year providing financial assistance to people who buy insurance through HealthCare.gov or one of the exchanges (like Covered California) that some states run on their own. The financial assistance takes two forms ― tax credits that discount premiums, and direct subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs.\n\nMost of the Republican schemes under consideration, including a working draft of House legislation that Politico obtained last week, envision the federal government continuing to provide assistance to people who buy coverage on their own. But the assistance would take a different form ― with a new formula for the tax credits, and no special assistance for out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe result would be some fairly dramatic shifts in who gets insurance, how much they pay for it, and, eventually, what kind of insurance they have. This isn't accidental. The decision to restructure financial assistance for insurance flows directly from the very different way Republicans and Democrats think about health care.\n\nBasically, Democrats believe there should be a right to decent, affordable insurance. They wrote the Affordable Care Act with that principle in mind. Democrats didn't achieve their goal ― millions of Americans remain uninsured, while millions more with coverage still face high costs. But something like 20 million people now have comprehensive policies they didn't have before. Overall, financial security and access to health care have improved.\n\nRepublicans take a different view. They are willing to give people a tax break to defray health insurance costs, and some Republicans are even willing to extend assistance to lower-income people who don't make enough money to owe income taxes. But Republicans reject the idea of government guaranteeing coverage, and their proposals to replace Obamacare wouldn't even attempt to provide such a guarantee.\n\nIt's a big reason why the mainstream Republican plans would likely result in more uninsured, weaker coverage, or some combination of the two.\n\nHow Obamacare Assistance Works\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, if you buy insurance through HealthCare.gov or one of the state-run exchanges, you can get tax credits that help offset the cost of premiums. These are special tax credits, in that they go straight to the insurance companies at the beginning of each month, so you don't have to wait until tax-filing season to get the money.\n\nThe tax credits are also refundable, which means that if your income tax liability is smaller than the value of the credit, or if you have no liability at all, you still get the full value. This is very important in health care because a large number of people buying through exchanges are working in low-paying jobs. They are hotel housekeepers and clerks at big-box stores, home health aides and security guards. If the credits weren't refundable, they wouldn't get much or any assistance, even though they are the ones who need it most.\n\nThe formula for calculating these tax credits is important. It varies based on income, so that you'll get a bigger tax credit if you make less money. The value also varies depending on how much insurance costs in your area ― in particular, the price of the second-cheapest silver plan, which the law treats as a benchmark. (Silver plans, which are less generous than typical employer plans, cover roughly 70 percent of the typical person's medical expenses.)\n\nThen there is the assistance on cost-sharing. It is available only to consumers who buy silver policies and whose incomes are below 250 percent of the poverty line ― about $30,000 for an an individual and $61,000 for a family of four this year. It gets very little attention because even most of the people who get the money don't realize it. (The exchanges factor in the assistance automatically, so that policies simply appear to have lower deductibles and co-payments.) But for the millions who get it, it's the difference between insurance that works and insurance that doesn't.\n\nYes, the whole scheme is awfully complicated. But put it all together and what you have is a system in which, generally speaking, people who need more financial assistance get it.\n\nHow GOP Tax Credits Would Work\n\nSo what would Republicans do instead? At the moment, nobody can say for sure, because they are still arguing among themselves over some pretty basic design questions. Moderates talk of repair as much as replace, while conservatives are determined to tear the law down entirely ― and then put little or nothing in its stead.\n\nJust this week, for example, several conservative Republicans in Congress said they would vote against any bill with refundable credits, because they would consider giving money to people with no income tax liability akin to creating a new entitlement. Of course, a bill with no refundable credits would, by definition, leave out a huge chunk of the population now getting coverage through Obamacare.\n\nThis approach ... would make it impossible for most lower-income people to purchase adequate health insurance coverage Linda Blumberg, The Urban Institute\n\nRepublican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) haven't gone that far, at least not yet. The draft legislation that leaked last week still had refundable credits, and looked a lot like the plan that Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price had proposed when he was in Congress last year. The Better Way proposal, a set of reform principles that Ryan released over the summer, also had refundable credits. President Donald Trump also endorsed tax credits during his speech to Congress on Tuesday night, although he didn't specify what kind.\n\nBut the tax credits in the Republican bills are different from the Affordable Care Act's. Instead of adjusting the value to account for premiums and income, as the law does today, the Republican plans envision tax credits whose value would vary based only on age. In the leaked bill, for instance, 25-year-olds would get $2,000 a year, while 55-year-olds would get $3,500. It wouldn't matter how much these people make, or what insurance costs in their communities.\n\nThe federal government would still be spending a lot of money on tax breaks for people getting health care. But it wouldn't steer that money in the way that the Affordable Care Act does ― in other words, it wouldn't target people who struggle the most with medical bills.\n\nWhy The Difference In Tax Credits Matters So Much\n\nSeveral recent studies, including two that were released on Wednesday morning, examined what the Republican approach would mean in practice.\n\nResearchers at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation looked exclusively at the premium tax credits and how they'd affect different groups of people. The results were predictably complex, with lots of variation from person to person, but the general pattern was clear. Lower income and older people and those who live in high-premium communities tend to get less help, Larry Levitt, senior vice president at Kaiser, told the Huffington Post. Those who are higher income and younger and live in low-premium areas tend to do better.\n\nLinda Blumberg, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, decided to take into account how changes to financial assistance would interact with other changes that Republicans propose, like allowing insurers new flexibility over what to cover and how much they could charge. If such a plan became law, Blumberg concluded, it would be impossible for most lower-income people to purchase adequate health insurance coverage, given their limited financial resources and potential medical needs.\n\nThree health care experts broke down the original Price bill, to see how it would affect total costs for enrollees ― in other words, not just premiums, but also out-of-pocket costs. They published their results in Vox last week: Although premiums would be lower under the Republican plan, this decrease would be offset by an increase in cost sharing. Once the differences in tax credits are accounted for, the Republican plan would increase total costs for every age group except for those under 25.\n\nMcKinsey & Co. ran a rough analysis on the leaked House bill, and presented its findings to a meeting of the nation's governors over the weekend. Some presently uninsured young people would get coverage, McKinsey's analysts predicted, because the GOP's tax credits would make insurance more financially attractive. But those gains would be more than offset by older people dropping insurance as it suddenly became a lot more expensive. Overall, McKinsey's researchers said, non-group insurance ― that is, coverage for people buying on their own ― would decline by 30 percent to 50 percent.\n\nNone of this should be surprising. The architects of the Affordable Care Act were trying to make sure everybody could get decent insurance, regardless of income, and they were willing to adjust financial assistance in order to make that possible. The Republicans who would replace the Affordable Care Act aren't trying to put insurance within everybody's reach. They are simply trying to offer a tax break that would available to people buying health insurance, and even then only under some circumstances.\n\nThe Republican approach would be a lot more straightforward, and it would likely mean a lot less federal spending. But it would also mean many fewer people buying insurance, much weaker coverage for those who have it, or both.\n\nThat's an alternative to the Affordable Care Act ― not a replacement.\n\nSign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

NEWARK, N.J. ― Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who announced his presidential candidacy on Friday morning, defended his record against criticism from the left later in the day during a news conference outside of his home.\n\nBooker calmly fielded questions about how he would respond to hypothetical attacks from President Donald Trump about Booker's ties to Wall Street, the perception that he is too corporate and his support for public charter schools at a moment of resurgent teachers union militancy.\n\nRather than adopt the populist rhetoric of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Booker defended his work combating predatory financial practices, including exploitative lending to low-income homeowners in Newark, and vowed that he would continue to stand up to bad actors in corporate America whose practices harm ordinary people.\n\nAnyone who knows my history knows my history of standing up for people who have been hurt by bad actors, he said.\n\nBooker did not deny supporting public charter schools. It would have been difficult for him to do so: He spoke at a rally co-sponsored by a charter school system in New Orleans on Jan. 18, at a time when Los Angeles schoolteachers were on strike in part over the growth of charter schools there.\n\nWithout once saying the word charter, Booker affirmed, We shouldn't have one-size-fits-all education. Local leaders should be able to decide what works best for them.\n\nInstead, he cast himself as a champion of higher public school teacher pay and better school funding that would enable more hiring of teachers, counselors and mental health professionals. One way he suggested to address the issue is by reforming the tax code so young stockbrokers, who may benefit from the carried-interest loophole or the lower tax rate on capital gains, don't pay a lower tax rate than teachers.\n\nOur teachers are ridiculously underpaid in America, he said. If you look at this in an economic analysis, they are the professionals who contribute the most to a thriving American economy. And we cannot continue to devalue one of the greatest professions in our country, which is public school teachers.\n\nI'm going to run the boldest pro-public school teacher campaign there is, which is how I ran the city of Newark, he added.\n\nIn addition, during a discussion of health care, Booker avoided a pitfall encountered by a fellow presidential contender, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), earlier this week.\n\nHarris declared at a CNN town hall in Iowa on Monday that she supported a Medicare-for-all system that included get[ting] rid of private health insurance. But by Tuesday, under fire from Republicans, Harris' staff was clarifying that while Medicare for all was her preferred policy, she was open to multiple paths to universal coverage.\n\nBooker, like Harris, is a co-sponsor of Sanders' September 2017 legislation replacing all but supplemental private insurance with one public federal program.\n\nOn Friday, however, when a reporter asked Booker if he would eliminate private health care ― seemingly referring to insurance, not the actual medical care ― the New Jersey senator took a different tack.\n\nWithout elaborating further, he responded, Even countries that have vast access to publicly offered health care still have private health care.\n\nNotwithstanding the below-freezing temperatures, Booker's decision to address reporters outside his Newark home in a working-class neighborhood provided an opportunity to showcase his status as a hometown favorite. (Booker served as mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013, before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014.)\n\nWhen Narcissa Quito, a neighbor of Booker's from across the street, noticed the news conference, she opened up her window, waved and called out to him frantically.\n\nBooker, who was in the middle of his answer to the question on charter schools and public education, smiled, calling back, Hermana!\n\nHola! Como estas? he continued in Spanish. A la victoria!\n\nYes! she replied in English. (In a follow-up interview, Quito, who immigrated from Ecuador more than 30 years ago, confirmed that she is already an enthusiastic backer of his bid.)\n\nBooker had ample opportunity to showcase his facility with policy details, including on criminal justice and immigration reform, causes he has long championed.\n\nHe previewed a presidential run that is likely to focus on uplift, appealing to American decency and goodness to overcome the divisiveness that has consumed the country under Trump.\n\nPressed on whether he was up for the task of taking on Trump, given his focus on love as a driving force in American politics, Booker expounded on the compassion of white lawyers who helped his parents overcome discrimination in the housing market and other civil rights advocates who helped move the country forward.\n\nThe people I admire are the people who lead by calling out the best in who we are and not the worst, he said. So I'm running for president because I believe in us, I believe in these values, I'm going to put them before the American people ― hey, and if that's not what they want, then I won't be the next president of the United States.
Pool via Getty Images President Joe Biden took to the podium on Friday to make remarks on the state of the economy amid the pandemic and the need for his ambitious American Rescue Plan.\n\nIn his much-celebrated memoir A Promised Land, former President Barack Obama described his 2009 stimulus bill in sweeping terms. By any conventional yardstick, I was about to sign historic legislation: a recovery effort comparable in size to FDR's New Deal, Obama wrote.\n\nIt was a middle-class tax cut bigger than anything since Reagan and an infrastructure program bigger than anything since the Eisenhower administration Obama proclaimed, adding that in his first month in office, he had secured the successful work of an entire first term.\n\nLittle of this description is accurate. Obama's $800 billion bill was equivalent to about 5.5% of U.S. economic output in 2008; New Deal spending amounted to around 70% of the economy the year before Franklin D. Roosevelt took office. There is no doubt the Great Recession would have been worse without Obama's bill, but it was not transformational legislation.\n\nEvery president wants to look on the bright side of his achievements, of course, and people will debate whether a bigger bill was politically possible until the end of time. But Obama's optimistic assessment of the 2009 Recovery Act rings hollow today not only for its statistical muddles. Over the past few years, a new intellectual consensus has emerged about how the economy works and what the government's proper role in managing it should be.\n\nBack in 2009, many if not most mainstream economists believed that excessive government budget deficits were a bigger threat to society than weak growth or prolonged unemployment. Going too big wouldn't just risk overheating ― it raised the prospect of a second financial crisis that could bring down the dollar and even American political hegemony.\n\nToday, by contrast, economists increasingly accept the idea that deficits are not inherently destabilizing, but a normal part of economic management. The price of going too big isn't a crash, but a little unwanted inflation ― something that can be reined in through Federal Reserve policymaking or some tax increases from Congress. These may be unpleasant when they come, but it will be much worse for people to lose jobs, incomes and homes in the meantime. When the costs of going too small are shattered families and broken faith in a shared national project, the choice is not difficult.\n\nAs conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks put it on Friday, When your great nation is facing decline because of rising inequality, insecurity, distrust and alienation, you don't just sit there. You try something big.\n\nOne of the few dissents from this new consensus is Larry Summers, the principal economic architect of the Obama stimulus who only a few months ago was among the chorus of economists urging President Joe Biden to go big. But Summers abruptly changed course on Thursday, arguing in The Washington Post that Biden's agenda risked inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, along with consequences for the dollar and financial stability ― in other words, another crash.\n\nPolitico's Washington-insider newsletter Playbook amplified the Summers analysis, and it was blasted across cable news for much of Friday morning … and slapped down repeatedly by the Biden administration.\n\nWe can't do too much here. We can do too little. We can do too little and sputter. President Joe Biden\n\nJared Bernstein, a member of Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN that Summers' analysis was profoundly wrong, while other administration officials spent the day trashing Summers across the media landscape.\n\nBiden himself shows no sign of changing course. Every signal from the president and his top economists has been consistent and clear since his election victory in November: He will not roll the dice on the country or his presidency with a skimpy bill. On Friday, after the Senate approved an early version of his proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, the president told a meeting of House Democrats: We can't do too much here. We can do too little. We can do too little and sputter.\n\nIt is not merely the left pushing back against Summers. Mainline party brass Democrats are convinced that the cost of going too small is a broken Democratic Party. On Friday, over 200 former Obama administration officials ― including recently departed Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez ― signed a letter saying the undersized 2009 stimulus bill ended up prolonging the economic pain and inhibited our ability to bounce back quickly. They urgee the Biden administration to learn the lessons from the last economic crisis and pass a large stimulus package.\n\nDemocrats will, of course, still listen to Obama; he will remain a revered figure within the party, whatever intellectual paradigm we are now living in. But Summers is going out with the tide. By declining to hire Summers and nominating Janet Yellen to be Treasury secretary, Biden demonstrated that he does not share Obama's admiration for Summers. Back in 2013, Obama had hoped to make Summers chairman of the Federal Reserve, but was forced to settle for Yellen when Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee blocked his man.\n\nBiden's $1.9 trillion relief package is welcome and robust, but like Obama's Recovery Act, it is not transformative lawmaking. It will enable the country to weather a difficult year, but it will not update the antiquated American economic infrastructure for the 21st century. Biden's payments to families will be welcome and its support for small business is urgently needed. The crises of inequality, climate change, and post-COVID-19 globalization will remain.\n\nIn his op-ed, Summers charged that Biden would burn up all of his political and economic space to address those issues by supporting American families.\n\nThe opposite is true. Republicans made clear this week they will not support even emergency economic relief from a Democratic president. Democrats will have no choice but to go it alone, and passing a popular bill will not hurt their ability to pass additional popular measures in the coming months. The economic growth enabled by Biden's COVID-19-relief bill will not crowd out other investments, but produce an expanding economy in which more investments are possible. His next bill to reform the mangled international trade system and update American infrastructure must be every bit as ambitious as his COVID-19 relief legislation, and Biden stated emphatically last month that it would be.\n\nThe Larry Summers Age is over; the Biden era begins.
Photo courtesy of Flickr.\n\nI agree with the glowing reviews of The Big Short. The film does a wonderful job of exposing the mendacity of the financial industry and the role it played in almost causing a worldwide economic collapse.\n\nIts depiction of Wall Street as infested with greed, devoid of ethics and indifferent to the real-life consequences of its conduct on Main Street Americans was spot on.\n\nLessons learned\n\nNevertheless, I felt a profound sadness as I exited the theater. I agree with The New York Times reviewer who noted the film offers no solutions, and no comfort. The best it can do is put down a marker.\n\nIt's not for lack of effort. At the end, the film raises the ominous possibility that this sordid history is about to repeat itself. An article in Bloomberg notes that Goldman Sachs, together with other banks, is selling a new investment it calls a bespoke tranche opportunity. The article explains that these investments are essentially a CDO backed by single-name credit-default swaps, customized based on investors' wishes. The pools of derivatives are cut into varying slices of risk that are sold to investors such as hedge funds.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nThis investment has much in common with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which fell into disrepute as a primary cause of the financial crisis. Bespoke tranche opportunities appear to be similar in concept. The change in name is simply a marketing ploy.\n\nThese new investments will no doubt be sold successfully to gullible investors, pension plans and endowments who believe this pitch in a Goldman Sachs email cited by Bloomberg: A tranche of a bespoke portfolio of credits can offer exposure to diversified risk with the possibility of leverage, credit enhancement and enhanced returns. Really?\n\nWhether or not that rosy assessment turns out to be correct remains to be seen. What is certain is that Wall Street will profit handsomely from the sale of these investments, regardless of how they actually perform.\n\nObscuring conflicts of interest\n\nI worry that focusing on the cause of the financial crisis and Wall Street's seemingly endless proclivity to create complex investments will obscure the larger issue. It's that the underlying premise is fatally flawed. Many investors believe their stockbrokers have a legal obligation to put the interest of the investor first. They don't understand the inherent conflict of interest that comes with permitting stockbrokers to sell investment products that generate higher fees as long as those investments are deemed suitable. Stockbrokers are under no obligation to advise their clients that lower-fee investments, with higher expected returns, are available.\n\nInvesting in Congress\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nIn my view, the goal of Wall Street -- under the guise of managing your money -- is to maximize the transfer of your assets to itself and to avoid regulation that would hinder its attempt to do so. It succeeds in these efforts through massive contributions to congressional campaigns. In 2014, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), a securities industry trade group, was the top contributor on Wall Street to these campaigns, investing more than $7.4 million.\n\nWhatever you may think of the ethics of Wall Street, no one disputes its ability to understand how to get a return (for itself) on its investments. Politicians know what is expected of them. If they fail to deliver, they can expect their opponents to receive this funding in the next election.\n\nThe biggest lie\n\nWhether or not new shenanigans by Wall Street will precipitate another financial crisis is an open question. It certainly doesn't appear that lessons have been learned from the last go-around.\n\nWhat is certain is this: Wall Street will continue to perpetuate the myth that it has the ability to beat the market through stock picking, market timing and fund manager selection.\n\nHere's what Wall Street doesn't want you to know and is terrified you will find out. Only about 2 percent of active fund managers generate statistically significant alpha (excess returns over their risk-adjusted benchmark). There's no reliable way to identify these fund managers prospectively. Even if you could do so, once the impact of taxes is taken into account, it is unlikely even these funds would beat the after-tax returns of low-management-fee index funds.\n\nAs my colleague, Larry Swedroe, noted, active management is the triumph of hype, hope and marketing over wisdom and experience.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nNo objective person who reads my books and those written by authors like Larry Swedroe, John Bogle, Burton Malkiel, William Bernstein and many others would continue to be seduced by the marketing hype of Wall Street. Movies like The Big Short do a great job of exposing the underlying greed that pervades the industry. But don't be fooled. While the financial crisis dealt a devastating blow to the retirement dreams of many, it pales in comparison to the daily plundering of assets that occurs when investors listen to the recommendations of those who claim an ability to beat the market.\n\nThere is a way to win as an investor. It starts with the realization that doing business with market-beating stockbrokers and advisors is designed to enhance their retirement at your expense.\n\n--\n\nDan Solin is a New York Times bestselling author of the Smartest series of books, including The Smartest Investment Book You'll Ever Read, The Smartest Retirement Book You'll Ever Read and his latest, The Smartest Sales Book You'll Ever Read.\n\nThe views of the author are his alone and may not represent the views of his affiliated firms.

Martin Lobel is Chairman of the Board of Tax Analysts, but the opinions expressed here are his and are not necessarily those of Tax Analysts\n\nBelieve it or not, Senator Elizabeth Warren is closer to Milton Friedman's description of a conservative than Speaker Paul Ryan. But you'd never know it because the mainstream media has tagged Warren as a Progressive and Ryan as a Conservative. Milton Friedman, the godfather of free market conservatism, believed the market worked best when the government didn't pick winners and losers. Even a cursory examination of most of Warren's proposals shows that she is proposing just that, to remove tax subsidies for those who can afford to hire lobbyists and attend expensive fund raisers. Ryan, on the other hand, has been proposing tax subsidies or tax cuts for the very rich in the hope that, once digested by them, some of the remains might benefit the rest of us. Ryan, in short, is a plutocrat enabler, not a conservative and the media has an obligation to inform the public about what he is really proposing.\n\nIt is an open secret that the best political reward is a tax subsidy because it continues indefinitely, is hidden from the public, and never has to be justified once its on the books. That is why the plutocrats have made our tax code so complicated and irrational. As my old boss, Senator Proxmire once said the more complicated a tax provision is, the less justification there is likely to be for it. Everyone, who isn't benefiting from it, agrees that carried interest, for example, should be taxed as ordinary income. Just as everyone, who isn't benefiting from it, agrees it is irrational to encourage the export of jobs and profits by deferring taxes on so-called foreign income. But they remain as part of our tax code because those who benefit from them are willing to spend whatever it takes to defend them while the ordinary citizen, who may know about them, isn't organized enough to mount a campaign against them or those who support them.\n\nThe solution to our complex business tax code is to follow Milton Friedman's lead and eliminate all tax subsidies and lower rates so the free market can work without the government picking winners and losers. That's a true conservative's position. Speaker Ryan's proposals, on the other hand, pick the rich as winners and the rest of us as losers. That's a plutocrat's proposal and should be identified as such. We need to remember that the real function of the government is to protect the public from those who would abuse the system to enhance their power.\n\nIf the public understood that Senator Warren is, in truth, a free market conservative and Speaker Ryan is a plutocratic proponent and not a free market conservative, don't you think that it might have an impact? Its time to end he said she said reporting. Its time for the media to analyze the various tax proposals and reveal them for what they are. Fortunately, Tax Notes provides a forum for experts to do just that. The real question is whether the New York Times and the rest of the general media will translate that information we provide into terms that the public can understand so they have the information they need to make rational decisions.

The White House is considering tax breaks for travel and tourism businesses amid the coronavirus outbreak, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe news comes a day after President Donald Trump said at a Fox News town hall meeting that he's also looking to cut so-called entitlement programs for Americans that include Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nThe Post, citing unnamed sources, said that talks about deferring taxes for airlines, hotels and cruise businesses are fluid and haven't been determined. It wasn't immediately clear if Trump's own hotels would be beneficiaries of tax breaks under consideration.\n\nPerhaps on a large scale, some of the sectors might need some temporary assistance, Kudlow said on Fox Business.\n\nThe travel and tourism industry is suffering its worst downturn since the 9/11 terror attacks, the Post noted.\n\nThe break for business is in stark contrast to Trump's statement Thursday about cutting social programs for Americans.\n\nFox News host Martha MacCallum told the president that if you don't cut something in entitlements, you will never really deal with the debt. Trump responded: Oh, we'll be cutting. He then pivoted to the U.S. economy, noting its strong growth.\n\nHe has raised that point previously concerning program cuts, perhaps suggesting that people are so much wealthier in a strong economy that they can pay for their own retirement income and health insurance.\n\n🚨 Trump says we'll be cutting entitlements like Medicare and Social Security 🚨 pic.twitter.com/6XRKE9joYz — Pod Save America (@PodSaveAmerica) March 6, 2020\n\nTrump promised when he was campaigning in 2016 not to cut Medicare and Social Security.

In 2008, the World Bank issued its first green bond. This security differed from other World Bank bonds in that the Bank pledged to bondholders that the proceeds of the bond would be invested in environmentally beneficial projects. Clean water. Clean air. Rapid transit that gets people out of thousands of polluting cars and motorbikes. These are the type of projects that the bank was going to invest the green bond buyers' money in.\n\nNow the rule of thumb in environmental finance is that the lower the payments, the more projects will get done. Is a farmer going to build a fence to keep his cattle from fouling a stream? If it costs $500, probably yes. If it costs $5,000, maybe. If it costs $50,000, definitely not. Are you going to put solar panels on your roof? If the payment is $20 a month, probably. If its $200 a month, maybe. If its $2,000 a month, definitely not.\n\nSo, in 2008, everybody thought that the World Bank's green bonds would have a lower rate of interest than its traditional bonds. The bank would then pass the lower payments on to its developing country borrowers, who, in turn, would be more likely to do more environmentally beneficial projects. Socially Responsible Investors would be willing to accept a lower rate of interest in return for the satisfaction of knowing that their money was creating environmental benefits. What a neat system!\n\nOnly it didn't work.\n\nThe World Bank's green bonds carried the exact same interest rate as did the Bank's other bonds. In other words, if investors wanted the Bank to invest in water pollution reduction projects, they could buy a green bond with, say, a 4% rate of interest. On the other hand, if they wanted to buy one of the Bank's other bonds that were financing, say, a coalmine, an urban highway or some other environmentally atrocious project, they could buy a regular World Bank bond that was also paying 4%. So, what is different about green bonds? Well, they assuage the conscience of sensitive investors. They make them feel good. They are Feel Good Bonds.\n\nThis situation may be changing thanks to DC Water and its advisors at Quantified Ventures.\n\nAs even casual visitors to Washington D.C. can attest, there are no multi-thousand acre tracts of active farmland or forests in the Nation's Capital. These features perform an invaluable environmental function in that they absorb rainwater and prevent it from gushing into - and polluting - lakes and streams. And so, rainwater, especially its virulent form, called stormwater, is a major nightmare for the District. So much so that the District, specifically its water/wastewater utility, called DC Water, has been working through a 25+ year solutioning process with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over what to do with the billions of gallons of stormwater that the District must deal with whenever there is a major rainstorm.\n\nThe upshot of this struggle is a consent order under which DC Water must dig enormous caverns - right under downtown DC - to trap the stormwater before it can get to, and overwhelm, their sewage treatment plant. Over the last few years, DC Water has been looking at green infrastructure to see if it offers a cost-effective and more environmentally friendly alternative. Green infrastructure is basically vegetation that absorbs rain. Think of rain gardens instead of cement patios. Think green roofs instead of tiles or sheeting.\n\nConcluding that it was definitely worth a shot, DC Water, the District, the US Department of Justice and the EPA agreed to amend their consent order. The agreement was that DC Water would build about 300 acres of green infrastructure. Before jumping into a massive 300+/- acre project that might cost hundreds of millions of dollars, DC Water decided to experiment with 25 acres first to see what the green infrastructure would actually cost and, second, how much water flow it would actually reduce. So, they picked out 25 acres and installed flow meters to see what the pre-project runoff was.\n\nDC Water's engineers told them that the project was likely to reduce flows between 18.6% and 41.3%. They said there was a 95% confidence interval that these goals would be reached. On the other hand, there was a 2.5% probability that the flow reduction would be below 18.6% AND a 2.5% probability that the flows would be reduced by more than 41.3%. The project was slated to cost about $25 million.\n\nSo, here's what DC Water and its advisors at Quantified Ventures did.\n\nThey put together a tax-exempt municipal bond that DC Water would issue. They called it an Environmental Impact Bond (EIB). And it is, indeed just that: an environmental impact bond! Remember a few paragraphs above where we said that the goal of environmental finance was to produce the lowest cost. Well it was a stroke of genius on the part of Mark Kim, DC Water's CFO, and Eric Letsinger, the CEO of Quantified Ventures, that they realized that lowest cost didn't necessarily mean lowest interest rate. So they built into the EIB a unique and brilliant feature: if the flow reduction exceeds 41.3%, DC Water will pay the investors an additional $3.3 million. BUT, if the flow reduction is less than 18.6%, then the investors will get $3.3 million less interest.\n\nThis looks like it's backwards. With this Environmental Impact Bond if more environmental benefits are created, the bondholders get MORE money, not less. Not only do they get the satisfaction of improving the environment, but they get an extra cash bonus too.\n\nSo, the question now arises: why would DC Water pay more for success? Well, let us say that the project exceeds its goals by 100%. That could mean that DC Water doesn't need to spend a possible $300 million on 300 acres of green infrastructure. They might be able to spend half of that to achieve their targets. That's could translate to enormous savings. So, why would DC Water pay its EIB investors an extra $3.3 million? The answer is simple: they are happy to pay out $3.3 million because they might save millions more!\n\nIn other words, DC Water and QV want to motivate investors to support investments that can develop environmentally positive results - motivating by paying for performance - encouraging environmentally minded investors to underwrite the likelihood of success for the project and get paid according to its riskiness - as one does with the rest of the investment market - thus mainstreaming environmentally beneficial projects into the investment community.\n\nWhat did the investment world think of this Environmental Impact Bond? What did the market think about Quantified Ventures' proven Pay for Success type of bond? Well, the venerable bible of the municipal bond industry, The Bond Buyer, named the issue the 2016 Non Traditional Deal Of The Year!\n\nDoes this mean the end of the type of green bonds discussed above? No. They will still be issued. There may be no financial implications to such bonds, but they do, after all, create good will. They do let investors know that the bond issuers are doing the right thing for the environment with the investors' money. As a matter of fact, DC Water is planning on issuing at least $100 million of green bonds in the near future. The proceeds of these bonds will go for stormwater reduction projects and other projects with direct environmental benefits, just like the World Bank bonds described above. And, soon DC Water will also issue a couple hundred million dollars of regular (non-green) bonds to pay for their other projects.\n\nSo, DC Water's Environmental Impact Bond is, indeed, just that. It is having a major, positive environmental impact!
Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images Are you considering a completely new kind of career right now because of COVID-19? You're not alone.\n\nA lot of workers have been job hunting in entirely new directions after the coronavirus pandemic upended their lives and careers.\n\nIn fact, 63% of workers who lost jobs because of COVID-19 have changed industries, according to a Harris Poll survey of more than 1,970 Americans conducted in October. The top reasons people gave for making a career switch were being laid off or fearing a layoff, needing more money, and feeling like there was no room for growth in their field.\n\nIf these reasons resonate with you, it's never too late to launch a new career ― but landing on the other side of the transition can be easier with some preparation and research.\n\n\n\nHere's what you can start doing now while you prepare to make the leap:\n\n\n\n1. Identify which of your skills can transfer over to your new field.\n\nIf you're sitting at your desk right now longing for change, know that you may have more tools than you think to get the career you want.\n\nFirst, identify which of your core functions can carry over into your new field.\n\nMarketing, general management, finance, consulting, sales — that is the function that's going to carry through, whether you're in tech or biotech or manufacturing, said Kristen Fitzpatrick, the managing director of alumni, career and professional development at Harvard Business School.\n\nYou are looking for professional, academic and technical skills that can be easily translated to that other industry, Jessica Hernandez, a career development coach, told HuffPost.\n\nShe gave the example of someone switching from the hospitality industry to logistics. If you're in hospitality and you had to work with suppliers and vendors and plan shipments or anything like that ― even though it was under that hospitality industry, those things are still transferable to new industries, Hernandez said.\n\nIf you don't have any of these transferable skills, Hernandez recommends educating yourself and taking online courses in the skills you need to get certifications that you can put on your résumé.\n\nYou should also read up on the basic technical skills and concepts you'll need to have to survive in your new field, Fitzpatrick added.\n\nIf you're going into finance, you should be able to read a 10-K [filing], you should be able to understand how the stock market works. There are basics in every industry that you should know, and then you're able to create a more compelling story for why you are worth a little bit of a risk as a career-switcher, she said.\n\n2. Rewrite your résumé to highlight how you're making career moves in that new direction.\n\nView your résumé as an explanation of where you want to go in your career, not a summary of what you have previously done.\n\nIf you are making a radical pivot that is not reflected in your formal education, career experts advise putting your self-studies, such as LinkedIn learning courses and digital bootcamps you have taken, at the top of your résumé. That way, a recruiter skimming the page can easily understand your reasons for a career leap and how you're working toward it.\n\nIf experience isn't super solid for whatever reason, but then [applicants] are showing that they've gone to hackathons on the weekends ... or things on their own, that shows determination, that shows focus, it's self-motivation, and those kind of candidates are definitely highlighted in my experience, Alison Daley, the founder of a tech recruiting and training platform called Recruiting Innovation, previously told HuffPost. Moxie and determination sure compensate for certain education pedigrees.\n\nAsk someone who has no idea what you do to look at your résumé so they can help you see what isn't clear and what industry vernacular from your old career you may still be using, Fitzpatrick said.\n\nThe amount of abbreviation and jargon I see when it's just how you've always talked for years ― you forget that other people don't know, she said.\n\n3. Network with people whose careers you want.\n\nTo expand your network, reach out to people who have the type of jobs you want and ask them for informational interviews.\n\nFind out what made them so successful, what they did before they got to the position or industry that they were in, Hernandez said.\n\nShe suggests framing your request with language like, Hey, I saw that you work for this company. I really admire your career path. I would like to transition into that industry one day. I was just wondering if you wouldn't mind sharing one or two steps that helped you get to where you are.\n\nIt's important not to make this transactional and ask them for a job, which may turn people off in a first encounter. Rather, you're asking them for information and actionable advice. Once you have a lot of these conversations, you'll start to notice patterns in these career paths, and in the meantime, you'll build relationships that could eventually lead to a referral, Hernandez said.\n\n4. Figure out your level of risk and budget the money you need during the transition.\n\nf I was someone who was more risk-averse, I would probably take eight months before I leave my job to prepare. - Ramona Ortega, founder of My Money My Future\n\nYou don't want the stress of money coming up as you transition. The transition is already hard enough, said Ramona Ortega, founder of the personal finance platform My Money My Future. When you're making a big career switch, you need to have a pot of money that is going to hold you over, whether you're just starting a new job [and] it's going to be another three to four weeks before you actually get paid, or you're looking for a job, which can take an indefinite amount of time, she said.\n\nBefore you switch, Ortega recommends looking at your bills holistically, consolidating accounts so you can see a full picture of where your money is going and coming from, and saving enough to cover fixed costs such as rent, mortgage, or car payments for three to six months. If you're taking money out of a 401(k), consider timing that action to when you are making less money and in a lower tax bracket, she said.\n\nIf you're switching from full-time employment to not knowing when your paycheck will be coming, Ortega suggests getting a side gig to ease that transition.\n\nThis could be something really random, she said. You want income coming in, especially if you're leaving a job that you've been with for 10 years and you're used to having that every-two-weeks-a check-is-coming-in [situation]. It's a very hard transition for a lot of people, she said.\n\nExactly how much money you will need for your move depends on your comfort with risk. Ortega said some people fall into the Screw it, I'm leaving camp, while others who are risk-averse may need a longer period of time to plan and build a bigger emergency fund.
The Internal Revenue Service unveiled a new website Friday where people who don't normally file tax returns can enter bank account information so they can receive coronavirus payments.\n\nThe new site is on IRS.gov. There's a big blue button that says Non Filers: Enter Payment Info Here.\n\n\n\nSince Congress passed a law calling for cash payments to most households in the U.S., people with low incomes haven't had a simple way to deal with the requirement that they file a tax return to get the benefit.\n\nThose who don't owe federal income taxes are not normally required to file returns, so the requirement presented a new hassle to the 15 million households that didn't file in 2019 ― and volunteer tax clinics are currently shut down.\n\nCongress created the one-time coronavirus rebate payments in order to help people get through the social distancing measures ordered by state and local governments to slow the spread of the virus. More than 16,000 Americans have died from it as of Friday morning, and more than 16 million have lost their jobs and filed unemployment claims.\n\nFor people who filed tax returns for 2018 or already filed for 2019, and who have bank information on file with the IRS, the rebate checks should hit their accounts soon. Individuals earning less than $75,000 are eligible for $1,200 and couples earning less than $150,000 are eligible for $2,400, plus $500 per child younger than 17.\n\nThe new IRS portal ― which the agency created with help from tax preparation companies like Intuit, the maker of TurboTax ― will hopefully resolve two weeks of chaos for non tax filers, some of whom discovered that existing free online tax filing software rejected returns from people with no taxable income.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin described the new site as a tool for Americans who are not required to file tax returns to make sure they receive their payment as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nAfter initially saying it would require everyone to file a tax return, the IRS said it would use Social Security data to deliver the payments to people receiving Social Security retirement or disability insurance. But people who don't receive those particular benefits still have to file.\n\nDemocrats have demanded that the IRS automatically send payments to people receiving Supplemental Security Income or Veterans Affairs benefits, since the government should have their bank account info.\n\nDean Webley, a 53-year-old former health care administrator in Philadelphia, said the payment would be extremely helpful to her. She said she's been getting by on savings since getting laid off two years ago.\n\nWith a 12-year-old son at home, Webley is eligible for $1,700 ― but the free tax sites wouldn't let her file, and she didn't have any luck with a separate new TurboTax program that is supposed to work better than existing free software.\n\nI haven't paid this month's rent yet, Webley said. Thank God all the bills are on moratorium right now, but a moratorium is not cancellation.
All right, I don't got long. I'm a dad, so I got a kid to take care of. What's up, bootlickers?\n\nI haven't seen ya'll since the campout. I've got something to say, right? I'm tired of this fucking shit. I'm a father, I'm a veteran, and I'm an anarchist. Those are three people you don't want to piss off, all right? I'm tired of children getting attacked in the streets. I'm tired of them sleeping in the fucking streets. I'm tired of seeing the very people that I swore to defend get attacked by the state.\n\nSo like I said out there, y'all need to close your fucking beaks and start moving your feet and get shit done. Take resources and put them in the hands of people who need them, all right? Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with y'all?\n\nWho the fuck are y'all to justify letting people die in the streets with your policies and your laws and your legislation. How do you justify that, killing people? I swore to give my life to defend the people from all forms of oppression. Eventually, the shit's gonna stop. Because when it's our turn, we won't make excuses for the terror. Marx.
The federal government is reopening for at least three weeks, but the prospect of a repeat looms. A second shutdown threatens to kick in Feb. 15 if Congress can't cut a deal on President Donald Trump's demand for money to build a border wall.\n\nHowever, labor advocates think they have the answer on how to end government shutdowns.\n\nDuring the final week of the shutdown, sickouts spiked among federal employees who refused to show up for work, leaving staffing shortages, triggering airport delays and raising concerns over whether tax refunds would be processed on time.\n\nMeanwhile, there were indications of growing support for coordinated absences even as thousands of staffers were being encouraged to work without pay.\n\nLast week, former Clinton-era Secretary of Labor Robert Reich who was also temporarily an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, publicly urged employees to stop showing up to their jobs in protest.\n\nAs a former secretary of labor, I urge federal workers who continue to toil without pay to stop working and those who are furloughed to picket their workplaces. Trump's callous disregard for all of you and for the public welfare must end. He must reopen the U.S. government. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) January 22, 2019\n\nJoseph McCartin, a professor and director of Georgetown University's Kalmanovitz Institute for Labor and the Working Poor, told Voice of America, a government-financed news outlet, that the strategy could work.\n\nIt would be about getting public attention, and even more important, causing the government to focus on this problem, he said. And hopefully, to delink the payment of wages to federal workers from the dispute that exists over the border.\n\nIn an American Prospect Op-Ed published less than two weeks before, McCartin had pushed for workers to act, writing, A sickout by unpaid federal employees could bring the impasse — and their status as hostages to the president's whim — to an end.\n\nDocumentarian Michael Moore promoted the tactic in his Friday appearance on Stephen Colbert's Late Show.\n\nThere's an easy way to end it, he said of the shutdown. Federal workers ― don't go to work without pay.\n\nMoore stressed that we shouldn't be supporting anything that requires someone who's not paid working for us, telling the audience to avoid flying and filing tax returns, suggesting they opt for extensions instead so as to avoid the need for workers.\n\nThe day after Moore's appearance, the agreement to reopen the government was announced.\n\nWhile the future of government operations and Trump's border wall remain unclear, Democrats and Republicans have until Feb. 15 to find a solution before key parts of the government could again grind to a halt.
NASHUA, N.H. ― Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was wrapping up a town hall here in New Hampshire's second-largest city when a voter asked how she planned to defeat Donald Trump and win the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe way I'm going to win is I'm going to unite our party, because we have to have a united party, Warren said Tuesday, one week before the second contest of the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. We can't have a repeat of 2016.\n\nIt's a point the Warren campaign has been hammering over the past month, downplaying her history of challenging other Democrats and arguing she's uniquely qualified to bridge the party's ideological, age, gender and racial divides. Some allies have gone further and argued it positions her well for a potential contested convention.\n\nBut as Warren stumbles out of a third-place finish in Iowa and seeks the game-changing result in New Hampshire that she failed to get in the Midwest, her pitch has a problem: Many of the voters she needs to win over aren't Democrats at all. Public polling here has shown Warren running strong with registered Democrats but performing poorly with the independents who plan to cast ballots in the Democratic race and often play a crucial role in Granite State politics.\n\nA Monmouth University poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters released Thursday illustrates her problem. Warren earns 13% of the vote overall, good for fourth place, behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's 24%, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 20% and former Vice President Joe Biden's 17%. But Warren earns the support of 21% of registered Democrats, trailing only Sanders. Her standing is hurt because just 5% of independents plan to back her. (Other polls in New Hampshire, including ones by Marist College, WBUR and Suffolk University, find similar gaps.)\n\nPatrick Murray, the Monmouth pollster who conducted the survey, noted the lack of a competitive Republican primary and said it meant more moderate and even some conservative voters would cast ballots on the Democratic side, causing problems for a progressive like Warren, who supports a wealth tax, mass student debt forgiveness and the decriminalization of border crossings.\n\nWarren's support is coming from traditionally liberal Democratic women, Murray said. When you only have one primary, you're going to get more independent voters who are further from the ideological extreme of the party. In this case, you're getting more voters from the center, or either more towards the right.\n\nMatt Rourke/ASSOCIATED PRESS Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren at a campaign event Thursday in Derry, N.H.\n\nBut ideology can't explain all of Warren's struggles with independents. Sanders, who is to her left, actually does better with independents than with registered Democrats in the Monmouth survey. That's partially because Sanders, who has long refused to officially join the Democratic Party, is seen as a less partisan figure. Warren, who rocketed to liberal fame in part because of her willingness to take on other Democrats, has downplayed her past criticisms in an attempt to become a consensus, unifying figure.\n\nThey're very much antiestablishment, Murray said of the independent voters who are backing Sanders. If she had done that, she might've been able to dig into some of Bernie's independents.\n\nThe Warren campaign declined to comment on the record for this story.\n\nWe Need To Pull This Party Together\n\nSince the start of January, Warren has sought to capitalize on escalating intra-party tensions caused by Sanders's rise in the polls by offering herself as a way to satiate both of the party's ideological wings while remaining acceptable to Black and Latino voters. (This is intended to separate her from Buttigieg, who has also positioned himself as the middle ground but struggles with voters of color.)\n\nHer allies routinely cite polling showing a wide swath of Democratic voters are still considering backing her and that she is the nominee who would disappoint the smallest portion of Democrat voters.\n\nAt the Nashua event, unifying the party seemed to be her major message. Aides handed out Unite the party signs to attendees, and Warren took time to note she had won support from elected officials and organizers who had previously backed candidates who have dropped out of the contest.\n\nWe now have a campaign that, sure, it's got a lot of Elizabeth Warren originals, she told a crowd Wednesday in Nashua, but it's also got a lot of [Sen. Kamala Harris] folks in it. It's got a lot of [former Housing Secretary Julián Castro] folks in it. It's got a lot of [former Rep. Beto O'Rourke] folks in it. It's got a lot of [Sen. Cory Booker] folks in it, because they all had good ideas, and they all care about our country.\n\nThe Warren campaign is driving the point home with television ads featuring people who supported Hillary Clinton, Sanders and Trump in 2016 and are now backing Warren. (The campaign aired a similar spot in Iowa.)\n\nAt events in Nashua and in Derry on Thursday, it seemed to be working. I was honestly leaning toward Bernie, but today clinched it for Warren, said Tara Picciano, a registered Democrat and stay-at-home mom from nearby Wyndham. I want the fighter. I want somebody who's going to unite the party.\n\nAsked if she worried that Sanders couldn't bring the party together, Picciano was diplomatic: What I worry about is the soundbite of bully-ism, she said. I feel like, unfortunately, that's where Bernie is right now.\n\nBut not everyone was sold or even agreed that party unity was a major problem.\n\nLorrie Belinsky, a retired school administrator and independent, said she was still considering Warren, Buttigieg and Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.). I don't know. That's one thing I maybe worry about. I'm not sure at this point, she said when asked if Warren could unite anti-Trump forces.\n\nAnd state Rep. Erika Connors, who said she was pretty sure she planned to endorse Warren after vacillating between her and Buttigieg, downplayed party unity as an issue.\n\nI don't really see the party as divided as people are making it out to be. I think people are either going to vote for Donald Trump, or they're going to vote for the alternative, whoever it is, she said.\n\nShe Was There To Hold Me Accountable As A Democrat\n\nA day earlier, Castro ― the only defeated rival of Warren's to directly endorse her so far ― was in downtown Nashua for a meet-and-greet at Warren's office here.\n\nDuring a brief speech to the gathered supporters, Castro discussed the first time he met Warren. As a member of a Senate committee with oversight of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Warren invited Castro to lunch in the Senate dining room. What Castro thought would be a casual get-to-know-you visit quickly turned serious and wonky.\n\nShe wanted to know what I was going to do to hold Wall Street accountable as people were losing their mortgages, she wanted to know how we are going to keep people in their homes, Castro said. She was there to hold me accountable, from a friendly administration, because it wasn't the party or the position that mattered most to her, it was the people that she was supposed to be there representing.\n\nCastro's anecdote stood out. Though it fits into a larger pattern of Warren holding the feet of her fellow Democrats to the fire, it broke against the Warren campaign's tendency to downplay that pattern.\n\nDuring her rise to political fame during the Great Recession, Warren was a vociferous critic of how the Obama administration's Treasury Department responded to the financial and housing crises. In the Senate, she continued to aggravate her Democratic colleagues by lambasting them for their support of laws progressives pointed to as giveaways to the banking and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nWarren has always balanced her criticisms of other Democrats with a team player attitude, hosting fundraisers for Senate candidates and using her robust email list to help other Democrats raise money. But throughout the 2020 campaign, Warren has often declined to engage in critiques of other Democrats, and her campaign has positioned her as the pragmatic progressive in contrast to Sanders's willingness to declare war on the establishment.\n\nShe has repeatedly declined to repeat her recession-era critiques of the Obama administration and has largely refrained from relitigating the fight that brought her into politics: her battles with Biden over his push for bankruptcy legislation she said would sell out consumers. In general, with the exception of her now-famous wine cave attack on Buttigieg, Warren has avoided going on the attack against the other candidates.\n\nWarren's campaign is now airing an ad in both New Hampshire and South Carolina featuring her work during the recession, but it doesn't show her sharply questioning Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner or Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White, two Obama officials Warren regularly scorned. It shows President Barack Obama lavishing praise on her.\n\nCastro, in an interview after his speech, punted when asked if Warren needed to place more emphasis on her past intra-party clashes: I'll leave the political analysis to the campaign.\n\nThe event also had a distinctly left-wing feel that could contribute to the skepticism some independents feel toward Warren: As Jordan Thompson, a former Harris organizer who later endorsed Castro and was now backing Warren, talked about how any movement for big structural change must be diverse and intersectional, other young people snapped their figures in approval.\n\nIn an interview after the event, Thompson praised Warren: She understands intersectionality. For too long, marginalized people have been placed on the back burner. But he also said he was under no illusion about how much demand voters in New Hampshire, the third-whitest state in the union, might have for racial justice.\n\nI would give some of those voters a little bit more credit, he said. But maybe that's just me being optimistic.\n\nWhere Warren Goes From Here\n\nWarren arrived in the Granite State in a steady position after a third-place finish in Iowa, receiving neither the boost granted to Sanders and Buttigieg nor the preemptive postmortems delivered to Biden. Polling in New Hampshire generally places her fourth, but she remains in third in national polling and in position to pick up a significant share of delegates on Super Tuesday on March 3.\n\nWe're in the top three in Iowa, and now we've landed in New Hampshire, and now we're out there fighting for everyone in New Hampshire, and then after that we have 55 more states and territories, Warren said during a short meeting with reporters Tuesday, indicating that there's little chance she would alter her campaign's long-game-focused, organizing-heavy strategy.\n\nBut it's unclear how the Warren team plans to jumpstart her campaign into actually winning the nomination, particularly as Sanders continues to raise gargantuan sums ― his campaign announced Thursday morning he raised more than $25 million in January ― and seemingly consolidates his hold on the left-leaning voters they once battled over.\n\nIf Warren can't get a boost in New Hampshire, she'll need to look to Nevada for a boost. But there are signs of trouble there: She's cut more than $300,000 from her television ad buys in the state, Advertising Analytics reported. And on Thursday, Politico reported that six women of color left Warren's Nevada staff in recent months, frustrated by a campaign culture they felt didn't value their input. At the Derry event, Warren issued an apology.\n\nI believe these women, completely and without reservation. And I apologize that they have had a bad experience on this campaign, she told reporters. I take personal responsibility for this. And I'm working with my team to address these concerns.\n\nBut as the field remains fractured ― not a single candidate dropped out after Monday night's caucuses in Iowa ― and the entrance of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg starting on Super Tuesday is set to throw the race into further chaos, some Warren allies have begun suggesting the candidate who consistently emphasizes her ability to unify the party could do just that from a contested Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee in July.\n\nA brokered convention has previously been more of a plot device than an active political reality, but I think it's an extremely live possibility in 2020, said Jeff Hauser, a Democratic strategist who supports Warren. In the context of a president who scares a party so much, and with the memory of 2016 divisions so sharp, I think the candidate who is disliked by the fewest members of the party is going to make a compelling choice.\n\nAmanda Terkel contributed reporting from Derry, New Hampshire.
The Democratic presidential candidates didn't come to the debate Wednesday in Las Vegas to be nice.\n\nThe feistiest debate of the 2020 presidential election cycle came three days before the Nevada caucuses, and it's understandable why. The first two contests of the primary race, in Iowa and New Hampshire, were a wash. And in two weeks, a third of all the delegates in the Democratic primary will be decided in one day, likely sealing the fate of most of the candidates in the race.\n\nThere were six presidential candidates on the debate stage in Nevada: former Vice President Joe Biden, billionaire media mogul Michael Bloomberg, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Each one still sees a path to the White House, but the clock is ticking.\n\nIt was Bloomberg's first Democratic debate. The former Republican New York City mayor made it on the debate stage after the Democratic Party changed the qualification rules to focus more on poll numbers instead of grassroots donations (Bloomberg is self-funding). From the get-go, the other Democrats on the stage made it clear Bloomberg wasn't getting a first-timer's free pass.\n\nSo I'd like to talk about who we're running against: a billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians' — and, no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg, Warren said in her first remark of the night.\n\nBut then again, the candidates weren't giving any of their fellow competitors a free pass either. Warren went after just about everyone on stage — twice over. Buttigieg seemed to have it out for Sanders and Klobuchar. And Biden and Sanders took their turns punching at Bloomberg, like the rest of them.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Wednesday's debate:\n\nJohn Locher/ASSOCIATED PRESS Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) try to get in their time at the Democratic presidential primary debate Wednesday in Las Vegas.\n\nBloomberg took a punch. And another punch. And then another one. And another one.\n\nPeople of color, women and his exorbitant wealth: the three areas of Bloomberg's record that came under attack Wednesday night. And the attacks were unrelenting and from every direction.\n\nSanders got to take the first swing at Bloomberg: He went after Bloomberg's record on police policy when he was New York mayor. Namely, the stop-and-frisk policy, the directive to police to stop, question and search suspicious people that disproportionately targeted Black and brown teenagers. It increased sevenfold under Bloomberg's tenure from 2002 to 2013.\n\nMr. Bloomberg had policies in New York City of stop-and-frisk that [targeted] African American and Latino people in an outrageous way, Sanders said. That is not how you're going to grow voter turnout.\n\nWarren and Biden took their turns. They hit Bloomberg on stop-and-frisk and his record with women. Over the past several decades, 64 women have brought forward nearly 40 sex discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuits against Bloomberg and his company. Women at Bloomberg LP have reportedly been bound by nondisclosure agreements (NDAs), which Bloomberg refused to break when pressed on the debate stage.\n\nHe has gotten some number of women ― dozens, who knows ― to sign nondisclosure agreements, both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace, Warren said. So, Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements, so we can hear their side of the story?\n\nBiden pressed on the NDA issue further.\n\nLook, let's get something straight here. It's easy. All the mayor has to do is say, You are released from the nondisclosure agreement, period, Biden said. You think the women, in fact, were ready to say I don't want anybody to know about what you did to me? That's not how it works. The way it works is they say, look, this is what you did to me, and the mayor comes along and his attorneys said, I will give you this amount of money if you promise you will never say anything. That's how it works.\n\nBloomberg should have expected these hits. His record with communities of color, his wealth, and his record with women have all come under intense scrutiny in the last week. Yet he appeared unprepared on all fronts. He was muted in his defense of stop-and-frisk policies. He chalked up the harassment complaints to maybe they didn't like a joke I told, refusing to free the women at his companies from the NDAs they'd signed, and didn't have an answer for why he has yet to release his tax returns other than to say he's working on it.\n\nRemember, I only entered this race 10 weeks ago, Bloomberg said. All of my associates here have been at this for a couple of years.\n\nThat only opened him up to further attack.\n\nThat's right, we have, Buttigieg jumped back. Engaging with voters and humbling ourselves to the backyards and diners.\n\nElizabeth Warren came ready to fight.\n\nJohn Locher/ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wasn't the only one to take a jab at debate stage newcomer Mike Bloomberg, but she hit him early and hard.\n\nNo one was holding back, but Warren was in a particular fighting mood, and it was a notable shift from past debates.\n\nHer hits on Bloomberg were numerous and incisive, but on multiple occasions, Warren literally went down the line of competitors alongside her on stage, picking apart their campaigning styles, records and policy platforms.\n\nMayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their health care, Warren said of his so-called Medicare for All Who Want It public option plan. It's not a plan; it's a PowerPoint. And Amy's plan is even less. It's like a Post-it note, insert plan here.\n\nWarren later added Klobuchar's plan was only two paragraphs to really drive the point home.\n\nShe even took a jab — albeit a smaller one — at Sanders, whom she has often buddied up with on the debate stage.\n\nBernie has started very much — has a good start. But instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work. And then his own advisers say, eh, probably won't happen anyway.\n\nWarren has had a hard time finding her footing in the race. She had an epic rise in early fall of 2019, when her brand as the woman with the plans made her look like a favorite for the early contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. Then her support fled to other candidates, such as Buttigieg and Klobuchar. And her third- and fourth-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, respectively, stifled any momentum she had in earlier months of campaigning.\n\nWarren's campaign made it clear that they see this primary process in the long term, and Warren herself made it clear that she's not standing down.\n\nButtigieg and Klobuchar really don't seem to like each other.\n\nIt's been clear for a couple of debates that Klobuchar and Buttigieg have some sourness toward each other. Early on, Klobuchar questioned whether Buttigieg had the experience to hold the nation's highest office.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Buttigieg seemed to imply Klobuchar didn't have the intelligence, highlighting a moment last week when the senator couldn't name the president of Mexico.\n\nYou're staking your candidacy on your Washington experience, Buttigieg said. You're on the committee that oversees border security. You're on the committee that does trade. You're literally in part of the committee that's overseeing these things and were not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south.\n\nAre you trying to say that I'm dumb? Or are you mocking me here, Pete? Klobuchar retorted.\n\nAnd that wasn't the only tense moment between the two.\n\nJohn Locher/ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) got into a dust-up with Pete Buttigieg over a gaffe last week about the name of Mexico's president.\n\nThe Medicare For All fight you have definitely heard before isn't going anywhere.\n\nLike at every Democratic debate, the health care fight Wednesday was about Medicare for All, and, drum roll please, how the country can pay for it.\n\nButtigieg seemed most eager to pick this fight with Sanders, especially in light of recent news about the Culinary Workers Union — a powerful organizing force in Nevada that said it received harassing messages from Sanders supporters after signaling to its members that Medicare for All would be bad for them.\n\nWe can actually deliver health care without taking it away from anyone, Buttigieg said. And we can build a movement without having legions of our supporters online and in person attacking Democratic figures and union leaders alike.\n\nButtigieg brought up the subject again later in the debate, focusing on the cost of Medicare for All.\n\nHe's said that it's impossible to even know how much it's going to cost, and even after raising taxes on everybody making $29,000, there is still a multitrillion-dollar hole, Buttigieg said.\n\nFor close watchers of the debate, Buttigieg is repeating an attack that Sanders, and Warren, have confronted before. As proposed, Sanders' Medicare for All plan, which would move all Americans to a single government-run health insurance program, is more generous than most private-sector plans. He has not identified a payment plan but instead cites a list of possible taxes he supports. And for unions with even stronger health care plans, Sanders has since said he would include a provision mandating companies with union-negotiated health plans to enter contract negotiations under the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nDemocrats have been in a seemingly never-ending debate about the appropriate future of health care in the United States. That fight doesn't seem to be going anywhere.\n\nBernie Sanders isn't going anywhere either.\n\nSanders is a leading candidate. He's rising in the polls. He looks poised to win the caucuses in Nevada and have a strong showing on Super Tuesday, March 3.\n\nSanders faced some difficult subjects. He was met with familiar attacks on his health care plan and his self-proclaimed democratic socialism. And he was asked yet again to answer for angry online supporters.\n\nWe have over 10.6 million people on Twitter, and 99.9% of them are decent human beings, are working people, are people who believe in justice, compassion and love, Sanders said. And if there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people. They are not part of our movement.\n\nBut Sanders was doing just as much of the attacking Wednesday. He came to the debate already a winner of a primary contest and with the momentum behind him.\n\nSeeing how feisty the rest of the field was, it's clear that some of the other candidates got that message, too: If things continue as they are, the race could consolidate around Sanders in a couple of weeks.\n\nOr it could be completely up for grabs.
Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) closed out 2020 by expunging nearly 500,000 non-felony cannabis-related records, an action mandated by Illinois' marijuana legalization law that went into effect a year ago.\n\nAs part of the action, the governor also pardoned 9,219 low-level cannabis conviction records, part of the state's efforts to repair the damage inflicted by the war on drugs ― primarily on residents of color.\n\nWe will never be able to fully remedy the depth of the damage in communities of color, who have disproportionately shouldered this burden, Pritzker said Thursday in a statement announcing the expungements. But we can govern with the courage to admit the mistakes of our past — and the decency to set a better path forward.\n\nIllinois' Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which legalized cannabis in the state, required the government to expunge 47,000 cannabis-related arrest records created between 2013 and 2019 by Jan. 1, 2021.\n\nIn a unique twist, the law also created a program that reinvests 25% of cannabis tax revenue into a fund for youth development, anti-violence programs, re-entry programs, economic development and civil legal aid services for R3 communities ― those dealing with high rates of gun violence, child poverty and incarceration rates.\n\nWith Thursday's action, the state also met a separate January 2025 deadline to expunge all 492,192 state-level records.\n\nHowever, only nine of the state's 102 counties have finished clearing their own non-felony cannabis-related arrest records.\n\nIn a statement to the Chicago Sun-Times, state Sen. Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford (D) said the expungements are encouraging, yet ultimately incremental.\n\nDismantling decades' worth of criminal justice atrocities will take years. That's evidenced by how this country handles cannabis, she said. We must never stop chipping away at that painful history. I'm proud of these critical first steps.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly stated Illinois has 201 counties. It has 102.
Political risk exists everywhere, as does uncertainty about how, when, or whether it will manifest itself in ways detrimental to international traders, investors, and lenders. For decades, conventional wisdom dictated that developing and emerging countries were the greatest sources of such risk, due to the absence of meaningful and enforceable laws, the prevalence of corruption, lack of financial resources, and security concerns. That of course remains the case, but as has been proven as a result of the Great Recession, the global war on terror, corruption scandals and growing income disparity, developed countries contribute every bit as much as those 'other' countries to the rising risks associated with cross-border transactions.\n\nThis has become a source of great concern to many global businesses, which are scrambling to stay ahead of the headlines. Some of the things that used to be taken for granted - such as that Europe will always be a source of stability and growth, or that China is an investment destination that must be included in an investment portfolio - simply are no longer the case. Europe's rolling recession -- complete with anemic growth and security concerns - will mean the continent will be a source of instability for many years to come. China's incessant bubble economy, declining long-term growth rates, and increasingly unfriendly policies toward foreign investors have given many companies pause for many years now. There are plenty of other examples of how conventional wisdom has been turned upside down.\n\nAs the U.S. enters a period of unprecedented post-war political instability, many businesses are wondering how to plan for the near and medium-term future. Decision makers in business sometimes have short memories; a preoccupation with making profit will continue to cloud the judgement of some of them. Recent headlines have stated how optimistic some business leaders are about America's future, believing that the pro-business platform about to be implemented is a stairway to heaven. It may well be. A significant reduction in corporate tax rates combined with an orientation toward America First could indeed propel the U.S. economy to heights unseen in decades -- at least, in the short-term.\n\nThe alternative argument is that the U.S. is about to lead the world into a wave of destructive economic nationalism that threatens to undermine the core of the post-war global trade and investment regime. In a zero-sum world where my gain must come at your loss, everyone stands to lose, of course. Imposing unilateral tariffs simply results in more of the same. Protectionism implies less competition, higher prices, rising inflation, and higher interest rates. Some of those foreign companies that previously couldn't wait to earn tax breaks by investing in the U.S. and hiring American workers are about to become a thing of the past.\n\nWhile global businesses have become accustomed to finding new markets and identifying ways to hedge risk, they are less adept at fundamentally altering their business models. Some U.S. businesses are already canceling plans to build foreign production facilities abroad. Some foreign businesses are already purchasing insurance in the event their U.S. investment proposals are not approved in the coming months. There is great unease about what the trade and investment regime will turn out to be 6 or 12 months from now, and with good reason. The paradigm shift that voters in the U.S., UK, the Philippines and elsewhere have ushered in is about to start sending shock waves around the world.\n\nIn 1990 I published an article entitled Why Political Risk Insurance Will Grow in the 1990s. At that time, the former Soviet Union had recently disintegrated, the Gulf War was about to commence, and there was general uncertainty about where the world was headed. I predicted at that time that political risk insurance (PRI) would grow dramatically because of enhanced demand. Indeed, it did. The PRI industry stands at a similar precipice today. With the looming possibility of trade wars, a deterioration in investment climates, and ever tightening lending standards, there is every reason to believe that, as much as the industry has grown - and that growth has been dramatic over the past 25 years - it also stands to grow dramatically in the coming 5-10 years.\n\nThis is both an opportunity and a challenge for the PRI industry, as well as those traders, investors and lenders who will utilize PRI to reduce their cost of capital and expand their business operations around the world. For the PRI industry, the challenge will be how to delicately balance a desire to underwrite more transactions with the need to impose even tighter underwriting standards. The temptation will be to incorporate a variety of long-term investment transactions and short-term credit transactions into underwriting portfolios, based on the many lessons learned as a result of previous claims. That temptation will be tempered, however, by the realization that history is no longer the teacher it once was. When paradigms shift, meaningfully predicting the future will become an even greater challenge.\n\nFor businesses, the desire to rely on PRI to strip out non-commercial risk from transactions will become greater than ever, for the same reason - to grow and generate ever greater revenue, deals must be done, even when the ground shifts beneath them. There will be ever greater competition for the product, but only those transactions with the best story to tell, and having the right combination of quality, tenor, size, and location, will receive coverage. Revenue in coming years will become increasingly associated with thought leadership and bravado, combined with deployment of the right risk management tools.\n\nIn ordinary times, PRI has proven to be an indispensable tool for many businesses that operate internationally in order to maintain growth and profitability. But this is no ordinary time; The winds of change are about to hit us like a hurricane. As the global trade and investment climate deteriorates, and becomes more unpredictable, demand for PRI should soar. The ability to manage cross-border risk through PRI -- and other insurance products -- will ultimately make the difference between those businesses that find a way to thrive in this era of disruption, or merely survive.\n\n*Daniel Wagner is Managing Director of Risk Cooperative and co-author of the new book Global Risk Agility and Decision Making.
Lou Dobbs guest Ed Rollins refers to sitting congresswoman @AOC as the little girl pic.twitter.com/pJyjaBGX91\n\nRepublican political strategist and campaign consultant Ed Rollins dismissively referred to 29-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) as the little girl with a big mouth.\n\nThat triggered a trademark zinger from the congresswoman, who called Rollins a walking argument for a 100 percent tax on misogyny.\n\nRollins told Fox News' Lou Dobbs on Friday: If you're going to put her out front with her mouth ... the little girl who wants pre-Reagan economics of 70 percent taxes, the Democratic women are basically going to be damaged.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said in a tweet that such attacks on women are apparently the best argument Republicans have in policy debates.\n\nGOP loves to insult my intelligence, yet offers *this* as their best + most seasoned opposition to my policy proposals.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this dude is a walking argument to tax misogyny at 100% 😉\n\n\n\nRepublicans rob everyone the opportunity of real policy debate by resorting to this. https://t.co/Yk3BTHbtxv — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 5, 2019\n\nBut what does Ocasio-Cortez know about tax policy? A lot, said the headline of an opinion piece Saturday in The New York Times by Nobel economics laureate Paul Krugman. A similar tax rate was imposed in the U.S. for 35 years after World War II, which included some of the most successful periods of economic growth in history, Krugman wrote.\n\nTax cuts for the ultra wealthy mean far less to them than cuts for people with modest incomes, Krugman noted. And extra money in millions of hands boosts spending.\n\nA policy that makes the rich a bit poorer will affect only a handful of people, and will barely affect their life satisfaction, since they will still be able to buy whatever they want, Krugman wrote.\n\nNobel economics laureate Peter Diamond — arguably the world's leading expert in public finance, according to Krugman — has calculated the optimum top tax rate at 73 percent. Several other experts back that up.\n\nSo Ocasio-Cortez, far from showing her craziness, is fully in line with serious economic research, Krugman added. Republican policy to keep taxes on the wealthy low, on the other hand, rests on research by … well, nobody, he added.\n\nKrugman's conclusion: Ocasio-Cortez definitely knows more economics than almost everyone in the GOP caucus.
The mooted GOP tax plan has drawn some positive attention from trade reformers because it's the first tax plan in decades to make serious moves designed to reduce America's trade deficit.\n\nUnfortunately, unless I'm totally missing something, it's also a seriously crazy document.\n\nSo crazy, in fact, that despite not being an ultra-partisan fanatic, I am forced to the conclusion that either the GOP leadership is even stupider than ordinary political cynicism would assume, or the plan is simply not meant in earnest. (Is it a trap for Trump, to discredit him if he's foolish enough to buy into it? Dunno. A trap for the idea of tax-based trade reform? Ditto. But either of these hypotheses would make more sense than the idea that they actually mean it.)\n\nNow it has many aspects, most of which I won't go into because its trade aspects alone are sufficient to rule it out as serious policy.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe GOP blueprint is basically a so-called border adjustable cash flow tax, a/k/a a territorial cash flow tax, a/k/a destination based cash flow tax (Twitter hashtag #DBCFT). Export sales are excluded from income, and imported products, services, and labor are not deductible.\n\nThe problem is that this results in a comically extreme disparity between the treatment of imported, domestic, and exported goods. Some examples:\n\n1. Domestic goods: ACME, Inc. sells $100K domestically, with $80K costs procured domestically - result is $20K taxable income. Results same as now.\n\n2. Imported goods: ACME sells $100K domestically, with $80K costs all imported - result is $100K taxable income because the imported inputs are not deductible.\n\n3. Exported goods: ACME sells $100K to foreign buyers, with $80K costs all domestic - result is $80K tax loss.\n\nSo it's a hyper-aggressive subsidy for exports. Boeing can sell a $100 million airplane to Air France, make $20 million in profit, and yet book it as an $80 million tax loss. It's the biggest corporate giveaway I've ever heard of.\n\nThis is so aggressive it will prompt corporations to do transactions that make no sense, simply to capture the tax loss. Profitable companies will buy up any exporting company, just to harvest their tax losses.\n\nIt's actually not so bad on the import side. Basically, it would force companies to pay their effective corporate tax rate on the value of imported goods. The average corporate tax rate is about 13%, so this would imply approximately a tariff of that amount. (To be fair, the average tax rate on importers is considerably higher, because importing doesn't offer as many loopholes as, say, running a hedge fund, so the de facto tariff would be more.)\n\nFundamentally, if you want to do something about the trade balance, it's problematic to focus on profits, rather than imports and exports themselves.\n\nFor example, what happens when Delta buys the plane Air France just bought in the example above? Because Air France is making the profit on the sale of the plane, and outside U.S. jurisdiction, there's nothing to discourage this. So Boeing will launder all its sales this way. And why shouldn't Delta just buy from Airbus, which is similarly outside U.S. jurisdiction? This tax only has leverage against imports done by American middlemen with profits to grab.\n\nSo what would happen? Here's a real-life case that occurred to me the other day:\n\n1. If I buy a pair of Chinese-made sunglasses from a stand on the Santa Monica Promenade, the landed cost of the glasses is not deductible to the guy who sells them to me, so he pays a very stiff tax for doing so.\n\n2. If I buy the same pair over EBay from a guy in Hong Kong, there's no U.S. middleman to take a tax hit, so there's no disincentive to buy imported glasses.\n\nImplication: a mad rush by consumers and businesses to establish direct import relationships with foreign suppliers. But this a) evades the tax and spoils the incentive, and b) has no rational economic purpose, so it undermines economic efficiency.\n\nSo put me on record this thing is probably too crazy to be real. It's quite likely House Speaker Paul Ryan is just using the public's current attention to the trade deficit as an excuse to get this plan in circulation with the real intention of dialing it back to something less kooky but still lavishly rewarding to his corporate sponsors.
NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images Elon Musk listens to President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, DC, on January 23, 2017.\n\nElon Musk spent the last decade building an electric car and solar panel company into a $41.7 billion empire aimed at loosening fossil fuels' grip on the global economy.\n\nBut the billionaire Tesla chief executive said he now supports former Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Rex Tillerson becoming secretary of state. Senators narrowly voted along party lines on Monday to confirm Tillerson's nomination.\n\nOn Tuesday, Musk tweeted a December editorial from The Economist arguing that Tillerson had the integrity to talk sense to his boss, President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese and threatened to pull out of the Paris climate accord.\n\nThis may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State, Musk wrote in the tweet.\n\nRex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team, he added. His team is now the USA.\n\nHe then said: I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise.\n\nUnder Tillerson, Exxon Mobil shifted away from its scorched-earth disinformation campaign denying the existence of global warming. During his confirmation hearings this month, Tillerson said he believes in climate change, though he rejected the overwhelming scientific consensus that emissions from burning fossil fuels are the chief cause. Still, in 2009, he publicly backed putting a tax on carbon, albeit as his preference to the cap-and-trade system then being debated in Congress.\n\nRex Tillerson supports a carbon tax. This is what is really needed to move the needle. https://t.co/6ne01TOzs1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 25, 2017\n\nMusk, by contrast, may be one of the strongest advocates for climate science in the Fortune 500. His companies depend on it. In November, shareholders gave Musk the green light to merge Tesla, known for its luxury electric vehicles, with SolarCity, the solar energy firm he ran with his cousins. Musk envisions the combined company as a one-stop shop for zero-emissions vehicles, and home electricity and heating systems.\n\nHis support for Tillerson may be more political than personal. Musk joined Trump's economic advisory team last month, along with the chief executives of General Motors, Uber Technologies and other big firms. He met with the newly sworn-in president on Monday to discuss the future of U.S. manufacturing, of which Tesla aims to be a big part. The company is building factories in Nevada and New York.\n\nSigh — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 25, 2017
WASHINGTON — It's Friday night, and rapper Too Short's Blow the Whistle is blaring inside of the only black-owned bar in D.C.'s predominantly white Dupont Circle neighborhood. Its patrons, drinks in hand, are enjoying various items from its Southern-influenced menu, like chicken and waffles and shrimp 'n' grits.\n\nBut this bar wants to be known for more than just another late-night spot in a city replete with them. It wants to be a space where black people can come together to freely express their whole selves, in a city where such spaces seem to be disappearing.\n\nThe Caged Bird, which opened its doors in July, is the newest bar that seeks to cater to black millennials in a city that was sued for discriminatory practices that promoted gentrification earlier this year.\n\nWashington, D.C., one of the blackest cities in America, has been experiencing an economic renaissance for nearly two decades — but that renaissance is considered nothing more than gentrification by longtime residents. According to the D.C. Chamber of Commerce's State of the Business Report, whiter and richer families are increasingly displacing low- and middle-income families. As affluent families move in, higher rents push out black residents, and black businesses leave with them.\n\nDerek S. Hyra, a public affairs professor at American University and author of Race, Class, and Politics in the Cappuccino City, says the District's redevelopment is disproportionately affecting communities of color.\n\nWith this economic boom, the tax base in Washington, D.C., has grown, but so has racial inequality, Hyra told HuffPost. There's a study by the Urban Institute that shows that white household wealth is 81 times that of black family wealth. There's immense inequality in the city.\n\nDupont Circle has been known as Washington's central neighborhood for gay life and business for decades. It is a trendy area filled with art galleries, bars, nightclubs and shops. Black business owners weren't seeing themselves represented in this vibrant area, prompting some entrepreneurs to plant roots in the neighborhood to try and attract black customers.\n\nTosin F/The Caged Bird The Caged Bird in Washington, D.C.\n\nBrandon Rule, one of the co-owners of The Caged Bird, knows how important it is to have a space for black people, by black people.\n\nWe wanted to combine the power of food, culture and community to foster an environment that welcomes and encourages artistic expression, cultural exploration and diverse experiences in hopes that, together, we can reimagine what's possible for our culture and community in D.C. and beyond, Rule told HuffPost.\n\nRule, 30, founded the bar with seven others who combined their resources to create a space, named in honor of Maya Angelou's famed memoir, that is 100 percent owned, operated, staffed and financed specifically by black millennials. It joined the roughly 2.6 million black-owned businesses in the United States, according to the United States Census Bureau.\n\nOn this night, the people inside The Caged Bird are choosing from the specially crafted menu at the venue for DMV Black Restaurant Week, the first of its kind celebrating the best black restaurants in the nation's capital.\n\nAndra AJ Johnson, a co-founder of the inaugural restaurant week, is a consultant for The Caged Bird.\n\nOur mission is about setting businesses to succeed by being able to reach the customers they need to reach, Johnson said, explaining the thought process behind creating restaurant week. Representation from an ethnic standpoint is low, and from a black standpoint, it's even lower. It's all about inclusivity.\n\nThat's partly why Kimberly Smith and Amaya Smith, founders of the Brown Beauty Co-Op, decided to open their business in Dupont Circle. The duo recently celebrated the grand opening of their store in December and chose the neighborhood because of the lack of representation in the area.\n\nIt was important to me that if I started a business, I want it to be in the District. Not outside on the outskirts or the suburbs, but be here, Kimberly Smith, 38, said.\n\nErin Martin/@bagladies The Brown Beauty Co-Op in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe pair wants the co-op to be known as more than just a shop to purchase beauty supplies. They hope the Brown Beauty Co-Op will also be a safe space for all women of color and a hub that provides mentorship for emerging black entrepreneurs and businesses.\n\nThey plan to provide newer brands shelf space to showcase their products and provide feedback from consumers and industry professionals to help them thrive in the market.\n\nWe want to help other businesses, Kimberly Smith said. Not every beauty business can be in a Bloomingdale's or Target, but there are so many people that are making really great products, and we want to give that retail experience to other small, emerging brands.\n\nWe wanted to show other people that we can have a successful business here in Dupont Circle that is catered to us. We chose this space, not only because it was needed, but to show that we can still be successful even when we target ourselves.
Lord Porter Lord Porter, chairman of the LGA, said council chiefs have repeatedly sounded the alarm on funding\n\nThe vast majority of town halls will put up council tax and hike charges as 80% fear for their financial survival, according to a new survey. An astounding 95% of English authority bosses plan a council tax hike while 93% said they will increase charges to make ends meet, the LGiU think tank discovered. The greatest immediate pressure on budgets came in children's services (32% of councils) followed by adult social care (28%), and housing and homelessness (19%), the report found. Adult social care was the greatest long-term pressure (38%), the survey said. Lord Porter, Local Government Association Chairman, said councils had been warning a cliff-edge was looming for council at the end of the decade. Some councils continue to be pushed perilously close to the financial edge, Porter said. Many will have to make tough decisions about which services have to be scaled back or stopped altogether to plug funding gaps. Extra council tax raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face. This means many councils face having to ask residents to pay more council tax while offering fewer services as a result.\n\nFunding pressures\n\nIt came as Labour announced the party will help councils bring services back in house, set up new energy companies and develop local economies using a team of experts. Speaking in Preston Thursday, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell will unveil the new 'Community Wealth Building Unit'. Preston City Council is reported to have returned almost £200m to the local economy and supported more than 1,600 jobs by using the town's anchor institutions and council contracts to and develop cooperatives. Tory austerity has blighted our communities and forced councils to cut and privatise many public services that we all rely on, he will say. The next Labour government will end austerity and properly fund local authorities, instead of cutting back and passing the buck like the Conservatives are doing. But we cannot afford to wait until we are in power nationally. Tory peer Lord Porter said local authorities face a funding gap of more than £5bn by 2020, but children's services was the area most in need of urgent attention. He said: The LGA has warned about the urgent need to address the £2bn funding gap facing children's services. A child is being referred to council children's services every 49 seconds on a daily basis and councils started more than 500 child protection investigations every day last year - up from 200 a decade ago. This unprecedented surge in demand shows no sign of abating. Council tax can be hiked by up to 3% this year, in line with inflation, before a referendum is triggered, while authorities can also levy an additional precept to raise money for spending on social care. The majority of the councils who responded to the survey (59%) were Tory-run authorities.\n\nPA Archive/PA Images Labour's Andrew Gwynne says there is a cross-party consensus for reform of local government funding\n\nJonathan Carr-West, chief executive of LGiU, said: Councils are on the edge. They are for the most part holding services together (though a significant minority are not). But they can only do this this by raising council tax, increasing charging and draining their reserves. The system is unsustainable and needs far more fundamental reform than is presently on offer. It's simply not acceptable that we don't know how local government will work post 2020. Councils are calling for assurances around funding for the next three years and for a fundamental redesign of the finance system. At present government is offering neither. That has to change. Andrew Gwynne, Labour's Shadow Communities Secretary, added: These findings show that after almost eight years of cuts, councils are facing unprecedented pressures to balance their books. When faced with choices; of where to cut, and where to invest - the government has failed to show that they understood the real life, human challenges facing this country. There's now a widespread consensus, across the political divide, that how we fund local public services desperately needs reform, but the Government does not appear to be listening to the sector.\n\nPA Wire/PA Images Communities Secretary Sajid Javid
LAS VEGAS ― President Donald Trump's choice to stay at his own Las Vegas hotel each night during the western states swing that wraps up Friday likely cost taxpayers a million extra dollars as well as diverted thousands of them into his own cash registers.\n\nPrevious presidents on extended trips away from the White House typically stayed in the city of each day's final event, or traveled to the city of the following day's first event. Trump, instead, traveled back to Las Vegas each night from California, Arizona and Colorado to overnight at his Trump International Hotel ― requiring several extra hours' flying time on Air Force One, a plane that costs taxpayers about a quarter-million dollars per hour in the air.\n\nAt this point in his presidency, there's no way to look at it other than Donald Trump is using his position and taxpayer dollars to make money for his businesses, said Jordan Libowitz with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. This is beyond a conflict of interest. This is corruption, plain and simple.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about his decision to return to Las Vegas each night just before he left for California, he claimed he had nothing to do with it.\n\nLargely, the schedule is set by the Secret Service. We do what they want us to, he told reporters at Joint Base Andrews just before the plane's departure. I don't set the schedule. I have nothing to do with it.\n\nIt's unclear, however, what Trump meant. Previous presidents visited the same western states numerous times, for example, and never once stayed in a Trump property.\n\nA Secret Service spokesperson told HuffPost: The U.S. Secret Service works in conjunction with the administration on all presidential and First Family visits as our primary concern is the safety and security of those that we protect.\n\nTrump's White House did not try to defend the accuracy of Trump's claim, and instead argued that the decision to use Trump International Hotel Las Vegas as a base actually saved taxpayers' money.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump pumps his fist as he arrives at McCarran International Airport on Feb. 18 in Las Vegas.\n\nIf the president had stayed in three different cities over three different nights that would mean three different advance teams traveling out ahead, three different USSS teams traveling ahead, it would mean impacting traffic with road closures in three different cities, taking rooms for security and communications at three different hotels, and various other necessities for presidential travel in three different cities, said a senior White House official on condition of anonymity. The hotel the president is in is well known to USSS in terms of security and the footprint needed. In short, doing it the way we're doing it saved money for the government and Las Vegas is most central to all the stops. Only a small contingent of required staff with specific roles stay at the hotel with the president. The majority of staff stay at a different hotel. All hotel stays are at the government rate.\n\nThat analysis, though, ignores the single biggest driver of presidential costs: the use of Air Force One.\n\nAccording to a report by the Government Accountability Office last year, the Air Force unit that operates the modified Boeing 747 normally used as the presidential aircraft spent $4.4 million for four round trips from Andrews to Palm Beach in early 2017 ― which works out to $273,063 for each hour of flight time.\n\nHad Trump held the same events but done so in a geographically logical order ― starting in Beverly Hills and finishing in Colorado Springs, but overnighting each day in the city where he would begin the following morning ― Trump would have spent four fewer hours aboard Air Force One, thereby saving taxpayers about $1.1 million.\n\nThe anonymous White House official's claim that more motorcades would have been required also does not tell the whole story. A full motorcade ― including the presidential limousine, staff vans and various specialized trucks ― is needed in any city where Trump is traveling, regardless of whether it will be used to move him from an airport to an event site and back, or to an overnight hotel and then to the event site the next day.\n\nWhat's more, advance teams scout out a city and motorcade routes are closed to traffic on any presidential visit, regardless of whether it is for a brief visit or an overnight stay.\n\nIndeed, the repeated overnight trips to Las Vegas may have forced the Secret Service and other support personnel to keep a motorcade there for a full four days, rather than move it to the site of an upcoming presidential trip.\n\nThis week is not the first time Trump used presidential trips to spend time at his own properties, even though it added considerable travel and security costs for taxpayers. In 2018, for example, he spent two days between official meetings in London and a Helsinki summit with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin at his own resort in Scotland, rather than waiting in London. And last summer, he insisted on staying at his resort on the west coast of Ireland on the days surrounding his visit to Normandy, France, even though it required several additional hours on Air Force One.\n\nPrecisely how many taxpayer dollars wind up in Trump's pocket from these stays cannot be determined. The White House, despite numerous queries from HuffPost over a period of months, refuses to disclose how many executive branch employees stay with Trump when he visits his own properties and how much it is costing taxpayers. And how much of that revenue winds up as profit flowing to Trump also is not known because Trump reneged on a campaign promise ― and decades of precedent ― by refusing to disclose his tax returns.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Trump's business charged Secret Service agents as much as $650 a night for rooms at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and $17,000 a month for a cottage at Trump's golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nBased on these and other invoices obtained by various groups using lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act, Trump has likely funneled at least several million dollars of taxpayer dollars into his own cash registers in his first three years in office.
WASHINGTON ― There's a way for the Trump administration to continue food assistance during the government shutdown ― at least according to one legal theory.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that because the agency overseeing food aid is shut down, benefits for 38 million Americans may disappear after February. President Donald Trump has said the shutdown could continue for months or a year.\n\nThe people who get food benefits will go hungry if this happens. The late 20th century expansion of the food stamp program helped eradicate starvation in the U.S.\n\nBut Professor David Super, an expert on administrative and welfare law at Georgetown University Law School, argues that the conventional wisdom misreads the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program's underlying statute.\n\nSuper points to the text of the Food and Nutrition Act, which indicates more than once that anyone who is poor enough to qualify for benefits is supposed to get them. Assistance under this program shall be furnished to all eligible households who make application for such participation, the law says.\n\nWhile it may seem obvious that people should get benefits for which they're eligible, the wording is significant. It echoes the entitlement language in the Social Security Act that preserves health and retirement benefits for seniors even if the federal government is partially shuttered.\n\nSuper is not alone in his analysis.\n\nWe have long agreed with some legal experts that SNAP's authorizing law requires SNAP benefits continue during a shutdown, Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in an email. The CBPP is an influential liberal think tank.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, did not respond to requests for comment. The agency has been mostly silent about what will happen to food assistance during a prolonged shutdown, except for a late December press release that only indicated it had funds for January's benefits. It's not clear what would happen in February if the government remains closed.\n\nIf the USDA reversed itself and said benefits would continue despite a prolonged shutdown, it would be in good company. The Internal Revenue Service had said it would collect tax revenue but not issue refunds ― until Monday, when officials said the agency would dish out refunds after all.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Past actions by Congress on food stamps could authorize the government to continue to offer food stamps even during a shutdown, according to legal experts.\n\nIf the shutdown continues and USDA determines it does not have the authority to extend SNAP in the absence of congressional action, many low-income households would be at risk of serious hunger and hardship, Rosenbaum wrote in a blog post, adding that food banks would see dramatic increases in needy families.\n\nEnding SNAP would not only cause material hardship for the program's beneficiaries ― most of whom are very young, elderly or disabled ― it would also rattle the economy.\n\nJoe Brusuelas, an economist with the accounting firm RSM, estimated a full year without SNAP benefits would reduce gross domestic product by as much as 1 percent. (For comparison, most analyses of the new Republican tax law said it would boost GDP by less than 1 percent in its early years.)\n\nA spokesman for House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) declined to say whether the chairman agreed that food aid could continue to operate despite the shutdown.\n\nIt's not just the entitlement language that should protect SNAP benefits. Though lawmakers have appropriated money for SNAP annually, Super argues they have also amended the statute over the years to make SNAP less contingent on appropriations.\n\nThe conventional wisdom, that SNAP must terminate benefits absent an appropriation, was correct under the statute as it once existed, Super said in an email. But, as often happens, the conventional wisdom failed to update as Congress repeatedly amended the statute.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of President Donald Trump's failed presidential campaign played key roles in orchestrating the Washington rally that spawned a deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol, according to an Associated Press review of records, undercutting claims the event was the brainchild of the president's grassroots supporters.\n\nA pro-Trump nonprofit group called Women for America First hosted the Save America Rally on Jan. 6 at the Ellipse, an oval-shaped, federally owned patch of land near the White House. But an attachment to the National Park Service public gathering permit granted to the group lists more than half a dozen people in staff positions for the event who just weeks earlier had been paid thousands of dollars by Trump's 2020 reelection campaign. Other staff scheduled to be on site during the demonstration have close ties to the White House.\n\nSince the siege, several of them have scrambled to distance themselves from the rally.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Jan. 6, 2021 file photo, Trump supporters participate in a rally in Washington.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\nThe riot at the Capitol, incited by Trump's comments before and during his speech at the Ellipse, has led to a reckoning unprecedented in American history. The president told the crowd to march to the Capitol and that you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.\n\nA week after the rally, Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the first U.S. president ever to be impeached twice. But the political and legal fallout may stretch well beyond Trump, who will exit the White House on Wednesday before Democrat Joe Biden takes the oath of office. Trump had refused for nearly two months to accept his loss in the 2020 election to the former vice president.\n\nWomen for America First, which applied for and received the Park Service permit, did not respond to messages seeking comment about how the event was financed and about the Trump campaign's involvement. The rally drew tens of thousands of people.\n\nIn a statement, the president's reelection campaign said it did not organize, operate or finance the event. No campaign staff members were involved in the organization or operation of the rally, according to the statement. It said that if any former employees or independent contractors for the campaign took part, they did not do so at the direction of the Trump campaign.\n\nAt least one was working for the Trump campaign this month. Megan Powers was listed as one of two operations managers for the Jan. 6 event, and her LinkedIn profile says she was the Trump campaign's director of operations into January 2021. She did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Jan. 6, 2021 file photo people arrive to attend a rally in support of President Donald Trump.

They deactivated or locked down their social media profiles, removed tweets that referenced the rally and blocked a reporter who asked questions.\n\nCaroline Wren, a veteran GOP fundraiser, is named as a VIP Advisor on an attachment to the permit that Women for America First provided to the agency. Between mid-March and mid-November, Donald J. Trump for President Inc. paid Wren $20,000 a month, according to Federal Election Commission records. During the campaign, she was a national finance consultant for Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee between the president's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nWren was involved in at least one call before the pro-Trump rally with members of several groups listed as rally participants to organize credentials for VIP attendees, according to Kimberly Fletcher, the president of one of those groups, Moms for America.\n\nWren retweeted messages about the event ahead of time, but a cache of her account on Google shows at least eight of those tweets disappeared from her timeline. She apparently removed some herself, and others were sent from accounts that Twitter suspended.\n\nOne of the messages Wren retweeted was from Stop the Steal, another group identified as a rally participant on a website promoting the event. The Jan. 2 message thanked Republican senators who said they would vote to overturn Biden's election victory, including Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas. She also retweeted a Jan. 1 message from the president promoting the event, as well as promotional messages from one of the president's son, Eric Trump, and Katrina Pierson, a Tea Party activist and a spokesperson for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nWren did not return messages seeking comment, and locked her Twitter account after the AP reached out to her last Monday to ask her about her involvement in the Trump rally and the tweets she had removed. Several days later, she blocked the AP reporter.\n\nMaggie Mulvaney, a niece of former top Trump aide Mick Mulvaney, is listed on the permit attachment as the VIP Lead. She worked as director of finance operations for the Trump campaign, according to her LinkedIn profile. FEC records show Maggie Mulvaney was earning $5,000 every two weeks from Trump's reelection campaign, with the most recent payment reported on Nov. 13.\n\nMaggie Mulvaney had taken down her Twitter account as of last Monday, although it reappeared after an AP reporter asked her about the account's removal. On Sunday, the same day the AP published this report, she blocked that AP reporter on Twitter.\n\nMaggie Mulvaney retweeted several messages on Jan. 6, including one from the president that urged support for the Capitol Police. Trump's Twitter account has been suspended, but the message could be seen in a cache of her Twitter account captured by Google. She also retweeted a message from her uncle, urging Trump to address the nation.\n\nMaggie Mulvaney did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nThe insurrection at the Capitol prompted Mick Mulvaney to quit his position as Trump's special envoy to Northern Ireland. He told CNBC a day after the assault that remaining in the post would prompt people to say 'Oh yeah, you work for the guy who tried to overtake the government.'\n\nThe leaders of Women for America First aren't new to politics.\n\nAmy Kremer, listed as the group's president on records filed with Virginia's state corporation commission, is one of the founding mothers of the modern day tea party movement, according to her website. Her daughter, Kylie Jane Kremer, is the organization's treasurer, according to the records.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Jan. 6, 2021 file photo Amy Kremer, Chairwoman of Women for America First, speaks in Washington, at a rally in support of President Donald Trump.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nThe IRS granted Women for America First tax-exempt status as a social welfare organization a year ago, with the exemption retroactive to February 2019. The AP requested that the group provide any tax records it may have filed since then, but received no response.\n\nIn a statement issued the same day rioters attacked the Capitol, Amy Kremer denounced the assault and said it was instigated after the rally by a handful of bad actors, while seeming to blame Democrats and news organizations for the riot.\n\nUnfortunately, for months the left and the mainstream media told the American people that violence was an acceptable political tool, she said. They were wrong. It is not.\n\nThe AP reviewed social media posts, voter registrations, court files and other public records for more than 120 people either facing criminal charges related to the Jan. 6 unrest or who, going maskless during the pandemic, were later identified through photographs and videos taken during the melee.\n\nThe review found the crowd was overwhelmingly made up of longtime Trump supporters, including Republican Party officials, GOP political donors, far-right militants, white supremacists, off-duty police, members of the military and adherents of the QAnon myth that the government is secretly controlled by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophile cannibals.\n\nVideos posted on social media in the days following the Capitol attack shows that thousands of people stormed the Capitol. A Capitol Police officer died after he was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher as rioters descended on the building and many other officers were injured. A woman from California was shot to death by Capitol Police and three other people died after medical emergencies during the chaos.\n\nTrump's incendiary remarks at the Jan. 6 rally culminated a two-day series of events in Washington, organized by a coalition of the president's supporters who echoed his baseless accusations that the election had been stolen from him. A website, MarchtoSaveAmerica.com, sprung up to promote the pro-Trump events and alerted followers, At 1 PM, we protest at US Capitol. The website has been deactivated.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Donald Trump Jr. arrives on stage as Kimberly Guilfoyle speaks Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington, at a rally in support of President Donald Trump called the Save America Rally.

Details of the DC PROTEST will be coming soon, it adds, and also lists a series of bus stops between Dec. 27 and Jan. 6 where Trump backers can Join the caravan or show your support.\n\nKimberly Fletcher, the Moms for America president, said she wasn't aware the Trump campaign had a role in the rally at the Ellipse until around New Year's Day. While she didn't work directly with the campaign, Fletcher did notice a shift in who was involved in the rally and who would be speaking.\n\nWhen I got there and I saw the size of the stage and everything, I'm like, 'Wow, we couldn't possibly have afforded that,' she said. It was a big stage. It was a very professional stage. I don't know who was in the background or who put it together or anything.\n\nIn addition to the large stage, the rally on the Ellipse featured a sophisticated sound system and at least three Jumbotron-style screens projecting the president's image to the crowd. Videos posted online show Trump and his family in a nearby private tent watching the rally on several monitors as music blared in the background.\n\nMoms for America held a more modest Save the Republic rally on Jan. 5 near the U.S. Capitol, an event that drew about 500 people and cost between $13,000 to $14,000, according to Fletcher.\n\nJustin Caporale is listed on the Women for America First paperwork as the event's project manager. He's identified as a partner with Event Strategies Inc., a management and production company. Caporale, formerly a top aide to first lady Melania Trump, was on the Trump campaign payroll for most of 2020, according to the FEC records, and he most recently was being paid $7,500 every two weeks. Caporale didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nTim Unes, the founder and president of Event Strategies, was the stage manager for the Jan. 6 rally, according to the permit paperwork. Unes has longstanding ties to Trump, a connection he highlights on his company's website. Trump's presidential campaign paid Event Strategies $1.3 million in 2020 for audio visual services, according to the campaign finance records. The company declined to comment for this story.\n\nAnother person with close ties to the Trump administration, Hannah Salem, was the rally's operations manager for logistics and communications, according to the permit paperwork. In 2017, she took a hiatus from the consulting firm she founded and spent three years as senior White House press aide, executing the media strategy for President Trump's most high-profile events, according to her company bio and LinkedIn profile.\n\nLast week, within minutes of an AP reporter sending her a LinkedIn message asking about her involvement in and understanding of what happened on Jan. 6, Salem blocked the reporter and did not respond to questions.\n\n___\n\nSmith reported from Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York and Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report.
We've all be there, in the beginning, you make your first Facebook Business page or Twitter account, you fill out your profile, and then upload your company logo (calling it branding), then... you become lost.\n\nYou aren't sure what to do, or how to make it work for your small business. So you schedule some posts about some killer advantages your company has and... nothing.\n\nThen you try to be more personable, so you share pictures of your cat fluffy.\n\nThe internet likes cats right?

Instead, join a conversation that's already active talking about your industry. You can also answer someone's question that they put out there, without the alterer motive of driving them to your website, or getting them on the phone to have them become a client.\n\nSocial media is all about building relationships over time, and you can't build a relationship with someone if all you are doing is thinking of yourself and your bottom line.\n\nHave fun with it, but keep it relevant.\n\nPart of the value of social media is to be entertaining.\n\nThis might sound like the exact opposite of what you want as a company, but it's a perfect opportunity to build true customer loyalty.\n\nSocial media gives you the opportunity to get in front of your clients without them being defensive about you selling to them. Which means you have to give them something more than a way to join your newsletter or how to use one of your products.\n\nMaking your posts fun, inspiring, or entertaining is how you can do that.\n\nIf you're a realtor that brings their dog everywhere, incorporate that, share pictures of your puppy being your assistant to your business. But if your adorable pet has nothing whatsoever to do with your company, then it doesn't belong on social.\n\nEven if Fluffy gets more shares and likes than anything else you are posting, it's not relevant, and you will only gain a follow of people interested in animal posts instead your business, which doesn't help you grow as a company.\n\nDon't have an adorable pet-related to your business, or have a business about a topic most people aren't too crazy about?

A business partner of U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in investigations, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.\n\nEvgeny Freidman, a Russian immigrant who is known as the Taxi King, will avoid jail time and will assist government prosecutors in state or federal investigations, the newspaper report said, citing a person briefed on the matter.\n\nThe New York State Attorney General's Office said in a press release that Freidman had pleaded guilty to a criminal charge on Tuesday in an Albany, New York, courtroom, but it made no mention of whether he was cooperating with prosecutors.\n\nFreidman has been Cohen's partner in the taxi business for years, even after New York City regulators barred Freidman last year from continuing to manage taxi medallions, the New York Times said.\n\nFreidman, when asked by Reuters about the report, declined in a text message to answer any questions about cooperating with prosecutors or the terms of his agreement.\n\nThis is me taking responsibility for my actions! ... Michael is a dear dear personal friend and a passive client! That's it! ...I hate that I have been grouped in this runaway train that I am not a part of! Freidman said by text.\n\nFreidman's lawyer, Patrick Egan, declined to comment on the Times report.\n\nFreidman had been accused of failing to pay more than $5 million in taxes and five other criminal counts each carrying maximum prison sentences of up to 25 years. In pleading guilty to a single count of criminal tax fraud, Freidman will be sentenced to five years' probation, the attorney general's office said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the New York state attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York are investigating Cohen for possible bank and tax fraud, possible campaign law violations and perhaps other matters related to Trump's presidential campaign, a person familiar with the probe has said.\n\nThe investigation into Cohen arose in part from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into possible collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia, something that Trump has repeatedly denied.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Florida launched an investigation Wednesday into an upscale nursing home amid reports that it administered coronavirus vaccines to wealthy donors and members of a country club along with its residents and employees.\n\nThe Washington Post and New York Post both reported that MorseLife Health System, a nonprofit that operates a nursing home and assisted living facility in West Palm Beach, has given vaccinations to donors and members of the Palm Beach Country Club, whose foundation has donated at least $75,000 to MorseLife since 2015, tax records show.\n\nThe newspapers reported that the vaccinations were organized by MorseLife CEO Keith Myers and New Jersey-based developer David Mack, who is a member of various MorseLife boards and chairman of the country club foundation's board. The vaccines were distributed at the Joseph L. Morse Health Center, which is on David S. Mack Drive.\n\nMeredith Beatrice, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis, said in an email to The Associated Press that the governor has been extremely clear that vaccine should only be administered to Florida's seniors 65 and older, frontline health care workers, and long-term care facility residents and staff.\n\nWe are investigating this situation and will hold any bad actors accountable, she wrote.\n\nGeorge Shea, a spokesman for David Mack and his brother, Bill Mack, said in a statement Wednesday that the Macks were helping MorseLife in its efforts to distribute the vaccine and did nothing wrong. He said the vaccinations followed state protocols by limiting those given to non-employees to people who are 65 and older.\n\nHe denied that the distribution was targeted at Palm Beach Country Club members. Shea did not respond to reports that the Macks were among those getting vaccinated. The brothers are both about 80 years old.\n\nMyers did not respond to a phone message left Wednesday at his MorseLife office. The company on its website says, our goal is to ensure that older adults enjoy full, rewarding lives in an atmosphere of luxury, outstanding service, and compassionate care.\n\nFlorida state Rep. Omari Hardy, a Democrat whose district includes the MorseLife compound, said it's appalling that the wealthy were given exclusive access to the vaccine while older residents of his district and throughout Florida have been struggling to get shots. Phone systems for scheduling appointments have crashed and older residents of some counties where the vaccine has been distributed on a first-come, first-served basis have been forced to camp out overnight to get inoculated.\n\nHardy said the situation is emblematic of how many wealthy people have gotten richer during the pandemic, while many poor and middle class Americans have lost jobs and sometimes even their homes. He said many of his constituents have contacted him to get access to the vaccine for themselves, a parent or grandparent, but there is nothing he can do.\n\nI am a constitutional officer of the state of Florida, but I can't pull any strings to help them — nor should I be able to, Hardy said. But these people can buy themselves a place at the front of the line.

ollinka via Getty Images Yes, these are still taxed.\n\nThanks to five men in the state Senate, women in Tennessee are likely going to have to keep paying higher taxes when they go to the store to buy tampons than they pay on their other groceries.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the state Senate Finance Ways and Means Revenue Subcommittee voted against a Democratic bill (SB 2285) to lower sales taxes on tampons, diapers and over-the-counter drugs from 7 percent to 5 percent, which is the amount charged on food.\n\nState Sens. Steve Dickerson (R), Ferrell Haile (R) and Thelma Harper (D) voted for the measure. Sens. Doug Overbey (R) and John Stevens (R) voted no, while Sens. Joey Hensley (R) and Bill Ketron (R) abstained. The four members who did not support it did not return requests for comment.\n\nThat same morning, the subcommittee also voted unanimously on SB 1610 to exempt gold and silver coins and bullion from sales taxes.\n\nIn other words, women have to pay taxes on necessary hygiene products, but people can buy all the gold bars they want tax-free.\n\nSimon Critchley/Getty Images State legislators want to make sure these are exempt from sales taxes.\n\nThe subcommittee vote doesn't necessarily mean that the tampon tax bill is dead. The legislators voted to give it a negative rating when it advances to the full committee, while SB 1610 received a positive rating. So in theory, the full 11-member committee could decide to buck the subcommittee members.\n\nHarper is the only woman on the subcommittee. She is also the only woman on the full committee. From a screenshot of the Senate Finance, Ways and Means website:\n\nTennessee General Assembly\n\nState Sen. Sara Kyle (D), one of the sponsors of SB 2285, said the state should not tax a woman for having a menstrual cycle, according to The Tennessean. She ultimately would like to see the tax eliminated altogether.\n\nWe are shy to talk about periods, but they are a fact of life for 1 in 2 people, and feminine hygiene products are required for human dignity, added state Rep. Sherry Jones (D), the other sponsor of the bill. We shouldn't tax a woman to have her dignity, especially considering the gender wage gap. With this bill, we at least recognize the necessity with a lower rate equal to the sales tax on food.\n\nThe vast majority of states require people to pay sales tax on feminine hygiene products -- even though they often allow exemptions for necessities -- and there is a movement nationwide to change some of the laws.\n\nPresident Barack Obama recently weighed in on the issue, saying that while he didn't know exactly why tampons were so often taxed as luxury items, he had a hunch.\n\nI suspect, he said, it's because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed.\n\n\n\nWant more updates from Amanda?

President-elect Joe Biden named Merrick Garland as his nominee for attorney general, the transition team said Thursday. If confirmed, Garland will take over a demoralized Justice Department that has abandoned bedrock principles and priorities, and come under withering attack from President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nGarland, a former federal prosector who lead the investigation into the Oklahoma City bomber, was nominated to the Supreme Court by former President Barack Obama following Antonin Scalia's 2016 death. The Republican-controlled Senate refused to hold a hearing on his nomination for months, citing the presidential election. His pending nomination died in early 2017, after 293 days.\n\nThe transition team announced other Justice Department nominees: Lisa Monaco for deputy attorney general, Vanita Gupta for associate attorney general and Kristen Clarke for assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. They said the nominees will be introduced at an event Thursday afternoon.\n\nGarland will take over a Justice Department that Trump sought to weaponize against his political opponents and use as his personal law firm. Trump has fired or pushed out a number of key department officials, most famously former FBI Director James Comey. Trump appointees have used the Justice Department's power in an overtly political fashion, even if they've resisted Trump's desire to wield the department's prosecutorial power as a blunt political weapon.\n\nThe nominee will face the challenge of determining how the Justice Department will approach potential criminal investigations into Trump and members of his administration. They will also face the prospect of rebuilding components like the Civil Rights Division, which abandoned key issues like police reform and focused on controversial religious liberty cases and attacks on college affirmative action programs. They'll also have to deal with the long-term consequences of Trump's attacks on the FBI, which has gutted Republicans' confidence in the nation's premier law enforcement organization. Biden's nominee may also have to figure out how to combat a rise in right-wing domestic terrorism cases, some of which have been directly inspired by the outgoing president's rhetoric against his political enemies and Muslims.\n\nIn addition, Biden's nominee will have to deal with the delicate question of how to handle the ongoing tax investigation into the new president's son, Hunter Biden, which is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware. The nominee will have to reassure the American public that there won't be political interference in the probe, perhaps by walling off the investigation. Republicans, the vast majority of whom were unconcerned with Trump's repeated attempts to improperly interfere in Justice Department matters, might even call for a special counsel to assure the probe's independence.\n\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder, who had to rebuild the Justice Department after controversies during the George W. Bush administration, told HuffPost that Biden understands that he needs to give the attorney general the space that he or she needs to restore integrity and the independence of the Justice Department.\n\nThe department has been taken off a road that I think it's basically been on since the Nixon administration, where there's been that separation of the Justice Department from the White House, Holder told HuffPost ahead of the election. You really need to look at the department as a whole. The people there, both in the field and at Main Justice, their motives have been called into question, their patriotism has been called into question, and all of that has to be dealt with. The department has got to be restored to what it was and what it must always be and clearly not what it is now.\n\nAttorney General William Barr, who replaced former Attorney General Jeff Sessions after he was forced out following the 2018 midterm elections, went to bat for Trump during Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, releasing a misleading summary of the Mueller report which controlled public opinion about the report's findings about Trump's actions for weeks. Barr, who holds strong views of executive power, was also accused of covering up Trump's actions in the Ukraine scandal that led to the president's impeachment by attempting to hide from Congress a whistleblower complaint about Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president. Barr announced he would leave the Justice Department on Dec. 23.\n\nMany career Justice Department employees who held on for four years of the Trump administration were likely to depart had Trump been reelected and able to mold the department into an even more overtly political organization.\n\nBiden, according to The New York Times, plans to keep FBI Director Chris Wray unless he's fired by Trump before the president leaves office. Wray, a Republican who once said he'd quit before breaking the law for the president, has upset Trump with his descriptions of the loosely organized anti-fascist movement known as antifa, his description of the limited impact of voter fraud, his discussion of Russian election interference, and his refusal to provide Trump's campaign with a last-minute boost by violating DOJ standards and publicly announcing some sort of politically advantageous investigation. Wray has defended the bureau from Trump's attacks, but he's been quiet post-election as Trump has made broad, sweeping claims about mass voter fraud, which law enforcement officials say could inspire attacks by right-wing extremists convinced that the election was illegitimate.\n\nAnother major question facing Biden and his attorney general is the fate of the nation's 94 U.S. attorneys across the country, most of whom are Trump appointees. Those officials, who serve as the nation's top federal prosecutors in federal districts, have sometimes been allowed to stick around until their replacements are confirmed. Trump's decision to ask the presidentially appointed holdover U.S. attorneys to resign set off some controversy in March 2017, not long before Comey's firing.\n\nUntil the Trump administration, modern attorney general nominees had typically received strong bipartisan support. Even Sessions voted for Holder back in 2009, when Holder was confirmed 75-21.\n\nHolder told HuffPost that Biden's attorney general pick has to come prepared with a targeted approach to handle the most egregious misconduct to come out of the Trump administration and hold people accountable but not get bogged down in a way that could derail the entire administration.\n\nThere's such a wealth of inappropriate conduct coming from the Trump administration that I think that they're actually going to have to prioritize what they'll look at, Holder said. If you looked at all the negative things, all the inappropriate things, you would spend an inordinate amount of time focusing on the inappropriate conduct by Cabinet members, White House officials, the president himself, and that could inhibit the ability of the new administration to focus on what the American people want them to focus on. But, Holder added, You can't simply let it go. People need to be held accountable.\n\nLiza Hearon contributed to this article.

On a recent flight from Boston to Atlanta, the woman sitting next to me introduced herself and asked me what I do for a living. I told her I work for a company that helps universities internationalize, and helps international students succeed at those universities.\n\nWhy on earth would you want to do that? she asked. Those international kids are taking seats away from American students.\n\nI explained to her that across America, college enrollment rates have been gradually declining after peaking in 2011. Last year alone, enrollment dropped 1.4 percent. This, coupled with a continued decline in state expenditures, has resulted in many colleges and universities scrambling to fill seats. International students not only provide a positive cultural impact, but provide a compelling economic benefit to the campuses and communities in which they reside.\n\nI was able to change my seatmate's mind, but overall there remains a lack of knowledge on the broader impact these international students provide. Like any industry facing rising costs and falling income, colleges and universities have been looking for ways to grow revenue. In 2012, I co-authored a paper with Jeff Denneen called The Sustainable University. In it, we argued that in order to address the unsustainable financial models that many colleges and universities face, we need to focus on new programs and innovations that unlock real value.\n\nIn the five short years since then, the risks we wrote about – rising tuition costs, decreased public funding and the financial shortfalls – have all worsened. But we have also seen that strategic and thoughtfully implemented programs that appeal to international students not only improve the educational experience of domestic students, but also provide much needed revenue for universities.\n\nRecent research supports this thesis. For example, a working paper published last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research reports that increases in the enrollment of foreign students generate substantial gains in university tuition revenues, which partially offset the loss in appropriations [from state funding cuts]. The report concludes that in the absence of the pool of foreign students, many universities would have faced larger cuts to expenditures and potentially greater increases in in-state tuition charges.\n\nThe economic impact on the national level is significant as well. Across the U.S., the more than 1 million international students who studied in the U.S. last year generated over $35 billion for the U.S. economy. This represents a direct inflow of foreign capital to support U.S. universities and state and local economies. Looking at job creation, the numbers are equally compelling – international students were found to support over 400,000 jobs nationally. This equates to three U.S. jobs created or supported for every seven enrolled international students.\n\nEven more encouraging, the financial benefits of enrolling international students extend beyond the campus itself. A research study just released by the Brookings Institution analyzed 16 regions and concluded that in areas that would otherwise likely face economic hardship as a result of industrial job loss, colleges and universities act as an antidote, anchoring tax revenue, a wide variety of jobs, and often supporting industries that benefit from an educated and young workforce.\n\nWhen skeptics like my seatmate hear these facts, support for international study programs rises dramatically. At a time of great concern over the fiscal health of our colleges and universities, examples of win-win solutions are hard to come by. And this economic story goes hand-in-hand with the powerful societal benefits of international education programs. American students benefit from attending schools with a greater diversity of ideas and perspectives from their international peers, while international students return to their home countries with a world class education and a better understanding of America and our values.\n\nThe economic and cultural benefits of international education are overwhelming and only getting better. For the future of our education system and our economy, this is one secret that needs to get out.\n\nTom Dretler is Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Shorelight Education.
Sean Kilpatrick/CP Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer stands during question period on Parliament Hill on Feb. 28, 2018.\n\nFederal Conservatives wasted no time blaming Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for Kinder Morgan's decision to suspend work on its Trans Mountain pipeline, even as the company lauds federal support for the project.\n\nTory Leader Andrew Scheer released a statement Sunday targeting Liberals — and not the British Columbia NDP government of John Horgan — for what he called devastating news for the energy sector.\n\nThe blame for this development rests squarely on the shoulders of Justin Trudeau. He has failed to take a single concrete step to ensure this project is completed. All he has done is give us empty words with no action, Scheer said.\n\nThe Tory leader argued Trudeau did not champion the Trans Mountain pipeline and suggested the federal plan to phase in a price on carbon pollution only makes such projects harder. Scheer noted that Trudeau said the oilsands need to be phased out, remarks for which the prime minister said he misspoke last year.\n\nScheer also criticized Trudeau for refusing to greenlight the Northern Gateway pipeline and said the prime minister killed the Energy East pipeline with last minute rule changes and regulations.\n\nTories similarly hammered Trudeau after TransCanada cancelled the Energy East project last year, in part because the federal government wanted regulators to consider the potential greenhouse gas emissions of producing and processing the oil that the pipeline would carry.\n\nConsidering the Prime Minister's track record of failure, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Kinder Morgan is now suspending work on the Trans Mountain Expansion project, he said.\n\nCanadians deserve a government that will actually get the job done.\n\nKinder Morgan appreciates 'support shown by the federal government'\n\nYet when Kinder Morgan announced the decision to halt non-essential activities on the project Sunday, the company cited B.C.'s continued active opposition and legal challenges to the project.\n\nWe appreciate the support shown by the Federal Government and the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and are grateful for the strong endorsements among the majority of communities along the route and 43 Indigenous communities, as well as customers, contractors and unions, Kinder Morgan Canada's CEO Steve Kean said in a release.\n\nThe fact remains that a substantial portion of the Project must be constructed through British Columbia, and since the change in government in June 2017, that government has been clear and public in its intention to use 'every tool in the toolbox' to stop the Project.\n\nThe uncertainty created by BC has not been resolved but instead has escalated into an inter-governmental dispute.\n\nHuffPost Canada reached out to Trudeau's office to respond to Scheer's claim.\n\nThe Liberal government approved the project, which would triple the amount of oil flowing from Alberta to Burnaby, B.C., in 2016. The prime minister has repeatedly said the pipeline will be built but has faced calls from Tory MPs to be more vocal in advocating for the project.\n\nLast week, hundreds of anti-pipeline protesters demonstrated outside a Trudeau fundraising event in Vancouver. A young Indigenous leader interrupted the prime minister's speech to accuse Trudeau of lying to his people.\n\nA day later in Fort McMurray, Alta., Trudeau promoted his government's efforts to get pipelines built and reiterated that the Kinder Morgan project would go forward.\n\nMoving our resources to greater markets is a greater priority, not just for Albertans, but for Canadians, and we are going to do that in a responsible way, he said.\n\nTrudeau is facing pressure from Alberta Premier Rachel Notley to take concrete action to resolve the dispute.\n\nA federal approval of a project must be worth more than the paper it's written on,'' Notley said Sunday.\n\nJason Kenney, the former Tory minister who now leads Alberta's United Conservative Party, is calling on the feds to withhold transfer payments to B.C.\n\nIf Justin Trudeau is going to punish Saskatchewan by withholding transfers b/c it doesn't want to punish its citizens with a carbon tax, then why isn't the fed govt also withholding transfer payments to BC to demonstrate that Ottawa means business? #ableg#UCP#cdnpoli#CPC — Jason Kenney (@jkenney) April 9, 2018\n\nAfter Kinder Morgan announced its decision Sunday, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr released a statement calling on the B.C. government to end all threats to delay the Trans Mountain expansion.\n\nAt a press conference on Parliament Hill, Carr said it was no time for any province to be reckless with the financial well-being of Canadians and for the fabric of the federation itself.\n\nYet when asked what steps the federal government could take to break the impasse, Carr merely said all options are on the table.
A private buyer in the U.S. has purchased a historical letter in which Indian independence leader Mohandas K. Gandhi muses about his personal relationship with Jesus and Christianity.\n\nThe typed document, which contains Gandhi's handwritten signature, sold to a buyer in the Northeast for $50,000 on Friday, according to Nathan Raab, president of the historical document dealer Raab Collection in Ardmore, Pa. The company told HuffPost it does not disclose the identity of its buyers or sellers.\n\nIn 1926, an American Christian religious elder, Milton Newberry Frantz, wrote to Gandhi, inviting the Hindu leader to read an article Frantz had written about Christianity. On April 6 of that year, Gandhi wrote back to Frantz from an ashram in Gujarat.\n\nGandhi wrote that he felt Jesus was one of the great teachers of mankind. However, he couldn't subscribe to the Christian belief that Jesus was more than that.\n\nNathan Raab / Raab Collection The letter from Mohandas K. Gandhi to Milton Newberry Frantz, dated April 6, 1926.\n\nGandhi tells Frantz:\n\nDear Friend, I have your letter. I am afraid it is not possible for me to subscribe to the creed you have sent me. The subscriber is made to believe that the highest manifestation of the unseen reality was Jesus Christ. In spite of all my efforts, I have not been able to feel the truth of that statement. I have not been able to move beyond the belief that Jesus was one of the great teachers of mankind.\n\nGandhi goes on to state that it's important to respect all people's faith traditions, since all religions are based on a common thread of love and mutual esteem.\n\nHe writes:\n\nDo you not think that religious unity is to be had not by a mechanical subscription to a common creed but by all respecting the creed of each? In my opinion, difference in creed there must be so long as there are different brains. But who does it matter if all these are hung upon the common thread of love and mutual esteem?\n\nGandhi grew up in a Hindu family that was primarily devoted to the worship of the god Vishnu. He was also introduced at a young age to Jainism, a religion that emphasizes nonviolence.\n\nFor much of his adult life, Gandhi earnestly studied the religions of the world. He read the Quran, Jesus's Sermon on the Mount and the writings of Leo Tolstoy on Christianity. He was deeply influenced by the Bhagavad Gita, one of the core religious texts in Hinduism, and remained a committed Hindu for the rest of his life.\n\nBy the time he wrote the letter to Frantz, Gandhi had already emerged as a leading figure in India's movement for independence from British rule. He had inspired thousands of followers to boycott British institutions and encouraged many to replace imported British goods with items produced in India.\n\nBettmann via Getty Images Mahatma Gandhi marches to a coastal village in 1930 to collect salt, in violation of British law in India.\n\nAfter being arrested and jailed for sedition in 1922, Gandhi retreated from political prominence for a few years. The letter to Frantz was written during this time.\n\nGandhi reemerged as a political leader by late 1928 and in 1930 launched the Salt March, a massive nonviolent protest against the British salt tax.\n\nWhen India achieved independence in 1947, Gandhi strongly opposed the country's partition into India and Pakistan, and he urged Hindus and Muslims to live together peacefully. He was killed on Jan. 30, 1948, by a Hindu fanatic who was angry about Gandhi's efforts to negotiate with Muslims.
In November 2013, I found out that a handful of my New York condo neighbors were renting out their units through Airbnb. This was unacceptable and I wrote an article in a major New York newspaper that helped fan a movement.\n\nWe made presentations to city council and the legislature and, three years later, the State of New York has essentially banned short-term rentals by Airbnb or others.\n\nI've also kept Airbnb out of my Toronto building and have written about the so-called sharing economy (which includes Uber) and the public concerns they raise.\n\nMany others ― San Francisco, Berlin, Barcelona, to name a few ― have followed New York by restricting or banning both Airbnb and often Uber too.\n\nThe central issue is not economic. It's that these platforms enable users to get lower cost services by bypassing laws, zoning, regulatory, insurance, taxation and safety requirements. Such restrictions are there for good reason, notably those involving safety.\n\nIn Canada, the conversation about this business model is just beginning. This week, the Institute for Hospital and Tourism Research at Ryerson U's Ted Rogers School of Management held a symposium about Airbnb. Its figures show that 1,121 units and 1,305 units each night are booked in Vancouver and Toronto respectively, according to Assistant Professor Chris Gibbs.\n\nThe potential is enormous. In Toronto, some 28% of dwellings are condos, up from 5% a few years ago.\n\nThe discussion involved pro and con but everyone agreed that all levels of government and condo boards plus landlords must address the issues. This doesn't mean a ban necessarily, but better financial and legal arrangements can be forged as is the case in some cities.\n\nMost importantly, however, both companies as constituted represent public safety threats. Strangers in buildings are a hazard because of access to residents, children, corridors, stairwells, gyms, pools, playgrounds, garages, storage areas, and lounges.\n\nSome unscrupulous owners have rented space out short-term to prostitutes, for orgies and noisy parties. In Toronto, about three years ago, a meth lab blew up in a condo building in Liberty Village due to the activities of someone who shared an apartment. Other egregious examples of damages or bad behavior have occurred.\n\nBut Airbnb doesn't protect guests either by not vetting hosts. Recently, Las Vegas police arrested a host for filming with hidden cameras the bedrooms of his Airbnb rental for purposes unknown, possibly blackmail or pornography. Guests also have no knowledge as to who else has keys to their space.\n\nThen there's Uber. In Toronto, it poses a safety risk because drivers are not thoroughly vetted nor are their cars routinely subjected to safety checks. It is nothing more than digitized hitchhiking and in Toronto recently one of its drivers was charged with sexually assaulting a passenger. There have been multiple incidents around the world, including assaults and rapes.\n\nAnother concern is tax evasion.\n\nThe Canadian Revenue Agency should force Airbnb, Uber and others to issue T4 income slips to all Airbnb hosts or Uber drivers so they pay taxes on their income. These T4s should also be sent to landlords or condo boards so they know what's going on as well as with other levels of government.\n\nOther obligations are dodged. Airbnb hosts commercialize their units and, as such, should pay higher mortgage rates, condo fees, and property taxes. (In New York, longer-term tenants must be approved and are assessed at least 25% more in condo fees for wear and tear to the building caused by their rentals. Insurance and mortgages are more expensive for rental units too.)\n\nAnother issue is that about 52% of the Airbnb rentals in Toronto are hosts who are doing this for multiple units, said Ryerson's Professor Gibbs.\n\nThis points out that they are simply running illegal hotels and, as a result, San Francisco and other cities have demanded that Airbnb impose a one home, one host rule.\n\nThen there are the rights of other owners or neighbors in multiple unit dwellings where short-term rentals occur. Condo boards that allow or don't deal with short-term stays endanger or inconvenience other residents due to noise, pet, smoking or other violations.\n\nThen there are squatters' rights. In one New York case, one guest refused to leave the apartment on the basis he was disabled. Eviction was almost impossible. The same could happen in Canada.\n\nOntario is reviewing its Condominium Act and should insist that condo boards have tools to deal with this problem. A board should be forced to have a policy on short-term rents, stipulate conditions, and levy higher fees, but only if 80% of owners approve. Conversely, they should be allowed to ban Airbnb and their competitors and enforce that.\n\nAs for Uber, cities should require drivers to meet identical taxation, licensing, insurance, maintenance and training requirements as must traditional taxi and limo drivers.\n\nPeople have a right to rent out their residence (apartment), but not to afflict their neighbors, the public, or to bypass laws. People have a right to hire someone to drive them around, but not if those people are untrained, untaxed and uninspected and can harm the public.\n\nGovernments must catch up to these proliferating websites to stop abuses.\n\nFirst published National Post March 11, 2017
Charlie Riedel/The Associated Press States across the country are attempting to raise the minimum age to buy a handgun. Gun control advocates are looking to capitalize on the momentum after the Parkland school shooting last year.\n\nBy Matt Vasilogambros\n\nAfter a significant year for the gun control movement in 2018, momentum for stricter firearms laws in states across the country likely will accelerate this year.\n\nIn states where Democrats made big gains in the November elections, lawmakers are quickly moving legislation to raise the buying age for guns and to ban assault-style weapons. Other measures, including bills to limit gun access for domestic abusers and people who may harm themselves or others, have increasing bipartisan support.\n\nThe national conversation about guns is changing, said Robert Spitzer, a professor of political science at the State University of New York College at Cortland and the author of five books on gun control.\n\nThere's been a flood of new legislation, he said. With more state legislatures in Democratic hands, with the sense you can enforce new gun laws and it not be a stigma, there's not only momentum but concrete evidence that those who want to see stronger gun laws are making headway.\n\nAlready this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states have introduced at least 50 major gun control bills, including measures to expand background checks and ban lethal accessories like bump stocks, according to a count by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun control organization co-founded by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the Arizona Democrat who survived a 2011 shooting.\n\nTo be sure, Republicans who still control most state legislatures likely will pass gun rights legislation. At least 26 state bills would significantly expand gun access, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nNorth Dakota, for example, is moving a bill to boost school security using armed guards, and several other states are following suit.\n\nThe Parkland impact\n\nStudent survivors of the February 2018 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead helped galvanize a national movement for stricter gun laws. In 2018, 27 state legislatures passed 67 new laws aimed at restricting access to guns.\n\nIn the six years prior, states had enacted nearly 600 gun laws, and nearly two-thirds of those were backed by the National Rifle Association, according to data compiled by Stateline.\n\nThat shift played out in the November midterms, when federal and statewide candidates promising gun control won in red and blue states. Lawmakers will carry that momentum into the new legislative session.\n\nGun industry officials, who generally oppose efforts to restrict firearm access, recognize the changing political landscape. Larry Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an advocacy group representing the firearms and ammunition industry, said the next year of gun-related legislation will be a mixed bag.\n\nIt comes as a surprise to no one that Democrat-controlled statehouses are less advantageous to the firearms industry, he said. We'll see more restrictive gun laws, but we might see improvement to right-to-carry laws in other states in the country.\n\nKeane later added, People have been writing about the demise of the Second Amendment for a long time. Politics ebbs and flows.\n\nNew gun control targets\n\nNew York hadn't passed a comprehensive gun control package since the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in neighboring Connecticut. The legislature in 2013 passed a law that limited high-capacity magazines, implemented universal background checks and revoked the gun licenses and weapons of the severely mentally ill.\n\nDemocrats, after winning control of the state Senate in November, immediately started work to approve more bills.\n\nThe legislature in January passed six measures that ban bump stocks, extend waiting periods for gun purchases, prevent teachers from carrying guns in schools and allow law enforcement to remove guns from people judged to pose a danger to themselves or others. The bills passed largely along party lines and were signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.\n\nIn California, newly elected Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters he would support limiting the number of guns Californians can purchase in a month, among other gun control proposals.\n\nAs one of his first acts as Illinois' newly elected governor, Democrat J.B. Pritzker signed legislation Jan. 17 that further regulates gun stores throughout the state by requiring certifications.\n\nDuring the signing ceremony, Pritzker said he wanted to tackle more gun control legislation, including a ban on bump stocks and trigger cranks — devices that allow a semi-automatic weapon to fire automatically.\n\nWhile several states are moving forward with their bans, the Trump administration has made the possession of the devices illegal starting in late March.\n\nThe Illinois State Rifle Association is preparing a lawsuit against the state over the new store regulation law. Richard Pearson, the group's executive director, said with Democrats in charge of the legislature and the governorship, it's difficult for gun rights groups to block regulation efforts.\n\nThe legislature went very anti-gun, and the governor is very anti-gun, he said. It's going to be a tough fight, there's no question about it.\n\nLast year showed that Democrats could run on gun control and win despite opposition from the National Rifle Association, said Nico Bocour, the state legislative director at the Giffords Law Center.\n\nAt the national level, Giffords' political action committee endorsed 95 winning U.S. House candidates, some of them in deep red states such as Kansas and Georgia. Gun control groups outspent the NRA by nearly $2 million in congressional elections, according to records compiled by Open Secrets.\n\nThe NRA did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDemocrats now have a majority in the U.S. House, and they are looking to pass universal background checks in the coming months. But such restrictions are highly unlikely to pass in the upper chamber, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.\n\nThe Senate also blocked President Barack Obama's gun control package in 2013, following the Sandy Hook shooting. Significant legislative action on gun control remains in the states.\n\nNow, state lawmakers are introducing gun control legislation even in states that have not taken up such measures in the past, Bocour said: 2019 is looking like it will be as successful, if not more successful than 2018.\n\nWe will be working with lawmakers in more states and more legislation than we have ever done before, she said. We're certainly seeing an increase in interest.\n\nBipartisan groups of lawmakers in Arizona, Kentucky, Oregon and Texas are seeking to pass measures to ban people convicted of domestic abuse from purchasing and possessing firearms. Just last year, 12 states passed similar laws.\n\nLawmakers in Nevada are considering bans on bump stocks, attempting to join the eight states that passed similar measures last year. States such as Maryland, New Mexico and Pennsylvania are considering strengthening background checks.\n\nAnd efforts to ban untraceable ghost guns, like those that are 3D-printed, are moving forward in Delaware, Maryland and Oregon.\n\nPushing 'Red flag' laws\n\nState efforts to pass red flag laws this year are especially likely to succeed, Bocour said. Such measures allow family, household members, or local law enforcement officials to petition for a court order allowing police to seize weapons from people who they think might harm themselves or others.\n\nLast year, eight states enacted such laws. Five of those were signed by Republican governors. Now, lawmakers of both parties in nearly a dozen states, including Colorado, Maine, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Pennsylvania, are considering similar legislation.\n\nSince Maryland's red-flag law took effect Oct. 1, state law enforcement has received at least 360 requests to remove firearms from residents considered to pose a risk, said Montgomery County Sheriff Darren Popkin, who led state sheriffs in implementing the law through new trainings and rewriting of forms.\n\nFive of those requests involved potential school shootings, he said. Maryland judges approved around half of the requested seizures after evidentiary hearings, Popkin said.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind this is saving lives, he said. Gun-safety laws are really a priority for law enforcement when we know somebody has made a threat to themselves or a threat to someone else, and they have access to firearms.\n\nGun rights advocates, like Keane at the National Shooting Sports Foundation, say they may support red-flag laws, but have concerns about due process.\n\nWe think it's a good idea to give law enforcement more tools, Keane said. We have no problem with the concept of these laws, but we think they should be written carefully since this is a fundamental constitutional right.\n\nAmong critics of red-flag legislation is Arkansas state Sen. Trent Garner. The Republican said that in his state, such a bill has almost zero chance of getting out of committee and zero chance of passing into law.\n\nI have strong reservations against them, he said, explaining his concern about regulating guns generally. I don't think there's much support. Even the Democrats in Arkansas are conservative.\n\nGarner supports legislation that wouldn't require a permit to carry a concealed weapon and has authored a bill that would make the shotgun the official gun of Arkansas.\n\nWe have a state gem: the diamond, a state bird: the mockingbird — so I wanted to make the shotgun the state gun, he told Stateline in an interview. Arkansas, he said, is famous for its duck hunting.\n\nIn Virginia, the legislature's slim Republican majority quickly blocked an attempt by Democratic lawmakers last month to pass red-flag legislation, along with several other pieces of gun control legislation pushed by Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.\n\nOne Republican lawmaker, state Sen. Amanda Chase, stood on the floor of the chamber armed with a .38 special on her hip during recent a debate. Gun rights advocates in Virginia called the bill a slippery slope, possibly leading to future bills that would allow law enforcement to seize guns of people who aren't mentally ill.\n\nNRA flexes its power\n\nGun rights advocates have improved chances in some states this year. The NRA helped defeat moderate Democrats in the U.S. Senate, including Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. The Parkland students also faced a disappointing loss in their home state with the victory of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nConservative states are eager to loosen gun restrictions, said Spitzer of SUNY Cortland.\n\nIn late January, South Dakota became the latest state to allow its residents to carry handguns without a permit. Republican lawmakers in states such as Iowa, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia are considering similar measures.\n\nTo combat school shootings, states including Kentucky are weighing measures to arm teachers and increase the number of armed school guards.\n\nLast month, the North Dakota state Senate passed a bill that would allow school districts to fund safety measures, including armed guards, by collecting additional property taxes. The bill now heads to the state House.\n\nIn South Carolina, a proposal to add a 7 percent sales tax on guns to fund school resource officers was quickly dismissed by the state's Republican governor.\n\nGun rights activists also see hope in the U.S. Supreme Court, which will review a New York City law that prevents residents from carrying their guns outside their homes.\n\nThe court likely will strike down the law, Spitzer said, with the addition of conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe majority is going to use it as an opportunity to expand gun rights, Spitzer said, and use it as a legal basis to strike down more gun laws in the future.\n\nIn Connecticut, the gun industry advocacy group National Shooting Sports Foundation's Mark Oliva, a public affairs manager, said he was encouraged by the court's decision to take up the case. It was its first major Second Amendment case since the court upheld the right to possess firearms, striking down a strict Washington, D.C., gun law in 2008, Oliva said.\n\nThey've been treating the Second Amendment like a second-class right for too long.
The rise in inequality is widening at an alarming rate. Top 1 percent controlling 95 percent of the overall wealth is causing the rest of Americans to head to the poor house. America's financial elite has put a stranglehold on American citizens to the point of determining the quality of their life (or lack of it). They are effectively controlling the country's economic and political agenda through their powerful lobbies and monetary contributions to politicians and decision makers of their choice.\n\nMillions of workers struggling to make a living by working on minimum wages are turning the country into something akin to a modern day slavery. There are 62% of citizens that have less than $1,000 in savings and are one paycheck away from the street; the American dream has come to an end; the progression of inequality is rapidly eroding America's middle-class into impoverished masses. It may not be long before the rise of discontent will give rise to social unrest potentially causing destabilization of the very foundation upon which the American society was conceived and built. A recent Gallup survey showing 47% of Americans would vote for a President who was a socialist. This should be seen as a wake up call.\n\nA noted economist, Joseph E. Stiglitz, wrote recently: America is becoming a more divided society - divided not only between whites and African Americans, but also between the 1% and the rest, and between the highly educated and the less educated, regardless of race.\n\nIt's high time to realize what may lie ahead. People with decision making power should realize, that necessary economic reforms must be implemented as soon as possible. Mitigating citizens' economic inequality should be top of the list.\n\nHere are five suggestions to mitigate the challenges:\n\nEnd Federal Reserve Monopoly\n\nAfter 7 years of post-recession slow growth, numerous quantitative easing (QE) stimuli, and a doubling of U.S. federal debt, the economy is barely limping on at a stall speed. According to industry experts such as Lacy Hunt, since the introduction of unconventional and untested monetary policy operations like QE, an impressive amount of empirical evidence has emerged that casts considerable doubt on their efficacy. Ex-voting member of the Federal Reserve, Richard Fisher went even further. He told a rare bit of truth-ness in a CNBC interview last year; What the Fed did, and I was part of it, was front-loaded an enormous market rally in order to create a wealth effect...and an uncomfortable digestion period is likely now. The wealth effect did not benefit an average American. In fact, America's middle-class lost nearly 30% of its wealth.\n\nEver since its inception, privately controlled Fed's monetary policies have been benefiting mostly the rich elite enabling them to widen the gap of inequality to historical levels. The Fed's time has passed. By admitting their own mistakes, it is becoming clear that the present day economy is dictating the Feds' policies and not the other way around. The Fed should be abolished and the monetary policies of America put into hands of elected politicians who must find a way to lessen inequality amongst its citizens.\n\nIncome and Assets Taxation of Rich Americans\n\nIntroducing steep taxes on short-term stock market trading and/or outright prohibition on high frequency trading would be a good start, but a serious way to combat inequality is progressive taxation of the super-rich income and their assets, both at home and abroad. Two or three percent increase would bring hundreds of billions of dollars into the public purse, the money that could be used to rebuild or improve municipal infrastructures, create quality jobs, help young Americans get an affordable education, and lower the national debt.\n\nRestrict Overseas Inversions\n\n\n\nTax avoidance by some of the richest and biggest corporations, which are using various loopholes to move their headquarters to various off-shore locations in order not to pay taxes, should be banned and declared illegal. Over the last decades, billions of dollars supposed to be paid on account of taxes, were successfully moved out of the country and pocketed by directors of such corporations. The theory that such untaxed money is used to start new enterprises and create jobs for Americans proved to be totally flawed. Rich are not starting new businesses that create more jobs. Instead, by-and-large, they end up hoarding their tax-avoided funds in their offshore accounts ... or ... buying out small start-ups to stifle the entrepreneurship that might compete with their hegemony. Morally and justly speaking, this money is tax payers' money that should be returned to the public purse for the benefit of the country.\n\nBring Jobs Back to America\n\nAmericans should no longer support overseas economies such as China and others by buying their products that can be made just as inexpensive and more efficient in America. For example, the advent of 3D copier and other robotic technology should be used to entice millions of unemployed Americans to start their own businesses by producing goods now imported from overseas. Days of mega-size ships, loaded with containers up to their chimneys, pulling into American ports should come to an end.\n\nTax Offshore Buyers of Residential Real Estate\n\nJudging by the extraordinary appreciating values of some urban centers such as San Francisco, LA, San Diego, Denver, Miami and Atlanta, foreign nationals that are able to (in many cases illegally) smuggle monies out of their own countries, mostly from China, Russia, Malaysia and others, are now out-bidding Americans with ease, driving real estate prices to higher levels than the pre-crash prices of 2007. If America does not curtail the foreign buying of American residential real estate, which has tripled since 2005, there may not be another cyclical correction to provide Americans with a chance of purchasing their homes. Charging any non-American citizen duty stamp on the purchase of residential property, is the only way to put a damper to rich foreigners snatching homes away from Americans.
This year, Americans will be asked to participate in the 2020 census, a process that occurs every 10 years. While you should expect to be contacted by the U.S. Census Bureau in the coming weeks (and maybe you already have), it's also a time to watch out for scammers pretending to represent the census.\n\nThe Census Bureau will be contacting Americans in a variety of ways, including phone calls, letters and even Census Bureau workers who will come to your home, said Steven Weisman, a lawyer, professor, author and expert in identity theft and cybersecurity. And as a part of the census, you will be asked for certain types of personal information.\n\nThat makes the census a perfect vehicle for identity thieves to pose as census workers in an effort to lure you into providing personal information that will be used to make you a victim of identity theft, said Weisman.\n\nIn a recent example, 92-year-old Dallas resident Robert Cooper received an authentic-looking census package in the mail in December. The form asked for personal details, such as age, education and who else lived with him. It also asked for his and his wife's Medicare numbers, the Dallas Morning News reported.\n\nBelieving he was responding to official census mail, Cooper provided those numbers and mailed back the form. Unfortunately, he fell victim to a scam.\n\nSince it is mandatory for all households to participate in the census and since the census collects very detailed and sensitive personal information, it makes for quite an attractive target for scammers to take advantage of, said Attila Tomaschek, a data privacy expert with ProPrivacy.com. The good news, he said, is that if you know what to look out for, you can significantly reduce your chances of becoming a victim and having your sensitive information or identity stolen.\n\n1. Census Mail Scams\n\nBecause the Census Bureau's first contact is usually through the mail, scammers will try and beat them to the punch and send out faux census documents to unsuspecting recipients.\n\nYou may receive false census documents meant to coax personal information from you, as Cooper did. Similarly, you could receive forms that are designed to look like official census mail, but are intended to confuse you and lead to inaccurate census counts. For example, Republicans were caught last month sending out mailers titled 2020 Congressional District Census, in envelopes labeled Do not destroy, official document, which mirrored the look of the official census form. However, these forms were not related to the census at all.\n\nAnd though there's plenty of paper-based fraud going on, criminals are also taking mail scams high-tech.\n\nOne trick for collecting personal information through the mail is sending postcards with a QR code and asking recipients to scan the code with their smartphones in order to access the census survey on a webpage, according to Rachel Willson, investigative coordinator in client relations for The Smith Investigation Agency. When the code is scanned, it loads malware onto the recipient's device.\n\nOne easy way to tell if your census mail is a scam? The return address is for a city other than Jeffersonville, Indiana, where all official census forms are mailed, according to Census.gov.\n\n2. Door-To-Door Census Scams\n\nIf you don't fill out a form or self-report your census information by web, phone or mail, a census taker will come to your door to interview you some time in the next couple of months. If you aren't around, they'll come back a few times, or they may resort to asking neighbors for information about your household. This is all perfectly normal and legal.\n\nHowever, you should be wary of answering the door for anyone you don't know. That person could be a scammer posing as an official census taker.\n\nIf someone knocks on your door claiming to be a census taker, ask them to present their official Census Bureau-issued photo ID to ensure they are legitimate, Tomaschek said. That ID will include a Department of Commerce watermark and expiration date.\n\nYou can then verify the agent's name in the Census Bureau's staff directory online, Tomaschek said. If the person at your door can't produce a valid ID or isn't listed in the directory, they are likely a scammer and should be turned away and reported.\n\nThe Census Bureau urges people with suspicions to call 844-330-2020, and to contact local police if they learn a home visitor doesn't work for the census.\n\n3. Census Phone Scams\n\nAnother way scammers may try to extract personal information from you is by calling and asking you to report your household information over the phone (as well as sensitive data that the actual census would never ask for).\n\nOne of the ways scammers trick you into thinking you're talking with an official representative of the U.S. Census Bureau is through call spoofing. This involves manipulating Caller ID so that your phone displays the call as coming from the census, when it's really a robocaller or other kind of scammer.\n\nThe Census Bureau does sometimes initiate phone calls to people in order to collect census data, but you can always independently verify that you're talking to a real census rep. You can call the Census Bureau's National Processing Center to confirm the identity of the census agent. If the caller cannot be identified, do not under any circumstances provide the caller with any information Tomaschek said.\n\n4. Online Census Scams\n\nWhen it comes to scams, the web is the Wild West. There are a multitude of ways criminals can trick you into sharing personal information ― even when you think you are not.\n\nPhishing emails, for example, have long been a tool used by scammers to collect personal information or install malware on the user's device. The census is no exception; a popular phishing tactic for census scammers is sending an email requesting that you take a survey. However, the Census Bureau will never contact you via email to complete a survey.\n\nIf you do receive an unsolicited email purporting to be from the Census Bureau and requesting you to complete a survey, you can bet that you're dealing with a scam artist, Tomaschek said. The best thing to do in such a case is to delete the email.\n\nBy no means should you click on any links or download any attachments in the email. The links will undoubtedly lead to a phishing site designed to harvest your personal information and any attachments will likely contain malware, Tomaschek said.\n\nSocial media is another place online where census scams can pop up. Earlier this month, for instance, Donald Trump's reelection campaign ran a series of Facebook ads directing users to fill out the Official 2020 Congressional District Census. Those ads did not link to the official census form, however, and instead sent users to a Trump campaign website. People were prompted to submit personal information and donate to the campaign.\n\nIf you are directed to the Census Bureau website from an email, social media post or another website, always check the web address to verify that you are indeed on https://www.census.gov/. There should also be a padlock icon in the address bar, which indicates that the site is secure.\n\nIf the web address doesn't end in '.gov' and if the address doesn't start with 'https' or the padlock icon doesn't appear in the address bar, regardless of how official it may appear to be, you're likely dealing with a census scam website designed to harvest your data and steal your information, Tomaschek said. If you end up on a site like this, leave immediately.\n\n5. Census Job Scams\n\nFinally, if you're job hunting, keep an eye out for scams related to census jobs. Scammers are posting job applications for people interested in temporary positions with the Census Bureau.\n\nAs with so many scams, this scam exploits a kernel of truth, which is that the Census Bureau is looking for people to fill thousands of temporary positions, Weisman said. However, the scammers are using this as an opportunity to make you a victim of identity theft or steal your money.\n\nIn one version of these scams, you might be asked to pay an application fee in order to apply for a job. The truth is that no federal agency, including the Census Bureau, charges an application fee, Weisman said.\n\nOther census job scams ask you for your bank account information in order to set up a direct deposit for your wages, only to use that information to steal directly from your bank account. Or you may be asked for your Social Security number for purposes of tax withholding. Although legitimate employers need this information, it's not required until well into the hiring process, after you've spoken with other employees in person.\n\nIn order to make sure that you are actually applying for a real job with the Census Bureau, you should go exclusively to the Census Bureau's official website and job application page, Weisman said.\n\nSpotting A Scam: What The Census Bureau Will And Won't Do\n\nIt's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the census process so you understand how and when you'll be contacted. Knowing the means by which the Census Bureau does and does not collect information is ultimately the key to being able to spot ― and evade ― a potential census scam, Tomaschek said.\n\nRegardless of how you're contacted by the Census Bureau, however, there are a few pieces of information the census will never ask for.\n\nFirst, the Census Bureau will never ask you to provide financial details such as your credit card numbers, Social Security number, bank account numbers, banking passwords or your mother's maiden name.\n\nThough participating in the census is important and technically mandatory, you can't be fined or jailed for not completing your census survey. If someone claiming to be a census agent requests such information from you and/or threatens you with fines or jail time for not complying, you will know that you are dealing with a scammer, Tomaschek said.

When politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. (From left to right) Rebekah Mercer, Robert Mercer, Stephen Bannon When politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. Last December, about a month before Donald Trump's inauguration, Rebekah Mercer arrived at Stephen Bannon's office in Trump Tower, wearing a cape over a fur-trimmed dress and her distinctive diamond-studded glasses. Tall and imposing, Rebekah, known to close friends as Bekah, is the 43-year-old daughter of the reclusive billionaire Robert Mercer. If Trump was an unexpected victor, the Mercers were unexpected kingmakers. More established names in Republican politics, such as the Kochs and Paul Singer, had sat out the general election. But the Mercers had committed millions of dollars to a campaign that often seemed beyond salvaging. That support partly explains how Rebekah secured a spot on the executive committee of the Trump transition team. She was the only megadonor to frequent Bannon's sanctum, a characteristically bare-bones space containing little more than a whiteboard, a refrigerator and a conference table. Unlike the other offices, it also had a curtain so no one could see what was happening inside. Before this point, Rebekah's resume had consisted of a brief run trading stocks and bonds (including at her father's hedge fund), a longer stint running her family's foundation and, along with her two sisters, the management of an online gourmet cookie shop called Ruby et Violette. Now, she was compiling lists of potential candidates for a host of official positions, the foot soldiers who would remake (or unmake) the United States government in Trump's image. Rebekah wasn't a regular presence at Trump Tower. She preferred working from her apartment in Trump Place, which was in fact six separate apartments that she and her husband had combined into an opulent property more than twice the size of Gracie Mansion. Still, it quickly became clear to her new colleagues that she wasn't content just to chip in with ideas. She wanted decision-making power. To her peers on the executive committee, she supported Alabama senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general and General Michael Flynn for national security adviser, but argued against naming Mitt Romney secretary of state. Her views on these matters were heard, according to several people on and close to the transition leadership. Rebekah was less successful when she lobbied hard for John Bolton, the famously hawkish former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, to be deputy secretary of state. And when Bolton was not named to any position, she made her displeasure known. I know it sounds sexist, but she was whiny as hell, says one person who watched her operate. Almost everyone interviewed for this article, supporters and detractors alike, described her style as far more forceful than that of other powerful donors. Rebekah Mercer is rarely photographed. However, occasionally she can be found in the background of news photos, uncredited in the captions. Here she is arriving at Trump Tower on December 8, with Nick Ayers and Kellyanne Conway. DREW ANGERER/GETTY IMAGES But then the Mercers aren't typical donors in most senses beyond their extreme wealth. (The exact number of their billions is unknown.) Robert Mercer is a youthful-looking 70. As a boy growing up in New Mexico, he carried around a notebook filled with computer programs he had written. It's very unlikely that any of them actually worked, he has said. I didn't get to use a real computer until after high school. Robert went on to work for decades at IBM, where he had a reputation as a brilliant computer scientist. He made his vast fortune in his 50s, after his work on predicting financial markets led to his becoming co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world's most successful quantitative hedge funds. A longtime colleague, David Magerman, recalls that when Robert began working at Renaissance in 1993, he and his wife, Diana, were grounded, sweet people. (Magerman was suspended from Renaissance in February after making critical comments about Robert in The Wall Street Journal.) But money changed all that, he says. Diana started jetting off to Europe and flying to their yacht on weekends. The girls were used to getting what they wanted. At Renaissance, Robert was an eccentric among eccentrics. The firm is legendary for shunning people with Wall Street or even conventional finance backgrounds, instead favoring scientists and original thinkers. Robert himself, by all accounts, is extremely introverted. Rarely seen in public, he likes to spend his free time with his wife and three daughters. When, in 2014, Robert accepted an award from the Association for Computational Linguistics, he recalled, in a soft voice and with quiet humor, his consternation at being informed that he was expected to give an oration on some topic or another for an hour, which, by the way, is more than I typically talk in a month. Sebastian Mallaby's account of the hedge-fund elite, More Money Than God, describes him as an icy cold poker player who doesn't remember having a nightmare. He likes model trains, having once purchased a set for $2.7 million, and has acquired one of the country's largest collections of machine guns. For years, Robert has embraced a supercharged libertarianism with idiosyncratic variations. He is reportedly pro-death penalty, pro-life and pro-gold standard. He has contributed to an ad campaign opposing the construction of the ground zero mosque; Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, a group that is associated with fringe scientific claims; and Black Americans for a Better Future—a vehicle, the Intercept discovered, for an African-American political consultant who has accused Barack Obama of relentless pandering to homosexuals. Magerman, Robert's former colleague at Renaissance, recalls him saying, in front of coworkers, words to the effect that your value as a human being is equivalent to what you are paid. ... He said that, by definition, teachers are not worth much because they aren't paid much. His beliefs were well-known at the firm, according to Magerman. But since Robert was so averse to publicity, his ideology wasn't seen as a cause for concern. None of us ever thought he would get his views out, because he only talked to his cats, Magerman told me. Robert's middle daughter Rebekah shares similar political beliefs, but she is also very articulate and, therefore, able to act as her father's mouthpiece. (Neither Rebekah nor Robert responded to detailed lists of questions for this article.) Under Rebekah's leadership, the family foundation poured some $70 million into conservative causes between 2009 and 2014.[1] 1. According to The Washington Post, the family donated $35 million to conservative think tanks and at least to $36.5 million to individual GOP races. The first candidate they threw their financial weight behind was Arthur Robinson, a chemist from Oregon who was running for Congress. He was best known in his district for co-founding an organization that is collecting thousands of vials of urine as part of an effort it says will revolutionize the evaluation of personal chemistry. Robinson didn't win, but he got closer than expected, and the Mercers got a taste of what their money could do. In 2011, they made one of their most consequential investments: a reported $10 million in a new right-wing media operation called Breitbart. I don't know any of your fancy friends, Robert Mercer told Sheldon Adelson, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. That the family gravitated toward Andrew Breitbart's upstart website was no accident. The Mercers are purists, says Pat Caddell, a former aide to Jimmy Carter who has shifted to the right over the years. They believe Republican elites are too cozy with Wall Street and too soft on immigration, and that American free enterprise and competition are in mortal danger. Bekah Mercer might be prepared to put a Democrat in Susan Collins' seat simply to rid the party of Susan Collins, a family friend joked by way of illustrating her thinking. So intensely do the Mercers want to unseat Republican senator John McCain[2] 2. Some have speculated that McCain may have angered the Mercers in 2014, when the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which McCain was the ranking member at the time, asserted that Renaissance had used complex financial methods to underestimate its taxes by $6 billion. Renaissance has told The New York Times its tax practices are lawful. that they gave $200,000 to support an opposing candidate who once held a town hall meeting to discuss chemtrails—chemicals, according to a long-standing conspiracy theory, that the federal government is spraying on the public without its knowledge. In short, unlike other donors, the Mercers are not merely angling to influence the Republican establishment—they want to obliterate it. One source told me that, in a meeting with Sheldon Adelson and Robert Mercer a few years ago, the casino mogul asked Robert if he was familiar with certain big Republican players. According to the source, Robert shut him down. I don't know any of your fancy friends, he replied, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. And so it seemed almost inevitable that their paths converged with Bannon's when he took over Breitbart in 2012. The Mercers recognized Bannon as an ideological ally. They also appreciated how quickly he improved the website's finances. Unlike many people in their orbit, Bannon wasn't obsequious: According to one person who often spends time with them, he made zero effort to dress up around his benefactors, often appearing in sweatpants and looking almost like a homeless person. Bannon was respectful around Robert, says this person, but with Rebekah he was more apt to say precisely what he thought: He worked for Bob; he worked with Rebekah. Although the Mercers had initially been persuaded to back Texas senator Ted Cruz in the Republican primary, Bannon preferred Trump, and by the time of the Republican National Convention the Mercers were with him. Rebekah made her move last August, at a fundraiser at the East Hampton estate of Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets. According to two sources, one who strategized with the Mercers and another who worked closely with Trump, Rebekah insisted on a 30-minute face-to-face meeting with Trump, in which she informed him that his campaign was a disaster. (Her family had pledged $2 million to the effort about a month earlier, so she felt comfortable being frank.) Trump, who knew her slightly, was willing to listen. He had been disturbed by recent stories detailing disorganization in his campaign and alleging ties between Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and pro-Russia officials in Ukraine. Rebekah knew of this and arrived at her meeting with props, says the source who strategized with the Mercers: printouts of news articles about Manafort and Russia that she brandished as evidence that he had to go. And she also had a solution in mind: Trump should put Bannon in charge of the campaign and hire the pollster Kellyanne Conway.[3] 3. Conway had worked for the Mercers' super PAC. By the following morning, Rebekah was breakfasting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with the two people he trusts most, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to talk through the proposal in more detail. Within four days, Trump did exactly as Rebekah had advised. Manafort was out. Bannon was in charge. Trump also brought on David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, with whom the Mercers and Bannon had been close for years. Less than four months later, Mercer's handpicked team had pulled off one of the greatest upsets in American politics. Through a bizarre combination of daring and luck, the insurgents had won. Now, they were Trump's version of the establishment—which is to say, a very volatile one.\n\n(From left to right) Patrick Caddell, Stephen Bannon, Lee and Alice Hanley On July Fourth weekend in 2014, members of the Mercer clan (Robert, Rebekah and her husband, Sylvain Mirochnikoff) went to visit some new friends. They traveled on Robert's 203-foot luxury superyacht, the Sea Owl, and anchored just off the WASP enclave of Fishers Island in New York's Long Island Sound. Their destination, a medieval-style granite castle called White Caps, towered over the shoreline. This was the summer home of Lee and Alice Hanley, Reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in Texas oil and gas but lived mostly between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. Like the Mercers, the Hanleys were convinced that the American political establishment was rotten to its foundations. Unlike the Mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider. It didn't matter whether the candidate came from the left or the right; voters just wanted somebody different. They had lost all faith in the ruling class—the government, the media, Wall Street. It showed the entire blow-up of the country coming, Caddell told me. A whole new paradigm developing. No Republican had yet emerged as a front-runner in the 2016 primary, but the Hanleys believed Ted Cruz could take Caddell's insights and ride them all the way to the White House. They saw Cruz as a unicorn: a dedicated fiscal and social conservative who had broken with his party repeatedly. They were dismissive of Trump. He doesn't understand politics or geopolitics or anything about the running of the government, Alice Hanley told me recently. Rebekah Mercer saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology. Robert Mercer and Cruz had met before during a conference in February 2014, when Lee Hanley had invited them to the five-diamond Breakers resort in Palm Beach for a grilling session. Robert was impressed by Cruz's intellect, according to a person at the meeting, but worried that the 43-year-old senator was too young and might struggle to capture voters' imaginations. Still, Robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various Hanley homes. Apparently, Cruz can hold his alcohol (his preference is cabernet), which is a prized attribute in the Hanleys' circle. As the Mercers weighed whether to get involved in a presidential race, their calculus was quite different from that of other megadonors, most of whom run massive corporate empires. Various people who have worked with the Mercers on campaigns told me they didn't pressure their candidates to adopt policies that would benefit the family's financial interests, such as favorable regulations for hedge funds. Instead, their mission was a systemic one. Steve Hantler, a friend of Rebekah's, says she was determined to disrupt the consultant class, which she saw as wasteful and self-serving. She wanted to disrupt the conservative movement, too. Rebekah saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a mechanism to promote a more hard-line ideology. According to Politico and other sources, she was frustrated at the time that no one was taking her seriously. As it happened, however, the family owned what seemed to be an ideal vehicle for achieving her goals. Around 2012, Robert Mercer reportedly invested $5 million in a British data science company named SCL Group. Most political campaigns run highly sophisticated micro-targeting efforts to locate voters. SCL promised much more, claiming to be able to manipulate voter behavior through something called psychographic modeling. This was precisely the kind of work Robert valued. There's no data like more data, he likes to say. Robert had made his money by accumulating piles of data on human behavior (markets might move in a certain direction when it rains in Paris, for instance), in order to make extremely precise and lucrative financial bets. Similarly, SCL claimed to be able to formulate complex psychological profiles of voters. These, it said, would be used to tailor the most persuasive possible message, acting on that voter's personality traits, hopes or fears. The firm has worked on campaigns in Argentina, Kenya, Ghana, Indonesia and Thailand; the Pentagon has used it to conduct surveys in Iran and Afghanistan. Best of all, from the Mercers' perspective, SCL operated entirely outside the GOP apparatus. (A source close to Rebekah said she wanted a results-oriented consultant.) As Rebekah saw it, SCL would allow the Mercers to control the data operation of any campaign they supported, giving the family enormous influence over messaging and strategy.

Robert preferred to focus on his work at Renaissance, often operating from his Long Island mansion, Owl's Nest. He wouldn't look under the hood, because that's not what he does, says Bob Perkins, one of Caddell's associates who worked on the Smith Project. Besides, Rebekah was the political animal in the family. (Her older sister Jenji has practiced law; her younger sister Heather Sue is, like Robert, a competitive poker player). This was a relatively new phenomenon. Rebekah isn't known to have been particularly political earlier in adulthood, while gaining a master's degree in management science and engineering from Stanford, or in early motherhood. (She has four children with her French-born husband, who became an investment banker at Morgan Stanley.) But, after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, which significantly loosened restrictions on political spending, Rebekah decided it was time to save America from becoming like socialist Europe, as she has put it to several people. She started attending Koch events and donating to the Goldwater Institute, a right-wing think tank based in Arizona. The family's political advocacy accelerated rapidly. It was in 2012 that she really attracted attention in GOP circles when, not long after Mitt Romney lost the presidential race, she stood up before a crowd of Romney supporters at the University Club of New York and delivered a scathing but detailed diatribe about his inadequate data and canvassing operation. Who is that woman? people in attendance asked. With SCL, Rebekah finally had the chance to prove she could do better. The company's American branch was renamed Cambridge Analytica, to emphasize the pedigree of its behavioral scientists. And Rebekah started flying Alexander Nix, the firm's Old Etonian CEO, around the country to introduce him to her contacts. Nix, 41, is not a data scientist (his background is in financial services), but he is a showy salesman. Dressed in impeccably tailored suits, he is in his element on stage making presentations at large conferences. He can, however, come across as arrogant. (I love the fact that you're telling your story, but I'm the one giving the interview, he told me in a conversation.) Alexander Nix at Cambridge Analytica's New York office. Rebekah Mercer was impressed by Nix's command of data and artistry on the polo field. JOSHUA BRIGHT/THE WASHINGTON POST/GETTY IMAGES According to Perkins and Caddell, Rebekah and Nix met with them a few times to discuss how CA could use the Smith Project. Rebekah was clearly impressed by Nix. In one meeting, according to Perkins, she gushed about his polo prowess and asked him to show off cellphone photos of himself on horseback. (Nix says he doesn't recall this meeting or others with the three. He also doesn't remember displaying such a picture and can think of no good reason why Bob or Pat would be interested in horses.) The political veterans were skeptical. I didn't understand what Nix was talking about, Perkins told me bluntly. Caddell says he was perplexed when Nix wouldn't show him the instruments CA used to predict voter behavior. He also thought the firm didn't grasp the seismic shift underway in American politics. And yet to his great surprise, Bannon vouched for CA, telling Caddell its scientists were geniuses. Caddell knew that Bannon was beholden to the Mercers—they were, after all, Breitbart's part-owners. According to The New York Times, however, Bannon was also vice president of CA's board. Even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist. After he learned of Bannon's involvement, Caddell stopped asking Bannon questions about CA. In the end, Bannon helped seal the deal between the Mercers and Cruz, with CA as the glue. In the fall of 2014, Toby Neugebauer, a garrulous oil-and-gas billionaire from Texas, took Cruz and his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, to the Breitbart Embassy, the website's Washington headquarters near the Capitol. Bannon flitted in and out. Nix, as usual, did most of the talking. After Neugebauer and Roe visited SCL's London headquarters, the Cruz team agreed that CA could play a key role in their operation, running models and helping with research. However, it was made clear to Rebekah and Nix that the entire data analytics operation would be supervised by Chris Wilson, CEO of the research firm WPA. A source close to Cruz told me that Wilson's operation had played a crucial role when Cruz ran for the Senate with only 2 percent name recognition in Texas and defeated a far better-known opponent. Why, then, was CA necessary at all? No one ever said directly that the quid pro quo for hiring CA was that the Mercers would support Cruz, says someone close to Roe. Nevertheless, after CA was engaged, Neugebauer took a private jet to the Bahamas to meet Robert Mercer on the Sea Owl. When Neugebauer asked him to donate to Cruz's bid, Robert was matter-of-fact. The family would start with $11 million.\n\n(Clockwise, starting top right) Jeff Roe, Ted Cruz, Alexander Nix All modern political campaigns have to balance their need for exorbitant sums of money with the obsessions of the people who want to give them that money. Roe, the straight-talking manager of the Cruz operation, has observed that running a campaign is like trying to solve a Rubik's cube of complicated personalities and uncomfortable dependencies. He has also told people that he is careful not to get too close to the donors who make his campaigns possible, because they can be so easily annoyed by the most trivial of things—his laugh, for instance, or the way he eats a bread roll. In the case of the Cruz campaign, the donor obsession in question was Cambridge Analytica. And it wasn't long before Roe and his team suspected that Nix had promised them a more impressive product than he could deliver. On March 4, 2015, Cruz, Roe, Wilson and others gathered in the Hyatt in Washington D.C. for an all-day meeting with Nix and a group of CA senior executives. Wilson took notes on his computer. According to multiple members of the Cruz team, Wilson was dismayed to learn that CA's models weren't fully ready for his focus groups the following week. As far as the team could tell, the only data CA possessed that the campaign didn't already have appeared to be culled from Facebook. In addition, they recalled, CA hadn't set itself up with Data Trust, the Republican National Committee's repository of voter information. At one point, they recall, Nix explained that the National Rifle Association's database of members would be a valuable way to target donors. Wilson typed an emoji with rolling eyes next to the statement because it was so obvious. He told people that he came away thinking, Red flag, red flag, red flag. In response to an extensive set of questions, Nix disputed this account of the meeting. He denied that Cambridge Analytica had obtained any data via Facebook—a source of controversy for the firm ever since The Guardian reported in 2015 that CA based its data on research spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission. Nix also claimed that it was the Cruz team that didn't have access to the RNC's Data Trust for much of the cycle and that all data used for the majority of the campaign was provided by Cambridge Analytica. However, Mike Shields, then the RNC's chief of staff and Data Trust's senior adviser, told me the Cruz campaign was in fact the second to sign an agreement with Data Trust, in 2014. Meanwhile, the red flags kept coming. Wilson found the data scientists that CA sent to Houston to be highly efficient at the day-to-day work of his research operation. But according to Cruz staffers, when he began to test CA's specialized models, he found that they were notably off, with, for example, some male voters miscategorized as women. In phone surveys, staffers said, CA's predictions fell short of the 85 percent accuracy the campaign expected. (Different models have differing levels of accuracy, Nix said in his response. I suspect these numbers have been taken out of context to make us look bad. In many previous articles the Cruz campaign have highly rated the quality of our data scientists.) By September, CA's first six-month contract was up. A CA employee in the campaign's Houston office accidentally left the invoice in the photocopier, and Wilson happened to fish it out. The invoice totaled an eye-popping $3,119,052 for work that Wilson estimated to be worth $600,000 at most. I can't fucking believe it, Wilson told Roe, who concurred. Jeff Roe (left) with Ted Cruz (right), who ultimately fell out of Rebekah Mercer's favor. We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon, a Cruz adviser said. ETHAN MILLER/GETTY IMAGES Nix disputed this account too, noting that the firm's fee was clearly stated in our statement of work and contract. However, a former consultant for the campaign, Tommy Sears, attended budget meetings for two if not three days over the matter. There was an understanding between both parties that the totality of the contract through March 2016 would be $5.5 million, he says. The heartburn felt by the Cruz team was that over $3 million had already been spent by September 1, 2015. When the Cruz team decided not to pay the full $3 million, bedlam ensued. A phone call was scheduled with Rebekah, Bannon and CA's attorney. I understand she's a nice lady, Wilson says politely of Rebekah. According to multiple people on the call, she accused Wilson of undermining CA. Bannon, meanwhile, unleashed a torrent of profanities at the Cruz team. Someone on the call gave me a censored version of his outburst: The only reason this campaign is where it is right now is because of our people and I. My recommendation to the Mercers is just to pull them out of there and we'll have them on another campaign by Monday. Bannon's language was so foul it was difficult to listen to, says one person on the call who had never met him before. Another of the political pros, who knew Bannon well, wasn't shocked. That's Steve doing business, he says. The Cruz team was taken aback by Rebekah's reaction. Some even wondered if she'd been given all the facts. One person who was close to the campaign says, She is somewhere between the daughter of a brilliant hedge fund manager and mathematician and somebody who runs a bakery in New York. She clearly has a skill set, but the skill set we're discussing here regarding the understanding of the value of data and analytics doesn't fall into that area. She is operating under the information she's been given. If Rebekah Mercer was broke and wasn't a major donor in the Republican party, says a Cruz adviser, nobody would spend two seconds trying to know her… She's not fun. She's just like a series of amoeba cells. The two sides were also diverging ideologically. In the summer of 2015, according to two sources, Rebekah reprimanded Cruz for an April article he'd co-authored with House Speaker Paul Ryan in The Wall Street Journal in support of free trade. She and Bannon told Cruz that he should adopt the positions of Jeff Sessions, whose views on trade and immigration were more in line with the conservative base. By this time, Cruz and his team were becoming increasingly concerned about Bannon's relationship with Rebekah. Bannon (who declined to comment for this article) was now blatantly pro-Trump. Over the course of the primary, Breitbart would publish around 60 pieces disputing that Cruz was eligible to be president because he had been born in Canada. Cruz repeatedly called Rebekah to complain, but she insisted that she had to be fair and impartial. One of his advisers says, We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon. A person close to Bannon counters: There's absolutely no way anyone could manipulate Rebekah Mercer. After the first debate in South Carolina, Rebekah gave Cruz a dressing down on his performance, according to three sources. Given what was going on around him—and what he must have truly felt—he behaved like an absolute gentleman, says a person close to Cruz. Rebekah was incensed that Trump had a tougher immigration policy than Cruz did—she particularly liked Trump's idea for a total ban on Muslims. Subsequently, Cruz proposed a 180-day suspension on all H1-B visas. Meanwhile, even though the Cruz staffers generally got along well with their CA counterparts—they sometimes took the visitors country-western dancing —the firm remained a source of friction. In retrospect, Wilson told people, he believed that Nix resented the campaign for allocating work through a competitive bidding process, rather than favoring CA. Two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Wilson assigned a contract to a firm called Targeted Victory. CA then locked its data in the cloud so it couldn't be accessed by Roe's team. The data remained unavailable until, a Cruz campaign source said, it was pretty much too late to be useful. Cruz won the Iowa caucuses anyway. The Cruz operation became so fed up with Nix that they pushed back, hard, on CA's bill for its second six-month contract. Wilson was able to negotiate the fees down after, as Cruz staffers recalled, a CA representative accidentally emailed him a spreadsheet documenting the Houston team's salaries. (Nix said CA had intended to send the spreadsheet.) Still, the campaign wound up paying nearly $6 million to CA—which represented almost half of the money the Mercers had pledged to spend on Cruz's behalf. The acrimony lingered long after Cruz exited the race in May. When he decided not to endorse Trump at the GOP convention, the Mercers publicly rebuked him. In a statement, Cruz was diplomatic: We were delighted to work with Cambridge Analytica, they were a valuable asset to my campaign, and any rumors to the contrary are completely unfounded. (The source close to Rebekah added, I was with Rebekah the other day and Ted Cruz was falling all over her. It's not fair to blame CA's methodology for Cruz's loss.) Others from Cruz's team, however, remain bitter about the whole experience. If Rebekah Mercer was broke and wasn't a major donor in the Republican Party, says one, nobody would spend two seconds trying to know her. … She's not fun. She's just like a series of amoeba cells.
Article illustrated by Abbie Winters\n\nIt's possibly the most exhausted easy money-saving tip of all time: Cut back on those coffeeshop lattes, and you'll save enough to buy a home! Sounds straightforward enough, but also too good to be true. Besides, are we really spending that much on coffee? According to a new study, we apparently are. SurveyMonkey says that 44 percent of millennial women put less money into their retirement accounts this year than into their coffee funds. (Um, guilty.)\n\nThis is not a statistic to scoff at. But what do those numbers — and that shocking savings vs. caffeine spending discrepancy — look like on a day-to-day level? We spoke with 13 women* who were willing to share the breakdown of their monthly spending in both categories. These women span a wide range of industries, cities, salaries, and budgeting-app approaches, but they're all doing their damndest to reconcile their current coffee habits with their plans to, you know, be able to enjoy that morning brew in blissful retirement someday.\n\nThe verdict? Overall, these women are doing a startlingly good job of budgeting. Maybe I should ask them to talk me out of the cortado I just ordered.\n\n*Some names and identifiers have been changed.\n\nWorks as: Marketing Manager Annual Salary: $65K-$100K Monthly Coffee Spend: $40-50, because I mostly drink shitty bodega coffee or make decaf at home. Monthly Retirement Deposit: $350 pre-tax, which Fidelity is always telling me is not enough.\n\nWorks in: Web Development Annual Salary: $100-$150K Monthly Coffee Spend: $50-69 Monthly Retirement Deposit: $1K I don't actually have a 401k through my job, but I do put $1K a month into a brokerage account; I'm allowed to cash in at any time, but the plan is that I won't. I'm pretty good about making coffee at home and buying K-cups.\n\nWorks as: Stay-at-home mom Annual salary: $0, husband's salary is $30K Monthly Coffee Spend: $6.50 Monthly Retirement Deposit: $0 I buy one 30-oz Folger's coffee jug for $6.50 (I keep coupons) and that usually lasts me two months-ish. I used to drink SO MUCH more coffee but I'm breast-feeding so now I have one cup a day.\n\nWorks as: Government Attorney Annual Salary: $100K-$150K Monthly Coffee Spend: $50, including coffee made at home as well as Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts on-the-go purchases.

OMG. I am a $5 latte, four to five days a week kind of gal. The funny thing is that I don't even think it's about the caffeine so much as that I am a total creature of habit, and I love the habit of starting my day at my favorite coffee shop, saying hi to the baristas, and having a moment to myself to just be before I dive into the work day. As for my retirement-savings percentage, I have been telling myself that I need to up it to 7% (I'd love to get to 10%) but I have yet to actually do it.\n\nFor the rest of the article, click here.
WASHINGTON ― As Congress begins working on a huge fiscal package to prop up the economy and soften the blow for people who are suffering from the coronavirus epidemic and its effects on their livelihoods, Democrats are demanding that any taxpayer bailout to major industries include restrictions on corporate bonuses and stock buybacks.\n\nThe issue of corporate accountability remains fresh in many lawmakers' minds. In 2009, amid the Great Recession, the insurance company American International Group (AIG) handed out millions in bonuses after receiving a bailout from the federal government. The move prompted widespread criticism from both parties on Capitol Hill and further soured the public on the idea of taxpayer-funded bailouts, especially to Wall Street.\n\nTo address the severe economic shock currently gripping the country, the Trump administration is working on an emergency stimulus proposal of at least $1 trillion that includes $50 billion in loans for the airline industry, which has been hit hard by the crisis. The package calls for an additional $150 billion in loans for unnamed severely distressed sectors of the economy. According to The Washington Post, those might include hotels, casinos, cruise lines, and the oil and gas industry. Other groups are also lining up for a lifeline, including restaurant chains, the nation's mayors, and nonprofit groups.\n\nCertainly, the hotel industry, the cruise ship industry, the airlines, those are all prime candidates, absolutely, Trump told reporters on Wednesday when asked about the administration's plans for targeted relief to businesses.\n\nAccording to the Post, the administration's fiscal proposal for certain industries does include limits on increases in executive compensation until repayment of the loans.\n\nBut Democrats are calling on the Treasury Department to go even further, urging them to set specific conditions — that will apply beyond the coronavirus crisis — on taxpayer funds that go to corporations.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who recently dropped out of the 2020 presidential race, laid out what she called a progressive litmus test for the bailouts on Tuesday. The eight-point plan calls for companies who receive taxpayer funds to provide a $15 minimum wage, keep people on their payrolls, maintain collective bargaining agreements, and permanently ban stock buybacks, among other steps.\n\nFunds must come with strings attached to ensure that the money goes to maintain payroll, not to enrich shareholders or pay executive bonuses, Warren said in an op-ed this week. Giant corporations that receive substantial loans from taxpayers should be required to set aside one or more board seats for a representative elected by the company's workers. Violations should trigger criminal penalties and clawbacks.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, noted that many airline companies repurchased their own stocks to reward their investors when times were good.\n\nLet's not forget that the reason many airlines are so short on cash right now is that they have spent billions on stock buybacks ― money they had to send out when they should have been saving it for a rainy day, for their customers and workers, Schumer said in a floor speech on Wednesday. That issue should be addressed.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) added on Twitter: There is no straight-face justification to give no-strings-attached cash to an industry that had the chance to use massive profits and tax cuts to build a rainy day fund, but instead used the money to pad investor returns and executive pay.\n\nCorporate stock buybacks skyrocketed after Trump signed the 2017 Republican tax cut into law. In fact, over the last five years, 50 of the largest U.S. corporations repurchased a staggering $1.1 trillion of their own stock, according to a Wednesday memo from the advocacy group Economic Liberties Project.\n\nBut Democrats aren't the only ones who are calling for conditions to bailouts for major industries that are severely affected by the economic crisis. Keith Anderson, co-founder of investment firm BlackRock, suggested in a letter to The New York Times this week that stock warrants should be attached to any loans given by the federal government, similar to what a private investor would require when bailing out a troubled company.\n\nThe vast majority of these entities, Anderson wrote, have spent the last decade of unprecedented economic expansion buying back their outstanding shares — as Royal Caribbean Cruises and Delta and American Airlines have done — in an effort to increase their per-share earnings and their share prices.\n\nWhile I hope that the citizens of our country who are most in need and the small businesses that have no access to capital markets are in the front of the line for assistance, when it does come time to lend a hand to these public companies, any loan or bailout should also provide a reward to the citizens of our country who are lending them money, he added.
Illustration By Isabella Carapella for HuffPost/Getty Images\n\nEvery month since the coronavirus pandemic began, Sydney, a 20-year-old college student in Bloomington, Indiana, has dreaded getting her period.\n\nShe lost her job in March and has been relying on financial aid, scholarship money and the income she earns from nannying full time to pay her bills. At the end of the month, that leaves very little cash for items such as tampons, pantyliners and over-the-counter pain relievers for menstrual cramps.\n\nI know that $30 a month may not feel like a big deal to most people, but when you are living paycheck-to-paycheck that is a decent chunk of change to have to set aside each month, said Sydney, who asked to go by only her first name to protect her privacy.\n\nI have to factor this cost into my already tight budget and I find myself filled with dread when my period comes around and I have to fork up that fee, she told HuffPost.\n\nSydney's experiences aren't uncommon. Period poverty, or inadequate access to menstrual hygiene tools and education, is a problem across the globe affecting girls, women and nonbinary and transgender people who menstruate.\n\nA 2019 study of low-income U.S. women found that nearly two-thirds of the women surveyed struggled to afford period products, leading many to resort to using paper towels, rags, or even diapers as alternatives.\n\nOne in five teenagers have struggled to afford pads and tampons, and one in four have missed class because they did not have access to period products.\n\nIn most of the U.S., tampons and pads are subject to sales tax because they're not classified as products that fill a basic, essential need. Only a handful of states have succeeded in abolishing the so-called tampon tax. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, does not cover tampons or pads. Neither does Medicaid.\n\nIt's not like your period is going to be nice and say, 'Hey, I see you're unemployed, let's hold off for a spell.' - Dana Marlowe, founder of the national service organization I Support the Girls\n\nThe scourge of COVID-19 has only exacerbated the problem. Many public places that supply free tampons and pads in bathrooms― school campuses, rec centers, libraries ― are closed.\n\nOne survey found that one in four people between the ages of 13 and 35 reported having a more difficult time managing their periods because of financial strain during the pandemic.\n\nAs with toilet paper and medicine, those who could afford to hoard maxi-pads and tampons did just that, leaving women with lower incomes without basic essentials.\n\nDana Marlowe, founder of the national service organization I Support the Girls, said her group has been flooded with requests for feminine hygiene products. In the spring of 2020, the group experienced a 38% increase in requests for products from both individuals and organizations.\n\nOur staff received communications from people in March, April, and May saying things like, 'I can afford to buy products, but the stores don't have any in stock and I'm getting my period soon. Is there any way to get some from you? I will donate when I can!' Marlowe told HuffPost.\n\nAs more and more women lost their jobs, people who used to be donors began to request products themselves.\n\nOne in five women in the U.S. have left the labor force since the beginning of the pandemic; Marlowe is anticipating the high level of need will last at least another 18 months.\n\nThe sudden lack of income has just resulted in an overwhelming number of requests to food banks, day centers, and organizations like us, Marlowe said. It's not like your period is going to be nice and say, 'Hey, I see you're unemployed, let's hold off for a spell.'\n\nUnfortunately, inadequate access to period products is rarely discussed even in the best of times.\n\nBefore period poverty can be addressed in a significant way, people need to be made aware it's even a problem, said Eiko La Boria, the founder of The Flow Initiative, a non-profit that addresses period poverty and gender equity in Jersey City.\n\nThere are so many women that have never heard of terms like period poverty or menstrual equity, yet once they do, it's as though a veil is lifted and they become allies, spokespeople, advocates in the fight to end it, she said. When we discuss it, we open the door to eradicating the shame and stigma associated with periods and period poverty, which will lead to a more menstrual equitable society.\n\nzoranm via Getty Images Pads, tampons, cups and similar products often have been hard to come by during the pandemic.\n\nPart of the problem may lie in semantics. Period poverty can be a marginalizing phrase, which is why many prefer to talk about menstrual equity, Among them is Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, a vice president for development at the New York University law school's Brennan Center for Justice and author of Periods Gone Public: Taking a Stand for Menstrual Equity.\n\nI think it is more accurate to refer to the problem — and the solution — as one of 'menstrual equity,' she said. That means ensuring that menstruation — and the inability to access products, information, education — does not deprive a person of their dignity or ability to participate fully and fairly in daily life.\n\nThe stigma and shame that exists around menstruation have been generations in the making, but the pro-period movement has been gaining traction.\n\nIn November, Scotland voted to make period products free, becoming the first country to do so. Slow strides have been made stateside, too.\n\nAs a result, pads, tampons, cups and other similar products are now eligible for inclusion in health savings and flexible spending account allowances. (HSAs and FSAs give employees the option to set aside pre-tax earnings to pay for qualified medical expenses ranging from doctor visits to co-pays to sunscreen.) Menstrual products had been ruled ineligible by the IRS because they did not alleviate or aid in the treatment plan of a specific illness.\n\nIn May, Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) introduced the Good Samaritan Menstrual Products Act, which would allow for more menstrual products to be donated to and distributed by nonprofit organizations during the pandemic.\n\nMenstrual equity is not a choice or a luxury, Meng said. It is a human right and a health right. Furthermore, in the current fight against COVID-19, periods do not wait for pandemics.\n\nOutside of legislative efforts, food banks, day centers and local organizations are working overtime to get women the period products they need.\n\nOur first day of the Westlake High School drive through went really well today! Remember you can stop by again next Wednesday to drop off products!\n\nPeace + Love 💕#periodswithpride pic.twitter.com/711iDec0VN — Periods with Pride (@periodswpride) December 10, 2020\n\nAs Weiss-Wolf pointed out, hundreds of food hubs in New York City have been distributing menstrual products, thanks to the quick, creative advocacy of two public school students who called upon the City Council to do so.\n\nIn California's Ventura County, high school students started Periods with Pride, a grassroots organization dedicated to providing menstrual products for people in need.\n\nThe group hosts local drives where they hand out products, said Sanjana Chandrasekar, a junior at Westlake High School and the program's youth and community outreach director. Even one pad or tampon box can make a huge difference, she said.\n\nIn Philadelphia, a mother-daughter team launched No More Secrets, an organization that makes door-to-door delivery of pads and tampons every day of the year throughout the city.\n\nWeiss-Wolf is heartened to see local nonprofits meet the moment with such distribution efforts, but said she hopes to see the day when they won't be shouldering so much of the burden.
Democrats Eye Texas District After Decades Of Solid Republican Control\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/AP Drew Angerer/AP\n\nFor the first time in decades, Democrats are energized about their chances to take a longtime-Republican congressional seat in Texas this fall.\n\nSince the 1970s, the 21st Congressional District has been solidly in Republican hands. Incumbent Rep. Lamar Smith has held onto the district, which includes a large portion of Austin, for more than 30 years. But Smith is retiring at the end of this term — and with signs of a possible wave election for Democrats, Smith's exit has sparked hopes on the Democratic side.\n\nThis is the part of the state that was Republican before Republicans were even a major factor in the state, said Sean Theriault, a political science professor at the University of Texas.\n\nIn these midterm elections, Democrats are looking to take back control of the House, which would break the control Republicans have of Congress and the White House. This is a race that doesn't top handicappers' lists — the Cook Political Report rates it as Likely Republican. So if this race were to go blue, it could indicate a very big wave on Election Night.\n\nBut Democrats are scoping out this district, because its political demographics have shifted over the past few elections. President Trump won it by 10 points in the 2016 election, which was was already a shift from 2012 and 2008 when Mitt Romney and John McCain won it by more.\n\nThat gives Democrats a shred of hope that former Army officer Joseph Kopser ($337,000 on hand) could pull off an upset in a wave, David Wasserman, House editor for the Cook Political Report, wrote in an analysis of the 21st District's rating.\n\nA history of partisan gerrymandering in Texas\n\nThese are the kinds of districts that could see an unintended consequence of political gerrymandering. By trying to squeeze out a maximum number of Republican districts by splitting up much of Austin and San Antonio and stretching them out to more solidly Republican areas, it could potentially mean a more competitive race in a big wave year.\n\nIt's the very definition of gerrymandering, Theriault said. By slicing up all those Democrats in San Antonio and Austin, they're able to have lots of Republicans in this area when you think of this as being a pretty progressive Democratic area.\n\nSmith was reelected with at least 60 percent of the vote until 2016 when he dipped below that for the first time. In this election, Democrats see an opportunity to mobilize their base around gerrymandering as a measure that dilutes their votes, contends Jim Henson of The Texas Political Project who has conducted polling on gerrymandering.\n\nBecause of the way that politics have evolved in the state, you know, over the last couple of decades, he said, all of these voting and election-related issues have become more salient and more partisan, particularly for Democrats.\n\nA conservative Republican versus a moderate Democrat\n\nSmith has been a conservative Republican, voting for President Trump's tax plan and taking a hard line on immigration. Smith is also a climate-change skeptic, who serves as chair of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, which oversees the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nHe straddles this line between the Republican establishment and kind of the new Tea Party Republicans, Theriault said.\n\nThe Republican running to replace Smith would be just as conservative. If Chip Roy wins, he would be a leading conservative in Congress. The former federal prosecutor, who also worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, has faced criticism, because he doesn't actually live in the district.\n\nThe Trump factor is a complicated one here, too, as Roy has campaigned carefully so that he is not tied too closely to Trump.\n\nOf course I disagree with the president on certain policies, but I think you've got to look at the overall package and say, 'Is the president leading?' And give the president the room to lead, Roy told KXAN-TV in Austin. And I think a lot of people in Congress, including Sen. Cruz and others, are giving the president the room to step out and lead and drive forward, and we're seeing the benefit of that.\n\nGerrymandering As A Campaign Issue Listen · 3:38 3:38\n\nRoy will face a Democrat who used to be a Republican. Joseph Kopser is president of Grayline Group, a tech analytics firm based in Austin, and an Army veteran who served in Iraq.\n\nHe's a pretty moderate Democrat. He knows how to solve problems, Theriault said. He has a veteran's pedigree, and so he appeals to the voters that he's going to need to attract in order for him to pull out this race.\n\nKopser is hoping to fire up the very same Democrats that Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke hopes will turn out for him in the tight race against Cruz.\n\nI not only share their progressive values of things we've fought so hard for over the years, Kopser told KXAN-TV, but doing that in a way that will allow independents and those orphaned Republicans who are just so estranged by their party today — they don't even recognize the Texas Republicans of today – to be able to say, 'You know what, we want calm out of the chaos.' \n\nDemocrats across the state are also aiming to capitalize on an 84 percent increase in Democratic voter turnout during the Texas primaries earlier this year, according to The Cook Political Report.\n\nThat jump was yet another metric of heightened Democratic enthusiasm and intensity, key elements when partisan wave elections occur, political analyst Charlie Cook wrote. Having said that, some Democrats are overhyping what happened, forgetting that Texas is still Texas, and that for every two Democrats who voted, three Republicans cast ballots.\n\nLess about the candidates, more about political parties\n\nMany voters in this district seem to have their minds made up, even though some don't even know the names of the candidates.\n\nAaron Bird, who was running a trail along the Colorado River in Austin, said he is voting for Democrats up and down the ballot, because he is dissatisfied with Trump and the way he treats women.\n\nI think it all starts with I have two girls and a wife, he said. I think it's just having someone who represents us in a dignified manner.\n\ntoggle caption Ashley Bailey /Here & Now\n\nAnother voter walking the trail, Laura Hubbard, also plans to vote all blue, because she said Democrats align with her values, namely, having people that we can trust and what they say is believable. Honesty, transparency, giving all people a voice.\n\nBut travel southwest of Austin and voters have a different outlook. Cheryl Poulus, for example, said she always votes Republican, and this congressional race is no exception. She's a big Trump supporter, and said she wants to do whatever she can to support his agenda.\n\nI like how he's reaching out to all the different leaders, Poulus said. I love the trade wars. I think that's gonna be OK. I think it's shaking things up a bit, shaking up the status quo, and then actually it will probably come back to be very good in the end.\n\nThis race, like many around the country, isn't necessarily about the candidates, but the parties they represent. That means Kopser's fate could rest on how well O'Rourke does in getting people out to the polls, Theriault said.\n\nThey're cut from a very similar cloth, he said. When you hear them speak, they don't sound like some of these other candidates that are getting the national headlines because of their strident liberal positions, but rather they seem like common-sense, problem-solving Democrats.\n\nTheriault added that the way Republicans redrew the districts in recent years could backfire and actually help Democrats in this election.\n\nThe problem for the Republicans when they do this is if we start talking about a 10-point wave year, he says, all of those districts suddenly become competitive in a way that no one would have thought they would be competitive two years ago.
Justices May Not Disturb Status Quo When It Comes To Sales Tax For Online Purchases\n\nThe last time the Supreme Court considered whether businesses had to collect sales taxes for out-of-state purchases, the court ruled that they did not have to do so. But that was before the Internet. On Tuesday, the court considered the question again.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nIn 1967 and again in 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that companies don't have to collect sales taxes for out-of-state purchases. That was before the Internet revolutionized the economy. This year, the high court decided to revisit the issue. And today, contrary to expectations, a narrow majority of justices signaled they may not be willing to disturb the status quo. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports.\n\nNINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The test case comes from South Dakota, which passed a law requiring out-of-state companies, including online companies, to collect sales taxes. Today, state Attorney General Marty Jackley said that allowing online companies to avoid collecting sales taxes costs states billions of dollars in revenue and unfairly harms local small businesses who do have to add those taxes onto their prices.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMARTY JACKLEY: That small business on Main Street is losing its sale. That's not fair. That's not right, and that should not be constitutionally sanctioned.\n\nTOTENBERG: But George Isaacson, representing Wayfair, countered that reversing the old decisions would force compliance with 12,000 state and local tax rules across the country and would be so expensive it would drive small companies and startups out of business.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nGEORGE ISAACSON: It would really be a wet blanket on the electronic commerce economy.\n\nTOTENBERG: Inside the court chamber, the justices seemed to concede that the court's prior decisions were wrong. But a majority said Congress would be better equipped to deal with the problem. South Dakota's Jackley objected, noting that the states have been trying to get Congress to pass legislation for 26 years, and Congress has turned a blind eye.\n\nJustice Kagan suggested that in failing to address the issue for so long, Congress has in fact made a choice. It likes the status quo. Justice Alito added, do you have any doubt that states that are tottering on the edge of insolvency have a strong incentive to grab everything they can? And Justice Breyer suggested that even if major changes in the law are needed, Congress can craft a better law than the court can.\n\nJustice Kennedy, however, had a blunt assessment. The assumption of many of these questions is that our prior decision is incorrect but that that doesn't make any difference, and I'm suggesting it does. Justice Ginsburg called the old decisions obsolete. As I see it, she said, everybody should have the same tax collection obligation. Justice Gorsuch - why should this court favor a particular business model that relies not on brick and mortar but mail order?\n\nBetting on the outcome of Supreme Court cases is a bad idea. But counting up the votes today, it looked as though the decision in the online tax case will be 5 to 4 with the odds slightly favoring the online companies' tax-free status.\n\nSHAPIRO: And Nina is still here in the studio with us. I want to ask you, Nina, about another case, one that was decided today involving immigration. This could make it harder for the Trump administration to deport a small number of noncitizens.\n\nTOTENBERG: That's right. The court invalidated part of an immigration statute that requires deportation of lawful permanent residents who are convicted of a crime of violence.\n\nSHAPIRO: What were the facts in this case?\n\nTOTENBERG: Well, there was a Filipino immigrant who'd lived here for 25 years. The court's decision today overturned his deportation order for two burglary convictions. Now, the law on deportation defines a crime of violence as one involving actual force or a substantial risk of force. And today's decision follows one written by Justice Antonin Scalia in 2015. It says that the language in this statute is so vague that it invites arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\n\nSHAPIRO: And a lot of people have noted that the deciding vote here was cast by Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, joining with the more liberal justices. Can we draw any conclusions from that?\n\nTOTENBERG: Not really. I suppose you could note that in this case, he's agreeing with not just the court's liberals but with conservative icon Scalia. But he did write separately to say that the Constitution looks unkindly on any law so vague that reasonable people cannot understand it. Still, this is just one vote in one case from a justice who otherwise has a very consistently conservative record. So at least as of now, you really can't draw any conclusion.\n\nSHAPIRO: That's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Thanks, Nina.\n\nTOTENBERG: Thanks, Ari.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

Michael Cohen Calls Trump A 'Racist' And A 'Con Man' In Scathing Testimony\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 11:49 p.m. ET\n\nDonald Trump apparently blessed the meeting his son held with a Russian delegation to get dirt on opponents in 2016 and welcomed advance word of efforts by WikiLeaks to disrupt the election, his former lawyer told Congress.\n\nThose were only a few of the politically incendiary allegations Michael Cohen made in a landmark hearing before the House oversight committee on Wednesday. But he stopped short of accusing Trump and his campaign of a full-on conspiracy with the Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCohen did, however, allege that GOP political consultant Roger Stone phoned Trump to tell him that WikiLeaks intended to release a batch of emails that would embarrass the Democratic National Committee.\n\nCohen described being in Trump's office when Stone called to say he had just talked with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about the release. Stone has denied that, but he too is facing charges of lying to Congress, in a federal case in Washington, D.C.\n\nA lawyer for Assange also denied on Wednesday that he had spoken by phone with Stone.\n\n'I Know What Mr. Trump Is'\n\nRussian intelligence officers stole emails from the Democrats and others as part of a concerted attack on the U.S. election, although it still isn't clear how much Trump and his campaign knew about Russia's efforts or whether the material WikiLeaks obtained had originated from the work of Russia's intelligence services.\n\nCohen was asked whether he believed it was possible that Trump and his family might have been compromised or whether they might have been willing to collude with the Russians.\n\nYes, he said.\n\nCohen also suggested that Donald Trump Jr. may have told his father about the June 2016 meeting he scheduled at Trump Tower following an offer of help from the Russian government — one the president has denied he knew about at the time.\n\nBut Trump knew about everything, Cohen said.\n\nThere was nothing that happened at the Trump Organization ... that did not go through Mr. Trump for his approval and signoff, he said.\n\nA laundry list of alleged wrongdoing\n\nCohen also made a number of other accusations against Trump:\n\nThat Trump paid Cohen, while in office, to cover the costs associated with buying the silence of a woman who said she had had a sexual relationship with Trump years earlier. Trump has acknowledged the payment but denied the underlying allegations about a sexual relationship.\n\nThat Trump's camp encouraged Cohen to lie to Congress and the public about the negotiations the Trump business had carried on with powerful Russians about a potential Trump Tower real estate deal in Moscow. The statement Cohen prepared, he said, was edited by Trump's lawyers. In a statement provided to NPR Wednesday night, Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump's personal attorneys relating to the Justice Department's 2016 Russian election interference investigation, said Today's testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the president edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false.\n\nCohen said Trump told him to lie about the medical deferments Trump received that excused him from the draft during the Vietnam War. Cohen said Trump had no medical records to back up his claim of a medical deferment but said he wasn't stupid and had no intention of being drafted.\n\nTrump ordered Cohen to find a fake buyer for a portrait of Trump to make it appear that the painting had sold for a lot of money and was therefore valuable; actually, Cohen said, Trump arranged to use money from his foundation to inflate the sale price.\n\nCohen also faulted Trump for remarks that Cohen called racist and for his years as a con man, treating nearly everyone as a sucker and using his political aspirations as an infomercial for himself — not as a way to serve the United States as the holder of its highest office.\n\nRepublicans reject Cohen's claims out of hand\n\nRepublicans and the White House rejected Cohen's allegations before he even made them, pointing out that he has pleaded guilty to federal charges of lying to Congress and has been sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., objected to the proceedings on Wednesday before Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., had even delivered his opening statement, leading to a dispute over whether the hearing could continue.\n\nUltimately, it went ahead.\n\nTrump said on Twitter that Cohen is only trying to get a lighter punishment, having been sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders slammed the House oversight committee for giving Cohen a venue to air public complaints against the president when Cohen is a convicted liar.\n\nSchemes within schemes\n\nCohen's opening statement addressed directly his history of lying — yes, he said, he had lied many times in the past. But, he said, that was when he was in Trump's thrall, and those days are over.\n\nFor those who question my motives for being here today, I understand, he said. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your 'fixer,' Mr. Trump.\n\nCohen provided members of Congress with what he said were documents that backed up his testimony, including a check signed by Trump that Cohen said was part of the reimbursement for paying off adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nTrump, Cohen and Allen Weisselberg, the CFO of Trump's company, worked out the arrangement under which Cohen would be repaid the $130,000 he gave Daniels to keep her from talking, Cohen said.\n\nThey agreed on a year's worth of periodic smaller payments that would make it look like Cohen was getting a retainer as Trump's lawyer, he said. Trump signed some of the checks, one of which Cohen gave to the committee. At least one was signed by Trump Jr. and Weisselberg, which Cohen also gave committee members.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., emphasized that the check was drawn on the trust that Trump created to give up control of his business after he was elected. That indicated that he stayed involved, despite his claims, and interacted with Trump Jr. and Weisselberg to make the payments to Cohen.\n\nThat's garden variety financial fraud, Khanna said.\n\nThe payment to another woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, was made on behalf of Trump by the publisher of the National Enquirer, American Media Inc., run by Trump's friend David Pecker.\n\nThat arrangement had been used before, Cohen said, although he didn't detail every other instance in which Pecker had helped Trump catch and kill damaging stories, as the practice was called.\n\nAMI reached an agreement with prosecutors in New York City in which it was not charged with a crime because it cooperated with investigators in Cohen's case.\n\nA brand allegedly built on lies\n\nThe chicanery that Cohen described involved nearly every aspect of Trump's public life and career, according to his allegations.\n\nTrump, for example, was in the practice of falsifying the value of his assets so that he would rank higher in listings of wealthy people, Cohen said.\n\nCohen told Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., about the practices used within the Trump Organization to take the real value of a building and make it appear greater, which would in turn make Trump appear to be richer.\n\nCohen also described Trump telling him to call a reporter for Forbes magazine to argue about his wealth in its ranking one year.\n\nTrump schemed with Cohen to rig online polls in 2014 and 2015 to make it appear voters were supporting him and thus make his political aspirations seem more plausible, the former lawyer said.\n\nTrump's sensitivities, according to Cohen, even allegedly included his grades and SAT scores.\n\nCohen told members of Congress that Trump told him to threaten his former schools with lawsuits if they released records about him to reporters.\n\nHow Many Times?\n\nA spokesman for Fordham University told NPR on Wednesday that the school received an initial phone call from the Trump campaign and a follow-up letter from a Trump attorney reminding us that they would take action against the university if we did, in fact, release Mr. Trump's records.\n\nFordham also said it was a moot point because it was bound by federal law, and that we could/would not reveal/share any records (as we would not reveal any student records) with anyone except Mr. Trump himself, or any recipient he designated, in writing.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, was preoccupied with the release of President Barack Obama's college transcripts.\n\nA contentious hearing\n\nTrump's allies called the hearing a political circus.\n\nThis might be the first time someone convicted of lying to Congress has appeared again so quickly in front of Congress, said the oversight committee's ranking member, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Certainly it's the first time a convicted perjurer has been brought back to be a star witness.\n\nCohen even reportedly lied about delivering his own son in the hospital, Jordan said.\n\nAnd Cohen didn't lie only to Congress, observed Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn. He also lied on his tax forms for the Internal Revenue Service, transgressions that were part of his guilty plea in a federal case in New York City.\n\nMeadows also invited an official from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Lynne Patton, who was a former Trump employee. She stood up at the hearing. If Trump is a racist as Cohen charged, Meadows asked, why did he hire Patton, a black woman?\n\nCohen asked in response why there aren't there any black executives within the Trump Organization. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Mich., called Meadows' showcasing of Patton insensitive.\n\nRepublicans also said Cummings and Democrats have become so deranged by their animus toward Trump that they were willing to risk his negotiations in Vietnam.\n\nThe president is meeting with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, but his supporters complained about what they called an inappropriate focus away from those negotiations over nuclear weapons and on Cohen's accounts.\n\nCummings called Cohen's statement too important not to hear, and he said that Americans listening to the hearing should judge for themselves whether they believe him.\n\nNPR reporters Scott Detrow, Carrie Johnson, Ryan Lucas, Tim Mak and Barbara Sprunt contributed to this report.
Trade Matters In 2016; This May Help You Understand Why\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Olivier Douliery/Getty Images Olivier Douliery/Getty Images\n\nThis week, NPR and some member stations will be talking about trade on the campaign trail and in communities around the country.\n\nIn this presidential election cycle, many Americans are casting votes based on their feelings about past trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and proposed deals, especially the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nBut for lots of us, understanding trade deals isn't easy because international commerce creates a complex web of winners and losers — all stretched over a nearly $19 trillion U.S. economy with 323 million people. With an issue so big, how can a voter reach good decisions about candidate positions?\n\nThe single most important idea to remember is that in such a large economy, well, it's complicated. Consider this example:\n\nIn February, Carrier Corp. announced it would shut down some manufacturing operations in Indiana and move jobs to Mexico. The U.S. workers are angry, as of course they would be: Their lives are being turned upside down by a cold, corporate decision. How can there be two sides to that story? Carrier provides a slam-dunk example that NAFTA is bad for Americans, right?\n\nBut remember that Carrier is best known for making air conditioners. As recently as 1993, about a third of U.S. homes had no air conditioning. Now, only about 1 in 10 lacks air conditioning. The change largely reflects the plunge in AC prices, thanks to lower production costs. Even a retiree with limited income may be able to afford a foreign-made room air conditioner for as little as $112 at Wal-Mart.\n\nHeat can be deadly for the elderly. Does the pain felt by a laid-off Carrier worker cancel out the relief felt by an 80-year-old Mississippian who finally can afford an air-conditioned bedroom?\n\nWelcome to trade. Let's get started learning.\n\nWhat Americans Think About Trade\n\nPolls generally have reflected bipartisan support for trade over many years. In 2000, Gallup found that most respondents said increasing trade with China would help. And such support held up until the recession, when, as a December 2008 poll showed, Americans became more skeptical about trade.\n\nIn 2010, as the Tea Party rose up, many anti-establishment Republicans started turning against trade. Business-oriented Republicans (think: Chamber of Commerce) were still very much in favor of trade, but the split with older, blue-collar conservatives was widening.\n\nDespite the recession-related dip and Tea Party backlash, trade bounced back in popularity by 2013 and 2014. Clear majorities of Americans said trade was more of an opportunity than a threat to them. In 2015, Pew found Americans continued to support trade in general — and even TPP specifically.\n\nIn January 2016, a Pew poll showed that global trade was not a hot-button issue, at least not when compared with much bigger concerns about economic growth, terrorism and education.\n\nHowever, the most recent Pew polling shows anti-trade sentiments have now surged among Republicans (with 40 percent calling free trade a good thing vs. 52 percent seeing it as a bad thing). Those who support candidate Donald Trump are especially anti-trade (67 percent said it was a bad thing vs. 27 percent a good thing). Even though Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have said they oppose the TPP, most Democrats support trade (60 percent good thing vs. 30 percent bad thing).\n\nOverall, 51 percent of Americans say such trade agreements have been a good thing for this country, while 39 percent believe they've been a bad thing, according to Pew.\n\nWhat Economists Think About Trade In General\n\nA 2012 survey of top economists showed 85 percent say the benefits of free trade are much larger than any effects on employment. Only 5 percent were uncertain. But critics point to data showing trade puts downward pressure on low-skilled factory wages and jobs. They also say the deals have done far too little to protect workers' rights and the environment.\n\nWhat Economists Say About Trade With Mexico\n\nOn NAFTA's 20th anniversary in 2014, economists re-examined the fallout and concluded it was largely a wash — with the U.S. losing some and gaining some. After reviewing that NAFTA research, the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank said: The general consensus in the literature is that NAFTA has not had significant effects on aggregate outcomes in U.S. labor markets.\n\nIn its NAFTA-impact report, the Congressional Research Service also concluded: NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest.\n\nWhat Economists Say About Trade With China\n\nA recent important study showed that Chinese goods hurt low-skilled Americans. China's immense workforce helps create a lot of wealth in the U.S. (e.g., Apple grew wildly by using China as its manufacturing backshop) but it tends to make low-skilled workers in the U.S. worse off — not just temporarily, but on a sustained basis. Economists also say that low-cost imports from China hold down prices for U.S. consumers.\n\nWhat Pro-Trade Groups Say\n\nU.S. Coalition for TPP: The benefits of trade are clear: better jobs, higher wages, and lower costs for American families.\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce: Selling more of our goods and services around the world is a great way to create American jobs, help small businesses, and keep the United States ahead of its global competitors.\n\nWhat Anti-Trade Groups Say\n\nAFL-CIO: For too long, our nation's trade and investment policies have reflected the influence of powerful corporate interests.\n\nPublic Citizen: Regarding TPP, This massive, controversial, pro-corporate 'free trade' agreement ... threatens everything from the safety of our food to the stability of our economy.\n\nWhat Some Studies Say\n\nThe China Shock: China's emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade.\n\nThe Economic Effects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership: It is a substantial positive response to slowing world trade growth and rising trade barriers, and a major contribution toward a rules-based global economy.\n\nTTIP Beyond the Beltway: Regarding the proposed U.S.-European trade deal: The average businessperson, worker or consumer is unaware that the agreement is under negotiation, and some are unsure of the distinct roles that the EU and its individual member states play in the process.\n\nWhat Moody's Says About Trump Proposals\n\nTrump calls for a 45 percent tax on all Chinese imports, and a 35 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico.\n\nAt the request of the Washington Post, Moody's Analytics recently modeled Trump's trade proposals for Mexico and China. It showed that if Congress were to approve such changes, China and Mexico would fall into recession — and about 4 million U.S. workers would lose their jobs, and another 3 million jobs that otherwise would have been created will be lost.\n\nThe U.S. economy would end up 4.6 percent smaller by 2019 than it otherwise would have been, and unemployment would rise to 9.5 percent. U.S. unemployment currently stands at 5 percent.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\n\n\nChinese imports did hurt a lot of U.S. workers, but most of that may now be in the rearview mirror. That's because so many factory workers already have been replaced, either by low-wage competitors in other countries, or by technology, just as farm laborers were replaced by tractors a century ago. Because of automation, U.S. manufacturers employ less than 9 percent of the U.S. workforce but generate more than 12 percent of GDP.\n\nAs factory jobs continue to melt away, new trade deals, such as the TPP, will focus on non-manufacturing areas — such as intellectual property, pharmaceuticals, agricultural products and services, etc.
Latest Trump Book, Once Again, Makes The Case That He's Incompetent, Narcissistic\n\nA Very Stable Genius Donald J. Trump's Testing of America by Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker Hardcover, 304 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nBook-length critiques of the presidency of Donald Trump keep piling up on American reading tables, so it seems time for a one-volume wrapup on what we have learned so far.\n\nImagine, for a moment, a high-octane courtroom prosecutor summing up for the jury a case built on the vivid testimony of multiple eyewitnesses.\n\nMore than a dozen previous books by close observers and insider-survivors of the Trump administration have provided that testimony. Now come Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig of The Washington Post to make the closing argument with plenty of reporting of their own.\n\nYou could scarcely ask for more capable advocates. Leonnig won a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting on the U.S. Secret Service in 2015, then joined Rucker and others on a team awarded the Pulitzer for stories on Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nTheir new, collaborative account — titled A Very Stable Genius: Donald J. Trump's Testing of America — walks readers step by step through the first 30 months or so of a presidency like no other. They leave little doubt that they and many of their sources regard that presidency as an unmitigated and deepening disaster — a threat to American government as we have known it.\n\nTwo kinds of people went to work for the administration, we are told on the prologue's third page, those who thought Trump was saving the world and those who thought the world needed to be saved from Trump.\n\nRucker and Leonnig's mission is manifest in their title, a sarcastic jab at one of Trump's more memorable moments of self-congratulation. Accused of being either unthinking or unstable, Trump at the time denied being either. He was, he said, a very stable genius. Whether the president meant that with a touch of self-deprecating humor or not, it functions here as the epitome of self-delusion.\n\nTrump stands accused in these pages of gross incompetence, rampant racism, pathological narcissism, indifference to facts and ethics, and a penchant for chaos. There can be no doubt the prosecutors are asking the jury — and the judgment of history — for a verdict of guilty.\n\nCan a president really be this far removed from the reality base that the rest of official Washington takes for granted? Yes, say Rucker and Leonnig — and what is more, his free-form defiance of norms and restraints is the essence of Trump's governance — and of his enduring appeal to his adherents.\n\nOlder readers may recoil from much of this assessment — not only because the behavior described is repellent, but also because its depiction in such relentlessly damning detail is disturbing. People naturally ask: How much of this can be true?\n\nOne example sure to be much discussed is an anecdote from Trump's 2017 trip to Asia, which involved a stopover in Hawaii and a tour of Pearl Harbor. The authors relate how, while en route to the memorial for U.S. service members killed in the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that brought the U.S. into World War II, Trump pulled [Chief of Staff John] Kelly aside for a quick consult.\n\nThe authors then have Trump saying: Hey John, what's this all about? What's this a tour of?\n\nNext we are told: Kelly was momentarily stunned. Trump had heard the phrase 'Pearl Harbor' and appeared to understand that he was visiting the scene of a historic battle, but he did not seem to know much else.\n\nLater on the same page, we have one senior former adviser adding that Trump was at times dangerously uninformed.\n\nKelly formally left the White House at the start of 2019, so is he the senior former adviser being quoted here? Or was the adviser someone who had heard the Pearl Harbor story from Kelly? Or did the Pearl Harbor story come from someone else entirely?\n\nKelly would seem to be the only person who would have firsthand knowledge of the president's question and of Kelly's own reaction. This is only one of several points in the book where the former Marine Corps general seems the likeliest source on one incident or another.\n\nSo if he was the source, why not say so? Perhaps because Kelly spoke to the authors on background or for some other level of attribution.\n\nPrevious books about Trump have also prompted debates about sourcing and attribution. Like Michael Wolff's two efforts at exposés and Bob Woodward's Fear, this account relies on a mélange of on-the-record and off-the-record insiders with varying degrees of proximity to the president.\n\nAt times, this mixed methodology presents real problems. We are told many things that some critics or some in the White House or former officials have told the authors. Without questioning the legitimacy of these quotations, can we rely upon them the same way we would trust direct attributions?\n\nTo the authors' credit, the on-the-record elements are compelling on their own. These include attributed material from former strategist Steve Bannon, former transition chief (and former New Jersey governor) Chris Christie and some of Trump's Manhattan peers, Tom Barrack Jr. and Chris Ruddy.\n\nSomewhat more speculative are the thoughts indirectly attributed to former White House personnel such as Kelly, including Rex Tillerson (his first secretary of state), Jim Mattis (his first secretary of defense) and Don McGahn (his first White House counsel). All the above come off as valiant public servants who strove to be guardrails — to keep the president's rogue instincts in check – until they were fired or resigned.\n\nWe often hear that a particular White House official was surprised or that they felt one way or another. Without a direct quotation, this is either a species of omniscient narrator or an example of reporters protecting their sources. In this work, as in much contemporary reporting, reporters offer a real-time, firsthand narration of events they did not witness personally. We are being given the eyewitness accounts secondhand.\n\nOne such anecdote tells of Trump meeting for the first time with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.\n\nTrump is quoted saying to Modi at one point: It's not as though you have China right on your border... We are told this prompted Tillerson to cover part of his face with one hand so as to signal something to Modi without Trump seeing it. (For the record, India's 2,500-mile border with China is more than 500 miles longer than the U.S. border with Mexico.)\n\nOn another occasion, we are told, Trump summoned various officials to discuss the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. companies from paying bribes to foreign governments to secure business contracts. Trump said he wanted that law erased. Told he could not do undo legislation by fiat, Trump reportedly turned to ultra-loyal aide Stephen Miller and said: Steve, draft an executive order to repeal that law.\n\nThose who followed these events in real time may feel as if they are being dragged back through nightmares they would rather forget. At the same time, for those who have not been as focused on the daily and weekly ups and downs, this catalog may come with the force of revelation. For that reason alone, it is highly valuable.\n\nStill, you don't have to be a Trump loyalist to feel the authors have chosen only the incidents and eruptions that cast Trump in the most unfavorable light, a style reminiscent of the muckraking journalists of a century ago. Those who wish to see Trump's offenses balanced against his tax-and-regulation cuts or hear encomiums to his transformation of the federal judiciary will need to look elsewhere.\n\nAs excerpts of the book appear in the Post, we can expect a blizzard of blowback from Trump. In fact, even before publication, he had begun tweeting insults to inoculate his followers against any infection from Rucker and Leonnig's labors — calling Rucker Mr. Off-the-Record and suggesting that the Post's nasty White House bureau chief should not be allowed back on the grounds.\n\nWhen Trump sent those tweets, the Post immediately rejected criticism. It stood behind its reporters just as it did in the Watergate era, when the team of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein sparked the larger, official investigations that would drive President Richard Nixon from office. Their work relied substantially on unnamed sources, including one in particular (Deep Throat) who turned out to be the deputy director of the FBI.\n\nWe have long relied on front-line reporters from the most prominent news organizations to write books about the powerful figures they once covered. Such books have always trafficked in insider knowledge and insights gleaned from hours spent close to the flame of political power.\n\nYet there is something unsettling about the evolution of this genre. Is it purely a matter of Trump's excesses or has he occasioned a sea change in journalism as well? Is it all about Trump, or are we also witnessing a new set of standards for the presentation of a presidency — or of politics in general?\n\nIn terms of the Trump timeline, this book wraps up around the time the Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 election is being debated. Although special counsel Robert Mueller concludes the Russians did interfere in 2016 in hopes of helping Trump, his report does not find a criminal conspiracy involving the Trump campaign itself. But Mueller also provided a list of occasions when Trump's actions could be seen as interfering with the investigation, adding that he could neither indict a sitting president nor say these actions were not indictable.\n\nNonetheless, with Attorney General William Barr and Republicans in general treating the report as an exoneration, the authors tell us, Trump felt liberated. As one former official of his administration tells them: There's a new ethos: This is a presidency of one. It's Trump unleashed, unchanged, unhinged.\n\nIn their final pages, the authors draw a clear line from that moment to the one when Trump makes the moves regarding aid to Ukraine and his desired investigation of prospective rival Joe Biden — the line that led on to Trump's impeachment.\n\nWhatever may happen to that impeachment effort in the weeks and months ahead, it creates a moment of intermission in the Trump saga and a chance to consider how the landscape has already been altered by this president. A Very Stable Genius offers a harrowing companion narrative to be read during intermission.
Federal Judge Delays Manafort Trial, Grants Immunity To 5 Witnesses\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sketch by Art Lien Sketch by Art Lien\n\nUpdate 4:21 p.m. ET\n\nA federal judge in Virginia agreed on Monday to postpone the trial of Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\n\nThe initial phase of jury selection is still set to get underway this week in Alexandria, just outside Washington, D.C., but Manafort's trial itself now isn't scheduled to begin until next week, on July 31.\n\nFederal Judge T.S. Ellis III told the parties in a hearing that he recognized the equities and good reasons on both sides of this motion and would agree to Manafort's lawyers' request for more time.\n\nEllis also unsealed the names of five witnesses who have been granted partial immunity from prosecution in exchange for their testimony in Manafort's case.\n\nDocuments in the case so far didn't give much suggestion as to what the witnesses might be called upon to tell the jury.\n\nJustice Department special counsel Robert Mueller has charged Manafort with alleged tax fraud and money laundering connected to the work he once did for clients in Ukraine.\n\nManafort is also facing a separate federal prosecution in Washington; his trial there is set to take place later this year.\n\nGovernment witnesses\n\nEllis also ordered the government on Monday to turn over its full list of approximately 30 witnesses by the end of the day. And when asked about amending the proposed written questionnaire for prospective jurors, he said: I'm not moved.\n\nWe're not going to get into how people voted ... of course people can be fair no matter who they voted for, Ellis said.\n\nThe judge said he intended to get a jury seated expeditiously and then keep the process moving once it had begun following the new start date.\n\nI'm not going let this trial drag on, he said. I'm not in the theater business.
Football Taught Jack Kemp Early Lessons In Equality\n\nFormer Buffalo Bills quarterback turned political leader Jack Kemp died over the weekend. He was 73. Many people probably remember him because he was such a popular figure on the talk show circuit, both while he was in office and after he left. And because he was such an eager advocate for whatever he believed in — sometimes too eager — interviewing him was a challenge because it was hard to get a word in edgewise, even a question.\n\nWhat he believed in most was so-called supply-side economics, the tax-cutting philosophy that is most closely associated with conservative Republicans like Ronald Reagan. But what he also believed in was equal opportunity.\n\nCan I just tell you? Of all the people I have ever met, let alone public figures I have ever met, he might be one of the few I can think of as colorblind. And I mean that in a good way. Not blind in the sense of a convenient indifference to other people's real-life circumstances, but a real lack of interest in race — or class or status, for that matter — as a determining factor in his opinions about people.\n\nAs many people know, after his football-playing days ended, Kemp served as a member of Congress for nine terms, representing western New York. He was often quoted as saying his football career served him well as preparation for his later and longer career in politics because, according to a version quoted by The Associated Press, by the time he got into office he had been booed, cheered, cut, sold, traded and hung in effigy.\n\nBut football was good preparation in other ways, because Kemp clearly saw — in a way many of his white peers somehow did not — how ridiculous and destructive racism was for people who were trying to reach a common goal.\n\nIn a letter to his grandchildren that he posted on his company Web site shortly after the election of Barack Obama in November, Kemp talked about how, as a quarterback for the old San Diego Chargers, playing for the AFL championship in Houston, his father sat on the 50-yard line, while his co-captain's father, who was black, had to sit in a small roped-off section of the end zone.\n\nHe reminded his 17 grandchildren of the indignities, small and large, that he saw his teammates and friends endure. But he also went on to say, I could go on and on ... but just imagine in the face of all these indignities and deprivations, Dr. Martin Luther King could say 44 years ago, 'I have an abiding faith in America and an audacious faith in mankind.' \n\nAnd Kemp went on to say, Real leadership is not just seeing the realities of what we are temporarily faced with, but seeing the possibilities and potential that can be realized by lifting up people's vision of what they can be.\n\nKemp will be missed for many reasons, not least because he demonstrated that conservative principles can be argued without the subtext of race-baiting and nativism, to which so many of his peers continue to resort when their electoral backs are against the wall. In fact, it strikes me that the Republican Party, of which Kemp was a committed member, and the traditional civil rights leadership, of which he was often an ally, face a similar quandary of maintaining relevance in a fast-changing country.\n\nThe Republicans, their African-American party chairman notwithstanding, need to determine whether they will stand on ideas — and which ones — or resort to old tactics and tropes. The civil rights leadership, having been denied the respect and appreciation most deserved in their prime, sometimes seems to the younger generation overpraised and accorded excessive deference now, to the point where some younger leaders fear they will never be free of these elders' assumptions and expectations.\n\nKemp's words to his grandchildren are instructive here, too. He said, My advice for you, too, is to understand that unity for our nation doesn't require uniformity or unanimity. It does require putting the good of our people ahead of what's good for mere political or personal advantage.\n\nWorth remembering, as we remember Jack Kemp.
Workers Are Moving First, Asking Questions Later. What Happens When Offices Reopen?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Thomas Barwick/Getty Images Thomas Barwick/Getty Images\n\nKate Ray and her husband, David, had just moved into a one-bedroom apartment in downtown Denver last March.\n\nIt was brilliant for about two days, she recalls. The high-rise building offered floor-to-ceiling windows, a gorgeous roof deck and an outdoor pool.\n\nThen the pandemic arrived, and their jobs went remote. The pool closed within like 48 hours of us moving in, says Ray, 34. The gym closed. All of the amenities closed.\n\nIn November, sewage water started flowing into their apartment from the unit above. That made life even more unpleasant, but it had an upside: They were allowed to break their lease.\n\nWith the freedom to move, they quickly bought a house — sight unseen — just outside Duluth, Minn., where Ray, who was now pregnant, has family.\n\nThey told their employers at first the move was temporary – just through her maternity leave. They didn't mention that they had bought a home in Minnesota.\n\nI think we both had fear of what that would mean for our employment conditions, she explains, but also because we couldn't really admit to ourselves, I think, the level of commitment that we were making and the level of crazy life changes that were happening.\n\nNot everybody is going to come back\n\nThey're not alone in making big moves during the pandemic. With millions of Americans suddenly working remotely, some took the unprecedented opportunity to shift their lives in a new direction — crossing their fingers that when it's safe to go back to the office, they won't have to.\n\nDavid Lewis is the CEO of OperationsInc, an HR consulting firm in Connecticut. Many of his clients have seen employees suddenly move out of state, and they've just rolled with it.\n\nIt wasn't frowned upon as much as it probably would have been prior to COVID — and now I think that day of reckoning is coming, he says.\n\nHe predicts that more than half of companies that can allow remote work will continue to, at least part time. And companies should think hard before being heavy-handed in ordering people back to the office from wherever they are now, he says. The good news is you could get everybody back in the office, he says. The bad news is ... not everybody is going to come back.\n\nWhen it comes to those workers who have already moved, Lewis says it depends who those workers are.\n\nIf they're valued employees and they're productive ones, and they have continued to be productive while working in this COVID world, chances are organizations are going to allow them to continue to do that.\n\nThat seems to be the case for the Rays. Now that they're hundreds of miles from Denver, their employers have hinted that they can probably keep working remotely.\n\nHoping to be fully remote forever\n\nIn Chicago, Renee, 38, was feeling similarly stuck in her high-rise condo when the pandemic arrived. She asked to go by her middle name so that she doesn't complicate her employment status.\n\nHer job at a market research firm went remote, and most of her boyfriend's dog-walking clients no longer needed him. For months, the couple would only leave their River North condo for a 6 a.m. walk.\n\nRenee had long dreamed of moving to Seattle. As the pandemic dragged on, she sought approval from her employer to relocate temporarily to Washington state. After initial pushback, she ended up with a new manager who had no problem with her moving.\n\nSo after holding a Zoom wedding in October, the newlyweds packed up some belongings and their cat, Bagel, and headed to Seattle.\n\nThey're now staying in a series of monthlong rentals.\n\nRenee has not missed the Chicago winter, and she loves having easier access to nature. In Seattle, you have all of these beautiful parks, she says. You can drive into the mountains in 30 minutes and get these amazing hikes in.\n\nThere are tradeoffs. One upside: Washington doesn't have a state income tax. A downside: The couple now pays double for housing, since they still have the mortgage on their Chicago condo. They're not ready to sell that yet, in part because she doesn't know if or when she'll have to return to the office.\n\nShe knows a lot of her colleagues want to be back in the office at least part time. But for her, the goal is to be fully remote forever.\n\nFor employers, moves bring costs and benefits\n\nA PwC survey of 1,200 U.S. office workers currently working remotely found that when the pandemic recedes, 29% want to work remotely five days a week. And 55% said they'd like to be remote at least three days a week.\n\nCompany leaders are a bit less enthusiastic. A parallel survey of executives found that 68% believe workers should be in the office at least three days a week to maintain company culture, and 65% believe the office is very important to increasing employee productivity.\n\nBhushan Sethi leads PwC's workforce strategy practice. He says that whether companies allow significant remote work will depend on what industry they're in, the size of their real estate footprint, and whether they have a lot of young workers to train.\n\nBut there are some big potential upsides for employers to remote work. Companies can hire talent in places they couldn't before, Sethi says.\n\nAnd offering remote jobs can mean gaining — or losing — an edge in attracting and retaining talent. Lewis predicts a big bump in the number of job listings touting that a position can be at least partly remote.\n\nJumping off of a ledge without a parachute\n\nWhile some workers have moved across the country, others have relocated within the very-long-commute range.\n\nOne of them is Benji, 34, who moved with his partner and daughter from downtown Detroit to Lansing, Mich., in August. He asked that his last name not be used in order to not complicate his job situation.\n\nHe and his partner signed a two-year lease, even though Benji's employer, a large health insurance company, hasn't given him permission to work remotely permanently.\n\nOh, it felt totally risky, he says, laughing. It felt like I was jumping off of a ledge without a parachute.\n\nIn Lansing, he enjoys the proximity to his family, a cheaper cost of living and the local schools for his daughter. When there's not a deadly virus, it is a fun town, he says.\n\nHe takes inspiration from the digital nomads he follows on YouTube and travel blogs. They seem to enjoy a sense of freedom and possibility in their lives that he hadn't been feeling in his own work life, he says.\n\nThey're living in Bali and working on a laptop with a hot spot in their bikini — and I was honestly jealous, he says. Moving from Detroit to Lansing is about the closest I was going to get to that kind of jet-setting lifestyle.
After Decades-Long Push, It's Not Clear Who Will Bid In Arctic Refuge Oil Lease Sale\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Barcroft Media/Barcroft Media via Getty Images Barcroft Media/Barcroft Media via Getty Images\n\nJust two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, the Trump administration is trying to lock-in oil and gas drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge with a hastily scheduled and controversial lease sale.\n\nThe event, January 6, marks a major moment in a 40-year fight over whether to develop the northernmost slice of the refuge's coastal plain, home to migrating caribou, birds and polar bears.\n\nBiden, as well as his pick for Interior Secretary — Rep. Deb Haaland — oppose drilling in the refuge. The hand-off of drilling rights to the highest bidders could make it more difficult to reverse course.\n\nBut despite the high stakes, uncertainty looms over how much oil is actually trapped under the million acres of tundra up for leasing, and how much industry interest there is to go find it.\n\n'We don't know very much about this area'\n\nThe data on what's under the coastal plain is decades old.\n\nWe don't know very much about this area, says David Houseknecht, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. Oil seeps and rock formations seem promising, but he says the agency hasn't estimated the coastal plain's oil potential since the late 1990s.\n\nBack then, it relied on seismic testing from a decade prior, technology that's now outdated. It found that anywhere from about 4 to 12 billion barrels of recoverable oil could lie beneath the federal lands. That's a whole lot of oil, but also a very large range of uncertainty, Houseknecht says. The seismic data that we have are quite old, low resolution and a sparse grid.\n\nThe other challenge, he says: There's no data from actual wells in the refuge.\n\nJust one exploratory well has been drilled in the coastal plain, on Alaska Native land in the 1980s, and the results are a closely-guarded secret.\n\nMark Myers, a former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, is among only a few people who have seen the well results outside of the oil companies that paid for it.\n\nI signed a confidentiality agreement, and it didn't have an end date on it, he says with a small laugh. I can't comment on it, in terms of what I saw.\n\nA New York Times investigation based on interviews and legal documents suggested the results were not promising.\n\nHouseknecht says geologists don't know more about the coastal plain's oil potential because it wasn't until late 2017 that Congress decided to allow drilling there, after decades of debate.\n\nIn recent years, he says, USGS had the 1980s seismic data commercially reanalyzed and planned to use it for a new oil assessment. But after the opening of the refuge three years ago the Interior Department called off the work without providing a reason why.\n\nBidding could be fairly lukewarm\n\nAs for who will bid in the lease sale, that's another mystery.\n\nOil and gas companies aren't talking about their plans publicly, which isn't surprising, says Kara Moriarty, head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, an industry trade group.\n\nParticipation in lease sales is one of the most competitive and secretive things between companies, she says.\n\nBidding has already taken place, but Moriarty says she doesn't expect to know more until the federal government unseals companies' bids during the January 6 event, which will be streamed online.\n\nOil industry analyst Rowena Gunn, with the research firm Wood Mackenzie, believes enthusiasm could be fairly lukewarm.\n\nControversy is one reason.\n\nIt wouldn't necessarily be good PR for them to be seen as drilling in the Arctic, or drilling in environmentally-sensitive areas, she says.\n\nEnvironmental organizations and some tribal groups have been lobbying oil companies, banks and other financial institutions to stay away from developing the refuge. A number of major banks say they won't fund oil projects in the Arctic.\n\nOpponents have also filed multiple lawsuits seeking to block drilling. They've raised concerns about its impacts on Indigenous people, the global climate, and wildlife, including the caribou that give birth in the coastal plain and the polar bears that den there. Even if leases are sold, legal experts say it's possible that courts could later cancel them.\n\nIn response to concerns about wildlife, as well as oil industry interest, the Bureau of Land Management recently removed nearly a third of the original 1.6 million acres from the sale. Geologist Houseknect says those areas do not have high potential for oil.\n\n'Very little capital for exploration'\n\nSupporters of drilling the refuge, including many Alaska politicians, argue that it's good for the economy and jobs.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski worked with the White House to open the coastal plain to drilling as part of Trump's massive 2017 tax bill. The idea was to create revenue to offset tax cuts, so the legislation directed the federal government to carry out two oil and gas lease sales by 2024.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the leasing program could generate a windfall of $1.8 billion over a decade, to be split between Alaska and the federal government.\n\nCritics of the sale, including the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, say they expect the dollar-figure to be much lower.\n\nFor right now, this absolutely seems to make no fiscal sense, says Autumn Hanna, vice president of the group. We don't need the oil. Why would we be going into such hard-to-access, sensitive places where the costs of exploration and development are so high?\n\nMyers, the former Alaska commissioner, agrees development costs could dampen interest.\n\nIt's already more expensive to drill in the Arctic compared to, say, Texas. On top of that, he says, oil prices are still relatively low after an oil-price war and the coronavirus pandemic hit the industry hard.\n\nThe prices have fallen down to a level that leaves very little capital for exploration in these companies, Myers says. So that's one of the biggest negatives.\n\nBut perhaps the greatest uncertainty is the changing administration.\n\nPresident-elect Biden says he opposes drilling in the refuge, and that he'll take steps to permanently protect it, though he hasn't said how.\n\nIt's possible his administration could delay the environmental permitting process for companies that buy leases from the Trump administration. Or a Biden administration could try to buy the leases back.\n\nCiting concerns about limited industry interest, Alaska politicians have lobbied for the state to step in. The board of a state-owned economic development corporation recently voted to bid up to $20 million at the lease sale.\n\nThe idea is the corporation could operate as a backstop, to submit minimum bids on the tracts and secure drilling rights in case no one else makes any offers. Then, at some point, it could partner with oil companies to do the actual drilling.\n\nIf any leases are bought and finalized, it will be just the start of a long process. Industry analysts say it would take at least a decade to actually pump oil out of Alaska's Arctic refuge.
White House Wants To Send Checks To Americans As Coronavirus Stalls Economy\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nUpdated at 2:30 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump has proposed sending money directly to Americans to help blunt the economic impact caused by the coronavirus pandemic, saying it's time to go big to boost the now-stalled economy.\n\nTrump said he wants Congress to push through a major comprehensive package to help businesses and workers facing hardships — one of many abrupt shifts the administration has made this week as the scope of the pandemic has come into sharp focus.\n\nThat's the way I want to go. I just want to get it done and have a big infusion, as opposed to going through little meetings every couple of days, Trump said. We want to go big.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the administration is asking Congress for another coronavirus relief package — including loans and direct payments — that would inject $1 trillion into the economy. It's a big number, he acknowledged. 'This is a very unique situation in this economy.\n\nAfter weeks downplaying the risk of the virus and dismissing the suggestion that the U.S. economy was headed toward a dramatic slowdown, Trump has made a turn this week, taking on a more somber and ominous tone about the impact the pandemic will have.\n\nPressed by reporters, Trump brushed off suggestions that he had changed his tone. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic, Trump said.\n\nBut before this week, Trump repeatedly compared the coronavirus to the average flu. And in early March, Trump said he did not think it was inevitable that the coronavirus would spread across the country, contradicting health officials at the time.\n\nSending out money immediately\n\nMnuchin met with lawmakers Tuesday to discuss details of the administration's proposal. He said Trump wants to start sending out checks within the next two weeks, though it was not immediately clear whether that would be possible or how it would work.\n\nIt's not clear what income ceiling might be put on the stimulus payments, but Mnuchin said the government does not want to send checks to millionaires.\n\nThe administration is also planning to allow Americans to defer tax payments up to $1 million for 90 days.\n\nMnuchin emphasized that banks and markets would remain open and that Americans would be able to access their money and stocks. We may get to a point where we shorten the hours if that's something they need to do, he said.\n\nWe'll see what happens after that\n\nOn Monday, the White House recommended new guidelines to slow the spread of the coronavirus over the next 15 days, urging older Americans to stay home. Trump asked all residents to avoid crowds of more than 10 people, avoid travel and stop eating in restaurants.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of state and local officials are issuing sweeping orders to close school for millions of children and shut down bars and restaurants for all but takeout orders. Areas hit hard by the spread of the virus, like San Francisco, have gone further, mandating that residents stay indoors and work from home.\n\nTrump ruled out the idea of a nationwide lockdown at this time but did not rule out taking even stricter measures as the pandemic continues.\n\nDeborah Birx, the White House response coordinator, urged people of all ages to heed the guidelines. We hear every night of people who are not in work moving that time into bars and other areas of large gatherings. If we continue with that process, we will fail in containing this virus, she said.\n\nWe're asking the younger generations to stop going out in public places, to bars and restaurants, and spreading asymptomatic virus onto countertops and knobs and grocery stores and grocery carts, she said.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, the coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 195,000 people around the world. In the U.S., there have so far been more than 5,700 confirmed cases.\n\nWith federal officials this week ramping up testing nationwide, public health experts say the prevalence of the virus in the U.S. is expected to get worse before it gets better, since testing in the country has until now been sparse.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that it would still be several weeks or longer before health experts can assess whether social distancing measures are slowing down the spread of the virus. Fauci has been helping lead the administration's response to the virus.\n\nIn Congress, late Monday, the House sent a bill to address paid sick leave and testing to the Senate, which is expected to vote on the measure this week. Earlier this month, Congress passed a roughly $8 billion package to address the response effort.\n\nAdditionally, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed $750 billion to raise funding for unemployment insurance, coronavirus treatment and emergency child care assistance. This spending measure is separate from the aid the White House is seeking from Congress.\n\nNPR's Kelsey Snell contributed to this story.
Restore PA and Wolf's fifth severance tax attempt, explained\n\nEd Mahon/PA Post Bio Recent Stories Ed Mahon was a reporter for PA Post.\n\n\n\nPreviously, he was an investigative and political reporter at the York Daily Record/Sunday News, where his work revealed holes in Pennsylvania's system for protecting victims of domestic violence.\n\n\n\nHe grew up in Delaware County, graduated from La Salle University in Philadelphia and has lived in Pennsylvania most of his life.\n\nMarie Cusick Bio Recent Stories As the Harrisburg reporter for StateImpact Pennsylvania, Marie Cusick covers energy and environmental issues for public radio stations statewide. She's also part of NPR's energy and environment team, which coordinates coverage between the network and select member station reporters around the country. Her work frequently airs on NPR shows including Morning Edition, All Things Considered, and Weekend Edition. Since 2012, Marie has closely followed the political, social, environmental, and economic effects of Pennsylvania's natural gas boom. Her work has been recognized at the regional and national levels– honors include a Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists and a national Edward R.

Previously, Marie was a multimedia reporter for WMHT in Albany, New York and covered technology for the station's statewide public affairs TV show, New York NOW. In 2018, she became StateImpact's first FAA-licensed drone pilot.\n\nWhen Tom Wolf first ran for governor in 2014, he called for a severance tax on natural gas drilling. After he was elected, he pushed for one in every budget — without success.\n\nThis year, he's trying a new tactic. He's proposing $4.5 billion worth of infrastructure initiatives over four years.\n\nThe state would borrow the money for projects and pay the debt back over a long time — up to 20 years.\n\nUnlike in past years, this severance tax plan is separate from the budget process.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the proposal and why Wolf thinks — this time — it won't be pushed off into never-never land.\n\nWhy the new approach?\n\nDuring a recent interview on WITF's Smart Talk radio show, Wolf said the new approach addresses concerns that the severance tax money would be folded into the general fund and lead to a ratchet up of spending that government has a reputation for doing.\n\nJoanne Cassaro / WITF\n\nHow high would the tax be?\n\nThe rate of the severance tax would vary based on the average annual price of natural gas.\n\nIt could be as low as 9.1 cents per thousand cubic feet of natural gas extracted and as high as 15.7 cents per thousand cubic feet.\n\nThe Wolf administration has estimated that the effective rate of the severance tax would be about 4.5 percent in the first four years. And combined with the existing impact fee, the effective rate would equal about 5.9 percent.\n\nHow much would it cost to borrow the money?\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Turzai, an Allegheny County Republican who opposes Wolf's proposed severance tax, said the plan will likely lead to at least $6.5 billion of new debt because of interest payments required to borrow the money.\n\nDuring a statewide radio interview hosted by Keystone Crossroads, Wolf said he didn't have an exact figure for how much the interest would cost.\n\nWhere would the Restore PA money go?\n\nThe Wolf administration has broken the funding down into main areas.\n\nThey are:\n\nMitigate flooding;\n\nExpand broadband;\n\nAddress blight;\n\nRemove polluting or poisonous substances from schools, drinking water and other places;\n\nGreen infrastructure;\n\nTransportation projects;\n\nBusiness development, including for the last few miles of natural gas utility lines that connect to manufacturing and industrial sites.\n\nWolf says how the money is used will depend on the needs of each community.\n\nBut Wolf said it's worth borrowing the money, and thus paying the interest costs, because of the benefits.\n\nThe question is how much are we going to pay for not preventing floods? Wolf said. …What's the opportunity cost for not having kids who have access to the internet?\n\nWhy the Republican House Speaker doesn't like Restore PA\n\nTurzai has raised several objections.\n\nAssociated Press / Matt Rourke\n\nHere are some of his arguments.\n\nThe tax would make natural gas more expensive to produce and deter fracking in Pennsylvania. The industry has created tens of thousands of jobs and led to savings for residential customers who buy natural gas, Turzai said. The debt is a problem. Turzai said the plan would create a debt-financed slush fund to be allocated at the whim of a new government board. Spending money on infrastructure, rural broadband, stormwater management and brownfield cleanup are worthy projects. But he said, when it comes to broadband, we do take issue with subsidizing multi-billion-dollar corporations to deploy technology using money from taxpayers.\n\nWhat are Republican proposing?\n\nIn the state Senate, two Republicans from southwestern Pennsylvania have proposed what they call an alternative way of paying for important infrastructure projects:\n\nOpening up more gas drilling underneath state-owned forest land.\n\nThis is in no way putting a drilling rig in the middle of a forest, said Republican Camera Bartolotta in a story reported by WITF's Katie Meyer. Three miles away, these things can be done. And it's 6,000 feet underground.\n\nWolf opposes the measure from Bartolotta and Republican Pat Stefano. In 2014, then-Governor Tom Corbett, a Republican, advanced a similar idea, which his administration called non-impact drilling. It was controversial and ultimately did not result in any new leasing or revenue to the state.\n\nMarie Cusick / StateImpact Pennsylvania\n\nIn the House, Turzai and other Republicans have proposed Energize PA — what they call a package of pro-growth, pro-jobs legislation that will raise money by growing the economy.\n\nWolf said Energize PA wouldn't raise the $4.5 billion dollars that his plan would.\n\nWhy some environmentalists don't like Restore PA\n\nThey don't like natural gas drilling.\n\nAnd because Restore PA requires the state to pay off debt with severance tax money, the state would be tied to natural gas drilling for up to 20 years.\n\n#askgovwolf States around us ban fracking, but you have it as a part of your restore PA plan. Why can't we move toward clean renewable energy instead of living in the past? — Fossil Free Pitt (@FossilFreePitt) June 20, 2019\n\n#AskGovWolf Gov. you are way too soft on plastic … SUP is bad, whether it can be recycled or not. Recycling is not the answer. And lightweight products to meet the climate crisis is a euphemism for plastic. We can't bet our future on this toxic industry. — catherine gammon (@nonabiding) June 20, 2019\n\n\n\nIn an #AskGovWolf radio show hosted by Keystone Crossroads, Wolf said people need to be concerned about climate change.\n\nBut in that energy efficient future, in that future that has a lower carbon footprint, we're going to need to have lightweight products and those lightweight products are going to be made of the natural resource that happens to lie beneath Pennsylvania, he said.\n\nLater, Wolf's press secretary, J.J. Abbott, said the governor was pointing to the fact that lightweight plastics improve gas mileage in vehicles and can reduce the energy required for shipping.\n\nWolf's rhetoric around addressing climate change is at odds with his desire to expand Pennsylvania's petrochemical industry. During his reelection campaign last year, Wolf linked the need for renewable energy to his support for the massive ethane cracker Shell is building outside Pittsburgh. Once it's online, the plant will be among the largest air pollution sources in the state.\n\nWhat is Wolf's argument for the severance tax?\n\nPennsylvania is the only major gas-producing state in the country without a severance tax.\n\nWolf argues that, because natural gas is distributed across state lines, Pennsylvania residents end up paying for the cost of severance taxes in other states.\n\nAnd Wolf says there are two big reasons why a tax won't drive drillers away. The natural gas is here, for one. The industry has also invested billions of dollars in new pipelines to move the gas to new customers– in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nAnd the state is smack dab in the middle of the richest market in the world for the products that come out of this, Wolf said.\n\nThat gives the state an advantage over Texas, Louisiana and Alberta, Canada, he said.\n\n\n\nWho supports Restore PA?\n\nIn the state House, the legislation was introduced with 99 co-sponsors. That's nearly a majority of members supporting the measure in the 203-seat chamber.\n\nOf those 99 lawmakers, 83 are Democrats and 16 are Republicans.\n\nHalf of those Republican co-sponsors represent part of the Philly suburbs: Delaware, Bucks, Montgomery and Chester counties.\n\nIn the 50-seat state Senate, the legislation was introduced with 25 co-sponsors: 21 Democrats and 4 Republicans.\n\nThree of the four Republicans represent only or mostly the Philly suburbs. The fourth is Sen. Mario Scavello, who represents parts of Monroe and Northampton counties.\n\nWolf has also received endorsements from community leaders across the state — although, he acknowledged, relatively few north of Interstate 80.\n\n(The Wolf administration created the below map of community endorsements.)\n\nMaybe I'm not explaining it as well as I should, but those areas above Route 80 are actually places that could use this the most, where broadband doesn't exist, Wolf said on WITF's Smart Talk.\n\nThe lack of broadband hurts people's access to business, schools and healthcare — and he said once autonomous vehicles become a reality, areas without broadband won't have them.\n\nWhy Pennsylvania has never enacted a severance tax\n\nSince Pennsylvania's natural gas boom began around 2008, there have been calls to implement a severance tax, but it's never happened. Why? As StateImpact Pennsylvania has reported, a lot of it comes down to the power of the natural gas lobby.\n\nShortly after the gas boom started, in 2009, the state House (then controlled by Democrats) passed a severance tax. It was defeated by Republicans in the Senate.\n\nCourtesy: Roxburynews.com\n\nInstead of a tax, Pennsylvania came up with a unique way of handling the fiscal impacts of drilling. In 2012, the legislature passed a special impact fee. Gas companies pay a fee for each well they drill. Most of the money goes back to the local governments where drilling is happening.\n\nA severance tax would be paid on how much gas is produced, when drillers sever the resource from the earth. In other words, Pennsylvania taxes holes in the ground — not gas.\n\nIn 2017, the GOP-led state Senate also approved a modest severance tax. It did not advance in the Republican-controlled House.\n\nWhile severance tax talk continued in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's natural production has skyrocketed. In 2017, the Commonwealth accounted for 19 percent of total U.S. natural gas production — more than any other state, except Texas.\n\nHow much money has the impact fee raised?\n\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the impact fee brought in more than $1.4 billion from 2011 through 2017.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, the Pennsylvania Independent Fiscal Office estimated that the impact fee would generate $247 million for 2018.\n\nWhat happens to the impact fee if Restore PA passes?\n\nIt would remain. Wolf says that impact fee is important for areas directly affected by drilling.\n\nWolf has estimated that his proposed severance tax would bring in about $300 million more a year, on top of the impact fee.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nIn the state House, Democratic Leader Frank Dermody said that members were preparing a discharge resolution to move the Restore PA bill out of the Environmental Resources and Energy Committee if there is not quick enough action on it. It takes a majority vote in the House to pass a discharge resolution, sending it to the full House.\n\nUnder the current legislative calendar, Restore PA supporters wouldn't be able to attempt a discharge resolution in the House until the fall, said House Democratic Caucus spokesman Bill Patton.\n\nAnd there are also procedural moves that a committee chair can take, such as changing the bill significantly through an amendment, to stop a measure passing through a discharge resolution.\n\nIn the Senate, Majority Leader Jake Corman said the Senate doesn't plan to take up the Restore PA bill this month, reported Capitolwire, an online subscription-based news service.\n\nWolf said he's hopeful lawmakers will return to it in the fall.\n\nOften when they say we're going to get to it in the fall, that's just sort of pushing it off into never-never land, Wolf said. But I think this time, it is something that we're all going to come back to in the fall.\n\nEditor's Picks
How Did Trump's And Clinton's Economic Policy Speeches Compare?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mary Altaffer and Chuck Burton/AP Mary Altaffer and Chuck Burton/AP\n\nDespite the vast differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, there were some striking similarities between the economic speeches they delivered this week. They both spoke in Michigan, where they both talked a lot about manufacturing, with both of them insisting that they would obtain fairer trade deals.\n\nThat's because both candidates are trying to latch onto — and insist that they can alleviate — a pervasive feeling among Americans that they just can't get ahead, and that it's related to a fast-changing U.S. economy. The candidates, of course, diverge vastly on many issues, but they also have some surprising areas of agreement.\n\nBelow, listen to what they said on five different policy areas, and read how the two candidates differ.\n\nTrade\n\nThat is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen. Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests. Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA. If we don't get a better deal, we will walk away. — Donald Trump\n\nListen To Trump On Trade 1:16\n\nBut the answer is not to rant and rave – or to cut ourselves off from the world. That would end up killing even more jobs. The answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us. So my message, my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages – including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as President. — Hillary Clinton\n\nListen To Clinton On Trade 0:45\n\nTrump and Clinton had a similar basic message on trade: I'm for trade deals; just not these trade deals.\n\nTrump, for example, said he would walk away if a renegotiation of NAFTA didn't turn out the way he wanted. And as he later added: Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. He also warned that the Trans Pacific Partnership would mean a million lost manufacturing jobs.\n\nAs for what he would do, in that seven-point trade plan he said he would label China a currency manipulator (people accuse China of manipulating its currency's value to exports cheap, meaning other countries' consumers would buy more), crack down on intellectual property theft, and impose tariffs on countries that cheat.\n\nClinton likewise says that she doesn't want the U.S. to cut ourselves off from the world and that trade can work for us. But she also — like Trump — had strong words against TPP: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages – including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as President.\n\nAnd she had many echoes of Trump in her speech — she said in her speech that she would impose targeted tariffs on companies that break the rules. Like Trump, she also pointed to currency manipulation and intellectual property theft as a problem.\n\nTrump's rejection of trade deals fits with one of his own broader campaign narratives: rejecting the establishment. Many Republicans — and, importantly, the Chamber of Commerce, which has given heavy financial support to Republican candidates — support free trade. This is just one way Trump thumbs his nose at more traditional Republican ideas.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nA big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to create more jobs at higher pay. And that means for us, creating an infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and complement our public investments. $25 billion in government seed funding could unlock more than $250 billion and really get our country moving on our infrastructure plans. — Hillary Clinton\n\nListen To Clinton On Infrastructure 0:35\n\nBut we are going to look boldly into the future. We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, seaports and airports. That believe me folks is what our country deserves. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation. — Donald Trump\n\nListen To Trump On Infrastructure 0:55\n\nAnother area in which Clinton and Trump broadly agree: both want to ramp up infrastructure spending.\n\nClinton has said she wants to spend $275 billion over five years (with additional private spending, eventually). She's proposed an infrastructure bank — an idea that has been around in Washington for decades now (at times, with bipartisan support, though it has been more of a Democratic cause in recent years) but that continually fails to gain much traction.\n\nThe basic idea is that the government would start a fund — in Clinton's case, $25 billion — and use it to finance major projects, for example through loans and loan guarantees (this CBO report is a good background). This can help spur new private investment that construction projects do not currently attract, as the left-leaning Center for American Progress explained in a 2012 report.\n\nTrump likewise in his speech touted infrastructure spending, though he didn't get into detail. However, he has explained those details elsewhere: he has seemed close to Clinton on the idea that something like an infrastructure bank would be the way to fund those projects, as the Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos wrote earlier this year, with Americans buying infrastructure bonds.\n\nHowever, he has said he wants to spend $500 billion or more on infrastructure, nearly double what Clinton wants to spend. Because interest rates are low right now, he has said, it is a great time to borrow. This puts him at odds with current Republican economic principles, which have focused more on reducing deficits.\n\nPersonal Taxes\n\nAnd Wall Street corporations, and the super-rich should finally pay their fair share of taxes. That's why I support the so-called Buffett Rule, because multi-millionaires should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries. We should also add a new tax on multi-millionaires, crack down on tax gaming by corporations, and close the carried interest loophole – something I've advocated for years. — Hillary Clinton\n\nListen To Clinton On Personal Taxes 0:33\n\nI am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new and really good-paying jobs. The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability as a nation to compete. — Donald Trump\n\nListen To Trump On Personal Taxes 0:23\n\nTrump's tax plan is where he hews much more closely to other Republicans' ideas. In fact, he recently overhauled his initial tax plan (which has been removed from his website) in favor of a new plan with brackets that match those proposed by House Republicans, though Trump has said would also add in a zero bracket. His new plan would lower the top rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, and with that zero bracket would have only four brackets, down from the current seven.\n\nThose consolidated, lower rates would largely benefit wealthier taxpayers. Not only that, but Trump would drastically lower the corporate tax rate and eliminate the estate tax — both of which are standard Republican talking points.\n\nAn analysis from the Tax Foundation found that those House Republican income tax brackets would provide tax cuts across the economic spectrum, but that the benefits would be much bigger for rich Americans. The top 1 percent would see their after-tax incomes grow by 5.3 percent, while people below the 80th percentile would see little change, with their incomes growing by less than 1 percent (these figures do not take into account any additional economic effects the plan would have).\n\nAltogether, Trump's plan would slash revenues and thereby grow the deficit. His former plan would have added $9.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. This one, with its higher income tax rates, would cut that figure, though it's unclear by how much. Larry Kudlow, a CNBC commentator and informal advisor to Trump, said the addition to the deficit would now total $3 trillion.\n\nClinton's plan, meanwhile, goes in the opposite direction: she relies heavily upon taxing the rich, a major way she pays for her other programs. Lower and middle-income people, meanwhile, would see their incomes change little — some with a slight decline — while the richest one percent would see their incomes fall by 5 percent or more, according to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center. The Tax Foundation likewise found few income changes for people who aren't the very highest earners.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center has estimated that Clinton's tax proposals would boost revenue by $1.1 trillion over a decade.\n\nCorporate Taxes\n\nAll of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside of the United States. Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes. In other words, we're reducing your taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent. — Donald Trump\n\nListen To Trump On Corporate Taxes 0:26\n\nRight now, when a corporation outsources jobs and production, it can write off the costs. We must stop that, and we must make them pay back tax breaks they ever received from any level of government in our country. And for those that move their headquarters overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, they're gonna have to pay a new exit tax. So if they want to go, they're going to have to pay to go. — Hillary Clinton\n\nListen To Clinton On Corporate Taxes 0:35\n\nTrump and Clinton both talked about taxes in terms of bringing overseas jobs into the U.S. Trump framed his plan for this as simple: he would drastically lower the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent — which is high among other advanced economies — to 15 percent, in an attempt to lure businesses into the country. (However, many U.S. businesses take advantage of tax breaks to pay far less than that 35 percent rate right now.)\n\nTrump's 15 percent plan may have an unintended consequence, however; he would apply that rate to pass-through business income, which is taxed at a top rate of 39.6 percent. That benefits the owners of certain types of businesses, allowing them to drastically cut their tax bills, and could encourage people to avoid taxes by changing how they report their earnings.\n\nClinton's framed her business taxes, meanwhile, as a way to stop companies from leaving the U.S. — she would imposes an exit tax on some companies leaving the country, and she also said she would crack down on tax inversions, in which a company moves its headquarters in order to take advantage of lower tax rates overseas.\n\nChild Care\n\nI think instead we should expand the Child Tax Credit to provide real relief to tens of millions of working families struggling with the costs of raising children – the same families that his plan ignores. And that's just a start. Because the more we do to help working families, the more our entire economy will benefit. — Hillary Clinton\n\nListen To Clinton On Child Care 0:21\n\nMy plan will also help reduce the cost of child care by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes. — Donald Trump\n\nListen To Trump On Child Care 0:11\n\nTrump's child care plan focuses on allowing families to deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes. That was immediately panned this week as largely benefiting richer Americans — higher earners pay higher tax rates, and many lower-and-middle-income households don't pay any federal income tax. Trump's campaign added that they would also have a plan for those lower-income households, allowing them to exclude child care expenses from half their payroll taxes.\n\nClinton swung back in her speech, emphasizing criticisms that Trump's plan would mainly benefit more well-to-do families. She touted her plan, which she said would cap the cost of child care at 10 percent of families' income, but then added that she was also proposing paid family leave, not to mention equal pay policies.\n\nThese kinds of family friendly policies have been at the center of Clinton's campaign throughout this election season. Though Trump is venturing into this territory, she seemed to be saying that she owns this policy area far more than he does.\n\nIt's not clear how much these programs would cost, but they could get expensive. Trump's would cut the tax liabilities of richer families in particular. Clinton's, meanwhile, would expand the Child Tax Credit and further subsidize child care, as the Washington Post has reported. The Huffington Post pointed to Sanders' universal child care plan — which, admittedly, is not quite the same as Clinton's — to provide a sense of scale. The bill for that plan came out at $35 billion per year, by one estimate.\n\nManufacturing\n\nHillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs. — Donald Trump\n\nListen To Trump On Manufacturing 0:46\n\nAnd then in 2000, as the market began to change and some of the auto companies began to realign, [Futuramic was] faced with a choice. We all face choices in life, don't we? And this company could have just said hey, you know, our business is not going to be what it was. We've got to just fold up. Let's, you know, just kind of quit. But that's not what happened here. And what happened here is what can happen across America. — Hillary Clinton\n\nListen To Clinton On Manufacturing 0:33\n\nTrump and Clinton both champion manufacturing in their speeches — it goes hand in hand with their strong rhetoric on trade. Trump focuses on the sharp decline in manufacturing jobs — the U.S. now has around 12.3 million manufacturing jobs, down by more than 7 million from a late-1970s peak. And while automation has helped to eat away at manufacturing jobs, there's also good evidence that China — one of Trump's chief villains when he talks about trade — played a big role in hurting U.S. manufacturing jobs.\n\nHowever, it's important to point out that the manufacturing industry itself is doing pretty well, something that isn't readily apparent from Trump's rhetoric. In fact, manufacturing output is about where it was at its pre-recession peak.\n\nTrump connected his manufacturing ideas with his plans for infrastructure and trade (for which, see above): he said that the goods used to produce this new infrastructure would be made in America, and he focused on foreign competitors (in particular China) whom he says have severely hurt American manufacturing. Tougher trade enforcement with China, he said, could reshore millions of jobs.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, seems to be saying that looking to manufacturing's past is the wrong strategy; she emphasized this with an anecdote about how Futuramic (the company where she spoke) moved from auto supply to aerospace manufacturing to remain profitable.\n\nLike Trump, she linked tougher trade policy to boosting manufacturing jobs. However, she also touted other specific plans that fit with her innovation-themed speech, like expanding scientific research that can create entire new industries. She also touted a tax credit aimed at boosting low-income areas.\n\nThe manufacturing industry has become fertile ground in an election season where populist candidates like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have been unexpectedly successful.\n\nThough the industry employs a relatively small share of Americans, the emphasis on manufacturing — a strong sector that nevertheless has lost millions of jobs — may nevertheless resonate with the many Americans who hear that the economy is recovering, yet feel that they no longer have the opportunities for prosperity that they once had.
California Says Goodbye To Jerry Brown, State's Longest-Serving Governor\n\nAfter a long political career, it's Jerry Brown's last day in office. He is retiring after four terms as the governor of California, and we remember his time through some of his more memorable quips.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown finishes his term today. He's always liked reeling off Latin quotes and obscure literary and historical references. Ben Adler of Capital Public Radio has a reporter's notebook of some of Brown's more memorable quips during his final go-round as governor.\n\nBEN ADLER, BYLINE: You might expect a drop in entertainment value when a movie star leaves the governor's office. But Jerry Brown took California politics from Arnold Schwarzenegger's...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: I'll be back.\n\nADLER: To Latin.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJERRY BROWN: I've often used the phrase from Thomas Hobbes, bellum omnes contra omnes - or rather, bellum omni contra omnes.\n\nADLER: That was Brown quoting a 17th century English philosopher during a state budget update in May 2011, back when California faced a $27 billion deficit. He was urging Republicans to strike a deal that would let voters decide whether to extend expiring tax increases. Otherwise, he translated...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBROWN: ...War of all against all. It will be - everyone will return to their corner and devise strategies on what California does.\n\nADLER: There was no deal. So later that year, after signing a budget with automatic cuts if state revenues came in below projections, Brown again turned to Latin.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBROWN: There's a very simple - I wanted to invoke a Latin phrase here - nemo dat non habet. It means, no man gives what he does not have. The state cannot give what it does not have.\n\nADLER: Brown would also sprinkle in little quips when speaking off the cuff. For example, in September of 2011, as he was slogging through hundreds of bills on his desk...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBROWN: Not every human problem needs a law.\n\nADLER: ...A statement he sometimes echoed in his veto messages, which themselves were often quite entertaining. And last month, at the Sacramento Press Club, he put forth perhaps the most Jerry Brown quote ever.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBROWN: I'm not here to make news. I'm here to enlighten you.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nADLER: As for literary and historical references, you'd be hard-pressed to top the 20 that Brown weaved into his 2013 State of the State address. For example...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\n\nBROWN: Oliver Wendell Holmes.\n\nGenesis.\n\nThen the lean cows ate up the fat cows.\n\nQuiz-bits (ph).\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats.\n\nThe principle of subsidiarity.\n\nThe Little Engine That Could.\n\nADLER: And in his 2017 State of the State...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBROWN: Let me end in the immortal words of Woody Guthrie...\n\nADLER: Brown quoted Guthrie's progressive folk anthem, This Land Is Your Land, as he urged a state still reeling from President Trump's election to respond with courage and perseverance.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBROWN: Nobody living can ever make me turn back. This land was made for you and me.\n\nCalifornia's not turning back - not now, not ever. His truth is marching on.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nADLER: That last line, an ad-lib inserted in the moment, from another famed American anthem, The Battle Hymn Of The Republic.

'Punishment Without Crime' Highlights The Injustice Of America's Misdemeanor System\n\nFormer federal public defender Alexandra Natapoff says 13 million misdemeanors are filed each year in the U.S., trapping the innocent, punishing the poor and making society more unequal.\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're going to talk about a part of the criminal justice system that my guest describes as trapping the innocent and making America more unequal - the massive misdemeanor system. Depending on where you are, some misdemeanors are as minor as jaywalking. But the consequences of being charged with a misdemeanor, whether you are guilty or not, can be life-changing, especially if you are poor. My guest, Alexandra Natapoff, is the author of the new book, Punishment Without Crime. Critics of how the criminal justice system deals with misdemeanors have described it as assembly line justice or McJustice.\n\nNatapoff is a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine. From 2000 to 2003, she was an assistant federal public defender in Baltimore. She drew on those experiences for the book, but it's also based on extensive data she collected from every state around the country and on interviews with people who've gone through the misdemeanor process, as well as police, prosecutors, public defenders and judges.\n\nAlexandra Natapoff, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start with a precedent-setting case from 1997 in which a mother was driving with her 3 and 5-year-old children in the car, and she was arrested for a seatbelt violation. Describe what she was arrested for.\n\nALEXANDRA NATAPOFF: Gail Atwater and her kids were driving around their local park very slowly - about 15 miles an hour. Her child, Mac, had lost his toy and the kids were looking out the window of their truck to try to find the toy. And they didn't have their seatbelt on. Their mom had told them they could take their seatbelts off in order to see out the windows to look for the toy.\n\nAnd they were stopped by a police officer, Turek, who pulled them over and hollered at Gail Atwater that she would be arrested for the seatbelt violation for not having her children in the seatbelt restraints. Her children started to cry. Ms. Atwater asked if she could take her kids to the neighbor's house. Officer Turek said, no, they're going to come to jail with you. A neighbor happened to walk by and take care of the kids, but Gail Atwater went to jail.\n\nShe was booked, fingerprinted, spent a couple hours in the lockup and eventually pled guilty to and paid the fine for the seatbelt violation. The most she could have been punished for that violation was $50. It's a traffic misdemeanor. She could not have gone to jail for the seatbelt violation, but nevertheless spent time in jail as a result of the arrest.\n\nAnd she brought a lawsuit. She asked the Supreme Court to hold that it's unreasonable for police officers to effectuate what we call full-fledged custodial arrest - that is, lock someone up, book them, take them to jail for a crime like hers, for which she could not have gone to jail. It was a fine-only traffic offense. And the Supreme Court ruled against her.\n\nThe Supreme Court said no matter what the crime, no matter how minor the misdemeanor, no matter what the ultimate punishment is, even if you can't be incarcerated for it, the police have the power to effectuate a full-fledged custodial arrest - that is, take you to jail, book you, lock you up.\n\nAnd it really - it was such an important case because it opens a gateway into the kinds of arrests and intrusions and jail stays that characterize this low-level world of misdemeanors and minor offenses. And so in many ways, the size and the harshness of the misdemeanor system trace back to Gail Atwater.\n\nGROSS: So how long was she in jail?\n\nNATAPOFF: Gail Atwater spent a few hours that day in jail. She was booked. They took her personal possessions. She was fingerprinted. She spent the time in the lockup as anybody would if they were arrested for any offense in that jurisdiction.\n\nSo although I don't know who Gail Atwater spent her afternoon with in the lockup, it's possible that anyone in her situation could have spent the afternoon with people accused of very serious crimes, violent offenders, people with mental health or substance abuse issues. And she had an arrest record, so her information now is in the booking system. And it's an arrest record that will follow her for the rest of her life.\n\nGROSS: When you say she had a record, this is her record. She didn't have one before this.\n\nNATAPOFF: Correct.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. So let's talk more about what a misdemeanor is. Not having your children wear seatbelts - that's a misdemeanor. But there's a wide range of crimes that qualify as misdemeanors. Can you give us a sense of that range?\n\nNATAPOFF: So misdemeanors are minor offenses. Every jurisdiction defines them differently. Typically, they're defined as any criminal offense for which you can do no more than one year incarceration as punishment. But misdemeanors come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Sometimes we call them petty offenses. Sometimes we call them violations or ordinance violations. In Texas, Gail Atwater's offense - her seatbelt offense - even though she couldn't go to jail for it, was a criminal offense. It was a criminal misdemeanor.\n\nMany jurisdictions criminalize their traffic offenses. Even though we don't typically think of speeding as a crime, 25 states define speeding as a misdemeanor. Sometimes people go to jail for these offenses, more often they don't, at least not right away. And so it's a whole world of low-level petty offenses, criminalizing low-level conduct, imposing punishments that are relatively light compared to the kinds of felony sentences that we've become accustomed to.\n\nGROSS: So your book is, in part, about the inequality of the misdemeanor system and how it's racially unequal and there's a class system within the misdemeanor system. So I don't know what kind of income the woman who was arrested for the seatbelt violation had, but what are the differences in how that might've been handled between a person who had money and a person who didn't?\n\nNATAPOFF: One of the startling things about our enormous misdemeanor system is just how unequal it is. It often goes after low income and impoverished individuals. It sweeps in people of color, often disproportionately, for order maintenance and other low-level offenses. One of the particularly burdensome and inegalitarian aspects of low-level offenses is the effect of imposing fines and fees on misdemeanor defendants.\n\nSo Gail Atwater, for example, it appears that she didn't have any trouble paying the $50 fine for her seatbelt violation, but many people do. And for many people, they are set bail for low-level offenses - hundreds of dollars which they cannot pay - and therefore languish in jail while their cases are being resolved.\n\nJurisdictions also impose fees in addition to fines - user fees that fund the criminal system itself. And so there are all kinds of ways that an encounter with the misdemeanor system generates criminal debt. Individuals who come into the system incur all kinds of debt - fines and fees and bail and other kinds of monetary penalties. And for the low-income individuals who typically, you know, represent the average person who encounters the misdemeanor system, that debt can be crushing.\n\nIt can be unpayable, so much so that they end up spending time in jail that they otherwise wouldn't have spent. If they do pay those fines, it can cast them into deep debt, ruin their credit. They may end up on probation solely in order to pay off those fines because the fines are so crushing. So now they're under court supervision, not because they committed a particularly terrible offense or because they need supervision, but merely because they cannot pay.\n\nSo there is a profoundly regressive quality to the way that the misdemeanor system deploys fines and fees and bail and monetary sanctions. And because the system is heavily funded by those fines and fees and monetary sanctions, the misdemeanor system turns out to be a kind of regressive tax policy. It's stripping the poor and the - and working people in the system of their wealth and their resources in order to fund itself.\n\nGROSS: Let's talk about bail. I mean, what is the purpose of bail, and how do you think it's being misused now?\n\nNATAPOFF: The purpose of bail is supposed to be to ensure that people appear for court when they're charged with an offense. When people are charged with an offense, they're, of course, presumptively innocent. They haven't been convicted of anything. So bail has nothing to do with whether anyone is guilty or innocent. It's essentially a deposit that the court can require of an individual to make sure that they come back to court.\n\nBut what has happened in the misdemeanor system is that bail has morphed into a tool for raising money, for extracting fines and fees from individuals and has contributed to a sort of misdemeanor version of mass incarceration. Many jurisdictions have bail schedules, a set list of fees for various low-level offenses.\n\nSo if you're charged with trespassing, your bail is automatically $500. If you're charged with marijuana possession, your bail is automatically $1,000. These amounts have nothing to do with whether this particular individual is a flight risk, whether they're dangerous. Rather, they're just set schedules.\n\nAnd for many people, those bail fees are out of reach. And so they remain incarcerated because they can't pay. And so we've seen around the country - many jails are filled with individuals who are there not because they've done anything particularly wrong or pose any particular threat or even a risk of flight but simply because they can't afford to pay bail.\n\nGROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff, author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PAUL SIMON SONG, HOW CAN YOU LIVE IN THE NORTHEAST?)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff. She is the author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. She's also a professor at the University of California, Irvine and a former assistant federal public defender in Baltimore.\n\nYou mentioned that fees and fines are used to fund things. And by things, do you mean, like, to fund cities and counties and municipalities - that those funds go into funding the system? So in that sense, kind of like traffic tickets, they're an important part of fundraising for the budget.\n\nNATAPOFF: And misdemeanors are moneymakers for local jurisdictions. They fund courts. They fund probation offices. They fund public defender offices. They fund prosecutor offices. Some counties and municipalities use them to fund the general budget. It's one of the covert aspects of the misdemeanor system that, in many instances, it's running, not aimed at rounding up dangerous people or solving crimes or protecting public safety but cities and institutions and courts are reliant on the revenue stream that the misdemeanor system produces. It's a real distortion, you know, of what our criminal system is for.\n\nOur criminal system is an extraordinarily important public, democratic institution. We need it to go after dangerous people. We need it for deterrence and for public safety. And yet, the misdemeanor system has quietly converted much of the misdemeanor apparatus into a revenue source. Whatever we think of punishment - whatever we think the purposes of criminal punishment are, raising money is not supposed to be one of them.\n\nGROSS: I think, for some areas, the police are expected to - or may be required to - pull over a certain number of people per month. Like, there's a quota. And I'm wondering if you think that contributes to problems within the misdemeanor system.\n\nNATAPOFF: We've recently learned through lawsuits and through police officers speaking out that many police departments rely on quotas - sometimes formal, more often informal - pressures on police officers to produce a certain number of arrests or citations or summons in order to measure their productivity or in order to support their promotion or their advancement in the department. And we've heard from police officers just how distorting these formal or informal quotas can be. They put pressure on officers to make arrests that they might not otherwise make, to issue summons and citations that otherwise might not be justified.\n\nThere have been lawsuits in New York from police officers that, when they are assigned to low-income communities of color, under pressure from these quotas, they feel forced to contribute to the racial disproportion of the criminal system - that in essence, because they've been assigned to communities of color, that they have to issue citations, that they have to engage in arrests, even when some other police action or some other intervention might be more appropriate.\n\nAnd it is a distortion of the police function. Police discretion is an extraordinarily important resource in the criminal system. We rely on police discretion to advance public safety, to make sure people are treated fairly. And when we put pressure on police officers to produce citations and low-level arrests when they might not otherwise exercise their discretion that way, we're really interfering with a key aspect of the system's integrity.\n\nGROSS: In your book, you write that you were a federal public defender in Baltimore from 2000 to 2003. And one of the things you learned from the people you represented there was that there was a very messy calculation of punishment - trying to decide, like, whether to plead guilty or pay a fine or you know. Give us a sense of what that calculation of punishment is when you're facing a misdemeanor charge and you don't have much money.\n\nNATAPOFF: I learned an enormous amount from the people that I represented in Baltimore - listening to their stories, meeting them and their families and hearing how they grappled with the challenges of facing a low-level misdemeanor charge. And I learned that often the calculus of punishment doesn't necessarily shake out the way you would think.\n\nThere might be an assumption, for example, that people would avoid jail at any cost. And yet, for many of my clients, being on probation for a year or two or three years with the burdens and intrusions of probation - having to make appointments and meet with their probation officers monthly, having to be drug tested routinely, giving up their privacy, having the restrictions on their freedom - for many of them, they decided that, for them, going to jail made more sense. Even though they knew that jail was risky, that it was dangerous, that it was painful, the intrusion into their lives and the burdens on their lives of supervision and probation often seemed, in the long run, to be even more disruptive.\n\nMany of my clients lived in dangerous neighborhoods. They were surrounded by dangerous situations. They often felt caught between a rock and a hard place. So I represented individuals, for example, who were charged with misdemeanor gun possession who knew that if they were caught they would be punished. And yet, they felt the pressure from their neighbors - from the people in their neighborhoods that if they did not carry a gun or at the very least were not perceived to be carrying a weapon, that they would be in danger, that they would be seen as a target. It was a heartbreaking calculus that they had to go through.\n\nGROSS: So in terms of lack of resources, among the things you're mentioning is the resource of time, that public defenders don't have enough time to represent all the clients that they're supposed to be representing, and judges don't have time to hear all the cases they're supposed to be hearing. So what are the consequences of that?\n\nNATAPOFF: The lack of resources in the misdemeanor system is one of the great challenges to the integrity of that process. And the reason that there's a lack of time is because the case loads are so enormous. There are so many people coming in to the misdemeanor system. Thirteen million misdemeanor cases are filed every year in this country. That's 80 percent of American criminal dockets.\n\nAnd so for public defenders - and it's worth noting that every official - every legal official in the misdemeanor system is faced with this crushing case load. Public defenders, prosecutors and judges are all under pressure to move cases along. For public defenders in particular, having hundreds, sometimes thousands of cases that they have to resolve means that they don't have time to talk to their clients.\n\nThey may meet them literally in the lockup in the courtroom 10 minutes before a hearing with no time to discuss the case, the facts, the file. This is sometimes referred to derogatorily as meet-them-and-plead-them lawyering, that essentially your public defender meets you. They tell you what the government's deal is, and they engage in the process of you pleading guilty immediately.\n\nThe lack of resources also means that public defenders lack the ability to investigate cases. So there are very few, if any, investigators and public defender offices available for misdemeanors, so if an individual is innocent or if there are witnesses or if there are facts about the encounter with the police or the crime that could be uncovered, that public defender office may simply be unable to unearth that information.\n\nThe lack of resources means also that in many ways, the law itself is put aside. Misdemeanor cases can be legally very complicated. They may involve unconstitutional searches and seizures. They may involve unconstitutional statutes. They may involve complicated factual issues. But without the time and resources to engage those questions, there's very little litigation. Motions are not filed. Issues are not aired both because public defenders lack the resources but also because there's enormous pressure on them from prosecutors and judges not to litigate.\n\nWe've seen around the country examples of judges who actually punish public defenders when they try to litigate issues on behalf of their clients when they want to go to trial, when they want to file a motion. Judges have been known to hold public defenders in contempt or threaten to hold them in contempt because they're holding up the docket.\n\nAnd so it's not the way that we think a judicial system is supposed to work. There's little room for law. There's little room for investigation. There's little room to have the adversarial conversation that we rely on to produce valid cases and valid convictions.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Alexandra Natapoff, author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. We'll talk more after a break, and Lloyd Schwartz will review a new recording of Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale made by Roger Waters, co-founder of the rock band Pink Floyd. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ANTONIO SANCHEZ AND BRAD MEHLDAU AND MATT BREWER'S NAR-THIS)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Alexandra Natapoff, author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. She's a professor of law at the University of California Irvine and, before that, was an assistant federal public defender in Baltimore. When we left off, she was describing how people accused of misdemeanors who don't have extra cash on hand face a backlogged justice system with public defenders who don't have adequate time or resources to properly defend their clients, so the clients are often encouraged to take a plea whether or not they're guilty.\n\nYou mentioned that part of the misdemeanor system is often referred to as meet them and plead them, so, you know, lawyers encourage - often encourage their clients to just like plead guilty and get it done with. So if you decide to take the conviction and you take the plea, what are the consequences of that? Now you have a record.\n\nNATAPOFF: So one of the great fallacies of the misdemeanor universe is that getting a misdemeanor is no big deal, that it's just a misdemeanor, that it won't dog you for your life. And that has come to be, you know, profoundly untrue. A misdemeanor conviction, although of course not as serious as a felony conviction, still imposes enormous burdens on the people who carry them.\n\nFirst and foremost, a conviction is accompanied by punishment. It can be crushing fines and fees. They may be on supervision, on probation for long periods of time. They may be incarcerated. If they're not incarcerated upfront, they may be incarcerated if they violate their probation or fail to pay their fines and fees. And then that conviction will - is a permanent conviction that follows them for the rest of their lives.\n\nWe know that it interferes with employment. It can mean that they lose welfare benefits, become ineligible for financial aid for education. They can lose their housing. It can threaten their immigration status. It can disqualify them for all kinds of jobs and licenses.\n\nSo the consequences of a misdemeanor conviction are far from petty, even though the conversation around misdemeanors, you know, really doesn't appreciate the impact that they impose.\n\nGROSS: So we've talked a little bit about how the misdemeanor system penalizes the poor more than people who have money because the poor can't afford to pay bail or fines or fees. What are the fees that you're referring to?\n\nNATAPOFF: So fees are different than fines. A fine is a punishment. It's punishment for whatever offense you are guilty of. It's typically set by statute. The judge decides how severe your fine will be as punishment for your crime. But fees are not punishment. They are user charges, in effect, that the criminal system imposes on people who go through it for all kinds of functions. They're essentially money-raising mechanisms that, for decades now, have been growing and growing as municipalities, counties and states rely more and more heavily on the revenue stream from the misdemeanor system.\n\nSo their fees can include jail fees, supervision fees, fees for applying for the public defender, fees for using the public defender, fees for drug testing, fees when they swab your cheek to put your DNA in the database. They'll charge you a fee if you don't show up to court, and they issue a warrant, they'll issue a fee. If you're late paying your fees, they'll charge you a fee.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the list of fees, ranging from a few dollars here to $10, $20, $30 or a hundred dollars there, can add up to hundreds, even thousands of dollars on top of whatever punitive fine the court decides to impose.\n\nGROSS: So wait a minute. You're charged a fee for paying - paying for your own incarceration in jail. And you're charged a fee to have a public defender and - when the whole idea of having a public defender is that it's a free lawyer to represent you.\n\nNATAPOFF: I think it's hard for people to really fathom just how unfairly the misdemeanor system strips poor people of their wealth, or more accurately, wealth that they don't have. One of the most infamous is fees charged for the application for the public defender. Of course, by definition, you're only eligible for a public defender if you can't afford a lawyer. And yet, nevertheless, many jurisdictions charge a fee - say, a $50 fee - to apply just to get a public defender assigned. And many people forgo a public defender because the fee is prohibitive.\n\nThe Supreme Court has upheld the use of what they sometimes called recoupment fees. So if you use a public defender, the state can come after you and ask for money to pay for that even though, again, by definition, you would only be eligible for a public defender because you can't afford a lawyer in the first place.\n\nJail fees are particularly egregious and ironic for individuals who are being incarcerated precisely because they couldn't pay their fines and fees. Once they go to jail, in many jurisdictions, the jail will then charge them a fee for having been in the jail. There are fees for the use of health care in jails, so many people forgo health care. They forgo their medication because they can't afford the fee in the jail to get access to their medication. It's really this enormous underground wealth-stripping, regressive mechanism that is only just starting to come to light.\n\nGROSS: So I just want to make sure - I know a lot of our listeners are probably thinking, is this person arguing that misdemeanors should not be punished or that there shouldn't be misdemeanors or that everybody should just be left alone - no jail, no fees or fines or bail? So what are you arguing for? I mean, you want reform, but you're not arguing to do away with the misdemeanor system.\n\nNATAPOFF: No, I'm not arguing to do away with the misdemeanor system. We need to be able to respond to low-level crimes, to low-level harms. It's not OK to take other people's stuff. It's not OK to engage in low-level violence. It's not OK to drive drunk. And so in many ways mirroring the mass incarceration debate, we need to dial it back.\n\nWe need to dial back this enormous, bloated misdemeanor system. We need to dial back arrests. We need to dial back incarceration. We need to dial back the penalties and the use of debtors' prison so that the misdemeanor system can do its job, so that it can go after crime and low-level offenses in a meaningful way and impose punishments that are not so wildly disproportionate to the crime.\n\nGROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff. She's the author of the new book, Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. We're going to take a short break and then we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff. She's the author of the new book, Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. She's also a professor at the University of California, Irvine and a former assistant federal public defender in Baltimore.\n\nWhat are a couple of the reforms you would like to see in the misdemeanor system?\n\nNATAPOFF: So many of the problems of the misdemeanor system flow from its sheer enormity. And there are things that we can do about that. Police could arrest fewer people. We could put less pressure on police officers to arrest and to issue summons when it's unnecessary. Prosecutors can decline more cases. When police officers arrest, prosecutors then have to decide whether that arrest is going to convert into a criminal case or whether it's going to be declined and remain merely an arrest.\n\nAnd prosecutors could shrink the pipeline by declining more low-level cases in which an arrest is enough. It was enough of an intervention and enough of a punishment - decriminalization, reduced use of jail, the reduced use of bail, as we're starting to see in jurisdictions across the country. There are any number of points along the misdemeanor pipeline which we could meaningfully and sensibly shrink it so that it can - so that the cases that are left can get our full attention.\n\nGROSS: Are you convinced that that would not encourage people to break laws because there wouldn't be consequences or at least there wouldn't be consequences as great as there are today.\n\nNATAPOFF: So many of the reasons that people are incarcerated in the misdemeanor system have nothing to do with their wrongdoing. When individuals are locked up because they can't pay a fine or a fee, it's not because they're scofflaws. It's because they're poor. When individuals are arrested for loitering or trespassing because the police are under pressure to clear a corner or make a quota, it's not because they're scofflaws. It's not because they're dangerous.\n\nThey're caught up in a system that's using misdemeanor arrest and using misdemeanor processing in unfair and dysfunctional ways. And I think there is a lot of room in our misdemeanor system to scale back those practices so that we can concentrate on misdemeanors that cause real harm - the drunk driving and the assaults and the domestic violence that require our attention and make our misdemeanor system more truly effective and a better deterrent.\n\nGROSS: I want to switch topics to an earlier book that you wrote, a 2009 book called Snitching: Criminal Informants And The Erosion Of American Justice. And this book was about the government's use of criminal suspects and criminal defendants to get information in exchange for deals to get, you know, somebody to talk or to, you know, name another person who is guilty of something in return for leniency for the informant's crimes. What do you think is the problem with that kind of approach?\n\nNATAPOFF: The problem with snitching, with the use of criminal informants, is that it is the most extreme version of a basic truth about the American criminal system, which is that ours is a system of negotiation. It's essentially a market. Ninety-five percent of all the convictions in this country, felony and misdemeanor, are the result of a plea. They're not a result of a trial. We almost never litigate guilt anymore.\n\nAnd so within this market, we've created a kind of a black market, if you will, of cooperation, of deals between the government and individuals who are suspect or who have committed a crime in which guilt and information and cooperation are traded, often off the record, informally, without constraint.\n\nAnd so this kind of black market of trading guilt and information has really undermined a lot of the integrity of the criminal system. Criminals are getting away with very serious offenses. Often, individual - vulnerable individuals are pressured into becoming informants at great risk to their lives. The government can launder a lot of its mistakes through cooperation and through the plea-bargaining process. So it's an opaque, under-regulated aspect of a market that is all - that hasn't gotten enough attention.\n\nGROSS: I know you're also concerned that somebody who is bargaining for leniency in return for information isn't necessarily telling the truth.\n\nNATAPOFF: So there's some big, famous problems with the use of criminal informants. One is wrongful conviction. Informants often lie in order to get a deal. Informants also often continue to commit their own crimes. They get a kind of impunity from cooperating with the government. A lot of it is very secretive, so it's a kind of off-the-record aspect - big off-the-record aspect of the criminal justice system.\n\nAnd all these things work in tandem to create troubling cases and troubling outcomes. It's not that the government should never be able to cut a deal. It's that for such an important public policy, we should know more about it. The government should be more accountable. These cases should be better scrutinized.\n\nGROSS: So in light of what you just told us about what you describe as snitching, what do you think of the use of giving information in return for a more lenient sentence as is being done by the Mueller investigation and the Southern District of New York in investigating the Trump administration?\n\nNATAPOFF: So in some ways, those deals and deals like them - by which I mean deals cut by wealthy, powerful, well-represented individuals in a highly scrutinized, transparent environment - are the best version of snitching. White-collar crimes, political crimes like these, where the government has very few options to get information about conspiracies or wrongdoing by powerful, insulated individuals, it's - in my view, it's probably the best version of the informant deal.\n\nThe kinds of informant deals I think we should be worried about are the ones that are not scrutinized, where people - where defendants, for example, are not represented by counsel, where it takes place off the record where no one ever learns about it, where the informant gets to go on and commit additional crimes because the government finds them so useful. But at the top of the pyramid, if you will, in the highly scrutinized, highly resourced environment of these political crimes and the Mueller investigation, that's about as good as we get in terms of the integrity of these kinds of deals.\n\nGROSS: As good as we get, but do you think it's justified?\n\nNATAPOFF: I think time always will tell whether a particular criminal deal is justified or not. And that's a matter for democratic debate. We will know, eventually, what the government learned as a result of these deals. And then the American public can decide whether it made sense to let people who committed serious crimes against our democracy off or gave them more lenient sentences.\n\nI'm not against the use of criminal informant deals in a system where we have already made the decision to negotiate. We live in a world of plea bargaining. And sometimes, it's worth cutting a deal with a terrible person in order to advance public safety and advance justice.\n\nGROSS: Alexandra Natapoff, thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nNATAPOFF: Thanks so much for having me.\n\nGROSS: Alexandra Natapoff is the author of the new book Punishment Without Crime.

Wolf's support for petrochemicals raises climate worries as Pennsylvania tries to cut carbon emissions\n\nPlastics build-out could conflict with governor's climate goals\n\nReid Frazier Bio Recent Stories Reid R. Frazier is an energy reporter for The Allegheny Front, a Pittsburgh-based public media outlet covering the environment in Pennsylvania. His work has aired on NPR and Marketplace.\n\nReid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania\n\nSince his second term began last year, there's been a theme for Tom Wolf's tenure as Pennsylvania's governor: climate change.\n\nAfter Pennsylvania experienced the wettest year on record in 2018, Wolf said the state would be setting its first-ever carbon reduction targets — 26 percent by 2025, and 80 percent by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.\n\nHe said floods in 2018 were evidence that climate change had already come to Pennsylvania. Scientists say global warming will make the state's weather wetter, since warm air holds more moisture.\n\nIt's affected our farmers, and the crops that they grow, he said. It's devastated our homes. It's affecting us each and every day.\n\nWolf followed that up with plans to join regional initiatives to reduce carbon from the transportation and electricity sectors.\n\nThe steps pleased many in the environmental community, including Joe Minott of the Clean Air Council.\n\nHe understands climate change, believes that it is already having an impact on Pennsylvania and is proposing to address it, Minott said.\n\nWhile Minott says Wolf deserves praise, there is a but. The governor also supports fossil-fuel and petrochemical industries that contribute to the emissions he wants to eliminate.\n\nWolf has extolled the jobs that Shell's Beaver County Ethane Cracker will create for Western Pennsylvania. The cracker, a massive plant that will turn natural gas into plastic pellets, would be part of (an) energy efficient future, Wolf recently told a radio interviewer.\n\nI think if we get this right, these are going to be jobs that stay here, he told a group of local officials in Beaver County in 2016.\n\nThe plant, which received a $1.65 billion tax credit from Pennsylvania, is under construction, employing around 6,000 people. When it's built in the next few years, it's expected to employ 600.\n\nAlong with jobs, Minott says the ethane cracker will be bringing something else to the region — a large carbon footprint.\n\nFor starters, the plant will further entrench the fossil fuel industry in the state's economy.\n\nThough it's helped the state lower its electricity sector emissions by 33 percent since 2005 by displacing coal, natural gas has its own carbon footprint. It produces carbon dioxide when burned, and gas wells and pipelines leak the potent greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere.\n\nOn top of that, Minott says, are the cracker's own emissions.\n\nThe Beaver County plant is permitted to emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide a year — the equivalent CO2 of 400,000 more cars on the road, according to the EPA's carbon footprint calculator.\n\nThe petrochemical plant is itself a humongous emitter of greenhouse gases, Minott said.\n\nMuch of that CO2 will come from burning natural gas to process ethane, a natural gas byproduct, into plastic.\n\nPut another way — that would be the equivalent of nearly 4 percent of the state's carbon dioxide budget of 58 million tons of CO2 in the state's 2050 climate target.\n\nIt's hard to understand how (Wolf) thinks he's going to be able to achieve the reductions that are needed to meet his 2050 goal, while at the same time (promoting) the petrochemical and the gas industry in Pennsylvania, Minott said.\n\nAnd the Beaver County plant could be just the first of several in the region. ExxonMobil is considering building a petrochemical plant in Western Pennsylvania, according to one report.\n\nLeah Stokes, a scientist at the University of California Santa Barbara who studies climate and politics, says promoting any new fossil fuels at this point — even natural gas — could tip the world over the edge of climate catastrophe by midcentury. Stokes said that even 80 percent carbon reductions would be insufficient to the scale of the climate crisis.\n\nWhat the modeling shows is that if we want to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which many consider a sort of safe warming level…we cannot build any new fossil fuel infrastructure.\n\nCosta Samaras, an engineer who studies climate change adaptation and resilience at Carnegie Mellon, said meeting the state's climate targets will be made harder by large additions of CO2, like petrochemical plants.\n\nThe math is unforgiving, Samaras said. Infrastructure lasts for a long time and a…plant can run for 30, 40, 50, even longer — 60 years. If we think about a budget that Pennsylvania can use, each new fossil (fuel) infrastructure asset is going to use up some of that budget.\n\nBut Wolf has maintained that natural gas, while not perfect, can be done better. He's proposed a severance tax on gas, and rules to limit methane leaks at wells and tightening other drilling regulations.\n\nThe governor's spokesman J.J. Abbott says Wolf is hemmed in by a Republican legislature that wants fewer rules on oil and gas, not more.\n\nThe governor has been a backstop against some of the proposals (by the legislature) that would reduce our ability to hold the industry accountable to high environmental standards, said Abbott, mentioning the Governor's opposition to SB 790, which would reduce some regulations on the conventional drilling industry, and Energize PA, the GOP's plan to incentive petrochemical development in the state.\n\nReid Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania\n\nWolf's stance on the industry has placated the state's big trade unions, a major source of support in his own Democratic party.\n\nJeff Nobers, executive director of the Builders' Guild of Western Pennsylvania, said Wolf's pragmatic approach is better for unions in Pennsylvania than that taken by Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The two U.S. senators each has called for a ban on fracking.\n\nI think the governor's trying to take a very middle of the road approach to this — ensuring certain (environmental protections) on one side while still being able to take advantage, and grow an industry, and create jobs.\n\nIt's also earned him praise from the natural gas industry, which has successfully resisted Wolf's main request of it — a severance tax on gas production. The industry says it already contributes to the state coffers through an impact fee— which in 2018 brought in $251 million.\n\nLike nearly every pragmatic elected official across the political spectrum, Governor Wolf recognizes the compelling environmental and economic benefits of clean-burning American natural gas, said Marcellus Shale Coalition president David Spigelmyer, in a statement. Natural gas remains a strong source of job creation, especially for our building trades and construction laborers, while boosting manufacturing, consumer savings and air quality.\n\nPolitical observers say Wolf's middle of the road strategy plays well in Pennsylvania, the country's No. 2 gas-producing state.\n\nI think as a Democratic governor in a state like Pennsylvania that Tom Wolf has in many ways found a sweet spot, said Chris Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg College. Borick points to Wolf's two blowout wins in the state as evidence: he won 55 percent of the vote in 2014, and 58 percent four years later.\n\nHe has found a spot that I think aligns very well with Pennsylvania public opinion, Borick said. He's never called for a moratorium on natural gas, but he's been strong in his proposals and demands for an extraction (or severance) tax.\n\nBorick thinks in a purple state like Pennsylvania, Wolf's balancing act might provide a blueprint for other Democrats to win elections.\n\nHe says that while public opinion on climate change is changing — 68 percent of Pennsylvanians believe climate change is a problem that should be addressed, according to a recent poll — it still isn't seen as critical as other issues, like the economy.\n\nPeople are concerned about it. They think about it. They're seeing it more in their lives, Borick said. But are they at the point where they're willing to go much more in? I don't know if we've reached that point. I think we're headed to that point, but I don't think we're there yet.\n\nCorrection: The caption on the photo of Gov. Tom Wolf in the original version of this story indicated the wrong time period for his visit to Beaver County.\n\nEditor's Picks
In California, Squid Is Big Business. But Good Luck Eating Local Calamari\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images\n\nCalamari is a favorite on American dinner tables. But while the U.S. has a thriving squid industry, chances are the calamari you are eating made a 12,000-mile round trip before ending up on your dinner plate. That, or it wasn't caught in the U.S. at all.\n\nMore than 80 percent of U.S. squid landings are exported — most of it to China. The rare percentage of that catch that stays domestically goes to Asian fresh fish markets or is used as bait.\n\nIronically, the lion's share of the squid consumed in the United States is imported.\n\nSquid is a labor-intensive product, says Emily Tripp, founder of Marine Science Today, a website on the latest ocean-based research. It's cheaper in some situations to ship it to China to be processed and ship it back.\n\nTripp, who recently graduated with a masters from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, did her thesis project on California market squid, which, during non-El Niño years, is California's most valuable fishery.\n\nIn California, squid is an economic driver of the seafood industry – it's the fifth-largest fishery in the United States by weight. Yet most of this squid is frozen and exported overseas to China to be processed and distributed to over 42 countries across the globe. It's an export market that, according to 2011 figures, is valued at $107 million. Only 1.4 percent of it, on average, makes it back to the U.S. In 2015, that figure was 0.46 percent.\n\nIt has to do with the American desire for a larger squid, explains Diane Pleschner-Steele, executive director of the California Wetfish Producers Association. A lot of squid that is shipped overseas stays overseas because they prefer it. They eat it over there. Our consumers typically prefer a larger squid, and so there's just a ton of squid imported into this country that comes in at a far lower price.\n\nIn the U.S., the squid that ends up on our dinner table is typically Patagonian squid from the Falkland Islands or Humboldt squid — a jumbo cephalopod fished predominantly in Mexico and Peru.\n\nCalifornia market squid isn't usually desired because of its smaller size.\n\nOur squid is a learning curve, Pleschner-Steele says. If you overcook it, it can taste like a rubber band. But in my opinion, if you do it right, it tastes more like abalone than any other squid. It's nutty, sweet and delicate.\n\nThe cost of labor is another, perhaps more significant, factor. Squid cleaning and processing is an extremely time-consuming practice. The eyes, cartilage, skin and guts need to be removed ahead of time, and it's cheaper to have this done overseas than domestically.\n\nA round-trip freight cost to China is $0.10 per pound and labor is just $7 a day there. By contrast, California wages — with tax and health insurance — amount to $12 an hour, according to Pleschner-Steele.\n\nAlso, supply chains and markets are incredibly opaque. Pleschner-Steele suspects that as the Chinese middle-class economy has blossomed, a lot of the squid processing facilities are now based in Thailand.\n\nTripp says during her research, it was nearly impossible to track down where exactly the squid was being processed abroad.\n\nThe biggest challenge was trying to find out where the squid goes when it leaves to the United States, she says. No one wants to say where they partner. It's a bit of a challenge. In the United States we keep such good records of all of our fish and seafood. There's no comparable system in China. I couldn't follow the chain backwards.\n\nRegardless, the narrative is the same: Californians aren't eating Californian squid. And if they are, it likely wasn't processed in California.\n\nAt Mitch's Seafood, a restaurant in San Diego committed to local fish, the owners spent three years looking for a California-based squid processor for their calamari. They eventually found a company in San Pedro called Tri-Marine.\n\nWe have to pay twice as much for it, but it's worth it so that we can say we offer California-caught and processed squid, owner Mitch Conniff says. Squid that's caught two to three miles away takes a 10,000-mile round-trip journey before I can get it back into my restaurant.\n\nAll Californian fish processors are capable of dealing with squid, Pleschner-Steele says. However, it's not a money-making operation because people aren't willing to pay for it.\n\nIt has to be on request, she says. We simply can't compete with the cost of other imported squid. \n\nSupporting the local squid industry is much more than just helping the local economy – it's helpful from a sustainability angle as well.\n\nEven with squid being sent on a round-trip journey across the world, the California market squid fishery has one of the lowest carbon footprints in the industry.\n\nCalifornia squid fishing fleets are one of the most energy efficient in the world because [they're] so close to port, Pleschner-Steele says. Our boats can produce a ton of proteins for about six gallons of diesel fuel. ... Efficiency is key.\n\nFurther efficiency, she says, could be achieved if consumers would be keen to fork over $1.50 a pound more for California-caught and processed squid.\n\nBut the truth is that Americans aren't willing to pay for it, she says. If people were willing to pay the price, we can definitely feed the demand.\n\nClarissa Wei is a freelance journalist based in Los Angeles and Taipei. She writes about sustainability and food.
White House Looks Outside Washington For Republicans Who Back COVID-19 Aid Plan\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nUpdated at 11:10 a.m ET\n\nAs Democrats in Congress take the initial steps to pass President Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package using a process that won't require any Republican votes, the White House is working to rack up endorsements from state and local elected officials and business groups — a strategy that it argues is making the bill bipartisan.\n\nCongressional Republicans say the package is too large and payments should be targeted to people who really need it. In a letter to Biden on Thursday, 10 GOP senators who had met with him noted some of the money appropriated in previous relief packages hasn't yet been spent. It highlights a gulf that will make it difficult to pass a bill that is bipartisan by any traditional definition.\n\nBiden has vowed to try to unite the country, and has said addressing the economic and health crises caused by the coronavirus is his top priority is a big part of that. But constrained by the pandemic, Biden hasn't yet been able to make the case for his plan by taking it on the road to rallies or even kitchen table photo ops, in the way that presidents typically have made large legislative pushes.\n\nInstead, in Zoom meetings and conference calls, the Biden White House is making its pitch to governors and mayors, county executives and state treasurers and secretaries of state, agriculture associations and labor unions, progressive groups and faith leaders.\n\nSome of that has paid off. The U.S. Conference of Mayors urged quick action on the president's plan in a letter to Congress that had so many signatories it ran 11 pages long. State and local governments stand to benefit from the Biden plan, which calls for an infusion of $350 billion to offset pandemic-related losses and expenses.\n\nLocal elected officials see up close how the pandemic has ravaged their communities, said Cedric Richmond, a former Democratic congressman who is now one of Biden's top aides at the White House, in charge of the Office of Public Engagement.\n\nThey understand the hurt, Richmond told NPR.\n\nThat's not going to stop us from trying to get Republican members of Congress, the House and the Senate. But we believe this plan is bipartisan already because it has such support from other Republican elected officials.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll this week found 37% of Republicans support Biden's $1.9 trillion package. But it has strong support from independents and overwhelming support from Democrats, meaning nearly 7 in 10 Americans support the proposal. Individual elements of the plan, particularly the $1,400 direct payments, enjoy strong support.\n\nBiden's push to go big and go fast even yielded an endorsement from the Republican governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice. A vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, Justice told CNN this week that people in his state are really, really hurting and action is needed fast.\n\nAdministration officials are also hitting the airwaves, with a White House official putting the tally at more than 100 national television, radio and podcast interviews since Jan. 21. This week alone, they've done some 30 local TV interviews in Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana and Colorado. This is a reprisal of Biden's campaign strategy: he traveled less due to the coronavirus, but he did a lot of local TV interviews to bring his message into voters' homes.\n\nVice President Harris has been doing some of those interviews. And on Friday, she and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plan to hold a Zoom roundtable with members of Black Chambers of Commerce from across the country about the crisis and the aid needed by small businesses.\n\nOne area of stark disagreement between congressional Republicans and President Biden is relief for state and local governments. Republicans continue to argue it would reward states and cities that mismanaged their budgets. The White House has framed this part of the package as being about help for first responders. Richmond says cities that rely on the hospitality industry have been especially hard-hit, losing significant tax revenue.\n\nWe have firefighters that were being furloughed, said Richmond. We have frontline workers that we truly care about and want to support that are struggling and without giving aid to state and local governments, those frontline workers in those states won't receive help.
Senate Republicans Unveil New Coronavirus Relief Package\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nUpdated at 8:10 p.m. ET\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., introduced legislation on Thursday to address the economic impact of the coronavirus. This is the third legislative package to deal with the outbreak.\n\nThe proposal was drafted by Senate Republicans and the Trump administration. The bill still needs to be negotiated with Senate Democrats, which McConnell said would happen Friday. Already some Democrats were criticizing the plan as too focused on help for corporations and were calling for major changes.\n\nThe 247-page bill, dubbed the CARES Act — the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — provides direct cash payments, loan guarantees for impacted businesses and more resources for testing and development of vaccines.\n\nHere are some key provisions:\n\nCash payments\n\nThe bill includes cash payments of as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per married couple. Individuals with an adjusted gross income of less than $75,000, and $150,000 for joint filers, would receive the full payment. People earning over that amount would see their payments reduced by $5 for each $100 in income over that amount. The benefit completely phases out for individuals earning over $99,000 and married couples making more than $198,000.\n\nPeople with incomes under $2,500 would be eligible for $600, or $1,200 for a married couple.\n\nSmall-business loans\n\nBusinesses with fewer than 500 employees could apply for fee-free loans of up to $10 million that could help cover payroll, employee salaries, mortgages, rent and some other debt obligations. Businesses that retain their employees and payroll levels between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, would have any of that money used for payments on preexisting debt and payroll forgiven.\n\nIndustry-specific loan guarantees\n\nThe bill includes $208 billion in loan guarantees for industries that are hurting because of the coronavirus. This includes up to $50 billion for airlines, $8 billion for cargo carriers and $150 billion for other unnamed businesses.\n\nHealth care\n\nThe bill would require the Food and Drug Administration to prioritize and expedite the review of new drugs. It also includes requirements that insurers pay for COVID-19 testing without a fee for patients; free coverage, without cost sharing, of certain vaccines as they become available; and $1.32 billion in additional funding for community health centers.\n\nTax deadline\n\nThe legislation would move the tax-filing deadline from April 15 to July 15 for most filers.\n\nStudent loans\n\nThe bill allows for people to defer payments on federal student loans and allows students whose universities have canceled classes to keep Pell Grants.\n\nThe bill: We want to get something done quickly and boldly\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer complained that Democrats weren't involved in the drafting of the bill but said he wanted to work with Republicans to get something done quickly. In a statement on Thursday evening, Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that to earn their support, any economic stimulus proposal must include new, strong and strict provisions that prioritize and protect workers, such as banning the recipient companies from buying back stock, rewarding executives, and laying off workers.\n\nOther Democrats have begun highlighting areas that they say fall short. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he is disappointed that the bill doesn't have sufficient funding for first responders and other front-line medical professionals, among other complaints.\n\nIt inadequately funds federal, state, and local efforts on the ground to blunt the spread of this disease and prevent our health care system from being overwhelmed, Leahy said in a statement. It fails to invest in programs the American people will rely on during this crisis, which have already begun to reach a breaking point.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., criticized the airline-specific loans as a blank check bailout that lacks protections for workers and consumers.\n\nThis proposal totally fails to prevent the corporate excesses and abuses that followed past taxpayer bailouts, Blumenthal said in a statement. Instead of corporate welfare, there should be grants and loan forgiveness for small businesses, which are the job creating backbone of our economy.\n\nDemocrats will have an opportunity to make changes to the bill in the coming days. Several lawmakers have said they hope to pass a final bill by the end of next week.\n\nThe bill proposal comes a day after two members of Congress tested positive for COVID-19 and President Trump signed a second relief bill that provides paid sick leave, expanded unemployment assistance and resources for testing.\n\nMcConnell had been in close contact with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in recent days as they rushed to draft a bill that reflects a GOP-wide consensus. McConnell now says talks with Schumer will start on Friday.\n\nAs soon as Congress passes this, we'd get this out within three weeks, Mnuchin said. Six weeks later, if the president still has a national emergency, we will deliver another $3,000 [for a family of four].\n\nMnuchin said the plan also includes $300 billion for small-business loans. The loans are intended to be used for hiring and maintaining payroll and could be forgiven down the line.\n\nMcConnell spoke about the bill on the Senate floor on Thursday before the draft was released. He said the legislation would include billions of dollars in forgivable federal loans for small businesses.\n\nOwners will not be able to use the funds to give themselves raises or increase their own profits, McConnell said. The point is to help small businesses endure, help workers keep their jobs and help workers and businesses emerge from this ready to thrive.\n\nIndustry-specific aid, including money for airlines, would be in the form of targeted lending, which McConnell described as government loans.\n\nJust like small businesses, entire sectors are being crushed by public health guidance, which is obviously no fault of their own, McConnell said. We are talking about loans that must be repaid.\n\nHe added that Congress will have future opportunities to address the long-term impact of the coronavirus crisis when it writes regular annual spending bills later in the year.\n\nThe legislation I have just laid out will not be the last word, McConnell said. This is not Congress' last chance to legislate, but it is critical that we move swiftly and boldly to begin to stabilize our economy.\n\nSchumer acknowledged in an interview on NPR's Morning Edition that there is public pressure for lawmakers to set aside differences and pass a bill quickly.\n\nWe don't want to be partisan — we just want to solve the problem, Schumer said. We want to get something done quickly and boldly. That's a big job, but we have to do it because the crisis is even bigger.\n\nBut Schumer says Democrats have a number of additional requests, including a vast expansion of unemployment insurance benefits.\n\nDemocrats want to provide a major increase in the amount of money provided through the federal unemployment assistance program — perhaps as high as an equal match to the salary lost. Schumer is also calling for that program to be extended for many months, along with expansions to paid sick and family leave. The president signed a package Wednesday night that included a first round of paid sick and family leave as well as help for jobless Americans, but lawmakers in both parties acknowledged that a broader effort is needed as the economic impact continues to worsen.\n\nHill Democrats also want limitations on any corporate bailouts or aid.\n\nIf they're going to do these corporate bailouts, we want to make sure they're for the average worker, Schumer said. We want to make sure they keep all of their workers without salary cuts. We want to make sure they don't use this money for stock buybacks.\n\nThe rapid developments come as lawmakers are growing increasingly concerned about the spread of the virus within the Capitol.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., informed members on Thursday that the House will not return to session until it is time to vote on a third coronavirus response bill.\n\nIn light of the guidance issued by the CDC, we will be adjusting the House schedule. It is my intention that the House will not return to session until we are in a position to vote on the third piece of emergency legislation to respond to the economic impact of this crisis, Hoyer said in a letter to House Democrats.\n\nRoughly nine lawmakers are under self-quarantine, and at least two have tested positive for COVID-19. While there is rising pressure among some rank-and-file members to allow remote voting, leaders have rejected those proposals.\n\nDozens of House lawmakers were already asking the chamber's leaders to allow remote voting before any members had tested positive. The effort was spearheaded by California Democratic Reps. Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.\n\nCongress also should be no exception to the public health safeguards, they wrote in a March 18 letter to Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. We are undermining our unified, bipartisan message to the American people when we come together on a crowded House floor to vote.\n\nDuring a House chamber vote, more than 430 members and 100 staffers can be clustered on the floor, they said.\n\nIn all, 52 members signed the letter. Both Swalwell and Porter previously urged remote voting ahead of the health crisis, saying it should be an option to members regardless. However, the issue has taken on a new urgency with the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHoyer acknowledged concerns about exposure in his letter to lawmakers and said he expected to adjust voting procedures. No decisions have been made on exactly what these changes will be, but we will be discussing all options, he wrote.\n\nAsked about members of Congress who had tested positive for the virus, President Trump said, I know all of them and said he hoped they all would recover. It's one of those things, he said, noting that most people recover.\n\nCongress would have to pass resolutions allowing remote voting, which would require either unanimous consent or an in-person vote. Either is a high bar, making the policy change unlikely at this moment.
Now What? 5 Looming Challenges For The Affordable Care Act\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Katherine Streeter for NPR Katherine Streeter for NPR\n\nRepublicans officially pulled the plug on their last-ditch effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act on Tuesday.\n\nWe don't have the votes, said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., after a closed-door meeting of Senate Republicans. And since we don't have the votes, we've made the decision to postpone the vote. Cassidy, along with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., put together the proposal they hoped could pass the Senate.\n\nAs of Sunday, though, the Senate will no longer be able to pass a health law overhaul bill with only a simple majority. That means the bill is effectively dead, for now.\n\nThat message was underscored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said, Where we go from here is tax reform.\n\nBut that does not mean all is smooth sailing for the ACA. Here are five ongoing challenges the law faces.\n\n1. Insurers still face tremendous uncertainty.\n\nWednesday is the deadline for health insurers to finalize rates for the 2018 individual market open enrollment season, which starts Nov. 1. Yet there has been no resolution to the question of whether the federal government will continue to reimburse insurers for subsidies known as cost-sharing reductions. Those are payments insurers are required to provide to moderate-income enrollees to help them afford deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. The law says the federal government is supposed to make those payments, but a lawsuit has left that an open question, and the Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to stop making the payments.\n\nWithout reimbursement of those subsidies, Pennsylvania Health and Human Services Secretary Teresa Miller told the Senate Finance Committee Monday, insurers in her state reported they would need to request a statewide average increase of 20.3 percent in the cost of health plan premiums. Those increases are similar nationwide.\n\nA bipartisan effort led by Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., to advance legislation to affirmatively fund the payments was reportedly progressing until Republican leaders stopped them to concentrate on efforts to pass the Graham-Cassidy legislation.\n\nBut Alexander and Murray now appear back at it.\n\nMurray said Tuesday she is ready to keep working on the bipartisan path that could lead to results.\n\nAlexander similarly released a statement that he would consult with Murray and others on a limited bipartisan plan that could be enacted into law to help lower premiums and make insurance available to the 18 million Americans in the individual market in 2018 and 2019.\n\n2. The Trump administration has cut funding for efforts to sign people up for insurance.\n\nAdministration officials announced earlier this month major cuts to the navigator program, which provides funding to community groups that guide people through the complex task of signing up for health insurance through the online marketplaces. Some groups are losing more than 90 percent of their budgets.\n\nThe cuts have forced many groups to lay off workers just before open enrollment begins and to limit the areas they serve.\n\n3. The 2018 enrollment period is half the length of 2017's, and now it will be shorter still.\n\nTrump officials are also slashing by 90 percent the advertising budget that reminds people about open enrollment and how to sign up — from $100 million to $10 million.\n\nThose cuts are even more significant this year because for the first time since the law's implementation, open enrollment starts in November, rather than December, and lasts only 45 days.\n\nMost people don't know the open enrollment dates, and they don't know that the deadline this year is Dec. 15, not Jan. 31, like last year, wrote Lori Lodes, who ran outreach for the ACA in the Obama administration, in a recent op-ed for Vox.\n\nTrump administration officials said they don't think advertising is cost-effective, but Lodes wrote that my office produced reams of data that proved the overall effectiveness of outreach advertising.\n\nAdditionally, HHS announced late last week that it will shut down HealthCare.gov for maintenance from 12 a.m. to 12 p.m. every Sunday during open enrollment, except for Dec. 10 – a step critics say could further undermine enrollment efforts.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\n4. The Trump administration is dragging its feet on giving states flexibility to stabilize their markets.\n\nBack in March, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services chief Seema Verma, who oversees the ACA, sent a letter to states encouraging them to use the law's waiver process to improve the functioning of their individual insurance markets. In particular, they suggested states could create reinsurance programs that would help lower premiums by providing a payment mechanism for the most expensive patients.\n\nBut when Minnesota took up that invitation, the administration delayed its response. When it finally did grant permission last week, HHS also informed the state that it will lose significant funding for a program that provides insurance to the state's low-income residents.\n\nGov. Mark Dayton, a former Democratic senator, said in a letter to Price that we have now been informed that Minnesota would lose more federal Basic Health Plan funding than we would receive in federal support for reinsurance, and described the entire waiver process as nightmarish.\n\n5. Republicans could take another shot at a full overhaul next year — or even this year.\n\nWhile the acknowledgment that the GOP lacks the votes to overhaul the health law means an immediate vote will not happen, the Republicans have potentially two more shots to try to pass a bill with a simple majority vote.\n\nWhat triggers the ability to pass a bill in the Senate without threat of filibuster is a formal budget resolution. Republicans have still not passed a budget resolution for fiscal 2018, which begins Oct. 1. The upcoming resolution is expected to call for a major tax cut bill. Some Republicans, notably Graham himself, have suggested adding health language to that resolution, which would be allowed.\n\nBut that would complicate efforts for both bills.\n\nMore likely is that Republicans could try again for a health overhaul via its fiscal 2019 budget resolution, which is due next April. That would leave them only a few months before the 2018 elections. Still, it's possible, particularly if they can use the time to reach consensus.\n\nThat is clearly what sponsors of the latest GOP bill have in mind.\n\nWe're on a path to pass his bill, Graham told reporters. It's just a matter of when. It will be in this Congress, under a better process.\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The 'Uncollected Stories' Show Allan Gurganus At His Finest\n\nThere aren't too many American authors for whom the publication of a new book is a bona fide literary event, but Allan Gurganus is one of them. The North Carolina author took the book world by storm in 1989 with his debut novel, Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All, which became a massive bestseller and spawned an Emmy-winning television miniseries adaptation. Only four books followed after that.\n\nUntil now. The Uncollected Stories of Allan Gurganus is his first book since 2013, and it's more than worth the wait. The collection is Gurganus at his finest: funny, compassionate, and marked by the author's amazing ability to reflect the lightness — and darkness — in the souls of his fascinating characters.\n\nThe collection kicks off with The Wish for a Good Young Country Doctor, which made something of a splash when it was originally published in The New Yorker last spring. The story is narrated by an antique collector reflecting on his days as an American studies graduate student; he was part of a band of merry hippie researchers and cerebral hucksters who frequented antique stores in the Midwest, delighting in every kitschy old toy they managed to dig up.\n\nAt one store, the student's eye is caught by a 19th-century painting, and he convinces the store's initially belligerent proprietor to tell him about the subject. It turns out to be a portrait of Fredrick M. Petrie, who arrived in a small town called La Verne at the same time as a cholera epidemic. [T]he doctor was soon the only person brave or fool enough to duck under the quarantine ropes, ignoring warning signs he himself had nailed to doors of those farmhouses worst hit, the store owner explains. Despite the doctor's help, the townspeople turn on him, blaming him for the wave of illnesses. In La Verne, if we act too kind or smart or interested in much, they'll make us pay. And pay. And pay, the shop owner says.\n\nThe collection is Gurganus at his finest: funny, compassionate, and marked by the author's amazing ability to reflect the lightness — and darkness — in the souls of his fascinating characters.\n\nIt's easy to see why the story resonated so much last year with readers who were just weeks into a pandemic of their very own. In 31 pages, Gurganus spotlights the best and worst in America: the selflessness of those who put their own lives in danger to help others, and the inexplicable mean-spiritedness they're too often subjected to in return. It's a story that hits way too close to home, and Gurganus tells it beautifully, with an underlying anger that nonetheless never turns to cynicism.\n\nMuch more hopeful is Unassisted Human Flight, which follows a reporter wrapping up his stint at a small-town North Carolina newspaper with one last big article: a story about an eight-year-old boy who, decades back, was carried by a tornado and left unharmed. The boy, now an engineer in his 40s, initially resists the reporter's entreaties to talk to him, reluctant to revisit the storm that killed his twin brother.\n\nBut the reporter persists, and eventually the man agrees to share his story. But wherever we wind up, in whatever amount, I think we'll exit riding some force to show us out, the engineer tells the reporter. Death is room-temperature. It has no mass but is a Fact. And nothing's out to torture us except certain other people. No hidden meanness is waiting to trap us.\n\nIt's a beautiful story that works chiefly because of Gurganus' gift for writing realistic, but still musical, dialogue. He gets the intonations of Southern speech just right, and never condescends to his small-town characters.\n\nThe standout story in the collection is Fetch, in which a narrator tells the story of witnessing a middle-aged couple taking their Labrador retriever to the beach. The woman appears gravely ill, with her partner helping her walk: How many months now has he slowed his gait to honor gravity's sudden tax on hers?\n\nAlthough the weather is inclement, the man throws a stick into the ocean for the dog to fetch, and it soon finds itself struggling to stay afloat, sending the couple into a panic: And you soon hear in their torn scraps of sound how they no longer simply tease or coax the animal ashore; theirs have become cries and screams ascending to the pitch of non-believers' prayers.\n\nIt's an astounding story (although one that will likely send any dog lovers reading it into a panic attack); Gurganus proves to be a master of pacing, recounting the dog's struggle in exacting, finely observed detail. Remarkably, he tells the story with no dialogue; the narrator only sees the couple communicating in gestures — it's a technique that somehow manages to amp up the tension of the story while still making clear the love the couple have for each other and for their beloved pet.\n\nAnd like all the stories in the collection, it's full of Gurganus' deep-seated compassion and fascination with — and love for — humanity. This is a remarkable book, and it proves once again why Gurganus is one of the country's most talented and imaginative writers. Coming after a year where nothing went right, and the world was forced to realize that things might not work out in the end, it's a hopeful tonic. As Gurganus writes, We grant ourselves so little daily hope. Meanwhile, barely noticing, we've already managed wonders.
The Census Bureau Needs To Hire Half A Million Workers For The 2020 Count\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Toby Talbot/AP Toby Talbot/AP\n\nWhile hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed during the partial government shutdown, one federal agency was in the midst of a massive recruiting effort.\n\nThe Census Bureau has been busy trying to hire around a half million temporary workers to help carry out the upcoming national head count of every person living in the U.S. The census is set to officially kick off next January.\n\nFunding carried over from last year kept census preparations going through the 35-day shutdown that ended Jan. 25. That includes processing applications received through the bureau's 2020 census jobs website that launched last September and staffing up census offices that are starting to open this month in communities around the country.\n\nThe one thing that keeps me up at night is the one thing I have less control over, and that's our ability to recruit and hire, the Census Bureau's head of the 2020 census, Albert Fontenot, explained during a public meeting last year.\n\nCensus workers will play a critical role to make sure people who don't fill out a census form themselves by mail, phone or online get counted. Fewer than seven in 10 householders plan to take part in the census, according to a new report commissioned by the Census Bureau.\n\nThe rate is cause for concern because the decennial census is designed to count every person in the United States, wrote the report's researchers, noting that the actual response rate may be lower.\n\nA small applicant pool?\n\nDoor-to-door follow-up visits by census workers help make up the most expensive part of the 2020 census. The head count is expected to cost a total of $15.6 billion. But the visits have helped the agency ensure that as many residents in the U.S. as possible are counted accurately and at their usual addresses.\n\nThe low unemployment rate, however, could result in an applicant pool smaller than the bureau would like for its openings for door knockers and other census positions.\n\nAn earlier round of hiring beginning in 2016 for partnership specialists — charged with encouraging the hardest-to-count groups, including communities of color, to participate in the census — encountered smaller than expected applicant pools, declined offers, and turnover, according to a Government Accountability Office report released last year.\n\nFor last year's test run of the 2020 census in Rhode Island's Providence County, the bureau sent out into the field about 70 percent of the workers it planned to bring on.\n\nUsing smartphones to submit people's census information back to the bureau through the Internet did help boost the workers' productivity for the test run in Providence County. Still, Census Bureau officials say they plan to adapt their recruiting efforts for the actual head count.\n\nOnly hiring U.S. citizens?\n\nMore than 90,000 people have applied for 2020 census jobs through the bureau's website, and since late December, the agency has hired more than 680 workers. The bureau is expected to make a more high-profile push for job applicants through an advertising campaign set to launch in January 2020.\n\nCensus job postings have noted that U.S. citizenship is a requirement, as it is for most federal government positions. For past head counts, however, the Census Bureau has received exemptions to hire noncitizens with special language or cultural skills to serve as translators and in outreach positions.\n\nThere is not a ban on hiring noncitizens, the Census Bureau's public information office emphasized in a written statement from June. In a new statement, the agency says it's still pursuing all legal flexibilities provided by Congress to hire the workforce we will need to conduct an accurate 2020 Census.\n\nSo far, however, the bureau has only hired U.S. citizens for the upcoming head count.\n\nBridge job\n\nSome communities are doing their part in recruiting efforts by helping job seekers apply for census jobs. For now, many of the openings are for outreach specialists who work with local community groups, as well as for positions based in local and regional census offices.\n\nMarzena Ermler, the career services manager at the New York Public Library, says she has been recommending census positions as a bridge job for some job seekers.\n\nWe very often see a lot of mature job seekers who are transitioning from one career to another, explains Ermler, who is based at the Science, Industry and Business Library in Manhattan. They, for whatever reason, are laid off, other jobs are over, and they need that quick access to cash.\n\nPamela Hudson recently stopped by the Bronx Library Center to meet with a career coach who helped her complete an online job application for a supervisor position.\n\nCommunities like the Bronx, she says, need to be counted accurately so that they get their fair share of the hundreds of billions of federal tax dollars distributed based on census numbers.\n\nI'm thinking about transitioning into this job because it's very important to me, Hudson adds. We have children that need education. We have children that need health care.\n\nConcerns about census funding\n\nThe partial government shutdown, however, did give Hudson pause about working for the Census Bureau. She noticed the bureau was not updating portions of its website during the shutdown because of a lapse in federal funding, according to a banner splashed across the site.\n\nI'm concerned about that, Hudson says, wondering if census workers may not get paid if there's another funding stalemate.\n\nIn case there's another shutdown in the coming weeks, the bureau has said it has enough money to work on the 2020 census into April.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hansi Lo Wang/NPR Hansi Lo Wang/NPR\n\nWhatever happens, Tayesha Hudson, no relation to Pamela, says she is not worried.\n\nI know eventually the government is going to have to get it together, and I know that they're going to want this 2020 census to go forward, she says.\n\nTayesha Hudson is interested in helping with door-knocking and collecting census information in the Bronx. If she is hired for the job, though, she expects to do a lot of persuading of community members who, she says, may not see the point of participating in the census.\n\nWe're all in this life just trying to make sure that we can go day by day, so we all should be counted.\n\nIt's about making sure that we get the things that we need in our community, that everybody is counted regardless of their race, regardless of whether or not they're a citizen, she says. We're all in this life just trying to make sure that we can go day by day, so we all should be counted.\n\nThe challenge of the citizenship question\n\nThe controversy over the citizenship question the Trump administration wants to add to the 2020 census could pose another challenge to recruiting and hiring. The question asks, Is this person a citizen of the United States?\n\nA federal judge in New York, who presided over the two lead lawsuits about the question, has ordered the administration to stop plans to include it on forms for the head count. But the administration – which is facing five other citizenship question lawsuits — wants the Supreme Court to let the question stay.\n\nIf it does, many census workers will have a harder job, says Elzie Wright, a program coordinator for the Christopher Rose Community Empowerment Campaign, based in Brooklyn.\n\nThey know that they probably won't get too many answers or too many participants, especially now in this environment, explains Wright, who has worked on outreach to the Haitian community in Brooklyn. Let's face it: There's a lot of undocumented people in the community. And that makes them suspicious to talk to anybody.\n\nThe Census Bureau is expecting fewer households to respond to the census if there is a citizenship question. It plans to use results from an upcoming field test of people's responses to the question to update its recruiting strategy as the head count draws closer.\n\nThat means the bureau could have to hire even more workers.
Walmart Joins Dick's Sporting Goods In Tighter Limits On Gun Sales\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 7:40 p.m. ET\n\nWalmart and Dick's Sporting Goods say they won't sell guns to customers under 21, and both are putting new restrictions on ammunition sales.\n\nDick's Sporting Goods, one of the largest sports retailers in the U.S., has announced it is immediately ending its sales of military-style semi-automatic rifles and is requiring all customers to be older than 21 to buy a firearm at its stores. Additionally, the company no longer will sell high-capacity magazines.\n\nWalmart, which ended sales of modern sporting rifles such as AR-15s in 2015, has announced that it is raising the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition from 18 to 21. The company notes that it does not sell bump stocks, high-capacity magazines and similar accessories.\n\nWalmart is also removing items from its website resembling assault-style rifles, including nonlethal airsoft guns and toys — like the air gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was shot by a Cleveland police officer who thought the 12-year-old was armed.\n\nDick's Sporting Goods CEO Ed Stack announced the firm's decision on ABC's Good Morning America on Wednesday, the same day that survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School returned to class. Stack said the 19-year-old gunman allegedly behind that massacre, which claimed 17 lives and wounded many more in Parkland, Fla., had purchased a firearm from the retailer last November.\n\nWhile that the weapon — a shotgun — was not used in the shooting, the CEO said the revelation deeply affected Stack and his colleagues at Dick's.\n\nWe did everything by the book. We did everything that the law required, and still he was able to buy a gun, Stack said. When we looked at that, we said the systems that are in place across the board just aren't effective enough to keep us from selling a gun like that.\n\nAnd so we've decided we're not going to sell the assault-type rifles any longer.\n\nThe company, which operates more than 715 locations, already had pulled assault-style weapons from Dick's stores after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting; now it will also stop selling the weapons at its subsidiary Field & Stream stores.\n\nStack said the decision to eliminate assault-style rifles is permanent.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims and their loved ones, the company said in a statement issued Wednesday. But thoughts and prayers are not enough. We have tremendous respect and admiration for the students organizing and making their voices heard regarding gun violence in schools and elsewhere in our country.\n\nWe have heard you. The nation has heard you. ... The systems in place are not effective to protect our kids and our citizens.\n\nThe statement asserted the company's support for the Second Amendment but continued, we have to help solve the problem that's in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic.\n\nIn addition to changing its own policies, the company issued a plea to elected officials to enact common-sense gun reform, specifically calling for the following regulations:\n\nBan assault-style firearms\n\nRaise the minimum age to purchase firearms to 21\n\nBan high-capacity magazines, as well as bump stocks — gun accessories that allow semi-automatic rifles to operate like fully automatic weapons\n\nRequire universal background checks that include relevant mental health information and previous interactions with the law\n\nEnsure a complete universal database of those banned from buying firearms\n\nClose the private sale and gun show loopholes that waive background checks\n\nWith their moves, Dick's and Walmart join a host of major companies that made changes in reaction to the Parkland shooting. As NPR's Amy Held reported last week, many other high-profile companies — from MetLife Insurance and First National Bank of Omaha to Symantec and Hertz — have ended their corporate partnerships with the National Rifle Association.\n\nThose moves have not been without controversy.\n\nEarlier this week, for instance, Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle threatened to kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta Air Lines after the company ended its own relationship with the NRA. Delta, which is based in Atlanta, had announced two days earlier that we will be requesting that the NRA remove our information from their website — a decision Cagle described as an attack on conservatives.\n\nAsked about the potential for pushback among gun rights advocates, Stack acknowledged the move isn't going to make everyone happy. But when we look at what those kids and the parents and the heroes in the school, what they did, our view was: If the kids can be brave enough to organize like this, we can be brave enough to get these [firearms] out of here.\n\nWe're staunch supporters of the Second Amendment, he added. I'm a gun owner myself. We've just decided that based on what's happened and with these guns, we don't want to be part of this story.
FACT CHECK: Trump's Tweets On Christians, ISIS And Vetting Miss The Bigger Picture\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mohammed Zaatari/AP Mohammed Zaatari/AP\n\nHundreds were detained at airports around the country Saturday in a chaotic and confusing day following President Trump's Friday night executive order temporarily banning Muslims from seven countries.\n\nIt spurred protests and backlash — even from some in Trump's own party, for either mismanagement of the rollout of the order or the values it represents.\n\nBut one thing Trump's executive order did — and why many are referring to it as a Muslim ban — is indicate a carve-out for Christians. Here's the controversial language:\n\nTrump hinted that he would be prioritizing Christians before the order was released on Friday. Here's the transcript of Trump's exchange with the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody:\n\nBRODY: Persecuted Christians, we've talked about this, the refugees overseas. The refugee program, or the refugee changes you're looking to make. As it relates to persecuted Christians, do you see them as kind of a priority here? TRUMP: Yes. BRODY: You do? TRUMP: They've been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\n\nIt's true that 99 percent of the 12,587 refugees from Syria admitted in 2016 to the U.S. were Muslim and less than 1 percent were Christian. That would outpace Muslims' population in Syria, which is 93 percent. But that's based on 2010 numbers. With the civil war going on and the millions who have been displaced, it's nearly impossible to tell exactly what the most current percentages are.\n\nAnother possible reason for the lower percentage of Christians being admitted from Syria to the U.S. is the protection they have received from the Assad regime.\n\nAs the Christian Post reported in 2015:\n\nChristians, who have been caught in the crossfire of the Arab Spring and civil war, have found a measure of protection under Assad's dictatorship.In October, the Catholic Herald reported on comments from one of Syria's leading Christians who said [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's intervention, while possibly motivated by selfish reasons, is helping and giving hope to Christians.\n\nWhy would Assad do that? His regime loves to paint itself as a protector of minorities, and there are still a large number of Christians in the Syrian capital of Damascus, for example, where Assad's government is centered.\n\nWhat's more, if the implication is that the U.S. is not admitting Christian refugees or that the U.S. is making it difficult, that's not true at all. In fact, the number of Christian refugees to the U.S. in 2016 was almost equal to that of Muslim refugees — 37,521 to 38,901, according to the Pew Research Center, which is basing its numbers on figures from the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTrump took to Twitter Sunday morning to defend himself on the need to prioritize Christians. He said they were being executed in large numbers, reiterated his call for extreme vetting and warned of the U.S. turning into Europe, which has dealt with terrorist attacks and bombings since the rise of ISIS:\n\nThe Obama administration did formally accuse ISIS of carrying out a genocide against religious minorities, including Christians in Iraq and Syria. Offices at the State Department have been involved in the U.S. response, though this did not include putting Christians at the top of the line for the U.S. resettlement program.\n\nBut here's the reality: While Christians in Iraq and Syria have been killed by ISIS, Muslims have been the group's victims far more frequently and represent the strong majority. Shiite Muslims are killed by ongoing waves of ISIS bombings of Shiite neighborhoods, and Shiite members of Iraq's security forces have been victims of mass ISIS executions.\n\nBut even as ISIS claims it fights for Sunni Islam, fellow Sunni Muslims have also been killed and displaced in greater numbers than Christians. That is in part because ISIS operates mostly in Sunni areas. Hundreds of thousands of Sunnis have been displaced from ISIS areas, as Sunnis, who try to oppose the group or have ties to the Iraqi government, are targeted.\n\nAnd Muslims have fought ISIS more than anyone else. This includes Kurdish Sunnis and Arab Sunnis and Shiites, who are on the front lines and often allied with U.S. advisers in the battle against ISIS, as well as Turkmen Muslims. Some of the most horrific videos from ISIS have shown the killing of Sunni Muslims who have fought the group, like a Jordanian pilot and Turkish troops shown burned alive.\n\nCertainly, it's the case that Christians were terrified of ISIS and fled. ISIS has desecrated churches and shrines. Some Christians have lived in ISIS-controlled areas and paid a tax to the terrorist group. And there have been Christians killed and kidnapped — 88 Eritrean Christians from Libya who were kidnapped by ISIS in 2015 two months after 28 Ethiopian Christians were executed; 262 Assyrian Christians kidnapped from the Tel Tamer area in Syria and held for ransom; 50 killed in Tel Tamer in suicide bombings.\n\nBut that pales in comparison with the mass murder of Muslims — massacres in Iraq; 1,700 Iraqi air force cadets executed or missing from Camp Speicher, a former American military base near Tikrit; the slaughter of hundreds of the al-Sheitat tribe in Syria; and the massacre of Syrian army POWs at Tabqa in 2014.\n\nThat's not to mention the hunting down of Yazidis.\n\nAs far as Europe goes, there is an ocean between the U.S. and Europe, and the U.S. already has very strict procedures in place for refugees, as NPR's Brian Naylor has reported.\n\nNPR's Jane Arraf also contributed to this post.
President-Elect Trump Breaks With Long History Of Press Conferences\n\nWe've created this handy widget to track how long it has been since Donald Trump held a formal press conference and how many times he has tweeted in that time. It will keep counting until he holds one.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nWhy are we tracking this?\n\nUnlike other ways of getting messages out, press conferences hold public officials more accountable to the American people because they have to answer questions in an uncontrolled environment.\n\nThe public expects that a president isn't just going to announce something [but] that he's going to explain it and be able to answer questions about it, said Martha Joynt Kumar, a political scientist at Towson University and director of the White House Transition Project.\n\nFor the second time as president-elect, Trump tweeted an announcement of a scheduled press conference, this time on Jan. 11.\n\nInitially, Dec. 15 was to be the day Trump would hold his first press conference since winning the election. But it never happened, canceled before a time and place had been set. It was supposed to be about how Trump would address his potential business conflicts of interest as president. The rescheduled press conference has no such promised focus.\n\nAlready, no president-elect (dating to at least Jimmy Carter) has waited longer to hold a press conference. One irony — perhaps hypocrisy — of Trump's extended run without a press conference is just how critical he and his campaign were of rival Hillary Clinton's choice to go an extended period (276 days in total) without holding one. His campaign sent out daily press releases counting the days since her last press conference, headlined, Hiding Hillary Watch — and, at one point, Trump even tweeted about it:\n\nI am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2016\n\nUnless Trump holds a press conference by Jan. 21, one day after his inauguration, he will hit the very mark for which he ridiculed Clinton on Twitter.\n\nPrecedent favors frequent press conferences during transition\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nTwo days after the Supreme Court decision that made George W. Bush president-elect in 2000, he held a press conference in Austin. He took questions from reporters about his potential Cabinet picks, whether he would call for tax cuts and when the weight of being the next president of the United States hit him.\n\nThe next day, Bush introduced his choice for secretary of state and took more questions. The day after that, he answered yet more questions during a press conference to introduce his national security adviser and White House counselors.\n\nPresident-elect Barack Obama followed a similar pattern, regularly fielding questions from reporters, as he made choices about who would serve in his administration. In all, Obama fielded questions from the White House press corps on 18 different occasions as president-elect. George W. Bush, who had a shorter transition period, did so 11 times.\n\nAt this point, if president-elect Donald Trump were to hold a press conference every day starting today, he wouldn't hit Obama's mark for formal interactions with the press during the transition period.\n\nAs with so many other things, Trump is flouting this tradition. He hasn't held a press conference since July 27, when he called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails. I will tell you this, Russia: If you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump said at his resort in Doral, Fla. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Seth Wenig/AP Seth Wenig/AP\n\nInstead Trump has opted for rallies, press releases, photo ops, a handful of interviews and tweeting. Lots of tweeting.\n\nOn the day he announced his choice for secretary of state, Trump tweeted praise for his pick, Rex Tillerson, the chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil, but didn't appear with him publicly. Trump did go down to the lobby of Trump Tower so he could be photographed with rapper Kanye West.\n\nLife, Trump said when asked what they talked about. We discussed life.\n\nLater, he held a victory rally in Wisconsin.\n\nThe first presidential press conference happened by accident\n\nWhen an aide to President Woodrow Wilson invited newspapermen to meet the new president in 1913, the presidential press conference was born.\n\nHe wasn't expecting so many newsmen to show up. But since then, it has become a tradition, a fixture of the relationship between the president, the press and, by extension, the American public.\n\nBased on an NPR analysis of data from the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara over the past three administrations, the president has fielded questions from reporters on average about every 15 days.\n\nCBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller, who meticulously tracks the activities of the president, says the longest drought between press conferences for President George W. Bush was 82 days, while the longest President Obama went without a press conference was 86.\n\nBut the traditions of the relationship between the president and the press don't appear to be a driving motivator for Trump and his transition team.\n\nAppearing on the Hugh Hewitt radio show, Trump's future White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said things like the weekly radio address, or even the daily briefing by the press secretary — where members of the media are allowed to question the administration on policy and topics of the day — could change under Trump.\n\nThe traditions, while some of them are great, Priebus said, I think it's time to revisit a lot of these things that have been done in the White House, and I can assure you that change is going to happen.
First Mention: Donald Trump Unveils Trump Tower In 1983\n\nWe find a first mention of Donald Trump deep in the NPR archives from the opening of Trump Tower in 1983.\n\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\n\nLet's take a look into NPR's audio archives. It is where we go for something we like to call...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: First mention.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nThat's when we locate, to the best of our ability, the moment when a well-known thing or person first showed up on NPR. Lately, we've been discovering when the current presidential candidates appeared. Today, it's Donald Trump.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nBOB EDWARDS, BYLINE: And this is NPR's MORNING EDITION.\n\nMCEVERS: On NPR's MORNING EDITION on April 25, 1983 - yes, that was the 1983 version of the theme song - reporter Todd Shapira was covering the opening of a skyscraper in New York City.\n\nTODD SHAPIRA, BYLINE: When you enter Trump Tower under the bronze portal on 5th Avenue, you're greeted by a polished doorman.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Good morning, dear lady.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Good morning.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Very lovely lady there, isn't she?\n\nSHAPIRA: The lavish shopping atrium inside will feature expensive boutiques from international designers.\n\nMCEVERS: Our reporter got a tour. He did not get to speak to Donald Trump, but he did talk at length about him.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nSHAPIRA: Also moving in is the building's namesake, 37-year-old whiz kid developer Donald Trump. Trump is on his way to building himself a real estate empire in New York, but not without controversy. In 1973, the developer was sued by the Justice Department for refusing to rent to blacks. Trump is also known for making lucrative deals with New York state and for making massive political contribution. Now, Trump is fighting the city for a $50 million tax abatement for his tower, saying this Kasbah for sheiks and movie stars will provide a public benefit because it's a mixed-use building with boutiques and office space. The city has twice ruled against tax abatements for Trump Tower. Trump responded by suing the housing commissioner for $138 million.\n\nMCEVERS: By the way, Trump did settle that racial bias case brought by the Justice Department, but did not admit any wrongdoing.\n\nCORNISH: NPR listeners would then have to wait two years before they got to hear directly from the future reality show star and presidential candidate. It came in a story about quarterback Doug Flutie joining the New Jersey Generals.\n\nMCEVERS: The Generals were a short-lived team for a short-lived league called the United States Football League. It was like an alternative to the NFL. Trump used to own the Generals. And when he hired Flutie, MORNING EDITION aired this story by reporter Jon Kalish on February 6, 1985.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nJON KALISH, BYLINE: It was Donald Trump, the wealthy New York builder and owner of the Generals, who first compared Flutie to Joe Namath. There are some who believe Trump has acquired players like Flutie and running back Hershel Walker to aid the USFL's anti-trust suit against the NFL. One sports columnist described Trump's motivation this way - Donald Trump knows the only way for the NFL to accept Donald Trump is for the Generals to have players the NFL needs. In any event, Trump says Flutie is good for his team and the league.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Doug gives tremendous credibility to the league. Ticket sales are going through the roof, and I'm not only talking about our team. I'm talking about many of the teams. Most of the teams were way up, and that's great. And that's largely attributable to Doug and to the league itself.\n\nCORNISH: Donald Trump in 1985, being heard on NPR for the first time.\n\nMCEVERS: Incidentally, the New Jersey Generals only played three seasons. And the whole United States Football League fell apart a year after that story.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

Trump Stands By Unproven Wiretap Claim At Joint News Conference With Merkel\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 4:50 p.m. ET\n\nAt a wide-ranging and occasionally tense news conference after their first in-person meeting Friday, President Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed trade and border policy — and had one notable exchange when Trump was asked about his unproven claims that former President Obama tapped the phones at Trump Tower last year.\n\nTrump declined the opportunity to retract the claim, telling the media that we said nothing when he tweeted, How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process, and that he was merely quoting a very talented legal mind he had seen on Fox News.\n\nYou should be talking to Fox, Trump said.\n\nAfter the conference, Fox's Shepard Smith responded: Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano's commentary, apparently referring to the report Trump cited.\n\nBut first, when addressing the question about wiretapping from a German reporter, Trump told Merkel: At least we have something in common, perhaps — making an implied reference to the 2013 revelations that the National Security Administration had spied on European leaders, including Merkel.\n\nMerkel did not reply.\n\nThe moment punctuated remarks that focused predominantly on trade and training the countries' workers for manufacturing in the 21st century. In his statement at the start, Trump praised Germany's apprenticeship program that trains people to join the industrial workforce.\n\nHe also took a moment to thank Merkel for Germany's continued support of the war effort in Afghanistan and for its role as a counter-ISIS coalition member.\n\nStill, while Trump said he reiterated to Merkel his strong support for NATO, he was also careful to emphasize that NATO allies need to pay their fair share for the cost of defense. It's a point he has repeated often, maintaining a skeptical view of the defensive alliance — a position that has made Germany and other European countries wary.\n\nMany nations owe vast sums of money from past years, and it is very unfair to the United States, Trump continued. These nations must pay what they owe.\n\nToward that end, both leaders said that Germany is committed to increasing its defense spending to 2 percent of its GDP — a goal already established for NATO members by the treaty's terms.\n\nMerkel, for her part, focused on business from the outset as a centerpiece of her visit. Indeed she embarked on her trans-Atlantic trip with some notable companions: top executives at BMW, Siemens and the industrial parts manufacturer Schaeffler.\n\nHer high-placed company sent as good a message as any about the direction Merkel expected these introductory talks to take.\n\nShe wants to make the point that the companies have created thousands of jobs in the United States, Tanit Koch, the editor of the German newspaper Bild, tells NPR's Rachel Martin.\n\nCiting Merkel's interview with another German paper, Saarbruecker Zeitung, the BBC says the chancellor planned to remind Trump that BMW's plant in South Carolina exported more cars than GM and Ford together from America.\n\nI'll make that clear, Merkel added.\n\nAnd unavoidably with business comes the question of trade. At the news conference, Merkel praised international trade agreements, saying they work best when they work as a win-win for the parties involved.\n\nThe English word she puts a lot of emphasis on right now is the word 'reciprocity,'  Koch says.\n\nYet the German publication Deutsche Welle points out that the bar of what to expect from their first meeting [is] rather low, especially given the prior verbal tiffs between them and their different domestic audiences.\n\nAnd those prior verbal tiffs are not insignificant.\n\nBoth as a candidate and as president-elect, Trump had some harsh words for the German leader, saying she was ruining Germany and had made a catastrophic mistake in welcoming more than 1 million migrants and refugees in recent years.\n\nIt's always better to talk with each other than about each other.\n\nThe stark difference between their immigration policies surfaced again occasionally in the course of their news conference — with Trump pointedly asserting that immigration is a privilege, not a right.\n\nIn turn, Merkel maintained that while efforts must be made to stop illegal trafficking, such efforts have to be done by looking at the refugees as well, giving them opportunities to shape their own lives. ... Help countries who right now are not [able] to do so.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump stressed this difference in beliefs in harsh terms, once saying, The German people are going to end up overthrowing this woman. I don't know what the hell she's thinking.\n\nAnd shortly after Trump's election, Merkel offered a rebuttal of her own in a tepid note of congratulations, taking the opportunity to state:\n\nGermany and America are bound by their values: democracy, freedom, the respect for the law and the dignity of human beings, independent of their origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political position. On the basis of these values I offer the future president of the United States, Donald Trump, close co-operation.\n\nThe tensions have made for a tenuous balance for both leaders — perhaps more so for the German chancellor, who faces a tough national election of her own in September.\n\nWhat we know from the polls — as much as we can trust them nowadays — is that you have 80 to 90 percent of Germans saying they pretty much abhor what [Trump is] doing, Koch tells NPR.\n\nBut Merkel can't fully separate herself from the U.S. president. Quite the opposite, in fact: Hopes remain that the meeting, if nothing else, might help reset the relationship between the two leaders.\n\nOr as Merkel told Saarbruecker Zeitung: It's always better to talk with each other than about each other.\n\nThey are likely to have at least one more opportunity to talk with each other after this visit. Trump has accepted Merkel's invitation to the G-20 Summit, which will be held in Germany this summer.
NRA Plans Layoffs, 20% Cut In Pay For Employees Due To Coronavirus' Economic Hit\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nFeeling the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic, the National Rifle Association is planning to lay off staff and taking other cost-cutting measures in the face of extraordinary challenges from COVID-19, Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the NRA, announced to the group's board of directors on Monday.\n\nThe belt-tightening in response to the virus outbreak includes the elimination of certain positions and forcing hourly employees to work just four days a week, in addition to 20% reductions in pay for NRA staffers.\n\nIn addition, some senior staff members are voluntarily taking deeper cuts, said an NRA spokesman by email.\n\nA pay reduction is expected for LaPierre, but it is unclear by how much.\n\nLaPierre was paid $2.1 million in 2018, according to the nonprofit's more recent publicly filed tax filing.\n\nLeaked internal documents published last year detailing lavish six-figure spending on clothing and travel expenses for LaPierre prompted calls for his resignation from some of the group's now-former board members. Nonetheless, LaPierre remained the group's leader.\n\nNews about the NRA's salary cuts and other steps taken to cut slash costs at the influential gun rights group was first reported by Newsweek.\n\nThe NRA had already canceled its annual meeting, set to take place in Nashville, Tenn., because of the coronavirus.\n\nThis is in addition to the cancellation of numerous scheduled NRA programs and the competitions, an NRA spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\nWe believe these actions will favorably position the Association leading up to the November election. We will continue to lead the fight to protect our Second Amendment, the First Amendment, and all our constitutional freedoms for years to come, the statement read.\n\nThe NRA employed 816 people in 2018, according to the group's tax filing.\n\nAcross the country, firearms and ammunition dealers have reported surging sales amid pandemic fears, with many buyers saying looming uncertainty tied to the crisis spurred them to arm themselves and others citing a reduction in law enforcement activity in explaining their purchases.\n\nCritics of the NRA seized on the group's financial woes, arguing that the economic hard times were driven by more than the coronavirus.\n\nShannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a gun control advocacy group, said in a statement to NPR that years of apparent self-dealing by NRA insiders and an agenda that is out of step with the American public could be a factor in the NRA's downsizing.\n\nI offer NRA leaders my thoughts and prayers as our organization prepares to outspend and outwork them yet again this election season, Watts said.\n\nAn NRA spokesman hasn't responded to a request for comment on Watts' allegation.
News Brief: Election Results, Stock Markets Drop, Gene-Editing Tool\n\nAfter Super Tuesday, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are the front-runners. U.S. financial markets fell again on concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. And, details of a new development in medicine.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIt is far from a done deal, but this morning after Super Tuesday, we're a lot closer to knowing who the 2020 Democratic nominee for president will be.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nRemember; this started out as the most diverse field of Democratic presidential candidates in history. The front-runners now are two white men in their 70s, both with long political careers - Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOE BIDEN: Just a few days ago, the press and the pundits had declared the campaign dead.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nBIDEN: And then came South Carolina, and they had something to say about it.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nBIDEN: And we were told, well, when you got to Super Tuesday, it'd be over. Well, it may be over for the other guy.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Cheering).\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: Tonight, I tell you with absolute confidence, we are going to win the Democratic nomination.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nMARTIN: The voices of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders after last night's contests. We've got NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson with us to clarify what has happened and what it means going forward. Hi, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.\n\nMARTIN: So it was a late night for all of us as we watched these returns come in. Big headline is that Joe Biden needed to do well. And he did, right?\n\nLIASSON: Yes, he did. The big question going in was, would Bernie Sanders end the night on a glide path to a plurality of delegates with an all-but-insurmountable lead? We came out of the night with Biden with the most votes and delegates so far, and maybe he's on track to get a plurality before the convention. The race is now a two-man fight for delegates.\n\nYesterday was a test of three things - money, momentum and movement or organization. It turns out money didn't mean so much. Bloomberg spent a ton of it and didn't do very well. In terms of movement and organization, well, Bernie Sanders had that in spades. Joe Biden only had one field office in California...\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nLIASSON: ...And one in Virginia. In some places, he didn't even campaign. It turns out that free media - earned media - momentum really mattered. And that's what Joe Biden had. He had endorsements, and it translated into wins. Who would've thunk it?\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nLIASSON: You know? Historical rules only work till they stop working.\n\nMARTIN: Until they don't work anymore.\n\nLIASSON: That's what we learned last night.\n\nMARTIN: (Laughter) Right. So we should just point out, we hear a lot about the fact that Bernie Sanders took California; Joe Biden came out on top of Texas - two very delegate-rich states. But it doesn't mean that each of those candidates walks away with all those delegates, right?\n\nLIASSON: No, because it's not a winner-take-all system the way the Republicans have. There's a 15% threshold. You don't get any delegates unless you get over 15% of the popular vote. If no one else gets 15%, then you can take all the delegates or a huge amount of the delegates - a bigger percentage of the delegates than the percentage of the popular vote that you got. But if a lot of other candidates get over 15%, then the winner of the state ends up taking a smaller percentage of the delegates than the percentage they got of the popular vote. That's why it's very important to see the final delegate totals.\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nLIASSON: We don't have those yet. But if you win big, you get more delegates than if you win by a smaller margin.\n\nMARTIN: All right. So let's talk about Elizabeth Warren, who did not have a good night. She really needed to do well or at least have a showing, right?\n\nLIASSON: Needed to do well. She came in third in her own home state of Massachusetts. She lost this place she was born, Oklahoma. And then, of course, that follows her fourth-place finish in the neighboring state of New Hampshire. But last night, she did not give any indication of giving up. Here's what she said.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: No matter how scared you are, no matter how hard it looks, you get out there, and you fight for the people you love.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nLIASSON: So what Elizabeth Warren is going to do next is the subject of a lot of speculation. She had talked earlier about maybe a brokered convention; that was her path to the nomination.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah.\n\nLIASSON: But now she's splitting the left lane of the party with Bernie Sanders. Is that what she wants? Or will she drop out and endorse him? No one knows.\n\nMARTIN: All right. Let's finish on Mike Bloomberg because this is the first time he actually appeared on any ballot. He has spent an enormous amount of money. He only took American Samoa, a territory, last night. So what happens to his campaign moving forward?\n\nLIASSON: Well, he's reassessing his campaign. But even if he doesn't continue as a candidate, he is still on track to play what could be a game-changing and historic role in the election because he has said he will spend whatever it takes - billions of dollars if necessary - to support whoever is the nominee of the party. And he'll fund down-ballot Democratic candidates. He'll fund get-out-the-vote drives. He'll fund everything. That's what he says he'll do. And that is pretty significant.\n\nMARTIN: All right. NPR's Mara Liasson on the results of Super Tuesday. Mara, thank you.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMARTIN: OK. The World Health Organization says that the death rate of COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus - that death rate is now at about 3.4%, which is higher than previously thought. The battle against coronavirus is really happening on a lot of different fronts, including at the Federal Reserve.\n\nKING: Yeah. That's right. The Fed made an emergency interest rate cut yesterday to try to protect the economy from the effects of the virus, but it didn't seem to work. The S&P, the Dow and the Nasdaq all fell yesterday anyway.\n\nMARTIN: We've got NPR chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley with us this morning. So Scott, just start with what was supposed to happen. What was the intention of the Fed in making this rate cut?\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The Fed was hoping to inject some confidence in the economy and the stock market after the worst week on Wall Street since the financial crisis. This was the first time the Fed had cut rates outside of an ordinarily scheduled meeting. And they cut by half a point, not a quarter point as they usually do. They don't have a whole lot of monetary ammunition here, so they wanted to act quickly and dramatically even though Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that this action on its own would not shield the economy from coronavirus damage.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJEROME POWELL: We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection. It won't fix a broken supply chain. We get that. We don't think we have all the answers. But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy.\n\nHORSLEY: The initial reaction in the stock market was positive. The Dow jumped about 300 points when the news first broke. But the more investors thought about it, the less they liked it. And the major indexes ended the day down around 3%.\n\nMARTIN: Right. So what went wrong? I mean, how did he miscalculate?\n\nHORSLEY: Well, it is odd because just a day earlier, the market had jumped 4 to 5% on the promise of just this kind of rate cut. So it's a little bit unusual. I spoke to the chief economist at LendingTree, Tendayi Kapfidze. And he just thinks the Fed missed the mark. This is not the kind of medicine the economy needs to deal with the coronavirus epidemic.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\n\nTENDAYI KAPFIDZE: I don't see that a rate cut makes me want to get on a plane or go to a sports stadium or any other kind of economic activity that increases my risk of infections.\n\nHORSLEY: Now, futures markets are pointing to the possibility of a rebound on Wall Street today, so there may be some reassessment. Although that may also reflect investors' attitudes about yesterday's Super Tuesday results.\n\nMARTIN: Right. So as you have pointed out, there are limits to what monetary policy can do when it comes to something like a public health crisis like the coronavirus. Is there another option for governments to employ?\n\nHORSLEY: There is. For example, South Korea is asking for just money to help businesses that are adversely affected by the epidemic. President Trump has been talking about a payroll tax holiday, which was something that was done during the recession. But there's been little follow-up on that from the White House and almost no talk about it on Capitol Hill.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Scott Horsley for us. Thank you, Scott. We appreciate it.\n\nHORSLEY: You're welcome.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMARTIN: And now some news from the world of medicine.\n\nKING: Yeah. For the first time ever, doctors have used a revolutionary gene-editing technique. They're trying to treat a patient by editing that patient's DNA while it is still inside the person's body.\n\nMARTIN: We've got NPR health correspondent Rob Stein with us to explain. Hi, Rob.\n\nROB STEIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: This sounds crazy. Scientists edited someone's DNA from inside their body.\n\nSTEIN: Yeah.\n\nMARTIN: Explain. What does that mean?\n\nSTEIN: Yeah. Well, they have literally genetically modified someone from the inside. And here's what I mean. Scientists - you know, they've been using a tool called CRISPR to rewrite the genetic code, you know, to try to treat diseases like cancer and sickle cell.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah.\n\nSTEIN: But until now, doctors have been taking cells out of the bodies - you know, cells like bone marrow cells - editing the DNA in the cells and then infusing the genetically modified cells back in.\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nSTEIN: Now, for the first time, they've tried this entirely new strategy to try to treat someone with a rare genetic disease that destroys their vision.\n\nMARTIN: That is amazing. So what happened? I mean, can you explain in layman's terms what they did?\n\nSTEIN: Yeah, yeah. It's really fascinating. You know, a surgeon cut a tiny hole in the patient's eye and then dripped in three tiny, little drops of liquid containing billions of harmless viruses that were genetically engineered to carry the genetic instructions for creating this CRISPR gene-editing tool inside the retina. The CRISPR then hopefully cut out the genetic defect that's causing the disease, letting the cells produce a crucial protein that will hopefully heal the sick cells in the retina and giving the patient the ability to see. Here's Eric Pierce. He's the Harvard doctor running this study.\n\nERIC PIERCE: If we can fix the underlying genetic defect, we have the potential to restore vision to people who never had normal vision before. It would indeed be amazing.\n\nMARTIN: That's phenomenal. So this is a person who couldn't see - hopefully that their vision is going to be restored. What happens now, Rob?\n\nSTEIN: They just did this procedure at the Casey Eye Institute. It's at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. And it's on the first volunteer, first study that's testing this. So the first thing the doctors and the scientists are looking for is, you know, whether it's safe. Remember; you know, nothing like this has ever been done before. So they're starting with a very low dose in an older patient who already had extensive vision damage. And they're only treating one eye. And this is all, you know, just to make sure it doesn't backfire somehow, end up destroying whatever vision they do have instead of helping them.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah.\n\nSTEIN: But the scientists say this patient could start to see better within, you know, maybe just a few weeks. So doctors are going to be watching really closely both for any problems and for any improvements before trying this on more patients.\n\nMARTIN: And obviously paying attention because if it works, I assume it's going to have effects, implications for other diseases, right?\n\nSTEIN: Yeah. That's right. That's one of the reasons scientists are so excited about this. You know, there are many other diseases where you really can't treat them by taking cells out of their body and editing them and putting them back in. And the only way to get to the cells that need to be fixed, you know, for brain diseases like Huntington's disease, maybe some inherited forms of dementia, muscle diseases like muscular dystrophy, is to edit from the inside instead of from the outside.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah.\n\nSTEIN: This is what Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health said about all this.\n\nFRANCIS COLLINS: All of us dream of what time might be coming, where we could apply this approach for thousands of diseases.\n\nSTEIN: He said it's really exciting, and he's looking forward to see what happens next.\n\nMARTIN: Wow. The implications could be huge. NPR's Rob Stein for us this morning. Thank you, Rob. We appreciate it.\n\nSTEIN: No problem.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, we incorrectly say that the Federal Reserve cut rates this week for the first time outside of a scheduled meeting. In fact, it was the first time since the financial crisis in 2008 that the Fed acted outside of a scheduled meeting.]\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Week In Politics: How Likely Are Efforts To Remove Trump To Succeed?\n\nThere are calls from members of both parties for President Trump to resign or be forced out of office for his support of those who attacked the U.S. Capitol. But what chance do those efforts stand?\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nSo what might any consequences for the president be after this week's assault on the nation's Capitol? NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thank you.\n\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.\n\nSIMON: Donald Trump has little more than a week left in office. Senator Murkowski of Alaska called on him to resign yesterday. Democrats in the House are working up articles of impeachment. There has been talk about the 25th Amendment being invoked. Any chance any of these efforts may succeed before President Trump does one or more of the things that they fear he might?\n\nELVING: We are not likely to see the 25th Amendment, Scott. It's never been used except for a matter of hours for medical situations. And resignation would not seem to be in President Trump's nature. So unless Vice President Pence decides to push for it, there does not seem to be enough motivation within the Cabinet to remove him using the 25th Amendment.\n\nThat leaves impeachment. And the single article has already been drafted - impeachment for inciting violence against the government of the United States. And the Democrats seem resolved to press for it on Monday. They would have the votes in the House. But, of course, the Senate would have to follow suit. That seems unlikely before the scheduled transfer of power on January 20. But we could see a return to the issue after that when Trump is gone with the idea of barring him from federal office for life. That historically has been done in a few cases of federal judges who had been impeached and removed.\n\nSIMON: A jarring, bracing note this week when Speaker Pelosi asked the Pentagon about what the options there were for keeping President Trump's hand off the nuclear trigger.\n\nELVING: The Pentagon will only say that she called and a conversation took place. But Pelosi was clearly shaken by Wednesday's traumatic events, and she is deeply concerned about what else Trump or perhaps some of his followers might be capable of in these final days.\n\nSIMON: Let me separate that out. What can the president do, say even this weekend - pardons, for example?\n\nELVING: Yes, he has already issued a slew of pardons. Many consider some of those to be unsavory, including for his former associates who had pled guilty to lying to the FBI and were about to be sentenced to prison. He has pardoned individuals who killed civilians in Iraq while on contract with the U.S. military. And there is a general expectation he will pardon members of his family and quite possibly himself while he still can, although the actual legal effect of a self-pardon has never been tried and remains very much a matter of debate.\n\nSIMON: What could he face as a private citizen?\n\nELVING: That question will probably dominate his thinking in his last days in office, Scott. Legal machinery is already working in New York state, possibly elsewhere, fashioning cases to hold him accountable, perhaps for tax deficiencies. There have been allegations of bank fraud, misrepresentations about his properties, among other possible charges. And state charges would be unaffected by his pardon power, which is strictly for federal crimes. And let's not forget that just last weekend, Trump got on a phone, was taped with the Georgia secretary of state pressuring that official to, quote, find, unquote, enough votes so that Trump could win. That may well be a prosecutable offense as well.\n\nSIMON: And in the meantime, which is an extraordinary way of beginning the sentence, this country is still in extraordinary crisis. The number of coronavirus deaths rises. The number of infections are on the rise. The economic crisis deepens. There's been an extraordinary Russian hacking of security services. We could go on. The coronavirus vaccine rollout has been slow and insufficient. Is President Trump paying attention?\n\nELVING: Ah, yes, the reality check of it all. We do have 4,000 people dying in a single day now. Last month, the economy lost jobs for the first time in eight months. And as you say, the computer systems of our government and other major institutions are under cyberattack from Russia. There is a lot that a president might want to prioritize right now other than his own personal fate.\n\nSIMON: Has Vice President Pence become the real president in all but name for the federal government and the military?\n\nELVING: He certainly has gotten an upgrade in terms of his independence and his integrity. That would be in recognition of his handling of the situation on Wednesday night when he was counting the Electoral College votes, weathering the wrath of the protesters and the president. But where is he now? Is he with Trump or is he not? That will be answered in the week ahead, and that will have a profound effect on what the Congress does and what happens to Donald Trump in the future.\n\nSIMON: NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving, thanks for - nobody better to talk to on this extraordinary week. I'm glad you're with us. Take care, Ron.\n\nELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

Gilead Declines 'Rare Disease' Status For Experimental Coronavirus Drug\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn a surprising turnabout, drugmaker Gilead Sciences asked the Food and Drug administration on Wednesday to rescind orphan status for remdesivir, the company's experimental coronavirus treatment.\n\nThe agency granted this status to remdesivir on Monday, prompting a backlash from public health and consumer advocates. Orphan drug designation is intended to spur development of drugs for rare diseases by bestowing drugmakers with tax breaks, FDA fee waivers and seven years without generic competitors.\n\nAlthough this isn't the first time a company has asked for an orphan designation to be rescinded, it's rare, says James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a non-profit public interest group.\n\nGilead must have been feeling the heat, Love says. I think it's embarrassing to take something that's potentially the most widespread disease in the history of the pharmaceutical industry and claim it's a rare disease.\n\nFor its part, Gilead said it could proceed to develop the drug quickly without the special regulatory status.\n\nGilead is confident that it can maintain an expedited timeline in seeking regulatory review of remdesivir, without the orphan drug designation, the company wrote in a statement. Recent engagement with regulatory agencies has demonstrated that submissions and review relating to remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 are being expedited.\n\nTo get orphan status, a drug company must show its drug serves a population of fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, at the time of the submission of the request for orphan-drug designation. Gilead's latest statement indicates that this was early March.\n\nDomestic COVID-19 cases are expected to surpass that threshold. As of Wednesday afternoon, there were more than 60,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S.\n\nOrphan drugs are among the most expensive in this country, in part because they are shielded from from generic competition for longer than other prescription medicines.\n\nKnowledge Ecology International had been preparing to file a citizen petition to push the FDA to reverse its decision on remdesivir, Love says. Now, it won't have to.\n\nThe facts and circumstances should have given the FDA the authority to have rejected the application, which they did not do, the says.\n\nThe FDA confirmed to NPR that it has received and processed Gilead's request.
Gov. Wolf's budget proposes boosting staff at Pa.'s departments of environmental protection, and conservation and natural resources\n\nIn annual budget address, Wolf talked about need for pipeline reform\n\nSusan Phillips Bio Recent Stories Susan Phillips tells stories about the consequences of political decisions on people's every day lives. She has worked as a reporter for WHYY since 2004. Susan's coverage of the 2008 Presidential election resulted in a story on the front page of the New York Times. In 2010 she traveled to Haiti to cover the earthquake. That same year she produced an award-winning series on Pennsylvania's natural gas rush called The Shale Game. She received a 2013 Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Journalism Award for her work covering natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania. She has also won several Edward R. Murrow awards for her work with StateImpact. In 2013/14 she spent a year at MIT as a Knight Science Journalism Fellow. She has also been a Metcalf Fellow, an MBL Logan Science Journalism Fellow and reported from Marrakech on the 2016 climate talks as an International Reporting Project Fellow. A graduate of Columbia School of Journalism, she earned her Bachelor's degree in International Relations from George Washington University.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf proposed money for additional staffing at the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and he renewed his support for a package of pipeline reforms, in his annual budget released Tuesday.\n\nThe DEP would get $171.6 million from the general fund in Wolf's proposed budget. Other sources of funding for the agency would result in a total budget of $553.8 million.\n\nAfter decades of cuts to DEP under both Democratic and Republican administrations, it's the first time proposed spending from the general fund for environmental protection has risen above $165.6 million, the level it reached in 1994-1995, according to former DEP Secretary David Hess.\n\nThose cuts had to be backfilled by permit fee increases, Hess said. Those kinds of fee increases were unsustainable.\n\nHess said when he ran DEP from 2001-2003, funding for the agency did not depend so much on permit fees. About half of DEP's current budget relies on those fees, while just 20 percent comes from the general fund, he said. Federal funds make up the rest. In the early 2000s, permit fees, general fund dollars and federal funds each contributed about one-third.\n\nOne result of those cuts has been a 25 percent drop in DEP staff between 2003 and 2018.\n\nThe time has come for the people in the General Assembly to really have some serious conversations about this, Hess said. I see a lot of seeds in this budget that can grow into something that more completely meets our environmental funding obligations.\n\nThe budget calls for an additional $1 million for hiring new DEP staff to support the cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay. Both the state of Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation recently said they plan to sue the EPA and Pennsylvania for not doing enough to reduce agricultural run-off that contributes to bay pollution.\n\nAbout $47 million is restored from last year's cuts to community-based restoration projects that work on improving waterways that feed into the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nHazardous site cleanup, severance tax and more park rangers\n\nDEP's Bureau of Air Quality would also get a boost under Wolf's proposed plan, which asks for an additional $1.5 million for new staff. And DCNR would get an additional $2.5 million for new state park and forest rangers. A recent report revealed DCNR has a backlog of maintenance projects underfunded by $1 billion. In total, the new budget would provide 25 new staff members at DEP and 25 at DCNR.\n\nWolf is also calling on lawmakers to enact a $1 per ton increase in tipping fees for municipal waste landfill deposits as a way to support the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Fund. The fund is expected to become insolvent by the end of this year, the Wolf administration said, and the governor says increased tipping fees would generate an additional $22.6 million. That could help with any cleanup associated with emerging PFAS contamination.\n\nPennEnvironment executive director David Masur says it's a good sign the proposal includes increased funds.\n\nIt's hard to protect our environment if we don't have the environmental cops on the beat to enforce the laws and implement programs, Masur said. But it would be valuable if we had a long-term plan in order to make DEP and DCNR whole.\n\nThe budget includes a natural gas severance tax to fund Restore PA, a set of infrastructure projects. It's the sixth time Wolf has introduced a severance tax, which has been blocked by the Republican legislature.\n\nThe oil and gas industry opposes the effort, saying it has generated almost $2 billion in impact fee money since 2012.\n\nResponsible natural gas development has been good for the state economy, good for local economies and good for Pennsylvanians, said API-PA director Stephanie Catarino Wissman. This initiative doesn't restore Pennsylvania; it jeopardizes Pennsylvania's economy and the hundreds of thousands of jobs supported by natural gas production.\n\nOpposition to Restore PA comes from the political right as well as some on the left, who see it as a way to continue fossil fuel development.\n\nRestore PA is structured around a severance tax that lasts for another 20 years, said Karen Feridun of the Better Path Coalition. It's bad enough that we would be committed to 20 more years of fracking, (and) it includes incentives for the petrochemical business.\n\nRepublican lawmakers criticized spending in the overall budget. House Republican leaders said in a statement that they share many of the same goals, such as safe schools and jobs, that Wolf talked about.\n\nHowever, we believe that the best way to achieve these goals and turn them into a reality for all our citizens is not just with new government programs, more spending and additional debt, according to the statement.\n\nThese approaches to problem-solving oversimplify the core underlying issues driving the need for state government intervention and they ignore the significant investments that are already being made by taxpayers.\n\nPipeline safety legislation\n\nWolf used the budget to renew his call to close what he calls gaps in pipeline regulation that tie the hands of the executive and independent agencies.\n\nThis proposed rulemaking should enhance pipeline safety in Pennsylvania and move forward expeditiously, Wolf said in a statement. Significant improvements to hazardous liquid public utility safety standards can be accomplished regulatorily by building upon the federal pipeline safety laws.\n\nThe pipeline proposals include granting the Public Utility Commission authority to regulate locations of intrastate lines. No state agency has that authority. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversees interstate pipeline siting, but the lack of authority within the state has fueled opposition to lines like Energy Transfer's cross-state Mariner East project. Mariner East 1, 2 and 2x carry or will carry natural gas liquids from western Pa. to an export terminal near Philadelphia.\n\nA bi-partisan package of pipeline safety bills introduced last year by Sen. Tom Killion (R-Chester and Delaware), along with Sen. Andy Dinniman (D-Chester), failed to gain traction.\n\nI was heartened to hear the governor address the need for stronger laws to ensure pipeline public and environmental safety, Dinniman said in a statement. Many of the points he made echoed what I and others have been calling for over the past six years here in Chester County and Harrisburg.\n\nWolf urged lawmakers to enact measures that require emergency response plans for schools and childcare centers that are within 1,000 feet of a pipeline; five-day advanced notice to residents and municipalities of any pipeline construction; and PUC-generated setbacks for residential neighborhoods, education facilities and hospitals.\n\nFor natural gas pipelines, Wolf stressed the need for legislation addressing emergency response, including operators sharing emergency response and evacuation plans with local emergency managers; sharing emergency response plans with the PUC; and requiring emergency shut-off valves in high consequence, or highly populated, areas. He also wants DEP to have the ability to establish setbacks from wetlands and waterways.\n\nIn his address, Wolf talked about using funds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon cap-and-trade program among Northeast states aimed at addressing climate change, to help fund environmental protection.\n\nAnd by joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, we can raise hundreds of millions of dollars in auction proceeds to make our air cleaner and our transit systems stronger so that Pennsylvanians can get to the jobs businesses are creating, he said.\n\nWolf signed an executive order in October directing DEP to draft regulations on joining RGGI. The program puts a price on power plant carbon emissions, which are then traded at auction. Some lawmakers have opposed the effort.\n\nCorrection: The original version of this story incorrectly named the chair of the state Republican party and used comments made about last year's budget proposal.

House Democrats Introduce Anti-Corruption Bill As Symbolic 1st Act\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIt isn't your usual bill, the For The People Act introduced Friday by House Democrats. Also known as HR 1, symbolically their first legislation, it is a 571-page compendium of existing problems and proposed solutions in four political hot zones: voting, political money, redistricting and ethics.\n\nA pledge to pass the bill was a common theme among Democratic House candidates last year.\n\nWe heard loud and clear from the American people, Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., told reporters Friday. They feel left out and locked out from their own democracy.\n\nIf the bill ever becomes law, it's unlikely to happen this year. Republicans control the Senate, President Trump is in the White House, and the GOP vehemently opposes the basic approach of HR 1.\n\nThis is obviously a pretty radical expansion of the regulation of political speech, said David Keating, president of the conservative Institute for Free Speech. If this bill had become law now, he said, anti-Trump groups would find it very difficult to speak as effectively as they have over the past two years.\n\nSome of the bill's provisions push the envelope, including reaching into state law. To settle the controversy over redistricting, the bill would simply take away the power of state legislatures to draw congressional districts and have independent commissions do it instead. That way, presumably, the local politicians could no longer gerrymander the districts to help their party and cripple the opposition.\n\nBut some other proposals are not surprising. The bill includes an update of the Disclose Act, a pro-transparency measure that Democrats have introduced regularly since 2010 — not that Republicans are any more likely to embrace it than they were back then.\n\nHere's a rundown of the bill's major provisions:\n\nVoting and election laws\n\nVoter registration would be made easier. Citizens could register online or get registered automatically, via data from driver's licenses or other government sources. For federal elections, states would have to provide same-day registration and at least 15 days of early voting. Election Day would be a federal holiday.\n\nThe bill would crack down on efforts to take voters off the rolls or prevent them from casting ballots. Felons could regain their voting rights after finishing their sentences.\n\nFederal elections would require paper ballots to prevent computer tampering. State chief election officials couldn't get involved in federal campaigns.\n\nThe bill would declare an intent to revive core anti-discrimination provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that were effectively shut down by the Supreme Court six years ago. It would also state that failing to vote isn't grounds for taking away a person's voter registration.\n\nCampaign finance\n\nProvisions from the Disclose Act would expand the prohibition on foreign political money and mandate the disclosure of the big donors behind politically active 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations.\n\nDigital companies, like Facebook and Google, would have to set up public databases cataloging political ad purchase requests of $500 or more and create new measures to block ad buys by foreign nationals.\n\nPresidential inaugural committees would have to disclose expenditures, in addition to the existing requirement for donor disclosure. This is a response to reports of unexplained spending by Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nA new matching-fund program would support House candidates who agree to raise only small-dollar contributions. (Similar provisions for Senate candidates would have to come from the Senate.) The public financing system for presidential candidates, largely irrelevant since 2012, would be updated.\n\nThe bill would quash sidecar superPACs that support individual candidates.\n\nEthics
Satirist Randy Rainbow Uses Show Tunes And Pop Songs To Lampoon Trump\n\nI always considered song parody kind of cheap, the Emmy-nominated lyricist and performer says. But ... I've gotten [such a] response from others ... that I'm appreciating it as an art form.\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Song parodies about President Trump and members of his administration - that's what my guest Randy Rainbow has become famous for. He borrows the melodies of show tunes and pop hits and writes original lyrics. He took the melody of the Mary Poppins song Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and turned it into a Trump song titled Super-Callous Fragile-Egocentric Braggadocious.\n\nRainbow performs each song within a video that typically also includes him interviewing Trump, a trick Rainbow accomplishes by re-editing videos of Trump interviews and inserting himself asking the questions and reacting to the answers. These YouTube videos go viral, and that's a tribute to Rainbow's clever lyrics, his great singing voice and hilarious reaction shots.\n\nYesterday, right after we recorded our interview, his YouTube series of satirical songs was nominated for an Emmy for outstanding short-form variety series. Let's start with one of his songs that borrows the melody from My Favorite Things. This is Trump's Favorite Things!, recorded last December when special counsel Robert Mueller was about to file memos about Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. This starts with Randy Rainbow interviewing President Trump.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, TRUMP'S FAVORITE THINGS!)\n\nRANDY RAINBOW: Thank you so much for joining me, Mr. President. I hope you have been enjoying the holiday season so far.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I will tell you I am extremely upbeat. The White House is running like a...\n\nRAINBOW: Defenseless young child being tear-gassed at the Mexican border.\n\nTRUMP: ...Well-oiled machine.\n\nRAINBOW: Oh, mine was just an expression.\n\nTRUMP: It's doing really well. I have great people.\n\nRAINBOW: Speaking of criminals, this is a very big week for the Russia investigation.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THUNDER)\n\nRAINBOW: Memos about Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, three high-profile defendants, are scheduled to be filed by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THUNDER)\n\nTRUMP: It's a scam. There was no collusion whatsoever, and the whole thing is a scam.\n\nRAINBOW: Really? Because word on the street is that you're getting pretty scared. Well, when anything bothers me or my entire family is about to be charged with treason, I try to think of nice things. I mean, there are so many things that make you happy.\n\nTRUMP: And there are certain things that I don't like.\n\nRAINBOW: Oh, let me think - raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, destroying the First Amendment, white nationalists.\n\nTRUMP: Is that enough?\n\nRAINBOW: Brutal dictators and cold-hearted liars (singing) tyrants and traitors and climate deniers, $5 spray tans with under-eye rings - these are a few of your favorite things. Burying tax returns after you file them, tear-gassing migrants for seeking asylum, big fat a** buckets of fried chicken wings - these are a few of your favorite things.\n\nTRUMP: I did nothing wrong.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Blue-collar workers all backwoods and beefy, giant hamburgers with extra covfefe, siding with Saudi Arabian kings - these are a few of your favorite things. When friends flip, when your day sucks and your hair looks bad, like right now, just blame all the victims and praise all the schmucks, and then you won't feel so sad.\n\nTRUMP: How long has this witch hunt gone on? It's gone on for what?\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) KGB play dates and absolute power, porn stars and playmates who charge by the hour, puppets at Fox News who dance on his strings - these are a few of his favorite things.\n\nTRUMP: I did nothing wrong.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Long-winded tweets with no spell check corrections...\n\nGROSS: Randy Rainbow, welcome to FRESH AIR. I think you are so funny and so much fun to watch. Thank you for being on our show.\n\nRAINBOW: Thank you. It's my honor to be with you.\n\nGROSS: So you do your videos in your home alone. You direct yourself. How many - I love your reaction shots because you have this, like, incredibly expressive face and really big eyes. And your reaction shots to what, you know, Trump is saying are always, like, hilarious. How do you direct yourself, and how many takes do you do?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, I've kind of worked it down to about four or five takes because I could stand there all day. And, you know, as a director, I'm quite hard on myself. The reaction shots are something that I've learned from my audience is more valuable than I even knew. I think that I did inherit a very expressive face from my mother and my grandmother. And yeah sometimes just a look to the camera or a slow burn says much more than even, you know, a song.\n\nGROSS: And it sounds like - you know, so you do this, like, alone in your apartment.\n\nRAINBOW: It's a very lonely existence, Terry.\n\nGROSS: I feel really sorry for you (laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: Thank you for inviting me out of my home. It doesn't happen often.\n\nGROSS: But it sounds like when you were a kid, you did similar stuff. You spent a lot of time alone in your bedroom making videos. What kind of videos did you make?\n\nRAINBOW: Oh, God. They were real classics, real gems.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: I mean, I - you know, I would have, like, my little figurines, my toy soldiers and things - well, I say soldiers, but, of course, I mean Barbies.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: And I would do, you know, sort of horrible DIY kind of stop motion animation. It was really bad. And then I - you know, I had a bunch of friends. I grew up doing theater. I would go to theater camp. And so I found a lot of like-minded young kids who were into performance. And we would get together and make videos. And that's kind of how I got started in the sketch comedy world. And that's what ignited my interest there.\n\nGROSS: So we'll get back to theater camp.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: But another question about your videos...\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: You have an orchestra behind you when you're singing in your videos. Are those kind of, like, karaoke versions of the show tunes?\n\nRAINBOW: They are, yes. They're - they are ripped karaoke versions that I play with and sort of fine-tune and adjust to be, you know, unique to my videos.\n\nGROSS: And are you going to be sued by any of the estates (laughter)...\n\nRAINBOW: Well, now that...\n\nGROSS: ...Whose composers' work you're using?\n\nRAINBOW: Can we go to the next question? No, I do have a very fancy lawyer now, and what I do falls pretty safely under fair use, you know, with...\n\nGROSS: Oh, good.\n\nRAINBOW: ...Parody and all of that.\n\nGROSS: Good. Please do not deny us these...\n\nRAINBOW: So far, so good.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. OK.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: We'll see after this interview airs. Thanks a lot.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Right. Well, I don't think Sondheim's going to be suing you...\n\nRAINBOW: No, thankfully.\n\nGROSS: ...'Cause he's a fan of your work. Yeah.\n\nRAINBOW: Can you believe it? You mentioned Sondheim. But I have, I'm happy to say, heard from most of the composers that I have parodied - everyone from Sondheim to Steven Schwartz to Andrew Lloyd Webber. So everyone is pretty much on board. So I have that in my corner, too.\n\nGROSS: That's great that the songwriters really love your work.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: So if you're just joining us, my guest is Randy Rainbow, who does song parodies - like, political ones - using Trump within the parodies and then doing songs about Trump. So this next song we're going to hear is He's In Love (And We're All Gonna Die), sung for - sung to the melody of I'm In Love With A Wonderful Guy from South Pacific.\n\nRAINBOW: That's right.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. This starts with you interviewing President Trump - again, taking Trump answers and inserting your own questions. And it starts with a little, like, take off of The Bachelor. So let's hear Randy Rainbow, He's In Love (And We're All Gonna Die).\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, HE'S IN LOVE (AND WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE))\n\nRAINBOW: I'm here now with the latest castoff from The Bachelor Hanoi, fresh off his second meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nI don't see a rose. Does that mean no denuclearization?\n\nTRUMP: We didn't sign anything today. It didn't quite work out.\n\nRAINBOW: Did you guys do it?\n\nTRUMP: I just don't think maybe either of us were ready.\n\nRAINBOW: So does that mean we can expect a third date?\n\nTRUMP: We'll see what happens. Again, the relationship is very good. He likes me. I like him. Some people say, oh, you shouldn't like him. I said, why shouldn't I like him?\n\nRAINBOW: Maybe because he's a deranged dictator who starves his people and executes members of his own family. But you know, we all have - my boyfriend doesn't put down the toilet seat, so - men.\n\nTRUMP: Well, no. I just think he's - first of all, he's a character.\n\nRAINBOW: What's your response to critics who accuse you of consistently siding with foreign adversaries over your own intelligence officials?\n\nTRUMP: Why shouldn't I like him? I like him, get along great.\n\nRAINBOW: And what do you say to those who worry that your naivete and reckless behavior are jeopardizing national security and putting us all in grave danger?\n\nTRUMP: We'll see what happens. Again, the relationship is very good.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) You would think he'd obey when his own intel agencies tell him to watch out for Putin and Kim.\n\nTRUMP: He's a real personality, and he's very smart. He's sharp as you can be, and he's a real leader.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) But he's too egocentric to do what those men think is best for the country instead of for him.\n\nTRUMP: He likes me. I like him. Some people say, oh, you shouldn't like him. I said, why shouldn't I like him?\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Yet he's as obedient as a tiny pup for any louse on a nuclear list.\n\nTRUMP: Look. Bottom line - I think he wants to get something done.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) 'Cause when his own daddy issues start flaring up, there's not a psychopath he can resist.\n\nTRUMP: He's sharp as you can be, and he's a real leader.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) So unabashedly he reveals...\n\nTRUMP: And he's very smart.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) ...Those sad, lovely feelings he feels. He gets horny for absolute power. Treacherous goons put a gleam in his eye. His taste in men stinks. Now he says that he thinks he's in love, and we're all going to die. He goes mad for a mad, crazy tyrant who rapes and pillages, murders and lies - merely faux pas he lets slide just because he's in love with these wonderful guys. Of a snitch under oath, on a witch hunt or anyone who disagrees - he's a hater. But ruthless dictators sure make him go weak in the knees. He goes cuckoo...\n\nGROSS: That's Randy Rainbow - one of his many political song parodies to show tunes and pop songs.\n\nHave you learned a lot about writing lyrics from doing this? What I mean is, like, you're patterning your lyrics on some of the best lyricists who've ever written for the stage. And you're frequently following their rhyme schemes, which are sometimes pretty complicated, depending on whose work you're doing. But have you learned a lot from using the greatest lyricists' work as your template to write your own lyrics?\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah, absolutely. I have, and I've pushed myself to do so because I always considered song parody kind of cheap. And I've always been - part of me - a little embarrassed that I do it and that I'm, you know, kind of ripping off other people's work. But it's only now that I'm - that I've been doing it - and then I've gotten response from others, including the actual artists who originated the work, that I'm appreciating it as an art form. But I think that I've pushed myself because I think that if I'm not going to write the original music to go with the lyrics, I'd better step it up and bring something special and strong to the table.\n\nGROSS: So how did you match Trump's second meeting with Kim Jong Un with I'm In Love With A Wonderful Guy? How did those two things come together in your mind?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, that was one, I think - I think I have - I have a running list that I sort of refer to, and that was a song that I wanted to do for a while. So I had just been waiting for the right opportunity to do it and - you know, just a classic love song. So I figured it was right for him and Kim.\n\nGROSS: Kim's in love with him. He's in love with him.\n\nRAINBOW: Kim's in love with him. There you go.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) So who are some of the lyricists you've come to really appreciate?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, Sondheim has always been a god to me. He's really the main one. But I appreciate - I mean, Lin-Manuel Miranda is fabulous.\n\nGROSS: So I know Sondheim, one of your favorite lyricists, loves puzzles. But you loved puzzles, too, as a kid, right?\n\nRAINBOW: I did have a thing for mazes. When I was a kid, I remember drawing little mazes constantly and puzzles. I loved that. And I remember - to sort of tie it together, I - when I started listening to Sondheim's music, I always envisioned - I always pictured a puzzle 'cause that's sort of how his lyric writing is. It's, you know, very carefully and masterfully putting a puzzle together. And so when I got to know him and was invited to his home, and I saw that he's a collector of puzzles, it was quite a full circle moment.\n\nGROSS: How did you get to know Sondheim?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, I've been friends with his now-husband for many years. And so I was first introduced to him about 10 years ago when I was working with him - with Jeff, who's now working with me on my tour. So that's how he first came into my life. And since then, he's become something of a mentor and a great support.\n\nGROSS: Does he ever give you advice on lyrics?\n\nRAINBOW: He knows better than that, Terry. No, he's...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) He knows who the master is.\n\nRAINBOW: He does. He's very generous. He's extremely generous. And he will compliment me all the time and say, your lyrics are so strong and, you know, how do you do it? - to which I say, Steve, you know, you wouldn't get it.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: I have a gift - not about to explain it to you.\n\nGROSS: Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Randy Rainbow, and he does really funny song parodies about, typically, President Trump or, sometimes, Mike Pence. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Randy Rainbow. And he writes and records song parodies, usually taking Broadway melodies and setting his own satirical lyrics to them. Typically, the songs are about President Trump or politics. And he posts them on YouTube; they get a gazillion views. And in August, he's going to start touring again with his show of his songs.\n\nSo, you know, you've mentioned that a lot of songwriters like your work. I know a lot of Broadway people love your work. What about President Trump and Vice President Pence? Have they ever commented...\n\nRAINBOW: They're big fans.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) They're big fans, I'm sure.\n\nRAINBOW: We're all having brunch next Sunday.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And they brought pink eyeglasses in honor of your - as a tribute to you.\n\nRAINBOW: Absolutely. You know.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nRAINBOW: I haven't heard from anyone in the administration. You know, I've heard through the grapevine that people in the administration are fans, but no one has directly reached out to me. I'm trying every day to, you know, at least be blocked by him on Twitter, but there has been no connection.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Haven't gotten that far yet?\n\nRAINBOW: No, but I'm working on it.\n\nGROSS: OK. So let's hear another song, and this is to the tune of Sixteen Going On Seventeen from The Sound Of Music. And the song is about President Trump's endorsement of Roy Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. And this is when Moore was running for the Senate against Democrat Doug Jones. And Trump endorsed Moore in spite of the fact that several women had come forward and accused Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were underage girls.\n\nSo the song is about those girls, and it starts off with a verse about the girl who became his wife. And the setup is that Randy Rainbow is interviewing Kellyanne Conway, who is defending Trump's endorsement of Moore. So it starts - we're going to start by hearing Kellyanne.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: So the president has said the allegations are troubling. They're also 40 years old. Nobody came forward before. The guy's been on the ballot many times. Doug Jones is a liberal Democrat, the president has said, and he doesn't want a liberal Democrat representing Alabama in the United States Senate.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) You wait, Kellyanne, with your ashy knees. It's time that you surrender. You are backing a man who admits that he's a bona fide sex offender.\n\nCONWAY: OK, but wait - did we...\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Offender.\n\nCONWAY: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Excuse me. Excuse me.\n\nRAINBOW: In Roy Moore's memoir, I Like Big Butts, he recounts, romantically, the first time he laid eyes on his wife Kayla, writing, quote, I attended a dance recital and remember one of the special dances performed by a young woman whose first and last names began with the letter K. I always remembered her initials, K.K., because they were just one K short of being awesome. I'm paraphrasing that last part.\n\nCONWAY: Go ahead.\n\nRAINBOW: Well, there's just one troubling part about that timeline, and it's that...\n\nCONWAY: Hurry - I have a meeting.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) She was 16, going on 17; Roy Moore was 32. Flagrantly lusting - he's just disgusting, and frankly, so are you. She was 17, going on 18, when she went out with Moore. Think it's a smear? Look - he signed her yearbook when he was 34. Here comes Steve Bannon, Trump and Pence, McConnell, Mike and Ben, fashioning false equivalence, protecting gross old men.\n\nThat's so funny. What a surprise.\n\n(Singing) He wants a Republican candidate even though he may be criminal, deplorable, immoral, illegitimate - that's 'cause so is he.\n\nTRUMP: Get out and vote for Roy Moore.\n\nGROSS: That's Randy Rainbow. And if you want to see more of his videos, they're all on YouTube. And that was recorded December 11, 2017. And if you think that that song is hopelessly out of date because Roy Moore lost, consider that in June, Roy Moore announced he intends on running again for the Senate. So Sixteen Going On Seventeen seems like an obvious song choice to use for the Roy Moore story. But how did you make that connection in your mind? It seems obvious after somebody makes the connection for you, but how did you think of using that melody?\n\nRAINBOW: You know what? I think that one was a request. Now I have this nice following, so sometimes I will take requests from my fans online, and I think that was one of them.\n\nGROSS: Have you heard from Roy Moore?\n\nRAINBOW: No, surprisingly.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, a bit surprising.\n\nRAINBOW: Hasn't been to one of my meet-and-greets.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nMy guest is Randy Rainbow. Yesterday, he was nominated for an Emmy for his YouTube series of videos featuring him performing his satirical songs about President Trump and his administration. We'll talk more after a break, and we'll listen back to my 2011 interview with former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. He died yesterday at the age of 99. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TROTTER TRIO'S I'M STILL HERE)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Randy Rainbow. He writes and performs song parodies about President Trump and his administration. Rainbow uses the melodies of show tunes and pop hits and writes original lyrics. His YouTube videos were just nominated for an Emmy for outstanding short-form variety series.\n\nSo you were in, like, your mid-30s when people started to really know you. Did you think, like, it wasn't going to happen; that you weren't going to have the career you wanted; that you'd be doing, like, other jobs, you know, and then, you know, moonlighting with things that you wanted to do?\n\nRAINBOW: I think other people probably thought that about me, but I have some kind of weird inner quality that - it's just a confidence that I have. I'm very - I'm not very sure of anything in my life, but there's always been something in me that has known that I'm going to get where I'm going, one way or the other. So it really was never a concern to me. I always knew if I just stuck to my guns and did what I wanted to do and put out work that I thought was good and funny and entertaining, it would work out.\n\nGROSS: You say you had this, like, confidence. But at the same time, based on what I read, you didn't have that confidence when you were auditioning at cattle calls for Broadway shows.\n\nRAINBOW: No, I've never been good at auditions. That's why this whole Internet thing we've got going has been such a blessing for me. And the fact that I've been able to utilize it to get myself out there is really something I'm really grateful for because it's given me the opportunity to produce things, you know, for myself in the way that I want to present myself to the world and then put them out there. I don't know if I didn't have that ability that things would've taken off as they did.\n\nGROSS: Sensibility-wise, you are, like, the opposite of Donald Trump. But in spite of being so different from Trump, you've said that Trump reminds you of your father.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah, Trump is absolutely a carbon copy of my father. And...\n\nGROSS: How?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, just behaviorally and - so much so that my father, who's no longer with us - he actually died shortly after Trump's election - but his campaign was going on, you know, at the end of his life. And even he said that he couldn't watch Trump on TV because it reminded him so much of himself. So these conversations that the world is now having about Trump's behavior are conversations that were had within my family about my dad constantly. So I think that's kind of why I really have his number.\n\nGROSS: So what were the similarities?\n\nRAINBOW: Just that kind of phony, you know, bravado. And there's just, like, a - you know, I hate to put down any group of people, but there's just a generation of, like, New York guy that - he just came from that stock. And it was just - there was nothing genuine, nothing introspective. It was just textbook narcissism. And I think there are - there's a large group of men who are like that.\n\nGROSS: So how did that affect you growing up?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, it was hard. I mean, it was - it made things very uncomfortable in my home and - you know, which is why I was locked in my room, making videos with my Barbie dolls. It was not a pleasant experience. It was not a pleasant environment because it really just - he was the nucleus, and it just revolved around this man who was really sick.\n\nGROSS: Was he ever in therapy?\n\nRAINBOW: No, I don't believe so. No. He had no interest. I don't think - again, he really had no idea that there was anything wrong with him. It was everybody else.\n\nGROSS: Was there this feeling in the house that unless your father was pleased that there would be, like, a dark cloud hanging over the family?\n\nRAINBOW: Absolutely. Yeah. And it was a full-time job to sort of, you know, try to brush the cloud away. And you know, that's why I was really happy at 21 to leave the house. And that's kind of where - when my life really began and I kind of came out of my shell.\n\nGROSS: How - what was his reaction to you being gay?\n\nRAINBOW: He was - you know, for as negative a force he was in my life, he was also - he was not the worst. He was very tolerant and did not mind at all that I was gay. He also claims to have had no idea growing up, so that shows you sort of how, you know, trapped in his own brain he was. He had - you know, it was a total shock to him when I came out, which was kind of absurd.\n\nGROSS: But your mother said she always knew. She was quoted in the...\n\nRAINBOW: Well, she may have made this guy.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Yeah, 'cause that's the way it works.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: So she was quoted in The Washington Post as saying she knew that you were gay when you were 3.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah. And I guess, you know...\n\nGROSS: I'll quote.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: She says, I knew he was gay by the time he was 3. He was constantly putting on shows and making the girls be the prince. He was always Snow White.\n\nRAINBOW: (Laughter) It's true. We would do major productions in my backyard, and I was really a nightmare to work with as a director. And yeah, there was a lot of gender swapping.\n\nGROSS: Do you think that if that was happening today, your mother would think, gee, is my child trans? Should I...\n\nRAINBOW: I often think of that, and I don't know. She very well might. And I think of that because I was an effeminate kid and - but I don't necessarily think - you know, I know I'm not trans. I don't feel - I don't think I ever felt that I was trapped in the wrong body. But yeah, I think that the lines are a little blurred now, and people are still kind of figuring those things out. I hear directly from parents all the time who have those questions.\n\nGROSS: So what were the first musicals your mother took you to?\n\nRAINBOW: The first musicals - well, I have this thing with Cats, no shade to Andrew Lloyd Webber. But you know, back to Sondheim - I remember being in New York and seeing the commercial for Into The Woods on TV, and that was all I wanted to see. It's all I cared about. But much to my chagrin, the first show they took me to was Cats.\n\nAnd so I remember having a - you know, a temper tantrum walking under the marquee for Into The Woods. But she would put - my mother put me to bed - I mean, talking about making me gay - I joke, but only half. She would put me to sleep with the cast recordings to Oklahoma and The Music Man. And I think that contributed a lot to my musicality and my love for musical theater, for sure.\n\nGROSS: You've done a parody of Trouble In River City from The Music Man.\n\nRAINBOW: Yes, I open my live show with it now, actually.\n\nGROSS: Oh, do you really?\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Oh. Do you want to do some of the patter for us?\n\nRAINBOW: Sure.\n\nI said, you got trouble, my friends. Right here - you got trouble right here in America. Sure, I'm a liberal and a gay, I'm mighty proud to say. Well, I'm kind of scared to say it. I admit that when Trump threw his name in the race, I assumed he was joking. You know how he jokes about stuff with his cool swag and his orange face. And then he started showing up and winning in the polls, like, a lot. And I was like, oh bleep.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Yeah.\n\nRAINBOW: It's better with the band, Terry.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Yeah.\n\nRAINBOW: You'll have to come see a live show.\n\nGROSS: No, no that is great. Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Randy Rainbow. And he does really funny song parodies about President Trump. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Randy Rainbow. He writes and performs satirical songs about President Trump and his administration. Rainbow writes original lyrics set to the melodies of show tunes and pop hits.\n\nYou always wanted to get back to New York and try Broadway. So when you got to New York when you were in your 20s, what did you audition for, and what were those auditions like?\n\nRAINBOW: I came to New York, and I put the whole thing on hold because I was a terrified 21-year-old and more, like, you know, 15 because I just had not at all grown up. I don't know what gave me the courage to even come here and live on my own, but I just knew this is where I belong. But I did not go right into the musical theater audition thing. I instead worked in a lot of offices and restaurants and things like that.\n\nGROSS: Did any of the, like, food restaurant bar kind of jobs you have have a theatrical aspect to it, like a piano bar or anything like that?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, the first restaurant I worked in was Hooters.\n\nGROSS: OK, that's - you don't have what you - it typically takes to work there.\n\nRAINBOW: Well, that's very rude of you to say.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: But no, I - when I first moved to New York, my dear friend from childhood was working at Hooters as a waitress and said the manager here is a gay guy. And if you come in, he'll probably give you a job. So I worked first at Hooters as a host. So you can imagine the look of dismay on the gentlemen's faces when they would come in after a hard day's work and I'd be standing there with my clipboard. So that was the first thing.\n\nBut that led to my working at the restaurant in Chelsea, which eventually led because of a friend who worked there then started working at a production office - a Broadway production office where I became a receptionist.\n\nGROSS: So...\n\nRAINBOW: And that was kind of where I got my foot back in show business a little bit. They were working on shows at the time like Hairspray and the revival of Sweeney Todd with Patti Lupone.\n\nGROSS: Oh.\n\nRAINBOW: So for me it was heaven because I was sitting behind the desk, and at any given moment, Patti Lupone would call, or Elaine Stritch would walk through the front door. And I couldn't get over my life.\n\nGROSS: Did you talk with them?\n\nRAINBOW: A little bit. I was so scared out of my wits that, you know, not much came out. But yeah, I had some interactions.\n\nGROSS: Do you know Patti Lupone better now?\n\nRAINBOW: Do I know her better? No, I don't. But I did do - before Trump came along and I was doing those more nonpolitical videos, I did a series of videos where I would lip sync to Patti Lupone's autobiography...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: ...You know, the audiobook of it.\n\nGROSS: That's hilarious, yeah.\n\nRAINBOW: And that was actually a - fairly a - at least among the gay and Broadway communities was kind of a fairly successful series for me. And I understand that she was a fan of that. I hope so.\n\nGROSS: How did you think of doing that?\n\nRAINBOW: I don't know (laughter). I think I was just drunk one night and listening to her. Have you heard her autobiography, the audio...\n\nGROSS: No.\n\nRAINBOW: ...Book version?\n\nGROSS: No, I haven't.\n\nRAINBOW: I highly recommend it. It's eight years of Patti Lupone just letting everyone have it and just, you know - just - it just - it moved me to sort of act it out and add some drama to it and some visuals.\n\nGROSS: Let's close with a Sondheim melody that you used for a parody. This is The Mueller Blues, and this was recorded in March 28, 2019. And it's to the melody of The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues from Stephen Sondheim's show Follies. So talk about what you're doing in this song.\n\nRAINBOW: Well, this for me was the perfect song to kind of pinpoint the emotions that everyone was feeling that week because the Mueller report had come out, but it hadn't really. And people were happy, and they were not. And they were frustrated. It was just - everyone was sort of running this gamut of emotions. And so my mind immediately went to this song, which kind of encapsulates that feeling of being all over the place.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. And you know, he's almost having, like, a little nervous breakdown...\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...In Follies...\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah, it's very breakdown-y.\n\nGROSS: ...When he sings this, yeah. So this was recorded right after the Mueller report was released. And right now I think you're waiting for Robert Mueller to testify so that you can write a Robert Mueller testifying parody.\n\nRAINBOW: I am. I've been waiting for some time now. They keep pushing it. Yeah, I'm toying with a few ideas, but I don't think I'll really know which direction I'll take until I see the testimony.\n\nGROSS: Well, while we're waiting for you to write and then post it on YouTube, let's hear your song from March of this year, The Mueller Blues. Randy Rainbow, it's just been great to talk with you. Thank you so much, and please keep doing what you're doing and do other things, too, 'cause I look forward to seeing you in a Broadway show or on TV.\n\nRAINBOW: Oh, wow - from your mouth. Thank you, Terry. It's been a pleasure to talk to you.\n\nGROSS: And to you. And I should say that this song starts with you being interviewed, so to speak, by Wolf Blitzer of CNN about the results of Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign coordination with the Russians. And then you start singing about the results of the investigation.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, THE MUELLER BLUES)\n\nWOLF BLITZER: According to the special counsel, Robert Mueller, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government. Are you ready to accept that conclusion from Robert Mueller?\n\nRAINBOW: A hundred percent, Wolf. This is only good news for the country, and I am here today to say that I am ready to leave this behind us and move on without some big song and dance. Excuse me.\n\n(Singing) O-M-G. He's reached a conclusion. Holy [expletive]. I'm sorry to curse, b****. Thankfully, there's been no collusion. So why don't I feel better yet? In fact, I feel worse.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: The Mueller report now turned in; Robert Mueller's work is over.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) It's lasted 22 months. It's no wonder we're stressed. I wish we could just let it go. The things that we learned are not what we guessed. And as for the rest, we may never know.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: How much, if anything, will America get to see?\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) I've got those, yay, it's finally over - wait; it's only just beginning blues. Those damn you, Robert Mueller - I mean, thank you for your service feelings. Those give me that report; now throw this trash in the bin. Congratulations, Hannity. But wait. What'd you win? Those what about obstruction? Here comes Rudy Giuliani feelings. Those is it really over? Can we still indict Ivanka? - blues.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Robert Mueller has delivered his report, but the political fight over it is just beginning.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Repeatedly, he stated...\n\nTRUMP: No collusion.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) He said - I guess that he was right.\n\nTRUMP: Are there any Russians here tonight?\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Is he exonerated?\n\nTRUMP: Total exoneration.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Technically, not quite.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Mueller's stopping short of exonerating the president.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) His comments were off-color.\n\nTRUMP: And we kicked their a**.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) He'd constantly deny...\n\nTRUMP: No collusion. No collusion. No collusion. No collusion.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) ...And slander Mr. Mueller.\n\nTRUMP: Look. The entire thing has been a witch hunt.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Now, look who's his favorite guy. I've got those, Nancy, go and get him. Never mind, girl, I'm exhausted blues, Mueller blues. Those, what the hell is Comey doing standing in a forest? - feelings. Host, bartender, we're going to need to refill my cup. And since there's no collusion, could you make something up? And why does Devin's cow have way more followers than I do? - feelings. Those, is it over? What just happened? Can't we just arrest Ivanka? Where's the rest? I got to see it. Give it to me. I don't want it. Yes. No. Black. White. Red. Blue. Left. Right. Thank you. Go away now. Please don't leave me, Robert Mueller, blues.\n\nTRUMP: No collusion.\n\nRAINBOW: Impeach.\n\nGROSS: That's Randy Rainbow's song The Robert Mueller Blues. You can hear more of his songs on his website. His videos were just nominated for an Emmy in the category outstanding short form variety series. He'll resume his national performing tour next month.\n\nComing up, we'll listen back to my interview with former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. He died yesterday.

Senate Can't Vote On $15 Minimum Wage, Parliamentarian Rules\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nUpdated at 9:27 p.m. ET\n\nSenate Democrats will not be forced to confront an internal political battle over increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 following a decision by the primary keeper of Senate rules.\n\nThe Senate parliamentarian ruled that a plan to gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 does not fit the complicated rules that govern budget bills in the Senate. House Democrats included the measure in a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill that is expected to be the first major legislative act for President Biden.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he is disappointed in the decision and pledged to pursue other legislation to increase the minimum wage.\n\nWe are not going to give up the fight to raise the minimum wage to $15 to help millions of struggling American workers and their families, Schumer said in a statement. The American people deserve it, and we are committed to making it a reality.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, praised the ruling, saying it was the appropriate path to protect the rules of the Senate.\n\nThe decision is a disappointment for progressives but relieves immediate pressure on Democratic Party leaders who are attempting to rally support for the overall bill despite concerns from at least two Democrats who say $15 is too high.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said President Biden, who proposed the $15 minimum wage as part of his American Recue Plan, is disappointed but that he urges Congress to move quickly to pass the relief. It also said he will work with leaders in Congress to determine the best path forward.\n\nSens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., are the only Democrats who have publicly opposed the idea, but many others have been selectively silent on the issue.\n\nDemocrats were bracing for the measure to be removed from the bill, and the path to an increase is much more difficult in the Senate, where most legislation needs 60 votes to avoid a filibuster. Senate Republicans are almost uniformly opposed to the plan, and a stand-alone bill to increase the minimum wage, introduced by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has 37 co-sponsors, meaning a number of Democrats may not back the idea.\n\nIn a statement, Sanders said that in the coming days he will be working with my colleagues in the Senate to move forward with an amendment to take tax deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don't pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide small businesses with the incentives they need to raise wages.\n\nThat amendment must be included in this reconciliation bill, he continued.\n\nNo Republicans are expected to vote for the massive spending package, meaning there will need to be unanimous support among Democrats to advance Biden's first major legislative priority.
Apple Tax Ruling Presents Broader Implications For U.S. Companies\n\nNPR's Ari Shapiro talks to Edward Kleinbard, professor of business and law at the University of Southern California, about the implications of the Apple tax ruling for U.S. companies in Europe.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nHere in the U.S., the negative response to the commission's Apple ruling went beyond the Treasury Department. Republicans and Democrats in Congress condemned it, calling the decision a money grab. All this comes after Apple has been criticized in the last few years for avoiding taxes here in the States by setting up subsidiaries in Ireland. To understand this, I spoke with Edward Kleinbard, a professor of law and business at USC.\n\nEDWARD KLEINBARD: Logically the United States should be troubled by the low tax rate in Ireland, and it should be not at all troubled by the commission's finding that Ireland entered into a one-off negotiated deal to subsidize Apple.\n\nSHAPIRO: But (laughter)...\n\nKLEINBARD: But the politics being what they are, it's natural for politicians to get a little confused and to think that those guys are ganging up on our guys. There's also a sense that, you know - who are these snail eaters to tell us what to do?\n\nSHAPIRO: Which is so funny because American political leaders have also criticized these companies for trying to dodge taxes by being located in countries like Ireland in the first place.\n\nKLEINBARD: Exactly. But there is one other thing going on, which is that the U.S. Treasury Department is smarter than this. The U.S. Treasury Department put out a large policy paper last week in which it came to the defense of Apple, and in part it's because of just political - the same kind of political considerations. But it's also because there's a tax agenda underneath the surface.\n\nU.S. companies have been so successful at this stateless income game mostly at the expense of Europe that they have well over $2 trillion in super low-taxed foreign earnings that have not been taxed in the United States, essentially taxed nowhere in the world.\n\nAnd what the United States is playing for is that when it comes time for corporate tax reform, there will be a one-time tax charge on all of those offshore earnings as part of the transition to the new system. Let's call it 10 percent. Well, 10 percent of $2 trillion is $200 billion of free tax revenue.\n\nSHAPIRO: Oh, so if this is revenue that has been taxed in Europe according to this court ruling, then it is revenue that the U.S. cannot someday in the future tax once this reform gets implemented.\n\nKLEINBARD: Essentially That's exactly right.\n\nSHAPIRO: Is there any chance of this bringing business back to the United States?\n\nKLEINBARD: No (laughter). You know, Apple is a really interesting example of this. Today in its press conferences and two years ago in Tim Cook's testimony before the Senate - tried to make the point that the real brains of the operation of Apple, the real drivers of its profitability are its software engineers in Cupertino. Well, if that were true...\n\nSHAPIRO: Then they should be taxed at California tax rates.\n\nKLEINBARD: Well, they should be taxed today, exactly, on the current basis by the United States. Apple is trying to have it both ways. On the one hand, they want to tell Europe that profits are really because of the genius of the American operations, and they want to tell the United States that the operations are really located outside the United States.\n\nThe pincer movement is forcing the essential incompatibility of these different stories to the fore. But this is not about real jobs. This is about shifting of profits through paper transactions.\n\nSHAPIRO: Edward Kleinbard, professor of business and law at USC, thanks very much.\n\nKLEINBARD: Thank you, Sir.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

In Diabetes Fight, Lifestyle Changes Prove Hard To Come By In Mexico\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR\n\nLet's say you'd like to go for a run in Mexico City.\n\nDr. Tonatiuh Barrientos, an epidemiologist with Mexico's National Institute of Public Health, thinks that's a good idea — in theory. An expert on diabetes, he'd like to see more people in the Mexican capital get out and exercise to combat the disease.\n\nBut as a runner himself, he knows that Mexico City isn't an easy place to jog. In a metropolis of 22 million, there are only a handful of parks where people can run.\n\nLook, this is a fairly crowded street. It's a pretty noisy street. It's polluted, Barrientos says walking through the Tlalpan neighborhood that lies between his office and his home. Now just imagine trying to convince yourself to get out there and run.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR\n\nIt's a tough sell. I mean the only place for you to really run is on the sidewalk. You can't run on the street because you'll probably get run over, he says.\n\nThe sidewalk is an uneven mix of broken cement slabs and cobblestones. Street vendors have set up little tables and carts to sell everything from electrical supplies to fried pork cracklings.\n\nThere are so many people that it's hard to even walk at a fast clip.\n\nAnd if you do manage to find a stretch of sidewalk, the elevation in Mexico City combined with the smog and the chances of getting mugged make running a hard thing to get excited about.\n\nThere are a lot of obstacles, Barrientos says as he dodges his way past low-hanging awnings. And you need to deal with that if you wanted to try to run here.\n\nProfessionally, Barrientos has tracked the slow, steady rise in Type 2 diabetes in Mexico. Roughly 14 million Mexicans are now living with diabetes — nearly triple the number who had the disease in 1990.\n\nBarrientos says for too long health officials considered it the responsibility of patients to change their diet and exercise routines. They either did it or didn't. He says now it's become clear that addressing one of Mexico's biggest health crises requires changes at a much higher level and includes lobbying for healthier public spaces where people can easily get out and exercise.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR\n\nHow do we change the world so that making healthy decisions is a lot easier than it is right now? he asks.\n\nDiabetes has mushroomed as Mexicans' lifestyles have changed dramatically over the last 40 years. Several generations ago diabetes was almost unheard of in Mexico. Now it's the leading cause of death, according to the World Health Organization. Mexicans with indigenous ancestry have a genetic predisposition for the condition that makes them even more likely to develop it than Caucasians. But a key driver of Type 2 diabetes in Mexico — and globally — is still a person's diet.\n\nBarrientos says current projections show that by 2030, 17 percent of all Mexican adults will have diabetes.\n\nAnd that of course opens a lot of questions about sustainability, he says. Can you really sustain a public health system with 17 percent of your population being diabetic? Especially if you are not prepared to control that diabetes.\n\nSome epidemiologists predict that by 2050, half the adults in the country could suffer from diabetes in their lifetime.\n\nType 2 diabetes can be reversed with weight-loss surgery in some cases. Uncontrolled, the metabolic disorder can have grave health consequences. It can lead to blindness, nerve damage, kidney failure and, in some cases, foot amputations.\n\nBarrientos and others are now saying the focus of diabetes prevention in Mexico needs to shift away from shaming individuals to looking at new government policies to tackle this mounting health crisis.\n\nWith tobacco we faced the same thing for many, many years. We were trying to encourage people to quit: Because if you don't quit you're going to die! he says. The only time that we started to see real change was when we said, 'We are going to change the rules of the game.' The more expensive it is the less you're going to be willing to spend your precious money on something that isn't good for you.\n\ntoggle caption Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR\n\nIn an effort to reduce soda consumption, the government in 2014 imposed a 1 peso per liter tax on sugar sweetened beverages, the equivalent of about 10 U.S. cents on a standard 2 liter bottle.\n\nAt the time Mexico was the leading per capita consumer of soda in the world. In regulatory filings in 2015, Coca-Cola said that the annual consumption of its beverages in Mexico was more than 600 8-ounce servings per person per year. That means that, on average, every Mexican was drinking nearly two glasses of Coke beverages every day. And that doesn't even count the amount of Pepsi or other brands of soda being consumed.\n\nAlejandro Calvillo, the head of a consumer group called El Poder del Consumidor, says soda is making Mexicans sick.\n\nWalking just outside his office in Mexico City, he points out little shops selling Coke and junk food on just about every block. In fact, the red Coca-Cola logo has become a symbol that declares snack shop.\n\nCoke in Mexico has more than 1.5 million places that sell Coke, Calvillo says. The presence of these products is everywhere. Calvillo was one of the advocates behind the 2014 soda tax, although he would have liked the tax to have been even higher. A higher tax, he argues, would have pushed down consumption even more and given the government more resources to combat the lifestyle that's linked to diabetes. In indigenous communities in Chiapas, he says, parents put Coke in baby bottles for their infants and the government isn't doing anything. It's crazy.\n\nLike Barrientos, he says that if Mexico is going to successfully combat diabetes, the rules of the game need to change.\n\nHis efforts to get the soda tax increased even more, however, have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nBut Jorge Terrazas, the head of ANPRAC, the carbonated beverages trade association in Mexico City, says soda is unfairly blamed for Mexico's extremely high rates of obesity and diabetes.\n\nThere's not conclusive scientific evidence demonstrating the relation between the intake of soft drinks with overweight, he tells NPR.\n\nThe average Mexican's daily intake of calories far exceeds the World Health Organization recommendation of 2,000, and Terrazas says the majority of those calories are coming from things other than soda.\n\nBut anti-soda campaigners says sugar is a big part of the problem. They say calling for solutions that rely on individuals alone to change their lifestyles won't solve Mexico's diabetes crisis.\n\nBarrientos, the epidemiologist and runner, says the solution is going to require major changes to the way Mexicans live, eat and exercise.
FACT CHECK: Republican Candidates On Keeping Or Changing Social Security\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/AP\n\nThis story is part of NPR's fact-checking series, Break it Down.\n\nFlorida, which holds its presidential primary on Tuesday, is home to more than 3 million seniors who rely on Social Security. At the GOP debate in Miami Thursday night, candidates were asked about their plans for the program.\n\nAll the Republican candidates say they want to leave Social Security as it is for people who are already retired, or soon will be. But Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have proposed changes for younger workers. Donald Trump says he wants to preserve Social Security benefits and is counting on stronger economic growth to help pay for that.\n\nThe Claims:\n\nDana Bash, CNN: According to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. Marco Rubio: Anyone who tells you Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, 'We don't have to do anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,' they're not being honest with you. Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents. For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68....If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow a fast as someone who made less money. Ted Cruz: Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it's irresponsible.....For younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dana, we need to have for younger workers that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts like the 401(k) that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids. John Kasich: If you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it. It will simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they'll get their full benefit. Donald Trump: I will do everything in my power not to touch Social Security....I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it.\n\nThe Big Questions:\n\n1. How big is the hole in the Social Security safety net?\n\n2. What would it take to fix it?\n\nThe Short Answers:\n\n1. The question from CNN somewhat overstates the problem. Social Security won't run out of money in 20 years. What will happen — somewhere around 2035 — is the program will exhaust its Trust Fund, which Social Security uses to help supplement money from payroll taxes. Even after the trust fund is gone, payroll taxes paid by workers will continue to flow into the system, and those funds will be sufficient to cover about three-quarters of all retirement benefits. In other words, if nothing is done, future retirees could still expect to collect 75 cents for every dollar of Social Security they're owed. (Social Security has a separate program that pays disability benefits, and it faces a more urgent cash crunch. If money from the retirement program is diverted to back fill the disability program, the trust fund will be exhausted a few years earlier.)\n\n2. There are a number of ways to close the gap between the money Social Security expects to take in from payroll taxes (the sole source of revenue once the trust fund is exhausted) and what it's expected to pay out in retirement benefits. All of the fixes involve some combination of raising revenue and/or cutting benefits. If policy makers act now, the gap could be closed with relatively modest changes. The longer we wait, the larger the required changes will have to be. Some of the fixes proposed by the GOP candidates would help to narrow the gap, but none would close it altogether.\n\nThe Long Answers:\n\nThe basic challenge facing Social Security is demographic. The system relies on payroll taxes from people who are working to pay benefits to those who are retired. That worked well when there were four or five workers for every retiree. But that ratio has now dropped below three workers per retiree and it's drifting towards two. Absent another baby boom or a massive influx of immigrants, that's not likely to change.\n\nIf policy makers take no action, there will still be money coming in to Social Security from payroll taxes. It just won't be enough to cover all the benefits that retirees will be owed. (It will be enough to pay about 75 cents on the dollar.)\n\nClosing that gap will require cutting benefits, raising taxes, or some combination of the two.\n\nRubio's proposal: Marco Rubio suggests gradually raising the retirement age at which younger workers like himself become eligible for Social Security. This is effectively a cut in benefits, since retirees would have fewer years to collect. Raising the top retirement age from 67 to 70 as Rubio proposed would fill about one-third of the Social Security shortfall. Rubio also suggested a form of means testing, in which wealthier retirees would see smaller benefit increases in the future. The Senator didn't offer any details, but other means testing proposals have been estimated to reduce the funding shortfall by about 10 percent.\n\nCruz's proposal: Ted Cruz suggests a different form of benefit cut, in which future retirees would receive smaller cost-of-living adjustments. Some argue that the current inflation measure used by Social Security overstates the price increases seniors face, although others insist cost of living adjustments should be bigger, not smaller. The cut that Cruz suggests would fix about 15 percent of the funding shortfall. Cruz also proposes letting workers divert a portion of their payroll taxes into private retirement accounts. This may or may not be a good idea. It was hotly debated during the George W. Bush administration. But using payroll taxes for any purpose other than Social Security would make the system's solvency problems worse, not better.\n\nKasich's proposal: John Kasich also advocates means testing with reduced benefits for wealthy seniors.\n\nTrump's proposal: Donald Trump argues against any cut in benefits or increase in taxes, instead relying on faster economic growth to close the Social Security funding gap. Kathleen Romig of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says faster growth would help with this and many other challenges. But she warns it's not a magic bullet. Forecasters have tried to predict Social Security's fate under many different economic scenarios, and there's no realistic growth level that would close the funding gap on its own. Faster growth cuts both ways, increasing revenue from payroll taxes but also increasing benefits, which are tied to wages.\n\nRevenue proposals: None of the Republicans suggested raising payroll taxes, but that's another way policymakers could help to close the funding gap. Payroll taxes for Social Security are currently 12.4 percent, split between employers and employees. Raising that rate to about 15 percent would close the funding gap entirely. (There's a separate, 2.9 percent payroll tax for Medicare.) Alternatively, policymakers could apply the payroll tax to more income. Wages and salaries above $117,000 a year are currently exempt from Social Security taxes. If that cap were eliminated, it would solve about 90 percent of the funding gap.\n\nAny of these fixes can be thought of as items on a menu, to be mixed, matched, and combined in whatever way is most politically palatable. By acting now, policymakers could solve the Social Security gap with a relatively modest increase in taxes and modest adjustments to benefits. With each passing year of inaction, though, the gap to be filled gets larger.
Utah Voters Approved Medicaid Expansion, But State Lawmakers Are Balking\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cory Dinter/KUER Cory Dinter/KUER\n\nUtah residents may have thought they were done fighting about Medicaid expansion last November. But when Utah lawmakers opened a new legislative session in late January, they began pushing through a bill to roll back the scope and impact of an expansion that voters approved by in a ballot measure.\n\nWe voted for this on Nov. 6. We were very clear about what we wanted, says Andrew Roberts, a spokesman for Utah Decides, the group that organized the Medicaid expansion referendum, known as Proposition 3.\n\nThe voter-approved measure would extend coverage to 150,000 uninsured people in the state.\n\nWe are frustrated, and I think Utahns are frustrated, Roberts says.\n\nHe's so frustrated that his group hired a billboard truck to drive in circles around the Capitol building and through the snowy streets of Salt Lake City and its suburbs. Signs on the sides of the truck flash phrases in LED lights, including Support democracy. Support Utah's vote. A looping video advertisement urges residents to call lawmakers who don't respect the will of the people.\n\nAfter six years of talking about Medicaid expansion, voters approved the ballot measure on Nov. 6, with 53 percent in favor. But the issue erupted again when the legislative session started Jan. 28.\n\nSimilar legislative efforts to curtail expansion are also happening in Idaho, where voters passed a Medicaid expansion initiative in November. Sixty-one percent of voters were in favor. Idaho lawmakers are considering ways to scale that program back.\n\nIn politically and fiscally conservative Utah, legislators argue the 0.15 percent non-food sales tax that voters approved won't be enough to pay for Medicaid expansion. So they'll pass an expansion, but only a very limited one.\n\nVoters wanted Medicaid expansion and that's what we're doing, says Republican state Sen. Allen Christensen. But, he adds, the voters didn't fill in the proper blanks. We are filling in those blanks for them. They are not obligated to balance the budget. We are.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cory Dinter/KUER Cory Dinter/KUER\n\nChristensen is leading the rollback effort in Utah. His alternative proposal, SB 96, would cap the number of individuals who would qualify for Medicaid, add work requirements and lower the annual income limit. Prop. 3 supporters had wanted the coverage available for people who made up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000 a year. But Christensen's bill would offer Medicaid coverage only to people who made less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $12,000 for an individual.\n\nMaking those changes would require the state of Utah to get approval for two federal waivers from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Proposition supporters point out that similar requests from other states have been denied.\n\nFrom the perspective of voters, I think voters have a right to be furious right now, says Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, another group that has supported Medicaid expansion.\n\nSlonaker says changing the scope of Prop. 3 would mean fewer people getting health coverage, and the state would receive less money from the federal government. He also fears it could make voters feel disillusioned.\n\nWhy would voters ever want to pursue ballot initiatives and direct democracy if the legislature's just going to repeal it anyway? Slonaker asks.\n\nWhile some Utah lawmakers, such as Christensen, describe being philosophically opposed to Medicaid expansion, much of the political debate in Utah is about how much expansion will cost, and whether the new sales tax will pay for it. Supporters point to the fiscal experience of other states.\n\nYou should think of Medicaid expansion as no different than if you said, 'Oh, hey, somebody's going to go open up a factory, says Bryce Ward, an economist at the University of Montana, in Missoula. And that factory is going to bring, in the case of Montana, $600 million of outside money into the state that we're going to pay to workers here.\n\nWard recently published a report on the economic impacts of Medicaid expansion in Montana during the first two years of that program. He says it brought in about $600 million dollars in new funds to the state per year. That money supported about 6,000 jobs, he adds, or about $350 million in additional income for residents.\n\nWard says states like his also can take advantage of savings, because Medicaid expansion makes providing health care to certain groups, like prisoners, more affordable. While states do have to pay 10 percent of the cost of expanded Medicaid (the federal government covers 90 percent — a more generous match than traditional Medicaid), the combination of savings and economic growth meant that, in the case of Montana, the program basically pays for itself, Ward says.\n\nThe benefits that people in Utah have is that people like me in other states have done the work trying to figure this out, he says. Or at least get some ballpark estimates of it.\n\nSo far, Utah lawmakers remain unconvinced by studies like Ward's. The bill to restrict Medicaid expansion is moving fast, and could reach the governor's desk as soon as next week.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with KUER and Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.
The Republican Party After Trump\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nJust a few months ago, the Republican Party had lost the presidency but won millions of votes, including gains among Black and Latino voters, gained seats in Congress and controlled more state legislatures. Now the president they promoted and assisted is widely unpopular for lying and inciting insurrection. The identity of the Republican Party is tied up with white supremacists.\n\nWhat is the Republican Party now? Well, we'll ask Ryan Costello, former conservative Republican and congressman who represented Pennsylvania's 6th District, who joins us now. Mr. Costello, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nRYAN COSTELLO: Great to be with you.\n\nSIMON: I feel like I have to put it this bluntly. Has the party of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and Ed Brooke become the party of the Proud Boys and Confederate flags and racism?\n\nCOSTELLO: Well, you know, I certainly don't want that. And I think the predominantly overwhelming majority of Republicans don't believe that sort of hateful ideology, don't subscribe to it, don't want anything to do with it and certainly don't want the party of Lincoln to be branded that way.\n\nSIMON: But before you go on, Washington Post/ABC poll says nearly 6 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they want to follow Trump's lead.\n\nCOSTELLO: Sure. And in fairness, I saw a poll today that - where those numbers may have gone down a little bit, but your point is a good one, and that is notwithstanding just how absolutely horrible and how much of a stain last week was on the history of our country and the president's role in it. And I think that it's one thing to speak about tax cuts and regulatory reform and speak to the ideological pillars that the party has been known for. It's another thing when the rhetoric and sort of, frankly, you know, the offensiveness of things that he would say from time to time points in such a manner that it leads to violence.\n\nSIMON: From your point of view, Mr. Costello, does the Republican Party need to renounce Donald Trump?\n\nCOSTELLO: Well, if you don't renounce, if you don't point out where he was wrong in very clear and explicit terms, you are destined to be a minority party, and people that were voters who would ordinarily support your legislative agenda or, even more broadly speaking, your governing philosophy are going to say, if you can't do the most basic and commonsense thing, then I can't support you.\n\nAnd some things in this country are even more fundamental than one's governing philosophy. They relate to the rule of law. They relate to the separation of power. It relates to the peaceful and orderly transition of power. And if you can't get those basic building blocks of our democracy and the notion of being self-governed in a republic, then voters are really not going to have time to hear the nitty-gritty on your policy details. And that's - I think that that's where we are at this moment, to be totally frank with you.\n\nSIMON: And - well, I have to ask, Mr. Costello, and I know polls can go up and down, but if more than half of the people who identify themselves as Republicans say the party ought to support Donald Trump, after all that's happened, he's still a Republican. Can you ask people to vote for the Republican label?\n\nCOSTELLO: Interestingly - you know, I'm sure listeners have heard the term RINO - right? - Republican in name only. Well, a RINO used to be somebody who would be registered Republican but often vote with Democrats or vote not aligned with the majority of Republicans. In the past four years, RINO has essentially meant not doing whatever Donald Trump wants you to do or saying something critical of Donald Trump - has nothing to do with ideology - right? - which is totally ridiculous to me.\n\nBut to your question, I am a Republican, but I'm not a Republican - and I don't think we want Republicans, just like we don't want Democrats who are unwilling to be critical of those in their party who have done or said things that are wrong, nor do we want a Republican or Democrat just to vote the party line.\n\nSIMON: I think the word reckoning is much overused, but as far as you're concerned, does the Republican Party need to go through a reckoning with its soul and ask, how could this happen?\n\nCOSTELLO: Yes, it does. And the part that bothers me so much is that when somebody says something offensive, whether it's the president or someone else, you know, not saying that's wrong, not cleaning it up allows those who are offended by it to think that that's what the party stands for.\n\nTo me, every American is entitled to certain inalienable rights. And if we are judging folks by things other than just them being a human being, then that's a problem. And I think the flip side for Republicans that gets Democrats in trouble is when we just focus on identity politics, which, to me, is very cancerous in our society. But we're not able to have that debate if we have people storming the Capitol with Confederate flags and saying and doing things on social media that are just outright hateful. It disgusts me. And you can't play to that. You have to outright reject it. And you have to say, I'm not interested in your support. I don't want your support. And if you can't say that clearly and quickly, then people are going to assume the worst.\n\nAnd so it is normally the case that a political party has a reckoning when a president loses after their first term. You know, the party has to look inward. They have to decide what they're going to be based on moving forward. And that's where I think we'll be.\n\nSIMON: Ryan Costello is a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania. Thanks so much, sir.\n\nCOSTELLO: Thank you very much. Take care.\n\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

Even Before Hurricane Maria Hit, Puerto Rico Was In Financial Ruin\n\nNPR and PBS's FRONTLINE have investigated the devastating toll of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico and how the federal response, Wall Street and a century of colonial neglect left 3.5 million Americans struggling to survive.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nIt was early morning last September 20 when Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, leaving a trail of death and destruction. In the months that followed, we've heard a lot about how the storm crippled the island, leaving millions without power, food and water. Now, over the next two days, we're going to take a deeper look at where things went wrong before and after the storm. NPR and the PBS show FRONTLINE have spent the last seven months investigating, and today they reveal a disaster that began long before Maria, a decade of Wall Street dealing that made millions for banks while the island teetered on the edge of financial collapse.\n\nToday NPR's Laura Sullivan reports on how a once-prosperous island ended up in financial ruin, unable to prepare for the storm that was to come.\n\nLAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Long before Maria you probably knew Puerto Rico was in financial trouble. The story went something like this - Puerto Rico borrowed way too much money over the years, overspent that money, and now it can't pay any of it back. And then there was this other story that tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans lost their savings. But what hasn't made much sense is what one thing had to do with the other.\n\nIf Iowa or California borrowed money and defaulted, you wouldn't expect people living in Iowa or California to lose their money, too. And what was more unusual, Puerto Rico imploded over municipal bonds. They're supposed to be the most boring, safe financial investments out there. You buy a Puerto Rican bond, Puerto Rico pays you back later with interest.\n\nCATE LONG: It's bizarre, OK? It's really bizarre.\n\nSULLIVAN: I asked a Wall Street analyst named Cate Long what she thought of this.\n\nLONG: Governments don't collapse like that. And, yeah, there was hundreds of people looking at this, and nobody saw it. This is like - I mean, look at it from the outside. Yeah, this is a crazy story, man.\n\nSULLIVAN: It did seem crazy. Could Puerto Rico really destroy its own financial interests all by itself, or were there other players who may have had their own interests? Down in San Juan, I stop by the nonprofit Center for a New Economy to get some of the backstory. The center's policy director studies the island's finances.\n\nSERGIO MARXUACH: My name is Sergio Marxuach.\n\nSULLIVAN: Say your last name again.\n\nMARXUACH: Marx like Karl Marx...\n\nSULLIVAN: Marx.\n\nMARXUACH: ...And swatch like the watch.\n\nSULLIVAN: Marxuach said that for decades Puerto Rico was booming. It had the special tax break that lured pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers to the island. But then in 1996, Congress began phasing it out. Within a decade, the island spun into recession and to compensate borrowed money.\n\nMARXUACH: The government was borrowing at an incredible clip. Some years the debt would increase by 15 percent year over year.\n\nSULLIVAN: How much percent?\n\nMARXUACH: Fifteen.\n\nSULLIVAN: It's easy to fault Puerto Rican politicians for this. Why didn't they just cut spending, cut school budgets and police budgets and whatever else? But you could ask every voter the same question - who do you like better, the politician who takes away all your favorite programs and gives you nothing, or the one who tells you can have everything you want and someone else will pay for it 20 years from now? Puerto Ricans chose the latter. They turned to investment banks to come in and put the bond deals together.\n\nMARXUACH: All they do is act as intermediaries. They find buyers.\n\nSULLIVAN: Usually that's pension funds, your retirement account or their own clients.\n\nMARXUACH: That's what they get their fees for essentially. And then they're off. They are not on the hook.\n\nSULLIVAN: So it's not their money...\n\nMARXUACH: No.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...That's at stake here.\n\nMARXUACH: Yeah. So they don't care.\n\nSULLIVAN: Puerto Rico bonds had perks and in theory should have been safe. Governments rarely go broke. Yes, there was Detroit. But Puerto Rico has as many residents as almost half the states in the country. The last time a state defaulted was 1933 in Arkansas.\n\nMARXUACH: Fund managers, they will not admit this now, but when Puerto Rico was selling debt like pancakes, they loved Puerto Rico debt. Since they had slightly higher interest rates and no taxes attached to them, you immediately look like a genius, right? You just bump up the entire return for the entire portfolio. So that's your bonus, right? That's your new Mercedes, your new yacht.\n\nSULLIVAN: Has anybody come forward from inside these banks to talk about what was really going on?\n\nMARXUACH: No. No. It's a very close-knit world in Wall Street. And the tendency is just to keep quiet and keep working.\n\nSULLIVAN: I went in search of that close-knit world. I found more than a dozen bankers and brokers involved in Puerto Rican bonds. They described a fast pace of moneymaking and competition and Puerto Rican politicians eager for an influx of cash. And then one afternoon, I found someone deep on the inside, a former top manager for the largest broker-dealer on the island, UBS. Carlos Capacete said he got his start in Puerto Rico's Golden Mile in the 1980s.\n\nCARLOS CAPACETE: All the major banks in New York would come to Puerto Rico on a regular basis to pitch deals. Listen; we can do an additional 200 million, additional 500 million. They make commissions. They make fees. This is kind of like a money-making machine. As long as there are transactions coming and going, they're making a ton of money.\n\nSULLIVAN: Capacete said he said that was all great until about 2011, when he and other bankers started realizing what many bond investors hadn't yet figured out - Puerto Rico was in trouble. There was too much debt. And this is where you might expect UBS and other banks to stop with the bond deals, stop pitching Puerto Rico bonds and stop selling Puerto Rican bonds to their clients. But the opposite happened. Capacete said when it came to clients, UBS pushed brokers to sell.\n\nCAPACETE: There were some hard-line tactics to sell the funds, you know, like go out and get them. Let's go. You got to sell these funds. They were just trying to push the bond funds to whoever had a heartbeat.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nSULLIVAN: There's an audio tape secretly recorded at a UBS meeting in Puerto Rico that's now part of lawsuits. You can hear a top company manager telling brokers to sell the bonds or...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Go home. Get a new job.\n\nSULLIVAN: These bonds were specifically designed to sell to Puerto Ricans. They were part of special bond funds that were far riskier than what regulators allow on the mainland. Brokers sold tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans into these special funds. Hundreds of millions of dollars of the island's wealth was now highly concentrated at the worst possible time. And then Capacete heard a troubling story.\n\nCAPACETE: One day this client tells me, are you aware of what they're doing in this other branch? And I said, tell me. And he told me the scheme.\n\nSULLIVAN: Capacete said he says he learned some brokers were pushing Puerto Rican clients who had already put so much of their retirement or savings into the special funds to go borrow money and put it into the funds, too. It's like using poker chips to take out a loan for more poker chips and betting them all on the same hand.\n\nCAPACETE: It's unethical. It's against the bank's regulations. And it puts the clients in a really, really tough risk situation.\n\nSULLIVAN: Capacete sent emails warning UBS. Almost a year later, two officers from the bank's compliance office came and said they found no evidence of the practice.\n\nCAPACETE: And I jumped up and I said, you're kidding, right? This is a joke. And I told her, look at the big accounts and follow the money. I left the room, and I don't think I ever spoke to them again.\n\nSULLIVAN: Why do you think the bank would want to turn a blind eye to something like this?\n\nCAPACETE: Because it was profitable. And I was the one that was - in Spanish we say (speaking Spanish). I was the one that was spoiling their party.\n\nSULLIVAN: UBS declined NPR and FRONTLINE's requests for an interview but said its loan terms were fully disclosed, and that the program as a whole did not violate financial regulations. It pointed to a separate case where regulators found it didn't mislead clients and called Capacete a disgruntled former employee who has sued the bank, and said it fired the one employee who had been violating policies.\n\nEventually, federal regulators investigated and found the bank should have had a system in place to prevent the practice. They fined UBS $34 million for the loan scheme and other problems. They also fined UBS and four other banks for putting clients at risk in the special funds. Eighteen hundred UBS customers have now sued.\n\nBut in 2013, the party came to an end for investors. Bond prices tanked. All of those tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans tied up in the same risky funds were in serious trouble, and those that had taken out additional loans suddenly had to cover them. Within months, billions of dollars of Puerto Rican wealth was wiped out.\n\nAnd surely by now the government and banks would want to be done with this Puerto Rican bond business. Rating agencies downgraded Puerto Rican bonds to junk. I asked Puerto Rico's current governor, Ricardo Rossello, what he thought of this period, and he put it this way.\n\nRICARDO ROSSELLO: The governor of Puerto Rico was run as a big Ponzi scheme. What you had was essentially a black box of a government running that had no clarity as to what was being borrowed and what was being spent.\n\nSULLIVAN: But in 2014, cable news was ablaze. The banks in Puerto Rico were going in for another bond deal.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Demand for Puerto Rico's debt was through the roof.\n\nSULLIVAN: It was the largest municipal junk bond offering in U.S. history.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: This deal I believe is a $3 1/2 billion deal. So we're up...\n\nSULLIVAN: Puerto Rican officials for their part told me they needed the cash to make payroll. But when I went back to the bankers I had met, several of whom had worked on the deal, they told me something else. They said this bond was more than just a bond deal. They said it was also an exit strategy for the banks. See; in the years before the bond, the banks had been loaning Puerto Rico money or making investments in other ways. Government documents show hundreds of millions of dollars were now at stake on an island in financial trouble.\n\nAnd dig deep into the 2014 bond documents, and you'll see it, too. Almost a quarter of the entire bond goes to pay them back, almost $900 million that didn't go to Puerto Ricans or even to keep the government afloat but went to pay back loans, pay fees or eliminate other risk of banks directly involved in putting the deal together. Barclays, which led the bond deal, got almost half a billion dollars; Banco Santander, 100 million; JPMorgan, 74 million; Morgan Stanley, 24 million; and others.\n\nNeither Barclays nor any of the other banks would agree to an interview. In statements, banks said they fully disclosed their financial stake in the deal and did not influence how Puerto Rico used the money. Morgan Stanley said they also extended Puerto Rico $250 million in credit after the bond. It was difficult to find bank insiders to talk on the record about this. And then I found one former broker who would.\n\nAXEL RIVERA: I started back in 1983 in Wall Street.\n\nSULLIVAN: I met Axel Rivera in a hotel lobby in San Juan. He was at Morgan Stanley when the record 2014 deal was done. As he flipped through the bond, he said when the island got closer to default, banks were getting nervous. They had too much debt on the island.\n\nRIVERA: They wanted to try to get as much as they could of their exposure out of their books.\n\nSULLIVAN: Your colleagues at Morgan Stanley...\n\nRIVERA: Yes.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Told you...\n\nRIVERA: Yes.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...That they had exposure to risk at that time.\n\nRIVERA: That they had much more than what they wanted, and they needed to unwind that.\n\nSULLIVAN: And they needed the 2014 bond...\n\nRIVERA: That's correct.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...To get them out. Then who gets left paying the bill?\n\nRIVERA: The bondholders, whomever they are. The banks get out, and everybody else gets - they get stuck with the bill.\n\nSULLIVAN: Rivera said for banks like Morgan Stanley and others, the bond was the finale, capping years of profit with a way out.\n\nRIVERA: Most of the general public didn't understand what was going on. The darkness of this bond deal made a lot of people in Wall Street happy, but it was immoral in many ways.\n\nSULLIVAN: Fifteen months later, the then-governor announced the island couldn't pay any of its debt. It was broke. The bond funds crashed, savings, retirements, pensions gone. The government started closing hospitals. There was no money to shore up bridges or electrical grids. And then - well, you know what happened next. A Category 4 hurricane came barreling into Puerto Rico. If ever this island needed the federal government to come and bring its A-game, now was the time. What it got was anything but.

Planning For Your Retirement: Understanding Annuities\n\nAn annuity can be a very smart retirement investment for many people. That's not just because an annuity can provide a secure revenue stream — a monthly check — for the rest of your life, no matter how long you live. On top of that, the longer you live, the more you get what's called a mortality credit as you outlive other people who bought into the annuity. The income gain from that can be many times greater than any other secure investment you're likely to find.\n\nBut annuities can also be overpriced, opaque, terrible products, too. So how do you figure out if an annuity is right for you? And if you think it is, how do you buy a good one that's not an overpriced turkey with massive hidden fees?\n\nTo help explain this, we called on Kent Smetters, an economist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He's an expert on personal finance and he's written extensively about annuities in particular.\n\nWhat is an annuity?\n\nA lifetime, or fixed, annuity pays you a constant amount of money until you die, sometimes called longevity protection. Since no one knows how long they'll live, a fixed annuity is similar to Social Security, except most lifetime annuity payments are not indexed to inflation. Overall, it's a very simple product.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Kent Smetters Courtesy of Kent Smetters\n\nIn contrast, a variable annuity is a very complicated product and, as commonly used, provides very little, if any, longevity protection. Instead, variable annuity sellers tout their tax benefits, but these benefits are often overstated and can even lead to higher taxes in some circumstances.\n\nWhat is a deferred annuity?\n\nYou can buy an annuity in two forms: an immediate or deferred. Both forms protect you from outliving your retirement savings. An immediate annuity means that you pay a lump-sum amount of cash, usually at retirement, and immediately start receiving annuity payments. A deferred annuity means that you pay for it, often while working, long before you start receiving annuity payments. Due to recent legal changes, you'll soon be allowed to buy deferred annuities through 401(k) plans.\n\nThe main advantage of buying annuities on a deferred basis is that you can often lock in annuity payment rates today, well before you retire, when your rates can be different. You can also buy a deferred annuity after you retire, for example, to start at age 80, after you think that you will have exhausted your other resources.\n\nIf you can afford to live well without the income from the immediate annuity, you are better off with the deferred annuity because it provides greater tax benefits and increased longevity protection.\n\nHow does someone figure out if an annuity makes sense?\n\n1) For an annuity to make sense, you should ideally have saved up in excess of $500,000 in today's dollars for retirement. That's because $250,000 is the amount a couple retiring today should have ready for out-of-pocket medical expenses, even if they are on Medicare, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute and NetBenefits. The other $250,000 is a cushion for other things that might come up.\n\n2) Think about buying a fixed annuity for the rest of your money. Once you have met your $500,000 goal, start investing in deferred annuities, especially if you are still working. If you are retired, purchase immediate annuities with the rest.\n\n3) Base your standard consumption on the monies from the lifetime annuity plus Social Security.\n\n4) If 3) is not enough for monthly expenses, think about reducing expenses. If not, repeat step 1) with $250,000 as your target.\n\nAnnuities seem more complicated than just buying, say, an index fund. How do you shop around and make sure you're getting a fair deal on an annuity?\n\nIn general, most people should avoid variable annuities because they have high costs and their tax benefits are often overstated. But true lifetime fixed annuities do make a lot of sense, if one can avoid the large commission loads. In essence, they help replace the former pension plans. Be patient and shop around. I would get quotes from several leading annuity providers: MassMutual, MetLife, New York Life, State Farm, TIAA (if you qualify). Look for a firm with an A.M. Best Company rating of at least A+, the best being A++. IncomeSolutions.com provides quotes with low commissions for some other companies.\n\nAre there other risks to consider?\n\nMost states have programs that will guarantee your annuity payments if you insurer (the company that sold you the annuity) goes bust. The insurer cannot legally discuss these programs with you, and so you must investigate your own state rules. However, I don't have great confidence in these guarantees. Still, the risk of outliving your assets is much larger than the risk of you losing money because a major insurance company that sold you an annuity goes bankrupt. And you can reduce your risk by purchasing multiple annuity contracts across several companies.\n\nWhat if someone has less than $250,000 saved up? They just can't afford an annuity?\n\n5) If you really can't annuitize anything, live on Social Security plus 3 percent of your beginning assets each year (4 percent if you are quite unhealthy). For example, if a person enters retirement with $200,000 in assets, they will need to adjust their consumption to hit Social Security plus $6,000 per year. If they consume more money than that, they risk running out of everything but Social Security, which has its own problems.\n\nTo educate people about how to save and invest more successfully, Smetters hosts a radio show, Your Money, on Sirius XM which, along with his website KentOnMoney.com, he does pro bono. As part of NPR's Your Money and Your Life series, we asked Smetters for tips on finding a financial adviser.
Why It's So Hard To Know Whether School Choice Is Working\n\nEnlarge this image LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos has been a passionate proponent of expanding school choice, including private school vouchers and charter schools, and she has the clear backing of President Trump. But does the research justify her enthusiasm?\n\nExperts say one single, overarching issue bedevils their efforts to study the impact of school choice programs. That is: It's hard to disentangle the performance of a school from the selection of its students.\n\nStudents are never randomly assigned to a school. A school's population is always affected by local demographics. With schools of choice, by definition, parents and students are making a decision to attend that school, so their enrollment is even less random.\n\nEven when researchers carefully match students at different schools based on demographics, it's possible that families that are more organized and more invested in education are also more likely to seek out charters and voucher programs. Or, selection bias can also work the other way: The students who struggle in traditional public schools may be more likely to seek alternatives.\n\nFurther complicating matters is this: By law, most charter schools must have open enrollment, using a lottery if they have more applicants than spots. However, charters, and private schools, have sometimes been accused of using strict discipline rules or other measures to filter out underperforming or otherwise undesirable students.\n\nThe admissions policies of voucher-accepting private schools can also vary widely, depending on school policy and state law. Some must have open enrollment. Others retain the right to select students based on religion, academic achievement, artistic talent, conduct, or other factors.\n\nAnd, no matter where you look, both private schools and charters tend to enroll fewer students with disabilities compared with public schools, a practice known as creaming.\n\nSo, with the huge caveat that it's difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison, where do researchers agree on the impact of choice?\n\nChoice programs seem to push nearby public schools to improve.\n\nThe results are consistent, and I don't think there's any debate, says Douglas Harris of the Education Research Alliance at Tulane University. Charters, vouchers and tax credits create competition and positive spillovers. When school choices expand, public schools stand to lose students, and thus money, and they seem to respond by stepping up their game.\n\nMartin Carnoy, a professor at Stanford University who has been studying the issue for decades, terms this response to competition an accountability effect. In other words, When you announce that there's a new sheriff in town, all of a sudden everybody perks up.\n\nCarnoy's studies of cities including Milwaukee argue that this effect fades over time.\n\nThere's far less agreement among researchers on the effects of choice for the students who choose to leave their traditional public school.\n\nFirst, charter schools. Charter students in city centers tend to do better than their public-school peers, according to the most recent research by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford. But charter students elsewhere tend to do the same or worse.\n\nAnd the learning progress of nearly 200,000 students enrolled in 100-percent online virtual charter schools is generally so bad that representatives of the charter sector recently called for states to close many of them.\n\nSecond, private schools. Whether students are using vouchers or tax-credit scholarships, their academic outcomes are a similarly mixed bag.\n\nMost studies find modestly positive or neutral impact on student scores, and that's generally limited to African-American students in large urban centers, says Micah Ann Wixom, a policy analyst with the Education Commission of the States.\n\nMartin Carnoy wrote for the left-leaning Economic Policy institute in February: Extensive research on educational vouchers in the United States over the past 25 years shows that gains in student achievement are at best small.\n\nDo voucher students perform better than they would have in their neighborhood school? asks Josh Cunningham, a senior education policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. At the most I can say, 'Maybe, a little bit.' But there's not a lot of evidence that they'll have any substantial academic gains.\n\nOr, as the Center on Education Policy underscored in its 2011 survey of voucher research: Achievement gains for voucher students are similar to those of their public school peers.\n\nBut more recent research has found that private schools, like charter schools, can actually hurt the academic progress of the students who choose them. Studies of programs in Louisiana, Ohio and Washington, D.C., found students who left for private schools did worse, not better, compared with their peers.\n\nScholarship tax-credit programs, like voucher programs, send students to private schools. Their impact is hard to determine, says Harris of the Education Research Alliance.\n\nThe best-case scenario seems to be a slight positive effect, but most people would interpret it as no effect, he says.\n\nFinally, when it comes to voucher and tax-credit programs, many states don't even require private schools to administer the state's test. In Florida, it can be any nationally normed test. So these programs are a bit of a black box. Going forward, if private school options expand, we may know less and less about the schools that more and more students are attending.\n\nOh, and there's another challenge: Most of these analyses rely on test scores alone. Test scores provide an imperfect and incomplete picture of student performance, as the most recent reauthorization of the federal education law acknowledges.
Democratic Candidates Storm Storm Lake\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls are in heartland America this weekend, making their case to rural voters in the small town of Storm Lake, Iowa. It's part of a broader push by Democrats to make inroads in traditionally Republican strongholds ahead of the 2020 election. NPR's Don Gonyea was there.\n\nDON GONYEA, BYLINE: This is northwest Iowa - deep red Republican country. But yesterday the stage was set for a group of Democrats for something billed as the Heartland Forum. There is an increasingly crowded field of Democrats in the race for president. Four of those officially running accepted the invite to attend.\n\nIt was not a debate. The candidates took turns on stage taking questions from a trio of journalists and from the audience. There was Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Amy Klobuchar, former cabinet secretary and San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro and former Congressman John Delaney. Warren was first on stage. In an opening statement, she tackled small-farm economics and the impact of big corporate farming and ag industry mergers.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF HEARTLAND FORUM)\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: You've got these giant corporations that are making bigger and bigger profits for themselves, for their executives, for their investors. And they're putting the squeeze on family farms, on small farms.\n\nGONYEA: When Amy Klobuchar, who's from neighboring Minnesota, took the stage, she said anti-trust laws need to be rewritten to protect small farms. She talked about President Trump's trade policies, tariffs he imposed against China and the retaliatory tariffs by the Chinese on U.S. farm commodities.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF HEARTLAND FORUM)\n\nAMY KLOBUCHAR: We've had a situation of the weather being bad. We've had some of the lowest profits for agriculture - at least in my state - since the 1980s. And I know that Iowa is experiencing this too. And while I'm glad that the administration decided to get that 12 billion set aside to make up for these trade wars, that's not the same as actually selling things, right?\n\nGONYEA: Now to Julian Castro, he was asked about balancing environmental concerns with farming. He said it's about the choices the government makes in the tax code and on where to invest.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF HEARTLAND FORUM)\n\nJULIAN CASTRO: Family farms can thrive and that you can have clean air and clean water no matter where you live, including in rural America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGONYEA: On immigration, Castro spoke of his grandmother coming to the U.S. from Mexico. The fourth candidate to speak was John Delaney of Maryland. He's still little-known, though he's been actively campaigning for almost two years already. Delaney spoke of his proposal, labeled the Heartland Fair Deal. In it, he too calls for much greater investment in rural areas.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF HEARTLAND FORUM)\n\nJOHN DELANEY: Capital has left this region. That doesn't mean people don't invest here. They do. But the owners of that capital are often not located here anymore like they used to be.\n\nGONYEA: Overall, the list of topics covered also included mental health, farmer suicides, climate change, rural school funding, student loan debt and more. Sixty-four-year-old Chris Petersen (ph) is a lifelong family farmer from Clear Lake, and he's a Democrat. He says the party needs to talk more about all of these things.\n\nCHRIS PETERSEN: Democratic Party, we got to talk about health care access. Rural hospitals are closing up. Everything is bad right now. And I tell you what. The Democrats need to stand up.\n\nGONYEA: Like some others, Petersen wishes more candidates had come but added that holding the event is a good sign that the party may pay more attention to rural America in the 2020 campaign.

Biden, Harris Promise 'Help Is On The Way' With COVID Relief Package\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPresident Biden and Vice President Harris spoke at the White House Rose Garden Friday afternoon in a ceremony celebrating the passage of the administration's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package earlier this week.\n\nThe joint event with congressional Democratic leaders marks the start of a concerted push by the White House to promote the American Rescue Plan around the country.\n\nIt's critical to demonstrate that government can function; can function and deliver prosperity, security and opportunity for the people of this country, Biden said during his remarks.\n\nBiden signed the bill Thursday, securing the first major legislative accomplishment of his term. The legislation includes direct payments, which Biden said would begin to go out as soon as this weekend, extended unemployment benefits and an expanded child tax credit. There's also billions of dollars set aside for schools, businesses and the expansion of the country's vaccine rollout. (Read more about the details here.)\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer attended, alongside a number of Democratic House and Senate committee chairs. Both Pelosi and Schumer praised committee leaders and members of their caucuses for getting the legislation passed, with Pelosi referring to House committee chairs as dazzling.\n\nOur unity on behalf of all the American people is what made this such a triumph, Pelosi said.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was also present, though he was one of the strongest backers of a provision in an earlier version of the legislation that would have increased the minimum wage to $15 by 2025. The proposed wage increase was ruled out by the Senate parliamentarian last month.\n\nBiden praised Sanders during his remarks, thanking him for making the case as to why this was so transformational and said the bill changes the paradigm on who benefits from major government legislation.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, this bill puts working people in this nation first, Biden said.\n\nThough Biden said Thursday that an overwhelming percentage of the American people support the package, no Republicans voted for the bill in the House or the Senate.\n\nFriday's ceremony kicked off a sort of victory lap during which Biden, Harris and their spouses will travel the country next week promoting the package.\n\nThe Help is Here tour will start on Monday, when Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff head to Las Vegas, while first lady Jill Biden visits Burlington, N.J. Other stops will include the Philadelphia suburbs, Atlanta and Denver.\n\nThis law is not the end of our efforts, though, Biden said. I view it as only the beginning.\n\nAccording to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey, 62% of Americans approve of how Biden is handling the pandemic so far.
Trump Wants A Federal Hiring Freeze, But It May Not Save Money\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump rode to electoral victory in part on discontent with Washington. He promised to drain the swamp — referring to the nation's capital. And No. 2 on his Contract With The American Voter, listing activities for his first 100 days, is a hiring freeze on all civilian federal jobs that aren't involved in public safety or public health.\n\nA freeze is not unprecedented. Other administrations — Democrat and Republican — have used them. Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton used a host of measures to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\n\nBut even those who support the idea of paring down the federal government's staffing say a freeze can have some unintended effects.\n\nIf incoming President Donald Trump wants to reduce the size of the federal workforce, what he should really do is decide which programs he wants to cut or eliminate, says Cato Institute tax policy director Chris Edwards.\n\nConsider what the federal workforce consists of: The civilian federal workforce is about 2 million people. That's roughly the same size as it was in the 1960s, when the U.S. population was about half what it is now.\n\nBut Paul Light, a public policy professor at New York University, says adding in federal contractors and grantees brings that number up to between 7 million and 9 million.\n\nLight says Trump's rhetoric about a hiring freeze and promises to drain the swamp seem to address concerns about thinning the ranks of government and making it more effective. But, in fact, hiring freezes tend not to do that, because while dislike of government is popular, he says, nearly all government programs are popular, too, from National Parks to food inspection to Medicare.\n\nWhen you start really looking at what these jobs are, Americans kind of like what most federal employees do, Light says.\n\nIn terms of saving money, it also doesn't work.\n\nA 1982 report — still cited by many experts — found past hiring freezes cost the government more while also resulting in less collection of taxes and other revenue.\n\nFederal payroll and benefits make up less than 10 percent of the federal budget, Light says, and a hiring freeze has a way of encouraging good workers to leave.\n\nSome of your very best employees who can get a job in the private sector will take it, Light says. And to backfill positions that need to be filled, agencies end up hiring more expensive contract workers, instead, which are generally not included in the freeze.\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\nThis president is going to end up in the middle of some major crisis that's going to depend on how well he makes government work to solve it.\n\nJames Sherk, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, says using contractors is still preferable to hiring workers directly. He says because of unions and appeals processes, it's far too difficult to fire underperforming federal workers.\n\nIt's essentially a lifetime commitment, and if you're not satisfied with the work, there's not much you can do about it, he says of a federal employee. With a contractor, if you're dissatisfied with the work, you just don't renew the contract.\n\nSherk adds that without a hiring freeze, agencies have less incentive to look for fat to cut. You're not looking for the efficiencies, because you don't need to find them.\n\nDonald Kettl, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland, says he believes the freeze is really about a desire among Americans for better-functioning government, and that a better-functioning government requires better hiring.\n\nThe irony here is that if the goal is to make government work better to try to get it more under control, the hiring freeze is exactly the opposite of what you need to do, Kettl says.\n\nKettl says government agencies don't just need to blindly downsize; they need to do a better job of identifying the skills and talent they need, and being more nimble at attracting them.\n\nThe bottom line here is, we have to figure out what it is that we want to do, and what it's going to take to be able to do it well, and hire the people with the skills to make that happen, and we don't have a very good system in the federal government right now for doing that, Kettl says. He says it will be interesting to see how Trump, a businessman, changes government hiring.\n\nKettl warns that just cutting federal agencies could backfire. When they need them, he says, Americans demand robust and functional government service. Think of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he says, or Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThis president is going to end up in the middle of some major crisis that's going to depend on how well he makes government work to solve it, Kettl says.
Mitt Romney Attacks Trump's Character In 'Washington Post' Op-Ed\n\nRachel Martin talks to GOP strategist Scott Jennings about what GOP Sen.-elect Mitt Romney of Utah had to say about President Trump's character. Romney was the party's 2012 nominee for president.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nThe president shapes the public character of the nation. Trump's character falls short. That is a quote, an excerpt. Actually, the headline of a scathing new Washington Post op-ed by Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate praised President Trump's tax cuts and his hard line on China. But the gist of this op-ed is a moral and ethical takedown of the president of the United States by a new senator from his own party. This comes as Trump meets with congressional leaders today to talk about border security and presumably come up with a plan to end the partial government shutdown.\n\nI'm joined now by Republican strategist Scott Jennings. He was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney in the 2012 campaign. Scott, welcome back to the program.\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS: Good morning. Thank you.\n\nMARTIN: I want to read a little more from this op-ed. Basically, Mitt Romney is saying here that President Trump has, quote, not risen to the mantle of the office. He says the president has failed to lead with honesty or integrity. What is your former boss doing here? I mean, he hasn't even been sworn in yet, and he's attacking the president this way right out of the gate.\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah. I think Senator Romney, Senator-elect Romney is doing what he said he would do during the campaign. I recall back in the summer, he wrote in The Salt Lake Tribune that he was going to speak out when the president does things that he doesn't like. He said he was not going to speak out on every tweet, but that if the president is acting in a way he doesn't approve of, he won't hesitate to speak out. I think he's also doing what a lot of Republicans do, which is separate policy from behavior and style. And that is not something that is unique to Mitt Romney. A lot of Republican voters did that when they voted for Donald Trump in 2016. So Mitt Romney has a six-year term, and he represents a state that won't mind if he tackles the president every now and again. And I expect he'll keep doing that.\n\nMARTIN: Although at one point, Romney appeared to get over his moral qualms with Trump because he was vying to become his secretary of state. So he has changed his mind before.\n\nJENNINGS: He has. I wonder if Mitt Romney is not delivering a little bit of payback to Donald Trump, who sort of led him on for secretary of state and then went with Rex Tillerson, of course, there, during the transition. These two guys have a long and interesting history. I suspect this won't be the last chapter that's written. But these Senate terms being six years, it does give you a lot of political freedom, especially at the beginning, to do things that you don't immediately have to answer for from voters back home.\n\nMARTIN: I want to shift and talk about the shutdown and the border security in that fight. But just briefly, do you think this means Mitt Romney wants to position himself to run against President Trump in 2020?\n\nJENNINGS: No. I can't imagine that to be the case. I mean, I guess if something catastrophic happened to President Trump and he could not run, perhaps Mitt Romney would be a candidate. But my view is Donald Trump is as strong in the Republican Party as he has been during his term, and if he wants to be the nominee of the GOP, he will be that nominee, regardless of Mitt Romney, or John Kasich or anyone else runs against him.\n\nMARTIN: So the president is meeting with lawmakers today at the White House. It's day 12 of this shutdown. Democrats don't have a lot of incentive to back down. Should the president at this point ease up on his demand for the $5 billion for the wall, do you think?\n\nJENNINGS: Well, you're right. They don't have a lot of incentive to back down, and the president hasn't given them much. But he ought to. In my opinion, the president ought to put something back on the table that he put on the table back during their previous negotiations, and that's fixing DACA. Fixing DACA was part of the president's four-pillars strategy way back earlier in 2018. It's something he has endorsed before. That would give pause, I think, to this Democratic strategy of letting this thing run out for a very long time. A lot of these new members of Congress ran on a fix for DACA. I think a very fair deal here would be 5 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA. That's a win for everybody...\n\nMARTIN: Although...\n\nJENNINGS: ...And gets us past this issue.\n\nMARTIN: Sorry to interrupt you, Scott, but even as outgoing chief of staff John Kelly said in an exit interview, the administration gave up on the idea of an actual physical wall a long time ago, that it was always more about border security, technology. Maybe the president hasn't gotten the memo on that, but do you think that's ultimately where it's going to end up, anyway?\n\nJENNINGS: Well, I think that the president says he wants a wall, and John Kelly no longer works there. So (laughter) I don't know, as we message this publicly, what this thing's ultimately going to look like. But I know what the president's going to call it, and that's a wall. And I know the Democrats are going to continue to say they don't want just wall funding. That's why I think there has to be something here, something new, to get past the impasse. That's why I think reintroducing DACA as part of this deal could be that something new that gives everybody a way to go home and say, look what I negotiated for you.\n\nMARTIN: Which, in the end, is what everyone wants, to be able to save face and say they won. Republican strategist Scott Jennings for us this morning.\n\nScott, thanks, as always. We appreciate it.\n\nJENNINGS: Thank you very much.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Does Subsidizing Crops We're Told To Eat Less Of Fatten Us Up?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images\n\nIf you're a taxpayer, you're in on this system.\n\nWe — the U.S. taxpayers — help subsidize farmers by paying part of the premiums on their crop insurance. This helps ensure that farmers don't go belly up, and it also protects against food shortages.\n\nBut are there unintended consequences? For instance, do subsidies encourage the production — and perhaps overconsumption — of things that we're told to eat less of? Think high fructose corn syrup or perhaps meat produced from livestock raised on subsidized grains.\n\nResearchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Emory University in Atlanta were curious. In a paper published in JAMA Internal Medicine, they point to a disconnect between the nation's agricultural policies and nutritional recommendations.\n\nAmericans are told to fill 50 percent of our plates with fruits and vegetables. But here's the contradiction, as the researchers see it: U.S. agriculture policies focus on financing the production of corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, sorghum, dairy and livestock, the researchers write. About $170 billion was spent between 1995 and 2010 on these seven commodities and programs, according to the researchers.\n\nTo evaluate the association between the consumption of these foods and the health of Americans, the researchers used data collected by a federal health survey to analyze the daily diet of 10,308 adults.\n\nThe survey was based on 24-hour recall, where participants are asked to name everything they ate over the past day. The researchers then estimate the consumption of subsidized food commodities as a percentage of total calories consumed. So what did they find?\n\nHigher consumption of calories from subsidized food commodities was associated with a greater probability of some cardiometabolic risks, the authors conclude. For instance, they found a higher probability of both obesity and unhealthy blood glucose levels (which raises the risk of Type 2 diabetes) among people who consumed the most calories from subsidized foods.\n\nIt makes sense, says one of the study authors, K.M. Venkat Narayan, a professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health.\n\nHe says the findings from this study and prior research suggest that subsidies increase production and consumption of products made from these seven foods. And [consumption] of those foods is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors.\n\nNarayan acknowledges the study has shortcomings. For instance, the methodology — known as a cross-sectional study — captures the association at just one point, a snapshot in time. It's possible if people had been interviewed about their diets on a different day — or over a series of years — a different picture would emerge.\n\nIt's also possible that farm subsidies have less influence on what we ultimately choose to eat than this study suggests. (More on that below.) So, this paper doesn't prove a cause and effect. However, this is certainly not the first time that U.S. farm policy has been implicated in the obesity epidemic.\n\nThe idea that our agriculture policies may undermine the health of Americans has been gaining traction. Consider this: The U.S. devotes less than 1 percent of farm subsidies to support the research, production and marketing of fruits and vegetables, according to this editorial penned jointly by former New York Times columnist Mark Bittman, food writer Michael Pollan, and Ricardo Salvador of the Union of Concerned Scientists in 2014.\n\nThe editorial, titled How A National Food Policy Could Save Millions Of American Lives, points out that Michelle Obama [is] warning Americans to avoid high-fructose corn syrup at the same time the president is signing farm bills to subsidize its production.\n\nThe writers suggest the government is funding both sides of the war on Type 2 diabetes, a disease that costs the U.S. $245 billion each year. The government subsidizes soda with one hand, by subsidizing corn farmers, while the other writes checks to pay for insulin pumps to help treat diabetes.\n\nBut, hold on! Are subsidies to farmers really driving our consumption of sodas or other less-than-healthful foods?\n\nNot so fast, argues Raj Patel, a research professor at the University of Texas, Austin who studies global food systems. Commodity subsidies are a small part of a bigger problem, he writes in an editorial published in JAMA Internal Medicine alongside the new study.\n\nLots of factors shape our food choices, from our biological attraction to sugar and other energy-dense foods to the convenience of cheap, packaged goodies. So if we wanted to nudge people to healthier eating habits, what policies might we want to change?\n\nOne way would be to limit demand by restricting the advertising of highly processed food, especially to children, Patel writes. As we've reported, despite pledges by the food industry, most foods and beverages marketed to kids are full of salt, sugar and fat. And food behemoths pay millions of dollars to market junk food and soda — for example, Beyonce's $50 million endorsement of Pepsi.\n\nAnother way to nudge people away from sweetened drinks is to tax them. As we've reported, the city of Philadelphia recently voted in a tax on sweetened beverages, and a similar measure in Mexico prompted a decline in sales of sugary drinks.\n\nThe evidence suggests that the appeal of sugar is so strong that it's tough to pin overconsumption to something as simple as farm policy.\n\nConsider this: Sugar hooked us on yogurt. Americans eschewed yogurt until Dannon began adding sugary jam to the bottom. Same story with cereal. Adding sugar to tasteless flakes drove up sales.\n\nAnd then there's the idea that crop subsidies don't necessarily make food cheaper. Here are two reasons why. First, only a tiny slice — an estimated 15 percent — of the price we pay for processed foods, say, a box of cornflakes or cookies made with wheat and corn syrup, actually goes to the farmer.\n\nIf the price of corn doubles, the price of cornflakes may go up only 10 percent, says Robert Paarlberg, an adjunct professor of public policy specializing in agricultural policy at Harvard's Kennedy School.\n\nThe rest of the retail price is set by packaging, processing, shipping and advertising. Some economists have argued that the cardboard box costs more than the corn inside the box, Paarlberg says. So, 85 percent of what we pay for food has nothing to do with commodity prices.\n\nAnd reason No. 2: Paarlberg argues that U.S. policies actually increase the price of some foods. Take, for example, corn sweeteners. Paarlberg argues that the price of corn syrup is driven up by the fact that the U.S. taxes imports of foreign sugar.\n\nWe place an import levy on cheap sugar from abroad, says Paarlberg. We use it like a quota system to keep cheap sugar from the Caribbean or Australia or South Africa out of our market. And without the global, free market competition, that raises the price inside the U.S. market ... for all sweeteners, including high fructose corn syrup, he says. Also, a significant amount of corn grown in the U.S. is used to make ethanol, so this demand also keeps the price of corn up.\n\nSo, as you can see, the way in which U.S. farm and trade policies influence Americans' eating habits is complicated. And Paarlberg argues that the cost of commodity crops is a trivial factor in the obesity equation.\n\nOthers sound a similar note. Patel argues that many farmers still need the safety net of crop insurance subsidies. He argues that subsidies are vital for indebted farmers who need to pay off creditors.\n\nYanking away the income on which many depend will do little to help promote more healthful eating or more sustainable farming practices, Patel says.\n\nI heard this same response from other farm economists and academics who study agriculture policy. The authors of the new study suggest we should realign government support programs toward more healthful foods. I would agree with that, Harold Van Es, of Cornell University, told me. Although this does not necessarily imply that we should not support [i.e., insure] the traditional commodities.\n\nPart of the challenge of encouraging broader consumption of fruits and vegetables is the expense. The production costs of fresh fruits and vegetables is relatively high, independent of government support programs, Van Es says.\n\nMany experts agree: We need new thinking about how to incentivize more nutritious food choices at the retail level, especially given that the U.S. government spends far more on food assistance programs such as SNAP, aka food stamps, compared with crop subsidies.\n\nPerhaps this is why the government has begun funding programs, such as a subsidy for food stamp recipients to buy fresh food at farmers markets. Meanwhile, some insurers are experimenting with nudging shoppers to make better choices by offering rebates for healthful food.\n\nAnother example? In several U.S. cities, doctors are now prescribing fruits and vegetables — an Rx that can be traded in for free produce at the farmers market. It's part of a program that aims to reshape the buying habits of people at risk of obesity, diabetes and other lifestyle-related diseases.
Las Vegas Welcomes The Spread Of Sports Gambling\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Leila Fadel/NPR Leila Fadel/NPR\n\nAt MGM Grand Las Vegas, a bookmaker takes bets on sports events at the round counter at the Race & Sports Book near the casino. Hockey is among the games being broadcast on 47 flat screens above while gamblers sit in leather seats to watch and strategize.\n\nFor years, Las Vegas has held a fairly exclusive lock on legal sports gambling like this in the U.S. But a Supreme Court decision to strike down an act that effectively banned it in most of the rest of the country now means other states can permit and regulate it, too. And while that means more competition for Las Vegas, casino executives and longtime bookmakers in Nevada are welcoming the decision. They say permitting sports betting is good for everyone in the industry. Besides, they say, people come to Las Vegas for more than that.\n\nOn this day, Kevin Olson and Josh Sturm are on a guys' trip, mostly to play cards and golf. The sports betting is just the icing, they say.\n\nHonestly, there's a lot of avenues online that you can use, and people that we know and myself use online sports betting quite often, Sturm said. So it's really, it's not a lucrative thing that we have to come to Vegas just to be able to do it.\n\nSturm is referring to the millions of people already betting online. The American Gaming Association estimates that people bet $150 billion on professional and college sports illegally every year.\n\nBut Sturm prefers to gamble and make bets in person.\n\nYou know you always wonder 'is there some element of cheating?' I guess, he said.\n\nAnd soon enough, Sturm and his friends might be able to make these bets — legally and in person — closer to their homes in Austin, Texas.\n\nIf something opens up in Texas, Olson says, I feel like I would be doing a bit more sports betting just year-round. Not just here in Vegas.\n\nBut he'll still head to Las Vegas for the experience: golf, cards, slots, shows, restaurants. And that is what bookmakers and casino executives are banking on. They hope that Nevada will be a model for newcomers to the regulated sports betting industry.\n\nYes, we've enjoyed a monopoly or a near monopoly on sports betting, but Las Vegas benefits when there there's interest in our field, in our field of entertainment sports, sports betting, gambling in general, said Jim Murren, the chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts International. It will promote activity, increase fan interest in the team, in the sport, in the league which we believe will in turn increase their interest in going to the sports mecca of sports betting and gambling: Las Vegas.\n\nMurren says people were also worried about Las Vegas when legal gambling went to other states and to Native American reservations.\n\nAnd yet Nevada has grown through that period of time, he said.\n\nMGM hopes to expand sports betting to its other properties in the United States and its online betting app. And with it becoming a legal and regulated industry, Murren said, it's just one more step toward erasing the stigma often attached to the industry as predatory.\n\nThe traditional view of the casino industry is starting to evolve, but it will be viewed much differently five years from now and this will be a major reason why, he said.\n\nCurrently, sports betting is a drop in the bucket of money made in Nevada off gaming. In the last fiscal year, Nevada took in $688.6 million in a tax fee on gambling and just over 2 percent of that came from sports betting according to the Nevada Gaming Association.\n\nThe association welcomed the ruling and offered its expertise to other states that will be regulating sports betting.\n\nBut what does this mean for bookmakers like Jimmy Vaccaro, who has been doing this work for 41 years?\n\nIt's a big day, Vaccaro said at the South Point Hotel and Casino just off the Las Vegas Strip. The in-house satellite radio station praised the decision as enlightened.\n\nNow with it being nationwide, it's going to have an impact, there's no doubt about it, he said. It will be a little less only because if you live in California, you don't have to run over here to make a bet, you could do it right from there.\n\nThere will be fewer people through the doors. But there will be plenty of opportunities a lot of other places for people like us to, in a sense, run their book for them, only because of what we have done, only because the way that we do business, only because of what we do and how we handle it, he says. We will get opportunities. I think the opportunity will outweigh drastically the little part that we lose people coming to the South Point.\n\nAll day, Vaccaro has been in meetings discussing the decision.\n\nThere is a lot to be ironed out to make sports betting lucrative — from state taxes in other places to whether the leagues get a cut of the bets.\n\nBookmaking has changed since Vaccaro started decades ago — betting has moved online and there is a higher cost to air professional football games. But bookmakers adapt, he says.\n\nWe're always reinventing ourselves.
'Middle Class Joe' No More: Biden Earned $15 Million Since Leaving Office\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joshua Lott/Getty Images Joshua Lott/Getty Images\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has referred to himself as middle class Joe throughout his political career, and used to regularly joke about being the poorest person on Congress.\n\nThose terms no longer apply.\n\nBiden and his wife, Jill, have together earned more than $15 million since Biden left office. That's according to tax returns and other financial disclosure forms released by Biden's campaign on Tuesday. The bulk of the Bidens' earnings come from book sales and paid speaking engagements – two routine sources of income for former high-ranking public officials.\n\nThe documents show Biden has earned far more than the rest of the 2020 presidential field, with the likely exception of billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race Tuesday.\n\nThe Bidens' adjusted gross income for 2018 was $4.5 million. It was even higher — $11 million – in 2017. They have paid a federal tax rate of just over 33% each year.\n\nBy comparison, Vermont. Sen Bernie Sanders earned $561,293 last year, California Sen. Kamala Harris reported $1,884,319. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren took in $846,394, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported $152,643.\n\nPresidential candidates typically don't release their tax returns until they've become their party's nominee. President Trump broke tradition and refused to make his tax returns public. As Democrats have continued to make that a political issue, the majority of the 2020 field have made their own financial information public. Biden's campaign points out that he's now disclosed the last 21 years of tax returns, including disclosures during his 2008 run and time as vice president.\n\nBiden's itemized financial disclosure shows that his income came mostly from his book Promise Me, Dad about his late son Beau Biden and the book tour that accompanied its release. He also made over $2 million from other paid speaking engagements, an average of over $127,000 per event. Event companies, universities, and community groups were among those who provided for Biden's paid speeches, but not major corporations or industry groups.\n\nThe Bidens gave $275,896 to charity last year. The rate – about six percent of their overall income – was higher than any other candidate except Warren, who also donated about the same percentage of her income.\n\nHere is the latest tax information from Biden and several of the other Democratic candidates who have reported it.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden (2018 return)\n\nAdjusted gross income: $4,580,437\n\nTaxes paid: $1,528,208, or 33% rate\n\nCharity: $275,796, or 6%\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (2018 return)\n\nAGI: $152,643\n\nTaxes paid: $20,136, or 13.2%\n\nCharity: $765, or 0.5%\n\nNew York Sen.

Alec Baldwin On Career Highs And Lows And Playing A 'Larger Than Life' Trump\n\nBaldwin is nominated for an Emmy for playing the president on SNL. In 2017, he told Fresh Air that he plays the character in a exaggerated way: It's kind of the Macy's Day Parade [version] of Trump.\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. We've devoted this week to revisiting interviews with some of this year's Emmy nominees. Today's guests are Alec Baldwin, nominated for his guest work playing President Donald Trump on NBC's Saturday Night Live, and Brian Tyree Henry, nominated for two different Emmys, one for comedy, for his role as Paper Boi on the FX series Atlanta and one for drama for a guest appearance on NBC's This Is Us.\n\nWe'll start with Alec Baldwin, who's memorable roles include a ruthless salesman in the film version of Glengarry Glen Ross and the network executive on NBC's 30 Rock. He won an Emmy for his portrayal on Saturday Night Live of Donald Trump last year and is nominated again for it this year.\n\nTerry Gross spoke to him in April 2017 when he published his memoir called Nevertheless. They began by playing a Saturday Night Live clip from 2017. Aliens have attacked the Earth. Kenan Thompson plays a military officer giving the troops a pep talk about how to save the human race. But first, he says, your commander in chief wants to say a few words. And he steps aside for President Trump, played by Alec Baldwin.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE)\n\nALEC BALDWIN: (As Donald Trump) Now, here's the deal. We are going to beat these aliens because we have got the best military. But we don't win anymore.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBALDWIN: (As Donald Trump) And the aliens are laughing at us. They're killing us, and they're laughing at us.\n\nKENAN THOMPSON: (As Military Officer) We know the aliens are killing us, sir. They have the most advanced weaponized technology we've ever seen. What should we do?\n\nBALDWIN: (As Donald Trump) OK, here's what we do. Here's what we're going to do. We are going to bring coal back, OK?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBALDWIN: (Donald Trump) We're going to have so much coal, you're going to say, where did all this coal come from? I never knew there could be so much coal.\n\nTHOMPSON: (As Military Officer) But, Mr. President, what about the aliens? They just vaporized the entire state of California.\n\nBALDWIN: (As Donald Trump) So then I won the popular vote?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTHOMPSON: (As Military Officer) Sir, please, everyone in California is dead.\n\nBALDWIN: (As Donald Trump) Even Arnold?\n\nTHOMPSON: (As Military Officer) Sir, yes. We are dealing with a highly advanced species here. They're from Zorblat-9. Their ships are invisible. They're telepathic.\n\nBALDWIN: (Donald Trump) OK, now, we don't know that they are from Zorblat-9. I've actually heard Zorblat-9 is very beautiful, very fantastic.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Oh, my God, does he have business ties on Zorblat-9?\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Alec Baldwin, welcome back to FRESH AIR. How did you start doing Donald Trump? And what stood out for you watching him that you thought you could do to caricature him?\n\nBALDWIN: Well, I think other people can certainly do Trump more deftly than I can. I don't think I really do the greatest impersonation of Trump, per se. But we're not doing it on film. We're doing it live on a TV show at 11:30 at night in front of a live audience. So there's a kind of - you kind of blow it up. You know, it's kind of the Macy's Day Parade...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: ...Of Trump. You know, it's a very larger-than-life thing. And I think in the back of my mind, maybe I could do him a little more precisely if we were in a different venue. But for this, you've got to pick a couple things, which is just his - I mean, I always say the same stupid thing to myself. I say, you know, left eyebrow up, right eyebrow down, stick your mouth out as far as you can like you're trying to bite somebody's nose off and kind of growl with that irritability.\n\nYou know, Trump is someone, to me, where the things I try to lock into and kind of hold onto just for that brief five minutes of the cold opening is that he's not having any fun. He doesn't shut up about how rich he is. He doesn't stop talking about how much money he has and how much privilege he has. And he just seems miserable. I mean, if he's an advertisement for wealth and privilege, then, good God, I think it's terrible.\n\nBut anyway, so we did that. And he was always straining to find a stronger, better word in his language and never found it. So you'd have him pause. You know, Trump is always in there going, you know, (imitating Donald Trump) the people that I work with, they're just really, really the most fantastic people. They're fantastic.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: You know, he just always - you see him digging in some bin. He's, like, in a filing room looking for another word. And he'll say, (imitating Donald Trump) my son-in-law Jared is really just an amazing young guy. He's amazing. He's just amazing. I think he has, like, a glossary of about, like, 200 words.\n\nGROSS: So Trump has negative tweeted about Saturday Night Live and about you in particular. I'll read a couple of tweets. This is October 16 at 7:14 a.m. (Reading) Watched Saturday Night Live...\n\nBALDWIN: (Laughter).\n\nGROSS: ...Hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election. December 4, 12:13 a.m. (Reading) Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable, totally biased, not funny. And the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad. And you responded (reading) release your tax returns and I'll stop (laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: Yes. Yes.\n\nGROSS: He hasn't released them. You haven't stopped.\n\nBALDWIN: No, I'm still waiting.\n\nGROSS: What was your first reaction when you realized that Trump was tweeting about your impersonation?\n\nBALDWIN: It is kind of absurd. Well, I mean, regardless of whether you're the subject of those tweets or one of them - 'cause all those tweets are kind of a multiple warhead, you know. He takes on the show, he takes on the press, he takes on me. But I think it's absurd that he would be doing that in the direction of anybody - any kind of comedy programming that's parodying him or commenting on him, whether it was Jon Stewart in his day and so forth or Colbert now. I find it amazing that he's doing that. And then when you think about it's me that he's doing it with, I find that even more surreal.\n\nGROSS: So let's talk a little bit about your memoir Nevertheless. One of the things I really enjoyed learning about you is that growing up in Long Island - Massapequa, Long Island, you watched a lot of old movies on TV. I grew up in New York City in Brooklyn and watched a lot of the same movie shows that you did - The Late Show, The Late Late Show, The Early Show. What was the Sunday afternoon thing you mentioned?\n\nBALDWIN: Picture For A Sunday Afternoon.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, Picture For A Sunday Afternoon. And then you explain in your book that you bonded with your father watching, like, the late-night old movies on TV and you bonded with your mother when you faked being sick and stayed home from school and watched daytime TV with her.\n\nBALDWIN: Dinah Shore.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, so I just thought that's so interesting that you became an actor and, like, TV, you know, like, movies and TV were ways of bonding with your parents. But - so with the movies that you saw on TV, what are the movies that you saw the most that made the biggest impression, ones that you were able to watch over and over?\n\nBALDWIN: I guess, you know, when I was young, my dad - I'm perfectly willing to see now that what I loved and what I was doing and what I was opening up my mind to was to communicate with my dad. He would come home from work. He'd lay on this day bed in the den of our house. There was a TV. And I'd sit in a chair and, you know, this was his sacred time, his alone time. No one could get near him or really, really bother him in the evening 'cause, you know, he'd get home sometimes, you know, 10, 11 o'clock. And sometimes I think he stayed away. Maybe he pretended he had a job at night, and he was really just doing something else.\n\nBut he was - it was tough. You know, he would come home and six kids and my mom - and I think everybody was just stressed out. And he'd be reading the capsule reviews in The Times' TV section. And my dad would say, wow, How Green Was My Valley. That's a good one. At 11:30, I'd say, can we watch How Green Was My Valley, Dad? I was 10 years old. He'd say, no, no, no. It's too late. He goes, well, let's just watch 10 minutes - 10 minutes, 15 minutes of How Green Was My Valley and you have to go to bed. I'd be like, sure, Dad, sure. It would work like a charm. TV comes on, How Green Was My Valley, my dad passes out on the couch. He falls asleep, and I watch all of How Green Was My Valley. I watched the whole thing. Some nights I actually got away with watching a piece of the next one that was on at, like, 1:15 in the morning.\n\nGROSS: In your memoir, you write that you learned lines from a lot of different films. So I'm going to ask you to do a passage from a film that you still remember.\n\nBALDWIN: (Laughter) Oh, God.\n\nGROSS: Yes? Yeah.\n\nBALDWIN: Well, I'll always remember, like, just lines that I used to think were funny. You know, like, those men - I loved men in movies who they always won. And they won in some funny way. Like, there's that time that Bogart has got - Elisha Cook Jr. has gotten him in the hotel. And he's walking him up to go meet Sydney Greenstreet in Maltese Falcon. And he's got the gun on him. And Bogart disarms Elisha Cook Jr. And he gets the gun away from him and he points the gun at him and says, come on. And he says, that will get you in real good with your boss.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: And I just love things like that, where the guy - the hero wins. And they really were great bad guys. I mean, they were - they made the bad guys really bad, you know, really bad. And, you know, Treasure Of The Sierra Madre - what's three times $35,000? I bet you $105,000 you fall asleep before I do, he'd say to those guys. So all those movies - you know, Bogart was, like, the great one. He was such a great actor and so different and so unique. But Cagney, Bogart, Paul Muni, Edward G. Robinson...\n\nGROSS: Wait, wait, wait - I'm going to stop you. Everybody used to do impressions of Cagney. All the comics used to do impressions of Cagney when I was growing up.\n\nBALDWIN: Yeah, yeah - when I was a kid, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Did you have a Cagney impression?\n\nBALDWIN: Cagney was - well, I mean, I always get the line wrong because I went back and saw the movie Public Enemy. I think he's got the guy in the trunk of the car where the guy goes - (imitating character) open up, open up. I can't breathe in here. I can't breathe. I don't have any air.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: And Cagney stands outside - Cagney goes, (imitating James Cagney) Air? You want air? I'll give you air - boom, boom, boom. And he shoots him through the trunk of the car.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBALDWIN: And I thought, God, what a horrible thing to say. (Imitating James Cagney) You want air? I'll give you air. And we used to do that. I'd lay in bed next to my mother. My mother was trying to sleep. She would take naps every day. This was when I was like 10, and my mother had six little kids. You realize - I look now at my children, my young children, and I realized my mother had little children. So they need to be constantly watched.\n\nWhen the kids - when my brothers and I got to be, all of us, got to be 16, 15, 14, my mother just opened the door and kicked us out of the house. She said, I don't care what you do. Just make sure you don't get hit by a car but get out. And she banished us from the house in the driving snow. She evicted us from the house. She just didn't want us in the house so she wouldn't lose her marbles. And - but when I was a little boy and I lay in bed next to my mother, my mother would be sleeping. And in this very quiet voice, you'd hear me go, (imitating James Cagney) Air? You want air? I'll give you air. Boom, boom, boom. My mother would hit me and say...\n\nGROSS: You all...\n\nBALDWIN: ...Lie still.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) You also used to watch Chiller Theater when you were growing up, which was the Saturday night late-night monster movie...\n\nBALDWIN: Chiller, yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...That Zacherley hosted. And my older brother would watch that, and I was allowed to stay up for a few minutes of it. And it terrified me. I fell in love with monster movies, you know, 'cause the things that really scare you...\n\nBALDWIN: Sure.\n\nGROSS: ...Then you fall in love with afterwards. So...\n\nBALDWIN: Lugosi, all those movies. Well, Lugosi...\n\nGROSS: Yeah, what really scared you when you were young? Yeah.\n\nBALDWIN: Oh, Dracula. I'd watch Dracula 50 times. (Imitating Bela Lugosi) Listen to them, children of the night. What music they make, he'd say.\n\nGROSS: I love that (laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: And then - love that one, and I love - my favorite line - Matthew Broderick and I always regale each other with our Claude Rains line readings from Invisible Man because we're Invisible Man junkies. And whenever Matthew and I see each other, we look at each other and say, (imitating Claude Rains) sit down, you fool, and let's have a decent fire...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: ...Because he says that to his enemy in the film. And the very first movie that I watched with my dad that I was - that made me an addict - was we would watch Million Dollar Movie. And Sorry, Wrong Number came on with Barbara Stanwyck and Burt Lancaster. And that movie scared the hell out of me. The idea that a man would pay people to kill his wife to collect the insurance - and I was probably 8 or 9 years old. And I was a complete idiot. I'd look at my dad and say, gee, Dad - I was like Dondi out of Dondi comics. I was like, gee, Dad, do people really do that, Dad? - pay people to kill their wives to get the insurance, Dad? My father would, like, glare over at my mother and go indeed they do, yes, indeed they do.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBIANCULLI: Alec Baldwin speaking to Terry Gross in 2017. He's nominated for an Emmy for his impersonation of President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live for the second year in a row. He won last year. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF AWREEOH SONG, CAN'T BRING ME DOWN)\n\nBIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's interview with actor Alec Baldwin. He's nominated this year for a guest actor Emmy Award for his portrayal of President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live. Terry spoke to him in 2017 when his memoir called Nevertheless was published.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nGROSS: So you grew up in Massapequa, Long Island, and - you point out - not the affluent part. There were two high schools. Your father taught at the one where the more prosperous families sent their kids, and you went to the other one. Your father taught history and economics. He coached football and riflery. He chaperoned dances, supervised weekend recreation programs, directed one of the school district's summer camp programs. And you say he was strict with you because he'd seen what happens to kids who go off the track and who start drinking or using drugs. So in what way was he strict with you?\n\nBALDWIN: Well, my dad grew up in Brooklyn. And I think my dad just, you know, he saw a tough part of Brooklyn. He played football at Boys High. He went to Syracuse and played football, and he was around some pretty tough people. And they moved to a tough - to Fort Greene when Fort Greene was not a good area like it is now. It's all been built up. And I think when he moved out to Long Island, like a lot of city dads, it was almost like we didn't move out here for you to get it wrong, you know?\n\nAnd he didn't realize - well, I take that back. He did realize, but I think he was puzzled with how to deal with the fact that people that moved out from the city brought all of the problems of the city with them as well - 'cause kids that are unoccupied, they're going to do drugs and drink and party and things like that. So my dad was very, very - I'm not going to say menacing, but he was very, very forceful with us.\n\nHe would, like, look at me and say - where are you going to go? I'd say, I'm going to go to my friend Jeff's house. He goes, what are you guys going to do? Did you leave the phone number with your mother? And everything was very calm and very officious. And then at the end he'd say, what time are you going to come home? I'd say, I'm going to be home at 10:30. And I'm tense the whole time. I mean, like, I'm waiting for the bomb to drop. He'd lean in and press his finger into my shoulder. And he'd say, if you're not back at this house at 10:30, I'm going to break every bone in your body. Do you understand me? And I was like, yes, yes. Oh, God. Oh, God. Yes.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: I was just terrified. I mean, that's what - other people who we grew up with, those dads had other things to withhold from their kids to control them. You can't use the boat this weekend. I'm going to take your car away. I'm going to take your allowance away. We had none of that. My father had nothing to give to us, you know, in addition to what was normal - our clothes and food and housing and if we needed money for certain - specific expenses related to our school and trips. But he wasn't handing out allowances ever. That was just - it didn't happen. We had to go out and earn our own money. And so the only thing he had was the fear program.\n\nGROSS: Did he ever use the threats? Did he ever...\n\nBALDWIN: I mean, there were times my dad would, like, you know, grab you by the shirt and, like, slam you up against the wall when you were, like, 15. That was a different generation. I mean, my dad wasn't somebody who was beating us with a pool cue. But he was someone who would - and every time he'd lose his temper and he'd grab you - and he was a pretty tough guy. My father was a very physically powerful, very tough guy when he was, especially when he was younger. He deteriorated very quickly in his 50s and died when he was 55 years old of cancer. But he never really got a chance to see me do what I do.\n\nI was doing this daytime TV show, which was fun. And it was important 'cause it was the beginning for me. But I just think about what I would have done to - you know, to show my dad how much I loved him and cared about him, too. You know, he - my dad was somebody who if - you know, I would have sent him around the world 10 times to enjoy himself to pay him back for what he did for me.\n\nGROSS: How did you decide to pursue acting in the first place? You were interested in politics. You ran for the president of George Washington University when you were a student there. You lost. And then it seems like a big switch from politics and history to acting.\n\nBALDWIN: Well, I think that, you know, the year ahead of me was kind of a gut year, as they used to say. I don't know if they use that term now. But I had done all my hard classes in my sophomore and junior year and got involved in student politics 'cause it interested me to a degree. And I wanted to go into politics and run for office and get a law degree to help supplement that or help to facilitate that. So I - my girlfriend broke up with me. I was in love with this woman when I was very young, and she said, I can't be with you 'cause you're not Jewish. Her grandparents told her to break up with me, and she did. Her grandparents said lose the shegetz boyfriend.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: And she did. And I go to visit a friend of mine. She says, why don't you audition for the acting program? I auditioned for the program. And I think, because I was...\n\nGROSS: Why did they say audition for the acting - like, what evidence was there that you had any...\n\nBALDWIN: I would hang out with them, and they'd say, oh, you're so funny. And, you're so cheery.\n\nGROSS: Oh, OK.\n\nBALDWIN: And you're such an animated person.\n\nGROSS: Were you doing impressions for them, too, of your favorite movie lines?\n\nBALDWIN: I would do - yeah. Air? You want air?\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Right.\n\nBALDWIN: I'll give you air.\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nBALDWIN: Whatever you were doing, your shtick. And then the next thing you know, a friend of mine, who was at NYU, her roommate was in the acting program. I went to visit my friend, and her roommate said, my God, you should audition for the program just for the hell of it. And I did. And I got in, and they gave me a need-based scholarship for the whole year there. And the joke in my family is that I called my parents, and my mother was apoplectic. I mean, she was screaming on the phone. What is wrong with you? And I said, I'm going to leave GW to go to NYU to study acting. And I said, now, Mom and Dad - I said, when I go back to New York as a returning New Yorker, I'm eligible for all of this financial aid that I lost when I left town. So when I went to D.C. - so actually, NYU was more expensive than GW, but it's going to cost you less money. And my father literally went, well, let's hear him out. Let's hear him out.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: And I moved there, and I said to myself, I'll do this for a year - one year only. I'll study. And if I get any kind of encouragement that I might have a career in this, I'll do it. And if I don't, I'm out. I'll go back to - I'll finish my poly-sci program and go to law school, and that's that. And I did the program for a year and got out. And I got a job right away, and I never stopped working since then.\n\nGROSS: Just one more question. I haven't heard you as the announcer of the New York Philharmonic radio broadcasts. I know you fell in love with classical music being stuck in traffic jams in LA and listening to the radio. Do you do, like, an announcer voice, the kind of voice you grew up with?\n\nBALDWIN: Yes. The guy that was the booth announcer, Robert Malley (ph), who was on the WOR booth announcer - they'd have the guy live in the booth in case there was a technical difficulty in the pre-digital age. And Malley would say, next on Million Dollar Movie, Barbara Stanwyck tells Gary Cooper where he can go on Ball Of Fire. And I used to sit there and go, my God. And when I did the Philharmonic, they'd say to me, you've got to articulate because you're going to be saying names. It took me 40 minutes to learn how to say Christoph von Dohnanyi.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: I was reading it going what the - Christoph. I'd say the Berlioz Symphonie fantastique Christoph von Dohnanyi conducts the New York Philharmonic. And I always pop the word New York 'cause I'm marketing. I'm selling. So I always go, this is the Mahler Ninth Symphony. Lorin Maazel conducts the New York Philharmonic 'cause I'm helping to sell the product.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: I'm a pitch man. I'm a pitch man. Anyway, thank you so much.\n\nGROSS: Alec Baldwin, thank you so much.\n\nBALDWIN: I love your show. Thank you for having me.\n\nGROSS: I'm so - thank you for doing it.\n\nBIANCULLI: Alec Baldwin speaking to Terry Gross in 2017. He's nominated this year for a guest actor Emmy Award for his portrayal of President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live. After a break, we'll hear from another of this year's Emmy nominees, Brian Tyree Henry nominated for two Emmys.

Who's Trading Bitcoin? South Korea Wants To Know\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ahn Young-joon/AP Ahn Young-joon/AP\n\nSouth Korea is requiring that anonymous transactions involving cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin be made traceable and that exchanges for digital currencies be subject to a 24.2 percent tax.\n\nSouth Korea is home to one of the world's largest bitcoin exchanges and is the third-largest market for it, behind Japan and the U.S.\n\nAlthough policy directives announced this week were telegraphed last month, they come at a time when bitcoin has been trending about 50 percent lower than its peak of nearly $20,000 in mid-December. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether, have also fallen sharply in the past week.\n\nSouth Korea's Financial Services Commission Vice Chair Kim Yong-beom said Tuesday that the new measures would take effect beginning Jan. 30.\n\nHe said it would keep foreigners without a South Korean bank account and minors younger than 19 from trading bitcoins and other digital currencies. Accounts that have been used until now to trade such currencies will be discontinued, Kim said.\n\nWe expect that cryptocurrency exchanges that are in danger of being exploited for money laundering will be thrown out of the market, Kim told reporters.\n\nReuters reports: The new requirements are meant to ensure that a cryptocurrency investor's money comes from a bank account owned by the same individual. Banks will be able to refuse to open accounts with cryptocurrency exchanges that do not disclose information about suspicious trading. They were told to closely monitor crypto trading that exceeds 10 million won ($9,338) a day or 20 million won ($18,676) per week and also accounts owned by corporations or groups and report any suspicious activity to the authorities.\n\nThe new tax is in line with what the government currently charges all corporations that earn more than 20 billion won ($18.7 million) per year.\n\nCointelegraph.com writes: Bithumb, which is the largest exchange globally at $2.85 [billion] daily trading volume as of press time, was hacked in February 2017, losing about $7 [million] in mostly Bitcoin and Ether. This security breach, along with several other breaches of South Korean exchanges, has recently been more definitively linked to North Korean hackers.\n\nEarlier this month, South Korea said it was considering a complete ban on trading bitcoins.
Ethics Agency Rejects White House Move To Block Ethics Waiver Disclosures\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nUpdated at 10:08 p.m. ET.\n\nThe Office of Government Ethics has rejected a White House attempt to block the agency's compilation of federal ethics rules waivers granted to officials hired into the Trump administration from corporations and lobbying firms.\n\nThe White House action, a letter to OGE Director Walter M. Shaub Jr. from Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, was first reported by The New York Times. The newspaper had earlier published a detailed account of lobbyists turned appointees who were granted waivers and now oversee regulations they previously had lobbied against.\n\nWith an ethics waiver, a federal official is free to act on matters that normally would trigger concerns about conflicts of interest or other ethical problems. Federal regulations say the waivers generally should be made public on request. The Obama administration routinely posted waivers online. The Trump administration has issued an unknown number and released none.\n\nShaub notified the White House and federal agencies in April that OGE wanted to see all ethics waivers issued by President Trump's administration. He set June 1 as the deadline. The broad request is known as a data call.\n\nMulvaney notified Shaub in a letter last week that the data call appears to raise legal questions regarding the scope of OGE's authorities. He said he wanted the data call put on hold until it is reviewed by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which advises the executive branch on constitutional questions and limits of executive power. The move could block the request for waivers indefinitely.\n\nShaub told the White House late Monday that his agency would continue collecting the ethics waivers. In a nine-page response, Shaub said that the OGE declines your request to suspend its ethics authority, adding that public confidence in the integrity of government decisionmaking demands no less.\n\nUnder federal regulations, OGE is supposed to oversee all waiver decisions throughout the government.\n\nOGE has a right to review any waiver, said former OGE Assistant Director Stuart Gilman. Referring to the data call, he said, It's not like somehow or other this is a special case.\n\nThe ethics waivers are supposed to be public documents, but the administration so far has not released them. An anti-Trump legal group, American Oversight, sued eight federal departments and agencies on Monday, arguing that ethics waivers should be released under the Freedom of Information Act. American Oversight had previously filed FOIA requests.\n\nThe Trump administration and OGE are fighting on other fronts, as well:\n\n-- OGE earlier this month announced a new certification document for Cabinet secretaries and other top-ranking appointees to show they are fulfilling the ethics agreements they signed before being confirmed by the Senate. Ethics agreements typically commit a nominee to avoid ethics violations through a blind trust, divestiture, recusal or similar action.\n\nThe document must be signed by the official. As with tax returns and other federal documents, false statements run the risk of penalties. There was no previous oversight of compliance.\n\n-- The White House has raised a conflict-of-interest question to challenge newly appointed special counsel Robert Mueller, who will oversee the FBI's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe issue is that other lawyers at Mueller's former law firm represent presidential daughter Ivanka Trump; her husband, Jared Kushner; and onetime Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Mueller never worked for those clients, but under ethics law he still could require a waiver for his new job. It's worth noting that while the White House suggests conflicts for Mueller, it obtained an ethics agreement for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. He needed it because, in his previous job as Oklahoma attorney general, he was a plaintiff in several lawsuits challenging EPA regulations.\n\n-- Last winter, Shaub used Twitter to exhort Trump into putting his hundreds of corporations into a blind trust. Trump instead put them into a revocable trust, where he can draw money from his businesses whenever he wants.
Youth Activists Are Heard In Biden's White House, But They Want To See More Action\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Zach Gibson/Getty Images Zach Gibson/Getty Images\n\nThe day before President Biden's allies on Capitol Hill were set to roll out his sweeping immigration overhaul, a group of activists rallied outside of the headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, projecting a message onto the building's façade.\n\nICE is deporting and torturing people, the all-caps message read. Abolish ICE and CBP, a reference to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe protesters were organized by United We Dream, the immigrant youth organization. United We Dream is one of a number of youth-led groups in regular contact with the Biden administration on key policy issues. While these activists are encouraged by what some described as open lines of communication to the White House, they say they're waiting to see whether that translates into policy victories.\n\nWhat we know and what I learned as an organizer is that access does not equal power,  said Greisa Martinez, the executive director of United We Dream. So we continue to organize.\n\nAfter a Democratic primary that was rife with generational tensions, Biden has so far managed to hold together the Democratic coalition that elected him, including the young people who turned out for Biden in droves. Now, younger Americans are confronting the intersecting crises of the coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, a national reckoning on race and justice and the urgent climate crisis.\n\nDemocrats control the levers of power in Washington with Joe Biden as the party leader, said Jesse Barba, a spokesman for Young Invincibles. And with it, they are having to own the outcome of how young people will weather the economic and health storms of the last four years.\n\nDuring the campaign, candidate Biden pulled out all the stops to make sure that young people knew the issues that mattered to them were deeply felt, in an effort to ensure that they would show up at the ballot box. Now, the Biden White House is acutely focused on making sure that those same young people feel heard.\n\nLeaders of youth-led movements have been invited to participate in regular meetings with administration officials, including Cedric Richmond, a Biden senior adviser and director of the White House Office of Public Engagement.\n\nI think there's a listening ear that's coming from the administration and Democrats on the Hill, for that matter, said Ben Wessel, the executive director of NextGen America, a progressive group dedicated to mobilizing young people. I think time will tell whether that listening ear becomes an action oriented or a legislative strategy.\n\nRichmond and Susan Rice, the head of the Domestic Policy Council, held a virtual meeting last week with more than a dozen youth activists focused on community violence prevention. The White House released an official readout of the meeting, saying that Rice and Richmond underscored President Biden's commitment to taking action to make our communities safer and to ensure that equity drives our policymaking across the federal government.\n\nOne of the activists involved in that discussion was Max Markham, the policy director for March For Our Lives, the group was founded by survivors of the deadly 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. He says he and his colleagues have been heartened by some of the conversations with the administration.\n\nWe have been vocal in our expectations that the Biden Administration has to have a plan and has to address gun violence as a public health emergency and that starts with staffing, that starts with who they're hiring and who they're empowering and the voices that they're amplifying, Markham said in an interview.\n\nWhile some activists say they appreciate having open lines of communication with the administration, including at its highest levels, they do not plan to stop asserting public pressure on the administration from the outside.\n\nMarch For Our Lives this week called on Biden to release a plan to curb gun violence in the first 100 days of his administration, that includes appointing a senior staffer as director of gun violence prevention to focus on the issue. March For Our Lives is also calling on Biden to leverage the Stafford Act, the federal disaster relief statute, to unlock $1 billion in funding to be used for community intervention programming and data collection with a public health lens.\n\nWe got the president into office and we expect results, Markham said. And we will make our voices known if that is not the case.\n\nThe early days of the Biden administration have been focused on meeting the immediate needs of the nation as it grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, including a $1.9 trillion emergency relief plan currently before Congress.\n\nMany young activists pointed to that package as a meaningful example of why it's so important that they be involved in policy conversations. The package now includes adult dependents among those eligible for stimulus payments.\n\nIn the two previous rounds of stimulus payments, adults who could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return were not eligible for money, a move that excluded more than 13.5 million adult dependents, according to the People's Policy Project.\n\nPeople think that adult dependents aren't having to pay their rent, aren't contributing to their own household income and well-being, said Sarah Audelo, the executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action. So there are some pieces that are very distinct to, 'Wow, this is an experience that someone who's 20 years old will only have.' So we need people who have that experience to be able to bring that perspective forward.\n\nPolicy tensions lie ahead\n\nMany organizers also say they're keenly aware that the administration is currently having its honeymoon period.\n\nAt some point, we're gonna run out of easy things to do, said Wessel. The to do list is going to get more challenging — things that are going to take a little more political courage and bravery, or a little more muscle in persuading the rest of America, not just young progressives.\n\nOne early point of tension came when Biden, speaking at a CNN town hall, outwardly rejected calls to eliminate up to $50,000 of student loan debt, a priority of many young organizers and liberal Democrats.\n\nI think there's just a lot of education clearly that needs to be done about who holds student debt, about the impact of student debt, said Audelo. I was hoping we were in a more positive place but then the town hall response was like, 'OK cool, we're like 15 years behind.'\n\nAnother potential point of conflict is the issue of immigration, with Democrats in need of at least 10 Republican votes in the Senate to pass Biden's sweeping immigration bill.\n\nThe proposal offers a path to citizenship for most of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. There have been steep political challenges to moving immigration legislation through Congress, and Republicans have already signaled resistance to Biden's legislation.\n\nGreisa Martinez of United We Dream said that part of the work that her organization and others are doing is engaging on policy with administration officials, but also being clear about what's at stake for folks outside of the administration.\n\nStill, Martinez is undeterred.\n\nIt's not just undocumented people that are clamoring for a different direction on immigration. It's millions of people that went out to vote and people are super clear that deportations and enforcement and detention is not the pathway that the majority of American voters want to go, and that's why they chose Joe Biden, Martinez said. What we know for sure is that we can't leave 2021 without any protection for people.\n\nSeeking more seats at the table\n\nThe demands of young organizers are sweeping in terms of policy, but they are also calling on the administration to bring more young people into the administration in meaningful ways.\n\nMany groups are calling on Biden to establish an Office of Young Americans within the White House and to appoint a director of youth engagement who will sit on the Domestic Policy Council.\n\nBiden does owe a lot to young people. But it's not just repaying us for helping him to get elected, it's making sure that he actually is working with us, said Charlotte Kerpen, the chair of the High School Democrats of America. For Biden to have a group of young people that he can really consult to, would make sure that the policies are not only reflecting the beliefs of young people, but are helping to make sure that in the future, the policies are representing what we have always believed. \n\nEarlier this month, the White House announced that Vincent Toranzo, a high school senior from Pembroke Pines, Fla., would serve on the administration's COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, aimed at addressing COVID-19 related health and social inequities.\n\nActivists pointed to other staffers with backgrounds in youth-led movements like Maggie Thomas, now the chief of staff in the Office of Domestic Climate Policy. She previously worked on the presidential campaigns of Democrats Jay Inslee and Elizabeth Warren, before helping to launch the climate group Evergreen.\n\nIn the past we've seen too often where there will be a public engagement arm and it's just separate from the actual policy work that's happening in an administration, said Audelo. And that's just unacceptable and that is not what young people are trying to do. They want to make sure that their concerns, that the unique perspective that young people have into the fight on climate, into the fights on the economy... that those perspectives, their ideas are reflected in actual policy discussions.
Trump Foundation's Tax Returns Reportedly Acknowledge Violating IRS Rule\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation has acknowledged in a tax filing that it violated the ban against self-dealing, or using its assets to help its leader's business or personal interests, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe Post quoted copies of the foundation's 2015 IRS tax returns, which had been uploaded, apparently by the foundation's attorneys, to a nonprofit tracking site called GuideStar. The newspaper said it hadn't yet confirmed whether the forms had actually been sent to the IRS.\n\nThe returns asked whether the foundation has transferred income or assets to a disqualified person or had engaged in any acts of self-dealing in past years. In both cases, the foundation checked the box for Yes.\n\nThere was no indication what the returns were referring to, or what kind of self-dealing might have taken place.\n\nTrump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nUnder IRS regulations, an admission of self-dealing by the leader of a nonprofit foundation can lead to a fine.\n\nThe Trump foundation has been accused of using its assets to pay debts incurred by Trump and his businesses over the past decade. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating the foundation.\n\nIn one case, the Post said Trump settled a dispute with Florida's Palm Beach County over the size of a flagpole at his Mar-a-Lago club by agreeing to make a donation to a veterans' charity. Trump made the donation using funds from the foundation, the newspaper reported.\n\nIn another case, Trump is said to have used funds from the foundation to settle a dispute with a man who made a hole-in-one at Trump's golf course in Westchester County, N.Y.\n\nTrump also reportedly used foundation funds to pay for items that he and his wife, Melania, bought at charity auctions, including a 6-foot-tall painting of Trump himself.
Trump, Pelosi Agree On Coronavirus Relief Bill. Next Hurdle: The Senate\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nUpdated at 12:54 a.m. ET\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the White House agreed Friday on relief legislation in response to the national emergency over the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe House passed the measure by an overwhelming vote Friday night.\n\nThe breakthrough followed hours of negotiations between the speaker and the administration, including more than a dozen phone calls on Friday between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about the priorities for the package.\n\nPresident Trump was reticent about the deal until the last moment, but he intends to sign the legislation when it reaches him, according to a source familiar with the White House's plans.\n\nThe president also wrote on Twitter on Friday evening that he encouraged Republicans and Democrats to join together in supporting the bill.\n\nPelosi told Democratic colleagues in a letter earlier on Friday evening that the agreement she'd struck with the administration responded to what she called her top priority: testing, testing testing.\n\nTo stop the spread of the virus, we have secured free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured, the speaker wrote. We cannot fight coronavirus effectively unless everyone in our country who needs to be tested can get their test free of charge.\n\nPelosi also told Democrats that the legislation would approve paid emergency leave; enhanced unemployment insurance; more food aid; and increased federal funds for health care.\n\nShe and House Democratic leaders had hoped to fast-track legislation they unveiled earlier this week but so far discussions with Republicans about possible changes hadn't gone smoothly enough to permit that.\n\nNational emergency\n\nTrump declared a national emergency related to the pandemic in a press conference on Friday afternoon at the White House.\n\nThe president said then in response to a reporter's question that he thought Democrats needed to yield more ground in their negotiations over the relief legislation, although he didn't go into detail.\n\nWe just don't think they're giving enough, Trump said. We could have something but we don't think they're giving enough. They're not doing what's right for the country.\n\nSeparately, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., sent a letter to House Democrats Friday afternoon noting that the speaker has literally been working around the clock on a deal.\n\nBut he said if one was not reached we will vote today on our bill, which incorporates nearly all of what the administration and Republicans have requested.\n\nOpposition to bloat\n\nSeveral Hill Republicans said they were worried that the latest version of the bill was bloated and were unwilling to make a final call on their support until the text is released.\n\nThere also were concerns among some GOP lawmakers that President Trump has not explicitly embraced the legislation, potentially leaving Republicans open to attacks if they voted for something Trump did not support.\n\nThe particulars in dispute included the economic aspects of any relief bill, including the prospect for emergency payroll tax cuts. President Trump wanted them; Democrats and a few Republicans didn't agree.\n\nThe president also faulted Pelosi and Democrats on Thursday for wanting goodies in coronavirus legislation that he said had nothing to do with what we're talking about. Those details weren't exactly clear.\n\nAlso unclear on Friday is the legislation's fate in the Senate.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., cancelled a recess planned for next week meaning that members would be in Washington to be able to vote — but it wasn't immediately clear how he and members might respond to the deal concluded between Pelosi and Mnuchin.\n\nMcConnell reacted coolly to the draft of the coronavirus bill as it stood earlier in the week.
Marijuana Pays For Schools In Colorado — Kind Of — But How Will It Help Maine?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy Luke Runyon, KUNC Courtesy Luke Runyon, KUNC\n\nVoters in Maine and a handful of other states are deciding whether to legalize recreational marijuana this November. One thing that could swing the vote is the possibility of millions of dollars in tax revenue from retail marijuana sales. Colorado was the first state in the country to roll out a tax scheme for legal marijuana in 2013, after recreational marijuana was legalized in 2012. So how are voters in Colorado spending the cash, and what should Maine voters expect?\n\nMaine, like a lot of other states, could always use more revenue, so the possibility of millions from legalizing marijuana is enticing. But many voters there are unsure how that money will be spent. Erin McGee Ferrell spoke to us in downtown Portland. McGee is a foster parent and says she doesn't get reimbursed much. She says that area is one state program that could use more funding.\n\nI know there's a lot of problems in terms of needing more money for health issues and people who are addicted to opioids. I mean, there's such a lack of money for children, and health issues, she says.\n\nThe mayor of Portland, Ethan Strimling, shares voters' concern. Specifically, he wants to know, how is the money from marijuana going to be dedicated to individual communities?\n\nAll we have at the local level is property taxes, Strimling says. It would be great if some of the revenue that's generated from this legalization could stay in the community where it's having the most impact.\n\nIn other words, to fund substance abuse programs to offset any of negative impact of legalization.\n\nIn Colorado, it's a mixed bag with regard to where the money from pot is spent.\n\nThe state has a slew of local and state taxes on retail marijuana. Almost everybody through the entire supply chain is paying into the system, including growers, testing laboratories and retail shops. To some extent, pot is paying for schools in Colorado, with much of the state tax revenue going toward school maintenance and construction - paying for things like new roofs and HVAC systems in rural school districts.\n\nBut Chris Stiffler, an analyst with the Colorado Fiscal Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, cautions against getting too excited about marijuana tax revenue.\n\nWe like to talk about it as if you were walking home today and you found a $20 bill on the ground, Stiffler explains. You wouldn't go home and buy a new car or new house. But you would maybe go out for a Chipotle burrito with guacamole and a margarita, right?\n\nHe says when voters in Colorado were considering legal marijuana, some of them thought that this was going to be a huge amount of money for education.\n\nThey want to know why they're not getting new schools, more teachers, why they're not getting better roads because they were promised so many marijuana dollars were going to fix and pay for the things that really drive their communities, Stiffler says.\n\nThe revenue is basically a drop in the bucket for the state budget. But for local communities, which can levy their own taxes on the marijuana industry, it appears that marijuana tax money can actually make more of a difference.\n\nTake Edgewater, Colorado, a small town of 5,300 people in the Denver metro area. The city has five retail marijuana shops and they're projected to bring in more than $1 million in marijuana tax revenue this fiscal year. To put that in perspective, their annual budget is $6 million, so that's one so that's one sixth that's coming from marijuana.\n\nMayor of Edgewater, Kris Teegardin says,Tax sales have been able to speed up major infrastructure improvements otherwise we that would have to take a very incremental approach to.\n\nOne of those improvements is road paving. Teegardin even jokes that maybe they should be paving the road in green to show people how their marijuana tax dollars are being spent. They're also putting money toward a brand new civic center and a police station. Other cities in Colorado are funding homelessness programs and mental health centers. But Teegardin is not banking on this money coming in forever.\n\nThis is something that we know could go away in the blink of an eye, he says. Or, it could have a downturn when other states legalize it or other municipalities decide to join, so we are really looking at a murky forecast for sales in the next three to four years.\n\nWith that in mind, tax analysts say the possibility of more revenue from pot shouldn't be the sole reason to support marijuana legalization because it may not be enough to solve big budgetary problems that states face.
If a Wealth Tax is Such a Good Idea, Why Did Europe Kill Theirs?\n\nEnlarge this image Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nNOTE: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.\n\nIn late January, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's in the race to become president in 2020, added a new kind of tax to the American conversation, causing anxious pacing on superyachts in every port: a wealth tax. It's a cousin of the property tax, but it encompasses all forms of wealth: cash, stocks, jewelry, thoroughbred horses, jets, everything. Warren calls the policy her Ultra-Millionaire Tax. It would impose a 2% federal tax on every dollar of a person's net worth over $50 million and an additional 1% tax on every dollar in net worth over $1 billion. Economists estimate it would hit the 75,000 richest households and raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.\n\nIt's a direct attack on wealth inequality, and it's influenced by the work of French economist Thomas Piketty, whose book Capital in the Twenty-First Century put a spotlight on the increasing disparity of wealth in developed nations. Warren, who informally endorsed a wealth tax while at an event with Piketty in 2015, is the first U.S. presidential candidate to take up the cause.\n\nThe disparity in what Americans own is much greater than the disparity in what they earn. Jeff Bezos has a net worth of $135 billion, but his formal salary is less than $100,000 per year. Warren's proposal aims to tap the fortunes of the ultra-rich and use the proceeds to fund social programs. But a wealth tax faces serious hurdles, including lessons from a failed experiment in Europe, the need for significant bureaucratic expansion, and serious questions over whether it's even constitutional.\n\nEuro Flop\n\nNormally progressives like to point to Europe for policy success. Not this time. The experiment with the wealth tax in Europe was a failure in many countries. France's wealth tax contributed to the exodus of an estimated 42,000 millionaires between 2000 and 2012, among other problems. Only last year, French president Emmanuel Macron killed it.\n\nIn 1990, twelve countries in Europe had a wealth tax. Today, there are only three: Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries—and, perhaps worst of all, it didn't raise much revenue.\n\nUC Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, whose research helped put wealth inequality back on the American policy agenda, played a part in designing Warren's wealth tax. He says it was designed explicitly with European failures in mind.\n\nHe argues the Warren plan is very different than any wealth tax that has existed anywhere in the world. Unlike in the European Union, it's impossible to freely move to another country or state to escape national taxes. Existing U.S. law also taxes citizens wherever they are, so even if they do sail to a tax haven in the Caribbean, they're still on the hook. On top of that, Warren's plan includes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of all a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.\n\nWarren's tax is also only limited to the super rich, whereas in Europe the threshold was low enough to also hit the sort-of rich. This higher threshold helps it avoid problems like someone having a family business that makes them look rich on paper but, in fact, they're short on the cash needed to pay the tax.\n\nAlso important, Zucman argues, the higher threshold means only a small group will be affected. And smaller groups have a harder time fighting for exemptions, which hurt European efforts. Some countries, for example, exempted artwork and antiques on the grounds they were hard to value. It's true, but it creates a huge loophole: Buy lots of art! Economists hate incentives like these because they distort markets. Warren's proposal calls for no exemptions.\n\nBureaucracy and the Constitution\n\nBut having no exemptions means the U.S. government will have to get very good at valuing art, diamonds, superyachts, and all the other fabulous things the super rich collect. Indeed, Warren's plan includes a call for a significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget. It was the hefty cost of enforcement that played a big part in Austria killing their wealth tax back in 1993. It turns out it costs a lot to track and value rich people's stuff every year.\n\nAnd a wealth tax may not even be legal. The ability of the federal government to tax is tightly curtailed by the U.S. Constitution. Legally imposing the first income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment. Legal scholars are currently debating whether a wealth tax would need another amendment. The debate, Josh Barro writes, centers on whether a wealth tax would be a direct tax, which the Constitution makes really hard for the federal government to impose.\n\nWhile the legality of a federal wealth tax is in question, the current politics of it are not. A new poll finds that even a majority of Republicans support Warren's wealth tax. It turns out President Trump himself once advocated for one too.\n\nA Local Problem with a Global Solution\n\nIt's been roughly five years since Piketty published Capital in the Twenty-First Century. One of the book's central arguments was that the rate of return on capital will be higher than the rate of economic growth (r>g) and, as a result, the wealthy will continue seeing their fortunes increase faster than everyone else's.\n\nHis solution was a wealth tax, but he recognized that exemptions and freedom of travel had doomed the European experiments. So he suggested a global wealth tax: The whole world would decide to do one thing at one rate. That such a solution is highly unlikely is a perfect symbol for the difficulty of getting money from people with the best accountants, the best lobbyists, and the best boats.\n\nDid you enjoy this newsletter?

History Shows Christmas Can Be A Powerful Motivator On Capitol Hill\n\nSince George Washington's raid on Trenton, the words Christmas, Washington and crisis have gone hand in hand.\n\nLAUREN FRAYER, HOST:\n\nIf Congress seems to have gotten more done in the last week than in the rest of the year, that may not be an accident. Christmas, or rather the possibility of missing Christmas, can be a powerful motivator on Capitol Hill. That's according to our NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving, the man we call Professor Ron.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE CROSSING FILM)\n\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: The first time the words Washington, Christmas and crisis all came together in our history was our first December together as a nation, 1776, the year of the Declaration of Independence and the full-scale outbreak of the Revolutionary War.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, THE CROSSING)\n\nJEFF DANIELS: (As General Washington) We became a nation on the 4th of July, six months ago.\n\nELVING: Things were not going well for General Washington and his ragtag colonial army.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, THE CROSSING)\n\nDANIELS: (As General Washington) Since then we have lost New York. Congress has fled from Philadelphia because we cannot defend it. We have lost every battle.\n\nELVING: But in the stormy darkness of Christmas night...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, THE CROSSING)\n\nDANIELS: (As General Washington) I propose that on the eve of December 25th, we cross the river, march on Trenton.\n\nELVING: To attack an enemy outpost.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, THE CROSSING)\n\nDANIELS: (As General Washington) And if God is with us, we'll take the whole lot of them.\n\nELVING: They surprised and overwhelmed the opposing troops, many of whom were still recovering from the indulgences of Christmas Day. It is said that Washington got his troops pumped up for this midnight outing with readings of a new pamphlet by Thomas Paine, called, The American Crisis.\n\nPETER BRESLOW: (Reading) These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country, but he stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.\n\nELVING: It turns out the historical evidence for Paine's pamphlet actually being read to the troops on the banks of the Delaware that night is a little spotty, but we do know Paine's Crisis was in fact a part of George Washington's media mix. And the words themselves still stir American hearts, as they have in times of war and want for generations.\n\nBRESLOW: (Reading) Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered, yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.\n\nELVING: When George Washington became our first president, we took a little time to establish the dollar as the currency for all states, but that got done over a Christmas session. For generations thereafter, Congress remained technically in session over Christmas, not out of disrespect, but just in case urgent business might require it. And the prospect of needing a Christmas session helped make the preceding weeks and months more productive. Deadlines, of course, are made to be stretched, and sometimes things got out of hand. Take the first Christmas of Lyndon Johnson's presidency in 1963.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL NEWSREPORT)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED NEWSCASTER: Honorable wheat harvests are a way of life in the United States.\n\nELVING: The House got caught up wrangling over a foreign aid bill that included selling wheat to Russia, which in those days was still the Soviet Union.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL NEWS REPORT)\n\nNEWSCASTER: American ships are to carry the grain, and government officials say there will be other benefits to the economy.\n\nELVING: Some members had already left town and had to be summoned back to muster the necessary votes.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FESTIVE MUSIC)\n\nELVING: Johnson, who had spent more than 30 years toiling in the House and Senate himself, appreciated this special effort and threw a little Christmas party for the inconvenienced members.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS)\n\nJUDY GARLAND: (Singing) Have yourself a merry little Christmas.\n\nELVING: But back in town, members felt entitled to speechify on the floor, prompting one of the few women in Congress at that time, Katharine St. George of New York, to suggest that they all just put their remarks in writing in the Congressional Record. Future generations yet unborn will be able to see them, she said, but those of us who are here on this Christmas Eve need not listen to them.\n\nMore recently, the notion of Christmas carols being sung on the Senate floor got real in the first year of President Obama's presidency.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBARACK OBAMA: I returned to speak to all of you about an issue that is central to that future, and that is the issue of health care. I am not the first president to take up this cause, but I am determined to be the last.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nELVING: President Obama's Affordable Care Act was passed on Christmas Eve of 2009.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOE BIDEN: The yeas are 60. The nays are 39. H.R.3590 has amended the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is passed.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nELVING: A few years later, conflicts between Obama and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives led to the so-called fiscal cliff. It was 2012. Obama had just been re-elected, and failure to strike a deal was about to cost taxpayers billions in spending cuts and tax increases. John Boehner, who was at the time the speaker of the House, exchanged offers and counteroffers with the White House.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOHN BOEHNER: Now, even if we did exactly what the president wants, we would see red ink for as far as the eye can see. Now, if the president doesn't agree with our approach, he's got an obligation to put forward a plan that can pass both chambers of the Congress.\n\nELVING: That showdown just five years ago kept a lot of people working in Washington straight through Christmas week and New Year's Eve until an agreement was struck. It might have gone down to the wire this year, too, but deals got done this past week and Congress finally got out of town.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS)\n\nLIBERACE: (Singing) And away they all flew, like the down of a thistle.\n\nELVING: But I heard them exclaim as they flew out of sight...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS)\n\nLIBERACE: Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.\n\nELVING: Ron Elving, NPR News, Washington.\n\nFRAYER: In addition to Professor Ron, you heard WEEKEND EDITION producer Peter Breslow reading Thomas Paine, and Jeff Daniels playing George Washington in The Crossing.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF LIBERACE'S 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS)\n\nFRAYER: You're listening to WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

The Week Ahead In Politics\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nAmidst all the political turmoil, including top White House staffers resigning after reports of domestic abuse, tomorrow, the president will release his budget. Now, normally a presidential budget would be big news, but this time, it's a bit anticlimactic. Why? NPR political correspondent Mara Liasson is about to tell us. Good morning, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So it seems a little strange to be talking about why something doesn't matter, but here we are, saying President Trump's budget - which is being released tomorrow - suddenly isn't that important. How did that happen?\n\nLIASSON: Presidents' budgets are always political documents. They're not a piece of legislation, but they do express the president's priorities. And, of course, the cliche is to say that the president's budget is dead on arrival on Capitol Hill. This one is probably dead as a doornail. And the reason is that Republicans and Democrats just passed a massive, two-year spending bill, which raises the caps for domestic and defense spending. And the White House was mostly a bystander in those negotiations. So what the president says in his budget tomorrow will not affect spending very much. Congress probably won't be passing a 2019 budget resolution. The bottom line is, in this instance, Congress seems to be ignoring the president.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Oh, OK. But when the budget comes out tomorrow, the spotlight will probably turn to White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, right? He was famously hawkish on the deficit when he was in Congress. What will he have to say?\n\nLIASSON: Well, we're looking forward to what he has to say about this because he really personifies the total reversal by Republicans about deficit spending. They've done a 180-degree turn on this. Most economists say what they just did was fiscally irresponsible, exactly the opposite of what you want to do when the economy is booming, and there's low unemployment. You would rather run a small deficit or a surplus, so you have some room to spend if the economy does go into a recession, which - most economists think it will in the next couple of years because this expansion is getting so old. But instead, Republicans passed a tax cut that adds $1.5 trillion dollars to the deficit. Now the spending bill treasury just announced it's going to issue almost a trillion dollars of new debt next year. That's an 84 percent increase.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Wow.\n\nLIASSON: So this is exactly the kind of thing that Republicans railed against when Obama was in office. And Senator Rand Paul, in his brief effort to hold up that funding bill, asked, are we only for fiscal responsibility when we're in the minority? And I guess the answer is yes.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Yes. What about the issue of immigration, which is, of course, tied to budget deal-making in Congress right now? Where does that stand, and where does the president stand?\n\nLIASSON: President Trump has laid out four pillars of the deal that he wants after he lifted the protection from deportation for these young people called DREAMers or DACA recipients. They were protected from deportation by President Obama. Trump lifted that protection. He gave Congress a deadline of March 5 before he says he'll start deporting those kids. What Trump wants is a path to citizenship for these kids. In exchange, he wants an end to the diversity lottery, an end to family reunification migration - he calls it chain migration. And, of course, he wants funding for the wall.\n\nWhat's interesting is when you listen to people on Capitol Hill, including Republicans in Senate leadership, they are really only talking about two of the president's four pillars. In other words, they want border security and wall funding in exchange for some kind of a path to legalization or citizenship for the DREAMers. They think a smaller, more narrow deal is more doable. So most Republicans also think that Donald Trump will sign whatever Congress sends him on immigration. Otherwise, he has to start deporting the DREAMers. Either way, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised that he would put a bill on the floor this week with an open process. That means amendments, votes, old fashioned legislating - something we haven't seen in a very long time in Washington.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Something to look forward to. NPR's political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks, Mara.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And elsewhere in our program, we'll get the details of that congressional spending bill.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

To the Editor:\n\nRe Iowa Drive Is Opening Battle for School Choice (front page, March 22): The use of tax funds to support religious schools raises a constitutional issue, but more than that a question of fairness.\n\nAfter all, we all pay taxes. Is it fair for Protestants, Jews, Muslims and atheists to pay for religious instruction in Catholic schools? Or for Catholics to pay for Protestant instruction?\n\nThere is a reason the Constitution separates church and state, and not only to prevent state-sponsored religious indoctrination, but also to require that taxes should be religiously neutral.\n\nThe Constitution is a remarkable document, of which some parts remain opaque and in need of constant interpretation, but the question of fair use of tax dollars is profoundly clear.
American arts institutions ought not to give up their independence for crumbs. For now, especially as the pandemic subsides, the more urgent task is to encourage a richer cultural offering at the local level. A nimbler and more practicable solution to do that is with a White House Office for Culture, akin to the National Economic Council or the Domestic Policy Council, that could research and coordinate arts policy across the federal government.\n\nAn arts center inside the executive office of the president — led, why not, by a Dr. Fauci of culture — could be sharper and swifter than a full department. This team could help Treasury create cultural tax policy, advise the Education Department on music instruction, liaise with Congress on arts stimulus. Importantly, it could ensure that stimulus funds for states and municipalities, whose budgets have been pitted by shutdown-induced tax shortfalls, shore up and eventually strengthen local arts organizations. (Almost no one has been hurt more by Covid than our artists, said Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York this week, when he announced a public-private partnership supporting the state's arts organizations.)\n\nThe new administration should also re-establish the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, whose members resigned en masse in 2017 after Mr. Trump's response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. (The artists who resigned included the director George C. Wolfe, the author Jhumpa Lahiri, the actor Kal Penn and the architect Thom Mayne.) To use a metaphor I detest but politicians seem to like, this committee should be the sizzle to the steak that is the Office for Culture. Any transformation this large needs a sales pitch; well-known actors, writers and musicians should be the pitchmen, linking Broadway and Hollywood to the town library and the school theater.\n\nDuring last year's campaign, Mr. Biden had a phrase he invoked with almost musical regularity: the election, he always said, was a battle for the soul of America. As a piece of political rhetoric, it might have been just a platitude. How can I deny, though, that the near-sacking of the Capitol — in a week when, for the first time, the daily death toll from Covid-19 reached an unendurable 4,000 Americans — indicates that the United States has undergone, these last years, a kind of soul-death? And if you were treating a patient whose soul had curdled, what sort of medicine might you prescribe?\n\nI've always been wary of arguments about art's necessity. But a soul-sick nation is not likely to recover if it loses fundamental parts of its humanity. Without actors and dancers and musicians and artists, a society will indeed have lost something necessary — for these citizens, these workers, are the technicians of a social catharsis that cannot come soon enough. A respiratory virus and an insurrection have, in their own ways, taken the country's breath away. Artists, if they are still with us in the years ahead, can teach us to exhale.
It's time to see the numbers.\n\nInvestors are about to get a read on the health of corporate America, as businesses begin releasing quarterly profit reports and laying out expectations for the coming year.\n\nThe results may resolve a roaring debate on Wall Street that has pitted economists, who have argued that the economy remains healthy, against investors, who pushed stocks to the brink of a bear market over concerns that growth is waning.\n\nAs we hear from more companies about how the year ended, we'll get more color on which side has a better feel, the economics community or the equity community, said Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nOn the whole, the numbers are expected to be solid. Analysts estimate that, when all the results are in for S&P 500 companies, fourth-quarter profits will have risen 15 percent over a year earlier. That would be the fifth-straight period of double-digit profit growth, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
How did we get into this sorry situation? A meltdown of this magnitude typically has many causes. In this case, the president's inability to reach some sort of deal rests heavily on several basic failures of understanding by him and his team. These include:\n\n1. A failure to grasp how divided government works. The president somehow came to believe that he'd have more leverage once the Democrats took control of the House. Maybe someone convinced him that, after the transfer of power, he could shift blame for the impasse onto Speaker Nancy Pelosi — a favorite villain of Republicans. Or maybe he assumed that Pelosi & Company would fold in the face of the dysfunction and public outcry a shutdown would bring. Whatever the logic, Team Trump assumed Democrats would b ecome more pliable , and a deal would emerge.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. Trump has been spoiled by two years of Congress being led by weak-kneed members of his party who, even when troubled by his excesses, largely let him run amok, lest he call down upon them the wrath of the Republican base.\n\nBut for their part, Ms. Pelosi and her new majority are concerned about presenting a united front against Mr. Trump's challenges to constitutional authority. With the president's wall having become a flash point, the political costs to Democrats for cutting a deal seen as advantageous to Mr. Trump would be steep.\n\n2. A failure to understand the costs of playing only to the base. While Republican lawmakers may be awed by Mr. Trump's command of their party's troops, Democrats are more motivated by the fact that the bulk of the electorate is tired of the president's divisive demagogy. Time and again, Mr. Trump has chosen partisanship over leadership, doing nothing to expand his appeal. This puts him at a disadvantage in wooing the public to his side of the wall debate.\n\n3. A failure to understand Nancy Pelosi. Apparently, Mr. Trump never got around to reading The Art of War, or at least not Sun Tzu's admonition to know your enemy. If he had, the president would have tried to develop at least a basic working relationship with Ms. Pelosi. The White House clearly assumed that, at some point — maybe after she secured the speaker's gavel — Ms. Pelosi would bend to Mr. Trump's will. But the speaker is not impressed with bluster. She is seldom cowed by political pressure from her own team, much less the opposing one. She plays the long game, and her will is as formidable as Mr. Trump's, possibly more so. One key difference: Ms. Pelosi knows how the legislative process works.
To the Editor:\n\nRe Our Democracy, Though Resilient, Isn't Unbreakable, by Susan D. Hyde and Elizabeth N. Saunders (Op-Ed, Dec. 16):\n\nYes, President Trump tried to break our democracy and turn the United States into an authoritarian state controlled by him. He failed — because of the safeguards the founding fathers built into the Constitution. The framers were fearful of a rogue tyrant abusing the power of the presidency, as Mr. Trump did over and over during his four years.\n\nWe can be grateful that Mr. Trump failed and will be gone in a few weeks. Mr. Trump may have weakened our democracy, but whether that weakening is fatal is up to us.\n\nWe now know that it is essential to harden the boundaries that future presidents must abide by and provide specific legal remedies when they fail to do so. We must require the release of tax returns before running for president and that the president's assets be placed in a blind trust during his or her presidency.\n\nThere must be laws that limit self-dealing, executive privilege, sale of presidential pardons, and claims of absolute immunity from investigation and prosecution.
Executives used to fear the activist investor.\n\nNow, there is an activist in the White House and many of those same executives have been making pilgrimages to Trump Tower and the White House, hoping their business plans don't get swept away by the changes made by the new president.\n\nPresident Trump was clear when he met with business leaders on Monday: Bring back domestic manufacturing jobs or face punishing tariffs and other penalties.\n\nOn the same day, he abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, effectively declaring an end to the era of multinational trade agreements. He said the decision would protect American workers, but some worry that such moves will allow China to fill the economic vacuum.\n\nAnother big issue that these companies are likely to face is how they use repatriated cash if tax reforms are passed in Washington. Mr. Trump made job creation central to his campaign, but many chief executives want to use repatriated cash to do stock buybacks and make deals instead.
Mike Lowry, a former five-term Democratic member of Congress whose one term as governor of Washington State was tarnished by sexual harassment allegations, died on Monday. He was 78.\n\nHis family announced his death, from complications of a stroke, in a statement issued by Gov. Jay Inslee in Olympia, Wash.\n\nMr. Lowry was elected to the House from Washington's Seventh Congressional District, in the Seattle area, in 1978 and was easily re-elected four times.\n\nHe was a leading Democratic critic of President Ronald Reagan's economic policies, even when they were wildly popular. He also opposed the president's arms buildup and restrictions on abortion.
Our concern is the additional costs that are starting to pop up in the process, the mayor said on Tuesday while unveiling the city's $84.7 billion budget proposal. We put forward a proposal around 421-a, with very simple standards: Reduce exposure for taxpayers, and that means city taxpayers, because we have to pay the bill; more affordable housing; and, don't fund luxury housing. It was really simple.\n\nCity officials and developers have argued that the construction of rental buildings would halt without 421-a benefits. The number of permits taken out by developers soared in the first half of 2015, in anticipation of the program's expiration.\n\nThe number of permits plummeted in the first half of 2016, but recovered some in the second half, leading some low-income housing advocates to suggest scrapping 421-a, because it is too costly and does not focus enough on the poor tenants who need it most.\n\nBut, Mark Willis, a research fellow at New York University's Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, said that property tax exemptions are essential to development of mid-rise housing in areas with moderate- to low-market rents. If fewer mixed-income units were built, he said, it could only intensify our current affordable housing crisis.\n\nUnder the governor's proposal, developers who set aside 25 to 30 percent of a project's apartments for low- and moderate-income tenants, can get a full property tax exemption for 35 years, compared with less generous subsidies in either the 2015 legislation or the mayor's proposal.
One of his targets is the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Kathleen Kraninger, whom Mr. Brown said he had advised during a phone call to resign. A bureau spokeswoman said that the two had last spoken on Dec. 10 and that Mr. Brown had thanked Ms. Kraninger for keeping him informed of the bureau's actions and rationale. Ms. Kraninger, the spokeswoman said, informed Senator Brown that she was supporting the requests from the transition team and how she would continue to carry out the bureau's mission.\n\nMr. Brown's staff, the senator said, is also compiling a list of rules made final by Trump appointees, including Ms. Kraninger, so Democrats could try to scrap them using the Congressional Review Act, a law that lets Congress vote to reverse regulators' actions.\n\nMr. Brown, who was elected to his third term in 2018, said the committee's first order of business would be to use congressional action to keep landlords from evicting people who could not pay their rent because of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on their finances. He said Democrats wanted to provide additional pandemic relief and work quickly to confirm President-elect Joseph R. Biden's nominees — all while an impeachment trial of President Trump could be playing out.\n\nIn the longer term, Mr. Brown said, he wants to get the Federal Reserve to set up bank accounts for members of the public who don't have accounts at commercial banks. The so-called public option would allow users to cash paychecks and receive government benefits, such as refunds from a new child tax credit that he and other Senate Democrats have proposed.\n\nBig banks have long resisted the idea of a public alternative to their services and have explored ways to pre-empt the creation of such a system. Early last year, for example, JPMorgan Chase officials discussed placing the company's banking services like A.T.M.s in some post offices, although the plan was abandoned when the pandemic hit. Bank lobbyists have argued that the responsibilities of financial services would overwhelm public institutions like the Postal Service and that banks can carry out the duties more efficiently themselves.\n\nBut millions of people still do not have access to any kind of bank account, and Mr. Brown said the fees they paid for check-cashing services and payday loans were the kinds of expenses that kept them at the lowest levels of America's economic strata.\n\nTo help remove that burden, Mr. Brown called for a 36 percent cap on interest rates for payday loans. At the moment, rate caps vary by state.\n\nMr. Brown has already raised some of his agenda with his Republican colleagues. He said he and Mr. Toomey had taken advantage of an unexpected opportunity to discuss the committee's future: They put their heads together last Wednesday, while both were locked for hours in a secure location as rioters stormed the Capitol.
After enduring years of street noise in their apartment in Flushing, Queens, Devanivas Gandham, 58, and his wife, Wilma, 55, began looking for a quieter place several years ago. We saw many, many houses, Mr. Gandham said. And we didn't like anything. Then a cousin who lived in Valley Stream, on Long Island, alerted them to a promising listing.\n\nFrom visits, they knew that Valley Stream — a village in Nassau County, in the town of Hempstead — was neat, clean and safe, Mr. Gandham said, so they arranged to see the house. With six bedrooms and three baths, it was big enough to accommodate not just the couple, but also their grown children: their son, Christi, 32, and daughter, Sherleen, 29. (It's an Indian custom, Mr. Gandham said, for unmarried children to live with their parents.) They bought the house in 2015 for $514,000.\n\nTheir new home is convenient to all of the Gandhams' jobs. Mr. Gandham, an echocardiography technician, and his wife, a laboratory technician, work in Manhattan; their children, both physicians, work in Queens. But even better, Mr. Gandham said, life in Valley Stream eases our stress and strain — it's quiet, calm, secluded.\n\nChristopher and Kristen DeVoe, both 36, were also familiar with Valley Stream before buying their three-bedroom, one-bath ranch house for $305,000 in 2010. They had been living there with their son, Tyler, then 3, in a one-bedroom apartment in the house of Mr. DeVoe's grandmother when they learned they were expecting another child. We knew we needed a bigger place, Mr. DeVoe said. And Valley Stream was affordable.

But Poly Prep Country Day School, a private school in Brooklyn with more than $114 million in the bank, got a $5.83 million P.P.P. loan. Public schools in Washington, D.C., averaged $189,000 in federal funding. But a P.P.P. loan for $5.22 million went to the Sidwell Friends School, the Washington alma mater of Sasha and Malia Obama.\n\nThis week, as the federal government releases a second round of P.P.P. loans, watchdog groups are following the money. From its start, the $659 billion program, intended to help struggling mom-and-pop businesses and nonprofits cover their payrolls with loans backed by the Small Business Administration, has been troubled by complaints that the rich and connected had crowded out intended recipients.
I.R.S. Tries to Fix Millions of Misdirected Stimulus Payments This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of markets, business and the economy.\n\nThe I.R.S. is trying to redirect millions of stimulus payments that went to unused accounts. Some Americans who used tax preparation services have temporary accounts on file with the I.R.S. Credit... Eric Gay/Associated Press The Internal Revenue Service misdirected stimulus payments for an estimated 13 million accounts, but the agency on Friday said it is trying to redirect to the money to the proper place. If you're anticipating a stimulus payment that hasn't yet landed, continue to monitor your bank accounts — and your snail mail. The I.R.S. was taking immediate steps to get stimulus payments to the correct accounts, the agency said in a statement on Friday. Many additional taxpayers will receive payments following this effort, the IRS added. Here's what happened: Millions of payments were sent to temporary accounts, which are often set up by companies like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt when they prepare returns. They use the accounts when customers opt to have their preparation fees deducted from their refund, for example, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest. The accounts may then be closed or become inactive — but may remain linked to the taxpayer's I.R.S. records. Tax prep companies have said they're working with the I.R.S. to resolve the issue. TurboTax said affected customers can expect to receive direct deposits starting on Friday. You can check the status of your stimulus payment through the I.R.S.'s Get My Payment tool. If it says your payment was sent to an account you do not recognize, it's not necessarily an indication of fraud, the I.R.S. said. It might just mean you were linked to a temporary account, and you should continue to watch your bank account for a deposit. More than 100 million stimulus payments have already been deposited directly into recipients' accounts, the I.R.S. said. About 8 million payments will arrive in the mail on prepaid debit cards. By law, the I.R.S. said, it must issue the stimulus payments by Jan. 15. After that, those who are entitled to a payment but haven't received one must instead claim a credit on their 2020 returns. Filers can fill the so-called Recovery Rebate Credit on line 30 of the 2020 Form 1040 or 1040-SR.\n\nFord will idle a Kentucky factory as the auto industry grapples with a semiconductor shortage. A Ford Exposition SUV being assembled in Louisville, Kentucky. Credit... Nick Carey/Reuters Ford Motor said on Friday that it will idle a plant in Louisville, Ky., for one week beginning Monday because of a shortage of semiconductors that is causing disruptions in auto factories around the world. Ford's Louisville assembly plant operates two shifts a day, employs about 4,000 workers, and makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair sport-utility vehicles. The automaker said it would cancel a week of downtime scheduled for later in the year at the plant to leave its output unchanged for the year A second Ford plant in Louisville has not been affected by the semiconductor shortage. That plant makes the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Explorer S.U.V.s, and the company's F-series Super Duty pickup trucks. Volkswagen last month warned that the semiconductor shortage would likely cause production delays at its plants in China and elsewhere. Honda and Nissan have also been affected by the shortage, according to Nikkei, the Japanese news organization. General Motors said on Friday that it has not been affected by the shortage but is monitoring the matter closely. Semiconductors play an increasingly important role in cars, controlling engines, brakes, transmissions, driver displays and other systems. Earlier this year, when auto sales fell because of the coronavirus pandemic, semiconductor manufacturers shifted their production to chips used for consumer electronics, Volkswagen said last month. Auto sales have since rebounded, leading to shortages of automotive-grade semiconductors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo compete with Tesla, G.M. will promote its electric cars and adopt a new logo. General Motors is introducing a new logo, replacing one that it had for nearly 50 years. Credit... via General Motors General Motors wants to shake up its image. The automaker said on Friday that it would start a marketing campaign next week to highlight a new corporate logo and the battery technology it had developed for use in at least 30 electric vehicles it intended to introduce over the next five years. The 113-year old company wants to reposition itself as a forward-looking producer of high-tech electric vehicles and to shed its reputation for being plodding and unexciting. Company officials believe its image has hampered their efforts to compete with Tesla, the maker of luxury electric cars. Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, are widely admired in the business and automotive world. The company's reputation for innovation has helped build a following of customers, fans and investors. The stock market values Tesla at more the $800 billion, more than many large automakers combined. G.M. makes far more vehicles and is substantially more profitable but has a market value of around $60 billion. G.M. will use the tagline, Everyone in, and some of the company's ads will feature the author Malcolm Gladwell. G.M. is hoping the campaign will help spark a mass E.V. movement, said Deborah Wahl, the company's global chief marketing officer. G.M. has used its current square logo, which contains the letters GM against a blue background, for nearly 50 years. The new logo uses lowercase blue letters against a white square outlined by a blue border with rounded corners, designed to resemble an electrical outlet or plug. Our traditional logo is more severe, Ms. Wahl said. We felt a need to show the world a different aspect of what we are doing. G.M. plans to spend $27 billion over the next five years on new electric vehicles using a modular battery design that it is counting on to lower costs and make its cars and trucks more affordable and appealing. We really believe this is an inflection point for E.V.s, she said.\n\nMarkets continue to climb, shaking off a grim jobs report. By: Ella Koeze · Data delayed at least 15 minutes · Source: FactSet Financial markets continued to rally on Friday, fueled by bets that a Democrat-led government in Washington would robust fiscal stimulus and despite fresh evidence that the United States economy is backsliding as the pandemic surges. The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent, climbing further into record territory and bringing its gains for the week to 1.8 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 was 0.7 percent higher, and the FTSE 100 in Britain rose slightly. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Japan closed with a gain of 2.4 percent, climbing to a level it last hit in 1990. Though Washington continues to focus on the pro-Trump mob that overran the Capitol building on Wednesday, the investing world is instead focused on the wave of spending that could come as Democrats assume leadership of the White House and both houses of Congress That enthusiasm also helped investors look past the Labor Department's report on December payrolls, which showed that U.S. employers cut 140,000 jobs last month, the first drop since last spring. The weak report bolsters the argument that more economic stimulus is needed. Stocks dipped Friday afternoon, but they recovered after President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said he was targeting trillions of dollars in spending. We should be investing significant amounts of money right now, to grow the economy, he said. At the same time, few on Wall Street seem to think Democrats will prioritize tax increases, which had previously been seen as a potential risk of a Democratic sweep. Now you have the potential for more stimulus, even possibly an infrastructure spend, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at the investment management firm Invesco on Thursday. So, I think the stock market is enthused right now. And that enthusiasm is pretty strong. Gains continued in other financial markets too. Oil prices continued to rally, with West Texas Intermediate rising more than 3 percent to $52.52 a barrel. A surge earlier in the week, which came after Saudi Arabia said it would cut production, means oil prices rose more than 8 percent this week. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note also continued to rise, reaching 1.11 percent on Thursday. The rise in yields most likely reflects expectations that the Treasury will be issuing large amounts of debt to finance renewed government spending. Kevin Granville and\n\nU.S. lost 140,000 jobs in December, the first decline since April. The already sputtering economic rebound went into reverse in December, as employers laid off workers amid rising coronavirus cases and waning government aid. U.S. employers cut 140,000 jobs in December, the Labor Department said Friday. It was the first net decline in payrolls since last spring's mass layoffs, and though the December loss was nowhere near that scale, it represented a discouraging reversal for the once-promising recovery. The U.S. economy still has about 10 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic began. Job growth reversed for the first time since April Cumulative change in all jobs since before the pandemic By Ella Koeze · Seasonally adjusted · Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics The December losses were heavily concentrated in leisure and hospitality businesses, which have been hit especially hard by the pandemic. The industry cut nearly half a million jobs in December, while sectors less exposed to the pandemic continued to add workers. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7 percent, down sharply from its high of nearly 15 percent in April but still close to double the 3.5 percent rate in the same month a year earlier. We're losing ground again, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. Most notably, this is still very much a low-wage recession, and the losses were where we first saw them when the pandemic hit. Unemployment rate By Ella Koeze · Seasonally adjusted · Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics Hiring has slowed every month since June, and the economy lost more than nine million jobs in 2020 as a whole, the first calendar-year decline since 2010 and the worst on a percentage basis since the aftermath of World War II. Congress last month passed a $900 billion relief package that will provide temporary support to households and businesses and could give a boost to the broader economy. And in the longer run, the arrival of coronavirus vaccines should allow the return of activity that has been suppressed by the pandemic. But the vaccine and the aid came too late to prevent a sharp slowdown in growth. We did have a pullback in the economy, said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. If stimulus was passed earlier, maybe that could have been avoided.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJob losses can be traced to the virus surge, with restaurants and hotels hard hit. Why did job growth go into reverse? It's simple: the resurgent pandemic. As virus cases rose across the country in the fall, governors and mayors reimposed restrictions on businesses and consumers pulled back on activity. Job losses soon followed: Restaurants and bars cut 372,000 jobs in December. Hotels cut 24,000 more. Private schools and colleges cut more than 60,000. The leisure and hospitality industry was hit hard in December, while other sectors made small gains Cumulative change in jobs since before the pandemic, by industry By Ella Koeze · Seasonally adjusted · Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics It's more pandemic-induced job loss, said Nick Bunker, head of North American research for the career site Indeed. It's a really vivid demonstration that the labor market can't bounce back in any sustainable form until the pandemic is under control. Industries less exposed to the virus, on the other hand, mostly kept hiring. Manufacturers added 38,000 jobs. Construction companies added 51,000. Even retailers, hit hard in the spring but able to adapt more readily, added 120,000. Mr. Bunker said the hiring in those areas was encouraging, suggesting that the economic damage was contained and potentially allowing for a faster rebound once the pandemic was under control. But the concentration of job losses also means that low-wage workers, many of them Black or Hispanic, are again bearing the brunt of the crisis. It's reinforcing the inequality that already happened a few months ago, Mr. Bunker said. It's just hitting the people who have already been hit pretty hard.
Fighting vaccine resistance with gift cards\n\nOne reason that the start to the U.S. vaccination campaign has been so sluggish is that health care workers — among the first to be eligible — have proved more reluctant to get the inoculation than expected.\n\nSome are concerned with the newness of the vaccines. Others are worried about potential side effects. And the failure to get the virus under control has eroded their trust in the groups now urging them to take the shot: the federal government, politicians and their employers.\n\nBut hospitals and nursing homes have been scarred by many thousands of Covid-19 deaths and are desperate to have their employees inoculated. And they're coming up with carrot-and-stick strategies that other organizations may mimic to handle vaccinations among reluctant employees.\n\nMy colleagues Rebecca Robbins, Sabrina Tavernise and Sharon Otterman found that some employers are offering rewards like cash bonuses, paid time off and even Waffle House gift cards for those who get inoculated, while in at least a few cases saying they will fire those who refuse.
No sooner was Jair Bolsonaro sworn in as president of Brazil on New Year's Day than he let loose a fountain of far-right decrees, undermining protections for the environment, indigenous land rights and the L.G.B.T. community, putting nongovernmental organizations under government monitoring and purging government contractors who do not share his ideology. This thrilled Donald Trump, who tweeted enthusiastically, Congratulations to President @JairBolsonaro who just made a great inauguration speech — the U.S.A. is with you!\n\nMr. Bolsonaro returned the love, tweeting back, Together, under God's protection, we shall bring prosperity and progress to our people!\n\nHis actions were a sad but not unexpected performance by Brazil's new leader, a onetime military officer whose 27 years in the Brazilian Congress were notable only for crude insults to women, sexual minorities and blacks. A good criminal is a dead criminal, he declared; he promised to send red outlaws to prison or exile; he dedicated his vote to impeach former president Dilma Rousseff to the military officer responsible for her torture under the former military dictatorship.\n\nNone of that seemed to matter to voters laboring under an economic collapse, a crime wave and a corruption scandal that undermined any faith in the political establishment. Mr. Bolsonaro's promise of change, any change, was enough to sweep him into office with 55 percent of the vote in October. The language of his inaugural address — I come before the nation today, a day in which the people have rid themselves of socialism, the inversion of values, statism and political correctness — was music to the ears of his reactionary base, investors and Mr. Trump, who shares his values and his bluster. The stock market soared to record highs and the Brazilian real strengthened against the dollar.
A HOUSE NEAR THE TAGUS RIVER IN LISBON\n\n$4.2 MILLION\n\nThis four-story house, which dates to the 19th century, is on 0.40 acre on the Rua da Junqueira, close to the riverside neighborhood of Belém in Lisbon, Portugal's capital. The house has 12 bedrooms and bathrooms, 10-foot ceilings, elaborate moldings and stonework, and an elevator. It is about five miles from the center of Lisbon, and eight miles from Lisbon's international airport.\n\nThe main entrance on the ground floor opens into a large foyer adorned with traditional Portuguese glazed tiles. The blue-and-white tile continues up the walls of the main staircase, which is made of stone. Directly off the foyer is a large office/library lined with floor-to-ceiling built-ins. Through an arched stone doorway are the service areas, including the laundry and kitchen. With stone floors and counters, the kitchen was built for use by servants and needs updating, said Paula Penim, the manager of the Oeiras Restelo office of Portugal Sotheby's International Realty.\n\nThe living areas are on the first floor. The main living room has a carved stone fireplace and two sets of glass transom doors that open into adjoining sitting rooms. A third set of doors leads to a spacious formal dining room with dark wood floors and French doors opening onto the yard. A butler's pantry off the dining room has a dumbwaiter to bring food from the kitchen below.\n\nTwo bedrooms, including the master with en-suite bath, are on the first floor. Five more bedrooms, two with their own bathrooms, are on the second floor. The remaining bedrooms are on the third floor, and were once servants' quarters.
And what happens once is likely to happen again. After this, there'll be pressure to get Facebook, Twitter and other companies to suppress other speech, such as fiery rhetoric against the police or oil companies or world trade authorities. People will demand: If you blocked A, why aren't you blocking B? Aren't you being hypocritical or discriminatory?\n\nConsider, too, that the app for Parler, a social network popular with Trump supporters, was removed on Saturday by Apple and Google from their app stores, and blocked by its hosting company, Amazon Web Services, because of concerns that some of Parler's users were inciting violence. Merely refusing to forbid certain speech, much of which is constitutionally protected, is now a basis for blacklisting.\n\nCompanies, moreover, are run by humans, subject to normal human failings. Mr. Trump's suspension may have been motivated by a sincere desire to resist efforts to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power, as Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, put it. But other politicians might be suspended because their policies are bad for corporate profits or contrary to the owners' political ideologies.\n\nIt's only human nature for people to think the worst of their adversaries' views — including by labeling them hate speech or fake news or incitement — while giving their allies the benefit of the doubt. And sometimes just the risk of suspension will pressure politicians to avoid taking positions a company dislikes.\n\nOf course, we shouldn't exaggerate the novelty of this. Newspapers and TV stations have long been able to decide which politicians to cover and which politicians' op-eds to publish.\n\nBut there are hundreds of newspapers throughout the nation and several major TV networks. Facebook and Twitter have no major rivals in their media niches. The public relies on them as matchless mechanisms for unfiltered communication, including politicians' communications with their constituents.\n\nWe also shouldn't overstate the danger of corporate power. Facebook and Twitter, unlike the government, can't send us to jail or tax us.
We sold less, but what we see is as soon as the confinement stops, there is a big increase of sales, Mr. Jottras said. That means people want to buy. They couldn't materially do it during the stay-at-home, but now they can do it, and we have a very, very big increase of sales after the second confinement.\n\nMr. Kraft said the market has performed much better than expected given the circumstances. Paris is still a seller's market, he said, provided prices are realistic. High-end properties in good condition, especially those with outdoor space, are in demand, while homes in need of renovation or in less desirable areas won't sell. In the end, our 2020 results will be equal to those of 2019 (a record year), and this despite 3 months of enforced inactivity during the lockdowns! he wrote in an email.\n\nWho Buys in Paris\n\nPierre-Alain Conil, a partner with Morel d'Arleux, a Paris notary firm, said he worked with many fewer foreign buyers in 2020 than in previous years, and close to none for pieds-à-terre. I know that some are still considering it for when the pandemic will be over because of how strong the market has proved to be, which makes it a very safe and conservative investment, he said.\n\nMr. Kraft saw a similar trend in Paris and throughout France. Normally, foreign buyers represent at least 50 percent of our clientele, he said. In 2020, this number was down to a mere 7 percent. The agency had many inquiries from abroad, but only a few international buyers have pulled the trigger due to the inability to visit properties in person.
The answer, I'd suggest, goes beyond the fact that children can't vote, while seniors can and do. There has also been a poisonous interaction between racial antagonism and bad social analysis.\n\nThese days, political support for programs that aid children is surely hurt by the fact that less than half the population under 15 is non-Hispanic white. But even before immigration transformed America's ethnic landscape, there was a widespread perception that programs like Aid to Families With Dependent Children basically helped Those People — you know, the bums on welfare, the welfare queens driving Cadillacs.\n\nThis perception undermined support for spending on children. And it went along with a widespread belief that aid to poor families was creating a culture of dependency, which in turn was the culprit behind social collapse in America's inner cities. Partly in response, aid to families, such as it was, increasingly came with work requirements, or took the form of things like the earned-income tax credit, which is linked to earnings.\n\nThe result was a decline in assistance for the poor children who needed it most.\n\nAt this point, however, we know that cultural explanations of social collapse were all wrong. The sociologist William Julius Wilson argued long ago that social dysfunction in big cities was caused, not by culture, but by the disappearance of good jobs. And he has been vindicated by what happened to much of the American heartland, which suffered a similar disappearance of good jobs and a similar surge in social dysfunction.\n\nWhat this means is that we've established a basically vicious system under which children can't get the help they need unless their parents find jobs that don't exist. And a growing body of evidence says that this system is destructive as well as cruel.\n\nMultiple studies have found that safety-net programs for children have big long-term consequences. Children who receive adequate nutrition and health care grow up to become healthier, more productive adults. And in addition to the humanitarian side of these benefits, there's a monetary payoff: Healthier adults are less likely to need public aid and are likely to pay more in taxes.\n\nIt's probably too much to claim that helping children pays for itself. But it surely comes a lot closer to doing so than tax cuts for the rich.
There are also smaller-bore projects, some of which the governor has already debuted: On Sunday, Mr. Cuomo said he wanted the High Line — a pedestrian walkway in Manhattan on a former elevated train track — extended to connect to the newly opened Moynihan Train Hall, a project that he hoped would spur development in the surrounding neighborhoods, already some of the city's richest.\n\nThe governor's address comes two years after Democrats retook full control of state government in 2019, when the Legislature had one of the most productive sessions in recent memory, passing a flurry of progressive priorities that had long been stymied by Republicans who controlled the State Senate. By contrast, many of the objectives Mr. Cuomo unveiled last year were derailed or overshadowed by the response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis year, the governor's arguably two most popular proposals — the legalization of pot and mobile sports betting — will require resolving disagreements with legislative leaders over how best to implement them.\n\nLegalizing recreational marijuana, for example, is expected to generate billions of dollars in economic activity and about $300 million in tax revenue in its first year, but legalization efforts have previously fallen apart following disputes over who should get licenses and how to spend the tax money. And marijuana tax dollars would not immediately solve the state's budget crisis; much of the money wouldn't materialize until years down the road.\n\nMr. Cuomo long opposed legalization — he described weed as a gateway drug just a few years ago — but his position evolved in 2018 as neighboring states spearheaded similar efforts and Mr. Cuomo faced a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, a progressive who made marijuana legalization a tenet of her campaign.\n\nCoronavirus may change financial and political calculations about many issues: Since last March, no state has had more deaths than New York, with more than 39,000.\n\nThe governor is now trying to remedy a sluggish vaccine rollout in New York, which has seen sharp increases in new cases, hospitalizations and deaths during the worst period yet in the coronavirus crisis. Mr. Cuomo has harshly criticized the federal response and said his own government's vaccine plan is being hamstrung by the limited supply of vaccine to the states.
The trade deficit figures could strengthen the resolve of Mr. Trump's trade advisers, including Mr. Navarro and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who want the United States to take a more aggressive stance on trade and are urging tougher action on trading partners that export more to the United States than they import, like China, Mexico and South Korea.\n\nAfter rolling out trade actions on washing machines and solar panels that were nominally aimed at China, the administration is considering sweeping action to protect American intellectual property from Chinese incursions. American negotiators are working to rewrite trade pacts with Mexico and South Korea, in large part because these countries run large bilateral trade surpluses with the United States.\n\nSome left-leaning groups that support the president's promises to end offshoring embraced the view that the administration's trade policies simply haven't gone far enough.\n\nThe same trade policy that Trump attacks ferociously and promised to speedily replace is still in place, said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch. It's not surprising that the deficit is up because in year one there has been a wide gulf between Trump's fiery trade rhetoric and action.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump's frequent promises to reduce the trade deficit, many economists believe that his trade policies will be largely powerless to reverse the trend. That's because the overall trade deficit is governed by macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. So while changes in trade policy can shift imports and exports from one country to another, for example, reducing the American trade deficit with China while increasing its trade deficit with Thailand, they are unlikely to reduce the American trade deficit overall.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump's signature economic policy so far — the $1.5 trillion tax cut — is likely to widen the trade deficit in coming years by encouraging more investment in the United States, many economists say.
A FOUR-BEDROOM GARDEN HOUSE IN SÃO PAULO\n\n$2.078 MILLION (6.5 MILLION BRAZILIAN REAIS)\n\nThis four-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bath house is in Cidade Jardim, an upscale neighborhood that borders the Pinheiros River and is about five miles southwest of the financial district of São Paulo, Brazil's most populous city.\n\nThe two-level, 4,954-square-foot house, situated behind stone walls on 0.13 acre, is being sold fully furnished, said Luiza Cazarin, the international relations coordinator for the listing broker, Axpe Imóveis Especiais, an affiliate of Christie's International Real Estate. The home was built in 1970 and underwent an 18-month overhaul after the current owners bought it in 2012.\n\nThe owners, who are moving to Italy, opted for a contemporary aesthetic in the renovations, led by Vivian Calissi, a local interior designer. They used a mostly muted palette in the finishes and textured wall coverings, with bursts of color in the artwork and accessories, outfitting the spacious rooms with modern Italian furnishings.\n\nEntry is through two sets of doors, with a small garden in between. The main carved wooden doors open to a hallway. There is a lounge area with a piano that flows into the living and dining rooms, both of which have double-height ceilings. The living room has a wall of custom bookcases at one end and glass doors that open to a garden with a seating area. The whole house was designed so all the rooms had a view of some garden, Ms. Cazarin said.
The job of commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department has proved to be one of the most tenuous in the country.\n\nThe mayor this week selected Michael Harrison as the city's fifth police chief in four years, and asked him to try to solve a list of persistent problems that chased most of the others from the job. Among the tasks: Reducing one of the nation's highest murder rates; building trust among residents who widely view the department as racist, corrupt and indifferent; and earning the support of rank-and-file officers.\n\nAnd lately, doing all of this under a federal court order intended to curb the department's long history of abusive and discriminatory practices.\n\nIf that were not enough, perceived success has often boiled down to one yardstick — the tally of murders and other violent crimes — whose roots, many experts say, lie to a large extent in a stew of deeper problems beyond the reach of a police chief.
WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to unveil on Tuesday a $4.1 trillion budget for 2018 that would cut deeply into programs for the poor, from health care and food stamps to student loans and disability payments, laying out an austere vision for reordering the nation's priorities.\n\nThe document, grandly titled A New Foundation for American Greatness, encapsulates much of the America first message that powered Mr. Trump's campaign. It calls for an increase in military spending of 10 percent and spending more than $2.6 billion for border security — including $1.6 billion to begin work on a wall on the border with Mexico — as well as huge tax reductions and an improbable promise of 3 percent economic growth.\n\nThe wildly optimistic projections balance Mr. Trump's budget, at least on paper, even though the proposal makes no changes to Social Security's retirement program or Medicare, the two largest drivers of the nation's debt.\n\nTo compensate, the package contains deep cuts in entitlement programs that would hit hardest many of the economically strained voters who propelled the president into office. Over the next decade, it calls for slashing more than $800 billion from Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor, while slicing $192 billion from nutritional assistance and $272 billion over all from welfare programs. And domestic programs outside of military and homeland security whose budgets are determined annually by Congress would also take a hit, their funding falling by $57 billion, or 10.6 percent.
NEW DELHI — Prime Minister Narendra Modi led his party to a landslide victory in India's largest state on Saturday, consolidating his power and putting him in a strong position to win re-election in 2019.\n\nThe scale of the victory in Uttar Pradesh's legislative elections was all the more stunning because it followed Mr. Modi's politically risky decision to eliminate most of India's cash. The vote was seen as a referendum on the prime minister, who campaigned vigorously in recent days in Uttar Pradesh, which, with a population of more than 200 million, would be the world's sixth largest country if it were independent.\n\nThis is a stupendous achievement, said Ashok Malik, a fellow with the Observer Research Foundation, based in New Delhi. Here you had a prime minister making himself the face of the election in the absence of a local leader and stitching together a coalition across the state.\n\nThe margin of victory in Uttar Pradesh was the largest seen by any party in more than 30 years. It gives Mr. Modi a significant advantage in the national elections in 2019, which in turn would bring him closer to his long-term goal of becoming a leader of historic significance, steering India away from its more socialist, secular past.
With both Democratic candidates in the lead in Georgia, the Nasdaq composite index opened around 1 percent lower on Wednesday on expectations that technology companies could be hurt by higher corporate taxes and stricter antitrust scrutiny.\n\nWall Street's investors see Democratic control of the Senate as leading to a large amount of deficit spending in the early days of the Biden administration, a potential boon to the still-struggling American economy.\n\nWe have to expect fiscal policy to be looser than if Republicans had kept their majority, wrote Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a research note. That could mean higher inflation, he added, which could be why U.S. Treasury bonds also saw selling pressure on Wednesday. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes climbed above 1 percent for the first time since March.\n\nThe effect on stocks is more mixed, with diversified indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 flat or up as the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank. Companies whose fortunes are linked closely to the overall economy would benefit from a bigger stimulus and infrastructure spending. Efforts to accelerate vaccination programs would also help industries that rely on in-person interactions get back in business.
The president of Mauritius, who was accused of using a credit card issued by a charity to buy clothes and jewelry worth tens of thousands of dollars, will step down, the prime minister announced on Friday.\n\nPrime Minister Pravind Jugnauth told reporters that Ameenah Gurib-Fakim, the first female president of the island nation off the east coast of Africa, would resign after Monday, when the country marks its 50th anniversary.\n\nThe president of the republic told me that she would resign from office and we agreed on the date of her departure, Mr. Jugnauth said in Port Louis, the capital, according to the BBC.\n\nHe did not provide the exact date of her departure, but he said her resignation would take place before Parliament returns at the end of the month.
ALBANY — From Hudson Valley trains to Nassau County bus shelters and Coney Island subways, Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, seemed to have an answer Thursday for every question at a hearing over the authority's part of the proposed state budget.\n\nMore than two dozen senators and Assembly members from districts served by the agency got a chance to ask Mr. Lhota about the needs and problems of their particular districts.\n\nThe volley of questions highlighted an almost endemic frustration with the agency, which oversees an octopus-like transit network that includes not just city buses and subways but also the Long Island and Metro-North railroads, making clear that its problems go far beyond the city's crumbling subway system.\n\nTo most queries, Mr. Lhota indicated that help or a more detailed response was on the way.\n\nThe nearly five hours of questioning, during which Mr. Lhota was joined by other M.T.A. officials, came as the authority is facing questions about its performance, about several high-profile accidents and about claims of deceptive practices. In addition, the agency has been caught in the middle of a public feud between Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo over how New York City Transit should be funded and improved.
COLUMBUS, Ohio — Four weeks before delegates meet to elect the next president of the United States Soccer Federation, Eric Wynalda was in Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday to address the state of soccer in a town hall before about 100 angry fans of the local Major League Soccer team.\n\nIt was unlikely that anybody in attendance had a vote in the election, but that did not matter to Wynalda. In a crowded field of eight candidates, Wynalda, 48, has positioned himself as the voice of the frustrated American soccer fan, a surging demographic since the men's national team failed to qualify for this summer's World Cup. But in that populist role, he has challenged the very pillars upon which soccer in this country has been painstakingly built over the past three decades.\n\nHis candidacy has been called Trump-like. Wynalda rejects the label, but he also has spent months eviscerating the very organization he hopes to soon lead, and he has insisted that he alone has the skills to run an organization with more than $125 million in annual revenues most effectively, even though he spent part of the last decade warding off creditors during a period of personal financial turbulence revealed by public records and not previously reported.\n\nExcept for having a bit of a temper — Wynalda was shown a red card in his first World Cup game — his soccer credentials are unimpeachable. Wynalda played in three World Cups, and for professional teams in Germany's Bundesliga and Major League Soccer, before he became television analyst and lower-division manager.

It would be like a traditional annual shareholder meeting — except that everyone from customers to hosts to employees and others will be invited.\n\n• It will also change its compensation program, with factors important to stakeholders like progress on guest safety taken into account when bonuses are calculated.
Punishing tariffs on European steel and aluminum remain in place. The administration continues to dangle the threat of duties on European cars, which would be economically devastating for the Continent. Europeans are deeply alarmed by what they regard as the president's recklessness in the Middle East.\n\nThe current state of E.U.-U.S. relations isn't good, and I don't think it's likely to get better anytime soon, said Peter Chase, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Brussels.\n\nMr. Hogan brings a different set of skills than Cecilia Malmstrom, whom he succeeded as the European Union's top trade official at the beginning of December. Some in Brussels think his rawer style will make him a better match for the current occupant of the White House.\n\nMr. Hogan recently said, for example, that by leaving the European Union, the British people were trading in a Rolls-Royce for a used sedan. The statement was seen as particularly cheeky coming from an Irishman who will also be responsible for negotiating a trade deal with Britain as part of its withdrawal from the European Union, a herculean task.\n\nHe is more direct, said Luisa Santos, the director for international relations at BusinessEurope, an industry group. Gender may also play a role, Ms. Santos said. There is a widespread perception in Washington and Brussels that Trump officials were not comfortable with Ms. Malmstrom, an assertive Swede.

Now, on with the show.\n\nCarlos Ghosn's escape committee\n\nThe former head of Nissan and Renault managed to evade 24-hour surveillance in Tokyo and spirit himself out of Japan to Lebanon. How he did it increasingly sounds like a movie-level caper.\n\nAssociates planned the heist for months, the FT reports, citing unnamed sources. They hired private security operatives who worked in multiple countries.\n\nMr. Ghosn made it onto a private plane bound for Turkey and arrived in Lebanon early Monday, the WSJ adds. (A Lebanese news media outlet claimed that he had hidden in a box meant for musical equipment; the world's tabloids, perhaps with an eye on that movie version, reckon it must have been a double bass case.) He entered Lebanon on a French passport.
Badly.\n\nI am nowhere near as smart as my father. But now, like him, I find I have free time during the day because I realize I've got enough money stashed away to be able to cut back on my workload.\n\nAnd because I like business and finance, I find myself spending more time paying attention to what is going on in the market. I will see or read something intriguing about the transportation industry, for example, and say to myself, I wonder if I should buy X. And then there will be a feature on an up-and-coming online retailer and I'll go: I should keep an eye on it and maybe buy on a dip.\n\nThen I will think of my father's impulsive approach to investing and realize I'm on the verge of following in his footsteps, so I stop and remind myself how I developed my own self-taught approach to investing, and that I have already have in place a plan to prevent myself from trading too often.\n\nI started in my late 20s, when I had a little bit of money (and no children). I didn't know enough to pick individual stocks, so I figured mutual funds were the way to go. In researching what to buy, I was stunned to learn that most actively managed mutual funds never beat the benchmark that they were being judged against, a reality that remains true today.\n\nWhat that meant was if I could just match the benchmark — mainly, the S&P 500 — I would be ahead of the majority of investors who were listening to the underperforming professional advisers. I became a firm believer in what was then, in the early 1980s, a relatively new idea — index funds. I remain a huge fan.
But Mr. Pence said the White House was bargaining in good faith. The administration has now provided Democrats details they were seeking about how any border security money would be spent, and officials have incorporated at least one Democratic idea, to allow migrant children seeking asylum to apply in their home countries rather than make a treacherous journey to the United States border.\n\nThe question I have is: When are the Democrats going to start negotiating? Mr. Pence said.\n\nThe administration's credibility continues to suffer, as Democrats call out Mr. Trump for falsehoods about the crisis, such as his assertion that former presidents had told him privately that they should have built the wall. On Monday, former President Jimmy Carter joined the list of presidents who said they had never discussed a border wall with Mr. Trump.\n\nWith talks to end the shutdown at a standstill, Mr. Pence said the president had directed the Office of Management and Budget to take steps to mitigate its effects, including an order to the Internal Revenue Service to issue tax refunds. Under previous shutdown plans — and interpretations of federal law — the I.R.S. was prohibited from dispensing tax refunds when Congress had not approved money to fund the Treasury Department, as is the case now.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Democrats tried to use leverage of their own to force Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to come to the table and pressure Mr. Trump. On Monday, Democrats said they would vote against advancing a package of bipartisan Middle East policy bills slated for consideration this week unless Republicans allowed a vote on bills to reopen shuttered federal departments already passed by the House — a decision that could scuttle its prospects if Democrats stick together.\n\nSenate Democrats did not indicate whether they are ready to block other bills, but their position raised the prospect that a significant portion of the chamber's work could halt until the Senate gets to vote to reopen the parts of the government now closed.\n\nThe House, under Ms. Pelosi, passed a package of bills on Thursday, the day Democrats took control of the chamber, to reopen the one-quarter of the government without funding Mr. Trump's wall. But Mr. McConnell has refused to consider them, insisting that he will not bring up any legislation that does not have Mr. Trump's explicit support.
A few years ago, when I was self-employed and had recently had my second child, my husband went combing through my credit card statements, looking for tax deductions that I'd missed. I'm financially disorganized at the best of times, and with a baby and a toddler, I was barely even trying to keep track of my business expenses. So it's not surprising that I hadn't noticed the hundreds of dollars of weird recurring bank charges that my husband discovered.\n\nIt turned out I'd been signed up for a dubious program that purported to protect users' credit in certain emergency situations. My bank had been accused of fraudulent practices in connection with it and fined $700 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government agency that was Senator Elizabeth Warren's brainchild. I tried, maddeningly, to seek redress from the bank — cycling through phone trees, screaming at automated operators. No one could tell me how I'd been enrolled in the program, or for how long.\n\nEventually, I turned to the C.F.P.B. itself, filling out a simple form on its website. A few weeks later, I was notified that the bank had been deducting money from my account for years, and I was being refunded more than $11,000. Having financed my own maternity leave, I badly needed the money.\n\n[Listen to The Argument podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]
The minimum wage in New Jersey is currently $8.85, and raising it to $15 would boost the incomes of more than 1 million people in the state, according to New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal-leaning research group. The bill proposes increasing the minimum wage to $10 an hour on July 1. On Jan. 1, it would increase to $11 an hour, and then would increase by $1 an hour every year until it reaches $15 in 2024.\n\nNo one working a full-time job should ever live in poverty, Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said in a statement. Putting the minimum wage on a clear and responsible path to $15 an hour is good for workers, good for our businesses and good for our economy. A higher minimum wage strengthens all of New Jersey.\n\nThe announcement of an agreement between Mr. Murphy, Stephen M. Sweeney, the senate president, and Craig Coughlin, the speaker of the assembly, amounts to a fait accompli; both Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Coughlin had said they would not introduce a bill unless it could pass and Mr. Murphy would sign it. With Democrats in control of both houses of the legislature, passing the bill will be a formality.\n\nThe agreement also marks a major political victory for Mr. Murphy, who made raising the minimum wage and legalizing marijuana central promises during his run for governor. Though he said during his campaign that he wanted to raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2021, the governor said he was willing to negotiate with legislative leaders to get it passed early this year.\n\nThe bill includes some exceptions: For seasonal workers and employees at small businesses who employ five workers or less, the base minimum wage would reach $15 an hour by 2026. For farmworkers, the base minimum wage would increase to $12.50 an hour by Jan. 1, 2024. Then, a special committee would review whether to raise those workers' minimum wage to $15 an hour.
Q: In the 1980s, when our children were very young, my husband and I left Park Slope, Brooklyn, for Levittown to raise our family, even though neither of us were from Long Island. Our children are now grown and have moved back to the city, where we visit them frequently. We're interested in moving back to Brooklyn, but we're torn. We're in our early 60s, so how would we adjust to being renters again? Or to owning an apartment rather than a house? I'd miss having a backyard and my husband likes coming home to the suburbs. When do we know it's time to move?\n\nA: Sometimes, the decision to move is made for you: New love combines two homes. A job leads you to a new city. A baby demands more space.

A RENOVATED CASTLE NEAR GLASGOW\n\n$1.8 MILLION (1.275 MILLION POUNDS)\n\nThis refurbished country house, known as Duchray Castle, sits on about 80 acres of woodlands in Queen Elizabeth Forest Park, about 36 miles from central Glasgow. The oldest part of the stone castle dates to the 16th century, said Chris Hall, director of rural and professional services for Rettie & Co., which has the listing. The castle has four bedrooms and four full and one half bathrooms, as well as a separate two-bedroom annex.\n\nThe main entrance is through a corner tower, which opens into a large dining room with wood floors, a fireplace and an unusual barrel-vaulted stone ceiling. The Gothic arched windows, set within alcoves, are typical of those throughout the house.\n\nA hallway from the dining room leads to the family room, which has oak-beamed ceilings, an exposed stone wall and a fireplace. The adjoining eat-in kitchen has a flagstone floor, gas range and a farmhouse-style sink. Also on the ground floor are a utility room with laundry hookups and a study with French doors opening onto a patio.\n\nOn the second level, accessible by two winding stone staircases, is a formal great hall with beamed ceilings, oak paneling and a large stone fireplace. There are also two bedrooms, each with an en-suite bathroom.
GHAZNI CITY, Afghanistan — What does it feel like to live in an Afghan city on the brink of falling to the Taliban?\n\nThe residents of Ghazni, a provincial capital of 280,000 about 110 miles south of the capital, Kabul, on a main highway, can hardly tell anymore who's in charge, and fear has become an everyday companion.\n\nWith the Taliban controlling some of the road network around Ghazni, citizens have long felt vulnerable. But during a recent visit, I kept hearing an even greater sense of defenselessness. Many here fear a full-on effort by the Taliban to seize the city could come at any time.\n\nNot content to merely control access to the city, the insurgents have begun attacking police posts within it. The Taliban methodically extort money — they say it is taxation — from businesses in the city center, including those near the government headquarters, and an increasing number of insurgents live openly in the city. Their fighters regularly kill officials, security personnel and even traffic police officers.
BAGHDAD — In the wholesale market of Jamila, near Baghdad's sprawling Sadr City neighborhood, a merchant, Hassan al-Mozani, was surrounded by towering piles of unsold 110-pound sacks of flour.\n\nNormally at a minimum I would sell 700 to 1,000 tons a month, he said. But since the crisis started we have only sold 170 to 200 tons.\n\nHis troubles are a ground-level indicator of what economists say is the biggest financial threat to Iraq since Saddam Hussein's time. Iraq is running out of money to pay its bills. That has created a financial crisis with the potential to destabilize the government — which was ousted a year ago after mass protests over corruption and unemployment — touch off fighting among armed groups, and empower Iraq's neighbor and longtime rival, Iran.\n\nIran in the past has taken the opportunity posed by a weak Iraqi central government to strengthen its political power and the role of its paramilitaries within Iraq.
DHAKA, Bangladesh — The sale of a used car is developing into an unusual criminal case and a potential diplomatic sore point between the United Nations and Bangladesh, whose government has frequently bristled at criticism from the international community.\n\nAt the heart of the case is an official named Stefan Priesner, an Austrian who headed the United Nations Development Program in Bangladesh from 2008 to 2012. When he left at the end of his tenure, Mr. Priesner sold his imported sport utility vehicle to a colleague.\n\nBut the customs police now say that he evaded $51,732 in taxes owed on the sale. The director general of the customs police, Moinul Khan, said on Thursday that the police were seeking authorization to charge Mr. Priesner with tax evasion and, because he received the proceeds through a foreign bank account, with money laundering.\n\nThe government's real grudge may be not with Mr. Priesner but with the United Nations and other international institutions. The program Mr. Priesner headed worked on electoral reform in Bangladesh, where Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina won the 2014 election essentially by default after major opposition groups boycotted the vote. The next general election is scheduled for next year, and will probably be closely scrutinized.
As California Eases Vaccine Rules, Many Complain of Chaos President-elect Biden proposed a major spending package to combat the virus. Americans are dying in greater numbers, and the virus is not always to blame.\n\nCalifornia just made it easier for people to get vaccinated. For many, it feels harder than ever. Credit... Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times Gov. Gavin Newsom's announcement on Wednesday seemed sweeping: California would open up eligibility for a coronavirus vaccine to anyone 65 or older, effectively abandoning a rollout plan that was meant to ensure that the most vulnerable would be first in line. A day later, residents of the vast and varied state were trying to navigate what many described as vaccination chaos. Some counties shifted gears immediately, among them Orange County, which said anyone 65 or older could book an appointment at the vaccination site it opened this week at Disneyland. But the scheduling website was quickly overwhelmed, making finding a shot seem like trying to score Taylor Swift concert tickets. Neighboring Los Angeles County, however, stuck with its strict priority rules, and said that vaccines there would continue to be available only to health care workers. The dueling approaches illustrate the tension across the country between two competing imperatives: getting as many doses as possible out quickly, and getting those who are at the most risk protected first. As of Thursday, about 11.1 million people in the U.S. had received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a figure that is far short of the 20 million the Trump administration had hoped to reach by Dec. 31. Most have received only the first of the two necessary doses so far. The confusion is hardly limited to California. In New York City, a million residents who are over 65 became eligible to be vaccinated this week, but the reality of actually getting a shot has proved maddening, with buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems and a lack outreach. California, with its decentralized public health system, is a microcosm of the many problems plaguing the national vaccination effort. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti defended the decision to limit vaccinations for now to health workers, despite the state's new directive. This is really about expectations, he said Thursday. Politically, it'd be easy to say, open it up to 65-plus. But he said that would mean that a senior citizen on the city's wealthier west side, living in a large house, could easily take a spot from an essential worker who's younger and living in a crowded home, with no room to isolate. And so when health care workers in Los Angeles arrive at a vaccination site, like the one the city is set to open at Dodger Stadium on Friday, they'll have to present either an employee badge with a photo or another form of documentation of their work. California relies on county health departments like the one in Los Angeles to administer vaccines, and Dr. David Lubarsky, the chief executive of UC Davis Health, said the counties were up against the same problem they faced when trying to ramp up coronavirus testing: too little manpower. Dr. Lubarsky suggested that the state should hand more vaccine doses over to health care providers, who already have the ability to reach out to patients selectively, including harder-to-reach patients like those with lower incomes or who are undocumented. We know who's at risk, he said. Jonah Frohlich, a San Francisco-based health care consultant, said that a combination of factors had left county public health departments scrambling to cope with a deluge of monumental tasks. The same institutions that are trying to manage testing, contact tracing and supports for people, Mr. Frohlich said, are the same people who are managing the distribution of the vaccine. Worse, he said, they must work with often outdated and overwhelmed information systems, and organize it all on the fly. This is the kind of program and process that should take years to implement, he said. The counties are doing the best they can, Mr. Frohlich said, but there is a real human cost to delaying the rollout of the vaccine.\n\n'The very health of our nation is at stake': Biden proposes a $1.9 trillion virus package. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. speaking in Delaware on Thursday. Credit... Kriston Jae Bethel for The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a $1.9 trillion rescue package to combat the economic downturn and the Covid-19 crisis, outlining the type of sweeping aid that Democrats have demanded for months and signaling the shift in the federal government's pandemic response as Mr. Biden prepares to take office. The package includes more than $400 billion to combat the pandemic directly, including money to accelerate vaccine deployment and to safely reopen most schools within 100 days. The very health of our nation is at stake, Mr. Biden said. We have to act and we have to act now. Mr. Biden detailed his so-called American Rescue Plan in an evening speech in Delaware, effectively kicking off his presidency. The Biden package, which would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing, flows from the idea that the virus and the recovery are intertwined. The $20 billion national vaccine program he announced envisions community vaccination centers around the country. Mr. Biden also called for a public health jobs program that would address his goals of bolstering the economy and the Covid-19 response while also rebuilding the nation's fragile public health infrastructure. The proposal would fund 100,000 public health workers to engage in vaccine outreach and contact tracing. At the same time, Mr. Biden is keen on addressing the racial disparities in health that have been exposed by the pandemic, which has disproportionately claimed the lives of people of color. He pledged to increase funding for community health centers, and also intends to fund efforts to mitigate the pandemic in prisons and jails, where African-Americans and Latinos are overrepresented.

Credit... Gabby Jones for The New York Times As New York City officials fight to control the coronavirus by this summer, it is becoming clear that the economic fallout will last far longer: The city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, the largest such drop in at least three decades. The anticipated shortfall, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, is largely driven by a projected drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties, which have all but emptied out since the pandemic began. Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate, and the economic projections suggest the city's budget will remain in a precarious position for the foreseeable future. For now, the city will partially offset the loss with increased revenues from income taxes: The rich got richer, according to a slide from the mayor's presentation. But the city will still likely have to substantially cut spending elsewhere. This is just a total economic dislocation for certain industries, the mayor said. We've never seen anything like what's happened to the hotel industry. We've never seen Midtown in the situation it is now. Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who have battled with the Trump administration for more federal aid, have expressed optimism that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., together with a Democratic-led Congress, will bring substantial assistance. Indeed, just before Mr. de Blasio's expected announcement, the incoming Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said that he and Mr. Biden had reached a deal for the federal government to cover the full costs of state and city expenses related to a disaster declaration from last March, when the virus was first discovered in New York. The move is expected to save the state and city about $2 billion, money that Mr. Schumer's office said can be used to tackle Covid-related budget gaps. And on Thursday, Mr. Schumer was promising more to come. This is just prelude of better days ahead out of Washington for New York, he said. With Biden as president and me as majority leader, it's going to get better. Still, few expect the federal government to be able to fully meet the budgetary needs of state and local governments. Dana Rubinstein and\n\nThe slowest states to roll out vaccines are in the South. A training session for coronavirus testers in West Virginia. Credit... Kristian Thacker for The New York Times Several states in the American South have been the slowest in the country to roll out Covid-19 vaccines. Georgia has faced a raft of logistical and bureaucratic snags. In South Carolina, the governor gave reluctant health care workers until Friday to get their shots or risk losing their priority status. And Alabama has the distinction of administering the fewest vaccines per capita in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This was a herculean effort, said Dr. Karen Landers, the assistant state health officer for the Alabama Department of Health. It has been a challenge. And, of course, it's disappointing that we're not where we need to be. Alabama has stuck to vaccinating health care workers and nursing home residents and staff and will not officially start vaccinating people 75 and older until Monday, though some counties have started earlier. South Carolina officials, too, have acknowledged disappointment. We are frustrated, Gov. Henry McMaster said last week, giving health care workers 10 days to get their vaccine appointments. And we are determined to eliminate the bottlenecks that are slowing this down. West Virginia, by contrast, has fared much better, administering the most vaccines per capita out of any state in the country. It began giving shots to people 80 and older a week ago and to people 70 and older on Wednesday. Teachers 50 and older are also getting vaccinated. In Alabama and Georgia, state officials say they have administered more vaccines than the numbers indicate. Officials in Georgia said part of the problem is the state's 20-year-old database. It is cumbersome and difficult for providers to quickly enter information about administered doses, said Dr. Kathleen E. Toomey, the commissioner of the state Department of Public Health. Some vaccine providers, particularly hospitals, also held back some of the state's limited supply, to ensure that booster shots would be available, Gov. Brian Kemp and officials from his administration said on Tuesday. They called that misguided. If this issue continues, the state will take possession of those doses and ensure that vaccinations continue, the governor said. If it takes me firing up my pickup truck and doing it myself, so be it. At first, Georgia also found a mismatch of vaccine supply and demand. Vaccines went to rural parts of the state where 60 to 70 percent of nursing home workers did not want them, Mr. Kemp said, leaving those areas flush with doses while demand crushed supply in urban areas. The governor said vaccinating all of Georgia's nursing home residents should be completed by the end of the month. But he also acknowledged that the state still has a long way to go. Many local health departments are being inundated with calls, Mr. Kemp said. Yes, the phone lines will be busy. Yes, the websites will certainly crash.

Yang Shiyao/Xinhua, via Associated Press China's National Health Commission said on Friday that more than 1,000 people nationwide were being treated for Covid-19, a day after the country reported its first coronavirus death on the mainland since May. The commission said that 144 new cases had been recorded on Thursday, the highest daily figure since a series of new outbreaks began at the end of last year. Of 1,001 total patients in China, the commission said, 26 were reported to be in serious condition. While the toll remains far lower than in other countries, the surge is challenging the government's much-touted success in wresting the coronavirus under control. Hebei, the northern province surrounding Beijing that has been hardest hit in the latest surge, reported 90 more cases on Thursday. New outbreaks have also appeared in the central province of Shaanxi and in Guangxi, a southern province that borders Vietnam. The new outbreaks suggest that the virus is once again spreading widely despite the measures China has taken, including electronic monitoring and new lockdowns. More than 28 million people have been ordered to remain inside their homes — more than the number affected last January when the central government locked down Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first reported. The National Health Commission reported that nine of the 144 cases recorded on Thursday involved people returning to China, but most of the new ones have spread domestically. In Shijiazhuang, a city of 11 million people where residents have been ordered to stay home since last week, the authorities have scrambled to build a large quarantine center in a rural district. The facility, which covers 82 acres, will ultimately have 3,000 trailer-like units, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

James Estrin/The New York Times People who received two shots of the Moderna Covid vaccine in its earliest, Phase 1 clinical trial are being offered a third shot, a so-called booster, as part of a continuing study to determine whether repeated vaccinations are needed, and whether they are safe and effective, the company said on Thursday. The vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer, both using genetic material called mRNA, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19 when administered as a two-shot regimen. But they have not been in use long enough to tell how long the immunity lasts, or whether additional booster shots will be needed. We anticipate that an additional dose could further boost the levels of neutralizing antibodies, should such a boost be required, and that this is expected to be an advantage of mRNA vaccines, Colleen Hussey, a Moderna spokeswoman, said in a statement. Neutralizing antibodies are made by the immune system in response to a virus or a vaccine and can block the virus from breaking into cells. The company's statement said the boosters were being offered to participants six to 12 months after their second shot. Volunteers in early trials received different doses of the vaccine, as part of the company's attempts to calibrate the most effective amount of active ingredient to use. The Moderna vaccine was ultimately given an emergency green light from the Food and Drug Administration as a two-dose vaccine of 100 micrograms of mRNA each. Trial volunteers who got lower doses might especially benefit from a third shot, said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. In its statement, Moderna said that boosters might also be studied in people who took part in its later, Phase 3 study of 30,000 participants, if accumulating antibody persistence data indicate that this is warranted. Company officials said at a conference this week that they thought protection should last at least a year, according to a report by CNBC. But Moderna's chief executive, Stephane Bancel, also noted in an interview with CNBC that the vaccine might have to be adjusted in the future to immunize people against new coronavirus variants or strains, much like flu vaccines are regularly revamped.

Pool photo by Jacquelyn Martin Representative Adriano Espaillat, Democrat of New York, announced on Thursday he had tested positive for the coronavirus, as concerns continue to mount on Capitol Hill that efforts to corral lawmakers into secure locations during last week's siege by Trump supporters may have led to a super-spreader event. Mr. Espaillat, 66, who received his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine last week, said he was not experiencing any symptoms and that he was isolating at home. In a statement, he said he understood that it took time for the vaccine to be fully effective and that he had continued to take all necessary precautions. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that people who test positive for the virus should isolate for at least 10 days after their symptoms start. The two vaccines cleared for emergency use in the United States, made by Pfizer and Moderna, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19. But neither vaccine is perfect, and researchers remain unsure of how well the shots curb the ability of the virus to silently infect people. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two injections, separated by three or four weeks, and they aren't believed to fully kick in until about a week or two after a person receives the second shot. Capitol Hill has long struggled to control the spread of the pandemic within its marble walls, a haphazard effort exacerbated last week as hundreds of maskless Trump supporters stormed the building and forced lawmakers to shelter in confined secure locations across the Capitol complex. Lawmakers, aides and reporters who took shelter in two separate rooms on both sides of the Capitol have been warned about possible exposure to the coronavirus. Though cases have continued to emerge since the 117th Congress was sworn in nearly two weeks ago, House Democrats have blamed a group of their Republican colleagues who refused to wear masks during the attack while waiting in a secure location for law enforcement to regain control of the building. Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat of New Jersey, Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, and Brad Schneider, Democrat of Illinois, have all tested positive in the aftermath of the attack and cited the Republican refusal to wear masks during the siege. Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, is in isolation after her husband, who was with her in the room, tested positive, and in a statement said the diagnoses were a consequence of my callous Republican colleagues who refused to wear masks. In response to those accusations and concerns about the spread of the virus on Capitol Hill, the House earlier this week approved a fine system for members who refuse to adhere to a mask mandate on the floor. It was unclear whether Mr. Espaillat took shelter in the secure room. But on Wednesday, he was among the lawmakers who spoke on the House floor — while wearing a mask — before voting to impeach President Trump for the second time. Mr. Espaillat noted that the colleagues who had tested positive in recent days collectively occupy a range of gender, ages, races and ethnicities. Covid-19 does not discriminate, he said. It is incumbent on each of us to prioritize social distancing from one another — even if that poses a temporary inconvenience — and wear a face mask. There is no singular panacea and we must adjust our daily habits and practices for our own health and safety as well as the health and safety of those around us and throughout our communities.

Tech companies are working to create a digital version of the Covid-19 vaccination cards that are used to track vaccination timelines. Credit... Tim Gruber for The New York Times Airlines, workplaces and sports stadiums may soon require people to show their coronavirus vaccination status on their smartphones before they can enter. A coalition of leading technology companies, health organizations and nonprofits — including Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, Cerner, Epic Systems and the Mayo Clinic — said on Thursday that they were developing technology standards to enable people to obtain and share their immunization records through health passport apps. For some period of time, most all of us are going to have to demonstrate either negative Covid-19 testing or an up-to-date vaccination status to go about the normal routines of our lives, said Dr. Brad Perkins, the chief medical officer at the Commons Project Foundation, a nonprofit in Geneva that is a member of the vaccine credential initiative. That will happen, Dr. Perkins added, whether it's getting on an airplane and going to a different country, whether it's going to work, to school, to the grocery store, to live concerts or sporting events. Vaccine passport apps could fill a significant need for airlines, employers and other businesses. In the United States, the federal government has developed paper cards that remind people who receive coronavirus vaccinations of their vaccine manufacturer, batch number and date of inoculation. But there is no federal system that people can use to get easy access to their immunization records online and establish their vaccination status for work or travel. A few airlines, including United Airlines and JetBlue, are trying Common Pass, a health passport app from the Commons Project. The app enables passengers to retrieve their virus test results from their health providers and then gives them a confirmation code that allows them to board certain international flights. The vaccination credentialing system would work similarly. The U.S. vaccination program has been stymied by logistical hurdles as states scramble to set up new systems for booking appointments. Demand is high, but the rollout has been progressing far more slowly than hoped, marred by crashing servers, busy signals and confusion. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday that about 11.1 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, far short of the goal federal officials set to give at least 20 million people their first shots before the end of 2020. At least 541,000 people in the United States have been fully vaccinated as of Jan. 12, according to a New York Times survey of all 50 states.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAzar acknowledges a top C.D.C. official was right in her February warning about mass disruption. Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, criticized China's handling of the pandemic at a Heritage Foundation forum on Thursday. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times The U.S. secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, excoriated China on Thursday for its bullying of international experts and scientists and acknowledged for the first time that a top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was correct when she warned in February that the novel coronavirus might cause a severe disruption to American lives. The official, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, was muzzled for nine months after issuing the Feb. 25 warning, which threw the stock market into a nosedive and infuriated President Trump, who was on his way back from India at the time. But she was merely repeating what she had learned from a White House Task Force meeting days earlier, Mr. Azar recalled. She got a little ahead of the briefing of the president and the official announcement, Mr. Azar said. But she and we were correct. Mr. Azar made his comments to the Heritage Foundation, during an online seminar that was billed as a talk about lessons learned from the pandemic. He spent much of it describing how China rebuffed offers of help from the United States — and thwarted American efforts to learn more about the virus that has now claimed more than 380,000 American lives. The United States got its first hint of the novel virus — a case of an unusual pneumonia in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 30, 2019 — from monitoring news reports and through a notification from Taiwan. While American officials tried various tacks to get them to cooperate — including praising China in public as they pressed them very hard and very firmly in private, they were unsuccessful, he said. Our teams were also pressing for the Chinese government to send us viral isolates from patients there. And China has still, one year later, failed to provide the first-generation viral isolates, Mr. Azar said, describing events in late January. It was not until Feb. 16, he said, that an international team including American experts was allowed into China to investigate. By this time, he said, Chinese intransigence meant that the window of opportunity had passed. Outbreaks had been seeded around the world. On Thursday, a team of experts from the World Health Organization finally arrived in the central city of Wuhan to begin hunting for the source of the coronavirus. But in a sign of Beijing's continuing efforts to control the investigation, the team of scientists and W.H.O. employees almost immediately ran into obstacles. Two scientists were unable to enter China at the last minute and remained in Singapore because they tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, the W.H.O. said. The Chinese authorities required the remaining 13 experts to undergo two weeks of quarantine in Wuhan. The investigation is a critical step in understanding how the virus jumped to humans from animals so that another pandemic can be avoided. Getting answers will most likely be difficult.

Credit... Ng Han Guan/Associated Press More than a year after a new coronavirus first emerged in China, a team of experts from the World Health Organization arrived on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan to begin hunting for its source. But in a sign of Beijing's continuing efforts to control the investigation, the team of scientists and W.H.O. employees almost immediately ran into obstacles. Two scientists were unable to enter China at the last minute and remained in Singapore because they had tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, the W.H.O. said on Twitter. The Chinese authorities required the remaining 13 experts to undergo two weeks of quarantine in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in late 2019. The investigation, which aims to gain an understanding into how the virus jumped to humans from animals, is a critical step so that another pandemic can be avoided. But getting answers is likely to be difficult. Here's what to know about the investigation. China set up hurdles and pushed for control. Apparently worried about drawing renewed attention to the country's early mistakes in handling the pandemic, Chinese officials have used a variety of tactics over the past year to hinder the W.H.O. investigation. After resisting demands from other countries that it allow independent investigators onto its soil to study the origin of the pathogen, China let two W.H.O. experts visit in July to lay the groundwork. They were not allowed to visit Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. For months, China delayed approving a visit by a full team of experts, frustrating the health agency's leaders. When the visit seemed to be finalized this month, it fell apart when Beijing declined to provide visas for the visitors, according to the health agency. Now that the investigators have arrived, critics say Beijing's desire for control means the inquiry will probably be more political than scientific. Tracing the virus will be a painstaking task. The team that has come to Wuhan will face a city radically transformed from when the virus first emerged, in late 2019. The city, which went into lockdown on Jan. 23 last year and became a symbol of the virus's devastation, has since been held up by Chinese officials as a success story in vanquishing the virus. The W.H.O. experts have decades of experience plumbing the depths of viruses, animal health and disease control. But tracing the source of the virus that as of Thursday had killed almost two million people worldwide and infected more than 92 million will be painstaking. While experts believe the virus originated naturally in animals, possibly bats, little else is known. How much access the team gets in China will be critical, public health experts say. The team will have to sidestep attempts to politicize its inquiry. The pandemic has hurt China's reputation, with many foreign governments still angry that Beijing did not do more to contain the crisis in its earliest stages. So Chinese propagandists are trying to use the W.H.O. inquiry to help shore up China's image and portray the country as a mature superpower. Complicating that effort could be new virus flare-ups in recent weeks that have prompted fresh lockdowns in China. In all, more than 22 million people have been ordered to remain inside their homes — double the number affected a year ago in Wuhan. On Thursday, China's National Health Commission reported a coronavirus death in the mainland for the first time since May. The major concern here is the origin of the outbreak has been so politicized, said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. That has really narrowed the space for the W.H.O. to have an independent, objective and scientific investigation.\n\nStrict safeguards should protect schools from the virus variant, experts say.

Scott McIntyre for The New York Times When a more contagious coronavirus variant first surfaced in early December, some researchers initially suggested that unlike with previous versions of the virus, children might be just as susceptible to the new variant as adults. Recent research from Public Health England may put those fears to rest. Based on detailed contact-tracing of about 20,000 people infected with the new variant — including nearly 3,000 children under 10 — the report showed that young children were about half as likely as adults to transmit the variant to others. That was true of the previous iteration of the virus, as well. There was a lot of speculation at the beginning suggesting that children spread this variant more, said Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government. That's really not the case. But the variant does spread more easily among children, just as it does among adults. The report estimated that the new variant is about 30 percent to 50 percent more contagious than its predecessors — less than the 70 percent researchers had initially estimated, but high enough that the variant is expected to pummel the United States and other countries, as it did Britain. Adolescents and teenagers between ages 10 and 19 were more likely than younger children to spread the variant, but not as likely as adults. Over all, though, the variant was more contagious in each age group than previous versions of the virus. The mutant virus will result in more infections in children unless schools shore up their precautions, experts said. The variant is not necessarily affecting children particularly, but we know that it's adding on more transmissibility to all age groups, Dr. Cevik said. We need to find ways to return these kids back to school as soon as possible; we need to use this time period to prepare. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain had promised last year to do all he could to keep schools open. But he changed course in the face of soaring infections and buckling hospital systems, and ordered schools and colleges to move to remote learning. Other European countries put a premium on opening schools in September and have worked to keep them open, though the variant already has forced some to close. In the United States, the mutant virus has been spotted only in a handful of states but is expected to spread swiftly, becoming the predominant source of infections by March. If community prevalence rises to unmanageable levels — a likely proposition, given the surge in most states — even elementary schools may be forced to close. But that should be a last resort, after closures of indoor restaurants, bars, bowling alleys and malls, several experts said. I still say exactly what many people have said for the past few months — that schools should be the last thing to close, said Helen Jenkins, an infectious disease expert at Boston University. Keeping schools open carries some risk, but I think it can be reduced substantially with all the mitigations in place, she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe U.K. bans travel from Latin America and Portugal, citing concern about a Brazilian variant.

Credit... Niklas Halle'N/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Britain said on Thursday that it would ban arrivals from Latin American countries and Portugal over fears of a coronavirus variant discovered in Brazil. In recent weeks, British authorities have already struggled to contain the spread of a different coronavirus variant discovered in Britain that is more contagious than its predecessors. At least two coronavirus variants are currently circulating in Brazil, and at least one has slipped its borders, traveling to Japan. Japanese authorities found one of those variants in four people traveling from Brazil earlier this week. The variant contains a mutation that has been linked with higher contagiousness, similar to the variant found in Britain and another in South Africa. Like the variant found in South Africa, the one exported from Brazil to Japan also carries a mutation that may weaken the efficacy of vaccines. This same mutation has also been identified in the other coronavirus variant recently discovered in Brazil. Experts have cautioned, however, that it would be very difficult for new variants of the coronavirus to evade vaccines entirely. The British ban is set to come into effect on Friday at 4 a.m., the transportation secretary Grant Shapps said on Twitter. Travel from Portugal to the U.K. will also be suspended given its strong travel links with Brazil, Mr. Shapps added, although truck drivers transporting essential goods from Portugal will be exempted. Britain has already banned flights from South Africa. Brazil banned flights from Britain on Christmas Day. British authorities have come under criticism from opposition lawmakers for delaying a travel ban from Latin America, but they have argued that implementing such measures takes time, and that travelers coming from these countries had to quarantine for 10 days upon arrival.

Health workers preparing vaccinations in Rockaway, N.J. Credit... Sarah Blesener for The New York Times Anxious about taking a new vaccine and scarred by a history of being mistreated, many frontline workers at hospitals and nursing homes are balking at being inoculated against the coronavirus. But hospitals and nursing homes, worried about their patients' health and scarred by many thousands of deaths in the past year, are desperate to have their employees vaccinated. These opposing forces have led to unusual measures: In addition to educating workers about the benefits of the vaccines, employers are dangling incentives like cash, extra time off and even Waffle House gift cards for those who get inoculated, while, in at least a few cases, threatening to fire those who refuse. Officials at two large long-term care chains in the United States, Juniper Communities and Atria Senior Living, said they were requiring their workers, with limited exceptions, to be vaccinated if they want to keep their jobs. For us, this was not a tough decision, said Lynne Katzmann, Juniper's chief executive. Our goal is to do everything possible to protect our residents and our team members and their families. Critics say it is unethical to strong-arm low-paid workers into being vaccinated. This is a population of people who have been historically ignored, abused and mistreated, said Dr. Mike Wasserman, a geriatrician and former president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine. It is laziness on the part of anyone to force these folks to take a vaccine. I believe that we need to be putting all of our energy into respecting, honoring and valuing the work they do and educating them on the benefits to them and the folks they take care of in getting vaccinated. A survey of about 5,900 employees at Jackson Health System in Miami found that only half wanted to get a vaccine immediately, a hospital spokeswoman said. Others said they would consider it later. In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine said last month that roughly 60 percent of nursing home workers had declined vaccination. In New York City, at least 30 percent of health care workers said no to the shot in the first round, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday.

Andrea Mantovani for The New York Times Europe has reached a tipping point as it grapples with the spread of new coronavirus variants, the World Health Organization's top official in the region said on Thursday, calling for tighter public health controls to slow their transmission. The new variants have been identified in 25 of the European region's 53 nations, Hans Kluge, the W.H.O.'s regional director, told a virtual news conference. We were prepared for challenging times in 2021, and it has been just that, he said. The region had 26 million confirmed coronavirus infections last year and more than 580,000 related deaths, he said, and in the past week alone recorded 1.8 million new cases. He said that the health authorities could not yet assess the full extent of a surge in infections resulting from increased social gatherings and relaxed precautions over the year-end holidays, because testing and reporting also dropped. But he said that the availability of vaccines offered hope for the months ahead. 2021 will be another year with the virus, but it will be more manageable and more predictable, Mr. Kluge said. As the year began, over 280 million people in Europe were living under national lockdowns, and several countries are set to add new measures in the hope of reducing new infections and easing the pressure on strained health facilities. In Switzerland, where the number of new Covid-19 infections has fallen in recent days, the authorities announced new restrictions that take effect next week because of the threat posed by the highly transmissible variants. Restrictions on businesses and social life in the country had been limited, and ski resorts have been allowed to remain open in a bid to minimize the impact on the economy. Switzerland is also keeping its schools open. But starting Monday, all shops selling nonessential goods will have to close, the limit on private gatherings has been cut to five people from 10, and the required closing of bars, restaurants, cultural centers and sports facilities has been extended until the end of February.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmericans are dying in greater numbers this year, and not just because of the virus. A casket sat in an empty room at a funeral home in Los Angeles on Sunday. Credit... Alex Welsh for The New York Times Deaths from all causes rose sharply during the second quarter of 2020 as the pandemic took hold in the United States, reaching levels last seen 75 years ago, according to provisional figures released on Thursday by the National Center for Health Statistics. Over all, the unadjusted death rate for all Americans rose to 1,033.7 per 100,000 in the second quarter of 2020, up from 850.8 per 100,000 Americans during the second quarter of 2019. The last time the death rate exceeded that figure was in 1945, the year World War II ended, when there were 1,058 deaths for every 100,000 Americans. Rates had steadily declined since then, said Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch of the center. The overall death rate attributed specifically to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was 136.2 deaths per 100,000 Americans during the three months of April, May and June of 2020. But deaths from several other leading causes, including diabetes, stroke, heart disease and hypertension, also increased. Since March, at least 400,000 more Americans have died than would have in a normal year. Deaths related to cancer, which have been declining for some time, continued to drop. The new figures also highlight the unique threat that Covid-19 poses to men. Men died of Covid-19 at far higher rates than women during the second quarter of last year, with 148.1 deaths per 100,000, compared to 124.6 per 100,000 for women. When the figures were adjusted to account for the age differences between the sexes, the disparities were even more stark: the Covid-19 death rate for men was 133.9 per 100,000 during the second quarter of 2020, compared with 86.9 per 100,000 for women. The center has collected data on racial and ethnic disparities in death rates, but has not yet published the research. Another paper published on Thursday, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, calculated that Covid-19 has reduced life expectancy for all Americans by about a year on average, but found that the impact differs dramatically by race. While the life expectancy of white Americans has been shortened by less than a year, to 77.84 years on average, life expectancy among Black and Hispanic Americans has been reduced by two years and three years, respectively, to 72.7 years and to 78.7 years. (Hispanic Americans live longer on average than white or Black people.) The reduction represents the single largest single drop in life expectancy in 40 years. The N.C.H.S. report is not the first to show that the pandemic has increased deaths from a variety of causes. In addition to the nearly 200,000 American deaths caused directly by Covid-19 from Jan. 26 to Oct. 3, another roughly 100,000 so-called excess deaths from other causes were recorded, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported. The greatest rate of excess deaths was found among young adults and people of color. Calculations of the death toll from injuries — a category that includes suicide, homicide, drug overdoses and firearm deaths — were not included in the new data, as reporting on these deaths frequently lags. But a separate N.C.H.S. provisional report on drug overdose deaths during the 12-month period ending in June 2020 found an 18 percent increase over the previous year to 79,251 deaths, up from 67,821 deaths during the previous 12-month period ending in June 2019. In total, there have been more than 384,000 known virus-related deaths in the United States. As of Wednesday, the seven-day average was 3,346 deaths a day, according to a New York Times database.\n\nOlder New Yorkers are exasperated as they try to get vaccinated.

She uses a walker and has a chronic lung disease. She is exactly the kind of person who most needs a coronavirus vaccine. Yet she has found it impossible to make an appointment and has become lost in the confusing system set up by the city and the state. Computer-literate, she navigated New York City's vaccine finder page on Monday, found the closest provider and sent an email with her name and phone number to set up an appointment. When no one called, she reached out to the urgent care's corporate office, which told her to wait. She wanted to register at the new Javits Center megasite, which she had heard about on the news, but couldn't figure out how. I'm willing to wait my turn, she said, frustrated, but I would like to have some feeling that I have a turn. Millions of older New Yorkers started the week with optimism that they would finally gain access to a vaccine after months of fearing they would fall victim to the coronavirus. But the reality of actually getting the shots has proved maddening. Buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems that act in parallel but do not link together and a lack of outreach is causing exasperation and exhaustion among older New Yorkers and others trying to set up vaccination appointments. It is also stymying New York's efforts to get the vaccine to many of the city's most vulnerable, creating a situation that risks exacerbating the inequalities that Covid-19 has already laid painfully bare. The race to vaccinate millions of New Yorkers has reached a critical point, as officials on Wednesday announced that two cases of a more contagious variant of the virus first detected in Britain had been found in New York City, one in Manhattan and one in Queens. The state has used 35 percent of its available vaccine, in line with the national average in a rollout that has gone far slower than expected nationwide. New York City has distributed 38 percent of its shots, with 491,000 available doses as of Thursday. But in the race to get shots in arms, some say the bigger picture about exactly whose arms should be prioritized has been lost. Here we are, facing a global pandemic, with thousands of New Yorkers who have lost their lives, and who is again the forgotten group of people? The very people who need help the most, said Mark Treyger, a city councilman from Brooklyn who said his office had been inundated with calls from family members trying to get appointments for their parents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story

The Internal Revenue Service is planning to bring back tens of thousands of furloughed workers for tax season, and the Food and Drug Administration has said it is bringing hundreds of workers back to step up food safety inspections.\n\nUnder its revised shutdown plan, the F.A.A. will have 3,113 employees in its aviation safety organization who are considered essential to protect life and safety, and those employees will work without pay. Under its original shutdown plan, only 216 aviation safety positions were considered essential for life and safety.
According to Fanatics, the largest online seller of licensed sports goods, the Golden Knights have ranked fourth in N.H.L. merchandise sales this season — and first since the start of 2018.\n\nThe fast start by the Golden Knights has, for now, allayed fears that the N.H.L.'s decision to put another team in a desert city would lead to financial trouble. (See: Coyotes, Arizona.) Commissioner Gary Bettman has for years pushed for new teams in the Sun Belt, with mixed success, and aiming for Las Vegas, in particular, seemed like an overreach.\n\nIt is the country's 40th largest television market, best known as a destination for tourists and gamblers, and has a population heavy on retirees and service industry workers, who are unlikely candidates to spend thousands of dollars on season tickets. The city had little hockey tradition; it has hosted minor league teams but has few ice rinks or youth leagues.\n\nBut an influx of out-of-town fans has complemented the Golden Knights' fast start on the ice and at the box office. This is good news for local hotels, restaurants and casinos, which host 43 million visitors a year, and for the team as it gets its bearings in the market.\n\nOther N.H.L. teams in areas that attract transplanted retirees — like the Arizona Coyotes and the Florida Panthers — also tend to have strong crowds supporting the opposition. The Golden Knights, though, appear to have specifically designed their game nights like most things in their city: as tourist attractions.\n\nWhile hockey is certainly the central focus of game nights, the Knights have added a medieval motif, sometimes comically. The Zambonis that drive on the ice have jousts mounted on their sides to simulate a duel. The arena includes a 24-foot knight's helmet and three castle structures, including one for cheerleaders with pompoms. Catapults are used to launch T-shirts into the crowd.\n\nWe wanted to focus on Vegas as the entertainment capital of the world, Bubolz said.\n\nThe Golden Knights' success, camp and all, is an encouraging sign for the N.F.L., which last year approved the Raiders' plan to relocate to Nevada. (The San Antonio Stars of the W.N.B.A. moved to Las Vegas in the off-season, and will begin play as the Las Vegas Aces in May.)
But the magnitude and the suddenness of the loss surprised and puzzled analysts. An after-tax loss of $100 million in the second quarter for the company as a whole translates into a pretax loss on home computers alone of $200 million to $250 million.\n\nTexas Instruments officials last week declined to be interviewed. ''Not a chance. Absolutely not a chance,'' said company spokesman Norman Neureiter. Indeed, even the home computer division's public relations manager, whose job it is to talk to the press about that specific T.I. activity, has not been allowed to talk to some publications in the last few weeks.\n\nNevertheless, it is evident that the loss was the result of a combination of factors, all of which are evidence of a consistent problem that T.I. has had in the consumer electronics business. In digital watches and calculators, T.I. helped drive prices so low that it ruined the business, even for itself.\n\nOne of the other companies severely hurt in the calculator wars was Commodore International, which was dependent on other companies for the chips it used and was therefore limited in how much it could cut costs. Since then, Commodore has vertically integrated. When Commodore and T.I. faced off again in home computers, Commodore was the winner. Mistake number one for T.I., analysts and competitors say, was getting into a price war with a more agile, lower-cost producer.\n\nT.I.'s home computer was first introduced in 1979 for $1,150 and was an embarrassing failure. T.I. discovered in 1982 that it could sell large volumes by cutting the price and offering rebates. But the T.I. 99/4A, which was little different from the machine that was originally designed to sell for $1,150, was no match cost-wise for Commodore's VIC-20. As Commodore and T.I. started their downhill race, it was inevitable that prices would get so low that T.I. would start losing money while Commodore stayed profitable. T.I. ''got suckered by Jack,'' said Harry Fox, president of Spectravideo, a new home computer company, referring to Commodore president Jack Tramiel.\n\nEven that would not have been too bad had T.I. been able to make up for low-priced computers by making large profits on software and peripheral equipment as it had hoped. But there is a flaw in such a razor-and-blade approach to profits in the home computer market.\n\nThe history of the personal computer business, brief as it is, has shown that the successful machines are the ones that have the most and best software available for them. It has also shown that no single company can write all the software itself. It must take advantage of the cottage industry of programmers.
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\n\nWASHINGTON — Not so long ago, left-wing activists were dismissed as fringe or even kooky when they pressed for proposals to tax the superrich at 70 percent, to produce all of America's power through renewable resources or to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThen along came Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — and her social-media megaphone.\n\nIn the two months since her election, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has had the uncanny ability for a first-term member of Congress to push the debate inside the Democratic Party sharply to the left, forcing party leaders and 2020 presidential candidates to grapple with issues that some might otherwise prefer to avoid.\n\nThe potential Democratic field in 2020 is already being quizzed about her (Senator Kamala Harris praised her on The View), emulating her digital tactics (Senator Elizabeth Warren held an Instagram chat in her kitchen that looked much like one of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's sessions) and embracing some of her causes.\n\nMs. Warren and Senator Cory Booker, among others, have recently endorsed the idea of a Green New Deal, a call to reimagine an environment-first economy that would phase out fossil fuels. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez thrust that issue into the national dialogue after she joined a sit-in protest in the office of then-incoming House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi, in one of her first, rebellious acts in Washington.
First, the deal calls for China to begin purchasing what the administration says will be $200 billion worth of American crops and other exported goods and services. Those purchases should increase exports from the United States to China, which, all else being equal, would promote growth.\n\nSecond, and perhaps more important, administration officials appear to be counting on the agreement to revive business investment in the United States, which has fallen in recent quarters after surging in the first half of 2018. The uncertainty that Mr. Trump and the Chinese sowed as they imposed escalating tariffs on each other's imports was largely to blame for that sluggishness, many companies and economists have said.\n\nThe bullish case for the China agreement is that it will ease that uncertainty. Some economists say the U.S.M.C.A. could do the same. For months, administration officials have touted a study by the United States International Trade Commission that predicted that the North American trade deal could raise growth by 0.35 percent, largely by reducing uncertainty over trade in digital services.\n\nAndrew Hunter, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, backed that assessment on Tuesday. The gap that opened up last year between investment and corporate profits suggests that tariff uncertainty has caused firms to delay investment plans, he wrote in a research note. He added, With the U.S.M.C.A. deal signed and the threat of further tariffs on Chinese goods seemingly off the table, that drag should now be fading.\n\nMany economists have praised the agreements for reducing uncertainty, but few have raised their growth forecasts because of them. That is in part because they say the deals still leave a large number of tariffs in place — particularly those against China, but also on some steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines imported from other countries.\n\nThey also noted that Mr. Trump had waged his trade wars on fronts well beyond North America and China. New trade battles loom this year, including one between the United States and France over a French push to impose a new tax that hits American tech giants like Google and Amazon.\n\nMary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the Phase 1 agreement was good news for the U.S. and the world economy. But, she said, there remains considerable uncertainly for businesses using China as a platform for products destined for the U.S. market, and we will continue to see the impact of this in slower investment and higher business costs.
WASHINGTON — House Democrats unveiled on Friday the details of ambitious legislation devised to lower barriers to the ballot box, tighten ethics and lobbying restrictions and, in a swipe at President Trump, require presidents and candidates for the nation's highest offices to release their tax returns.\n\nSingling out Mr. Trump and his administration, Democrats said that they were making good on promises to voters across the country who vaulted them into the majority with demands to clean up corruption and influence-peddling in Republican-controlled Washington.\n\nOver the last two years, President Trump set the tone from the top of this administration that behaving ethically and complying with the law is optional, said Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Ladies and gentlemen, I have stopped by here to simply say we are better than that.\n\nLittle if any of the bill, named H.R. 1 to underscore its primacy, is likely to become law; in its sprawl and ambition, the measure is less a legislative vehicle than a political platform for the Democrats heading into the 2020 presidential cycle.
TIGHTROPE\n\nAmericans Reaching for Hope\n\nBy Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn\n\nAs the United States awakens from one of its foundational myths — that we are a democracy without castes — the official record of our times is being written largely by people born to socioeconomic advantage. This irony, in which those on the fortunate end of historic wealth inequality attempt to chronicle a populist movement produced by that inequality, often results in dubious journalism.\n\nEven well-intentioned urban, coastal, college-educated scribes commit obliviously condescending word choices (flyover country), illogical assumptions (everyone in red states voted for Trump) and variations on poverty porn, in which subjects are conveyed as helpless and joyless (observe this sorry case in Appalachia). To those who know something about, say, rural poverty firsthand, earnest nonfiction narratives understandably may read as voyeuristic studies predicated on the dangerous idea that we are a nation of two essentially different kinds of people.\n\nIn fact, we are a nation of essentially similar people shaped by vastly different circumstances of place, wealth, education and culture. Those best able to document our socioeconomic divide with humility and accuracy typically have occupied more than one class, remain connected to the one they left and attribute any upward mobility to good fortune rather than to personal exceptionalism.\n\nOne such journalist is the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, who grew up tending sheep on a small family farm in rural Oregon in the 1960s and '70s. In Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope, he and the journalist Sheryl WuDunn, who is also his wife, offer a litany of stories from across the country, revealing the structural causes of countless so-called personal failures among the working poor. Most of these stories come from Kristof's hometown of Yamhill, population 1,105.
Mary Bowerman\n\nUSA TODAY Network\n\nA Virginia man went out of his way to inconvenience the Department of Motor Vehicles on Wednesday by paying a sales tax on two cars with 1600 pounds of pennies.\n\nNick Stafford arrived at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Lebanon, Va., with five wheelbarrows filled with pennies on Wednesday, the Herald Courier reported.\n\nHe published a live update from the DMV on his website as he watched employees count almost 300,000 pennies to pay the $2,987.14 sales tax he owed on two new cars.\n\nAt first the DMV started counting the pennies using automated coin counting machines, but the machines were jamming so they are now counting the pennies by hand, and have been doing so ever since, he said.\n\nStafford told the Herald Courier, his beef with the DMV began in September, when he was forced to file a Freedom of Information Act Request in order to get Lebanon DMV's phone number.\n\nHe filed three separate law suits against the DMV, which were dropped Thursday, according to the Herald Courier.\n\nFollow @MaryBowerman on Twitter: @MaryBowerman
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe cornerstone of President Joe Biden's emotional appeal to the nation in his inaugural address was for a coming together. With unity we can do great things, Biden said. Important things.\n\nThe first important thing will be reaching an agreement with Congress on emergency funding to help defeat the coronavirus and cushion its impact on the economy. A pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans is an emergency that justifies deficit spending, as long as there is oversight to prevent waste and fraud.\n\nAdding to the urgency: New variants of COVID-19 are more transmissive and perhaps more lethal, so Biden's rescue package is the right idea at the right time. It just needs to be the right size.\n\nThe White House plan calls for $1.9 trillion in spending, after a year of COVID-19 emergency funding that has already added more than $2 trillion to a spiraling national debt. There's room to scale this back, particularly in light of a new Congressional Budget Office report that predicts a better-than-expected economic recovery.\n\nTen moderate Republicans countered with a $600 billion alternative, and Biden rightly agreed to meet with them on Monday, holding out hope for the kind of compromise 71% of Americans want to see.\n\nWhere is there room for agreement?\n\nFunding to directly fight the virus is a no-brainer. Biden is seeking $400 billion for this to correct massive shortfalls left by the previous administration: money to boost production of vaccines and protective equipment, open vaccination centers, hire health workers and, once and for all, expand testing and lab facilities. There's also $170 billion to help safely reopen K-12 schools and institutions of higher learning.\n\nBut the balance of Biden's proposal consists of direct aid to individuals, assistance for states and businesses, and a proposal to hike the federal minimum wage to $15 from $7.25 an hour. Places to cut include:\n\n►$1,400 stimulus checks. Nearly 10 million Americans still receive jobless benefits because of the pandemic, and a one-time check for $1,400 (on top of a $600 payout approved in December) would go a long way. As we argued then, however, any additional checks ought to be more narrowly targeted to the neediest.\n\n►Other direct aid. While extra unemployment benefits should be extended into summer (they currently end in March), it's not necessary to increase the federal supplement from $300 a week to $400. Other forms of aid — hikes in child and earned income tax credits, and child care assistance — could better be considered in a future Biden recovery plan that spells out ways to offset the cost through tax hikes. As it is, taking all the proposals together would provide a family of five an annual federal sum of $28,000.\n\n►Minimum wage increase to $15 an hour. This long controversial proposal is best considered as separate legislation that would index the federal wage to inflation and leave states and localities room to go higher.\n\n►A combined $500 billion in state aid. There is rich disagreement between Democrats who want this and Republicans who don't. A neutral analysis last September of state needs estimated a shortfall of $227 billion over three years, a more appropriate figure.\n\nBiden and Democrats could try to force through their oversized demands by using an arcane and rarely employed process known as budget reconciliation, in which a simple majority — and not the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster in the Senate — would be necessary. But every Democrat, including moderate Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, would have to be on board, and a straight party-line vote would undercut Biden's promise of unity.\n\nReconciliation is an alternative if the Republicans refuse to meet Biden halfway. But if there's anything the parties ought to be able to agree on, it's a plan to get the pandemic under control, because little else is possible until that happens.
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nTeams likely to honor Kobe Bryant during NBA games\n\nSix games are on the NBA schedule for Monday, a day after Kobe Bryant, one of basketball's greatest players, was among nine passengers who died in a helicopter crash. The victims also included Bryant's 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. Despite intense emotions around the league, the NBA played its entire slate of games Sunday, receiving criticism on social media. Most teams paid tribute to Bryant with 24-second and 8-second violations during Sunday's games and we likely will see similar tributes on Monday in Detroit, Miami, Chicago, Oklahoma City, Minneapolis and Salt Lake City.\n\nPrefer to listen?

While the Democrats used almost all of the 24 hours allotted to them, Trump's lawyers went for short and sweet when they kicked off their defense Saturday taking only two hours to outline their case for exonerating the president. Trump's lawyers attacked House Democrats' credibility and accused them of omitting exculpatory evidence. They portrayed Trump as innocent of all charges and warned the senator-jurors against removing him from office – saying that would be an abuse of power and imploring them to let American voters determine Trump's fate in November.\n\nSpaceX set to launch Falcon 9 for Starlink internet mission\n\nSpaceX on Monday will take another crack at launching a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 60 Starlink satellites from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station after bad weather scrubbed a planned launch Friday. However, the weather forecast continues to be a concern for the Monday mission with 9:49 a.m. ET liftoff. This mission will mark the fourth full flight of a Falcon 9 with 60 Starlink satellites, bringing SpaceX's constellation to 240 satellites in low-Earth orbit. The initiative is designed to transmit broadband internet connectivity, including some underserved regions. SpaceX will attempt to land the Falcon 9 booster on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean following the launch.\n\nHolocaust victims remembered on 75th anniversary of Auschwitz liberation\n\nThe United Nations-designated International Holocaust Remembrance Day is Monday. The Jan. 27 date coincides with the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in 1945. This year marks the 75th anniversary. A memorial ceremony will be held in the U.N. General Assembly Hall that will include Holocaust survivors giving their testimony and a musical contribution by Itzhak Perlman. Last week, dozens of world leaders – including Vice President Mike Pence, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Britain's Prince Charles – visited Jerusalem to attend the World Holocaust Forum, the largest gathering focused on commemorating the Holocaust and combating anti-Semitism. For historians, the forum's main message was one of education amid signs of ignorance and indifference to the Holocaust.\n\nThe 2020 tax filing season opens\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service will start accepting tax returns from individual taxpayers on Monday, kicking off the filing season when more than 150 million returns are expected to be processed. If this year resembles last, most taxpayers who receive refunds will get back about $2,800 on average. You'll have until April 15 to submit your returns for 2019 and pay any taxes you owe, with automatic extensions to Oct. 15 available. The IRS is touting the benefits of filing returns electronically, including automatic flagging of some common errors and reminders to supply missing information.

You thought the biggest controversy of the Kentucky men's basketball team's season was going to be that 1-6 start? Think again.\n\nThe Wildcats were more than 500 miles from the Bluegrass State when they knelt during the national anthem Saturday at Florida, but fans and others back home noticed.\n\nA sheriff and jailer burned their UK shirts in protest. One county's leaders passed a resolution calling for taxpayer money to stop flowing to the university. And one of the highest-ranking Kentucky legislators cried on the Senate floor, saying that the players' action was a disrespectful gesture to military members such as his son.\n\nPeople have died for this country, said Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester. They have died to allow young men to go out on the floor and have the opportunity to play sports and speak their mind.\n\nMore:Opinion: Dos and don'ts of protesting for athletes. (Hint: It's never acceptable for some)\n\nMore:NBA coaches: Wednesday's riot at U.S. Capitol 'disturbing', 'disgrace'\n\nKentucky players, who chose to kneel following last week's riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump as well as a summer of protests for racial justice, said they expected a backlash. But did they know the response would be so strong so quickly?\n\nWith the world we're living in now, I think everybody knew, forward Isaiah Jackson said at a press conference Monday. At the end of the day, people are going to say what they're going to say. People can do what they want. It's a free country.\n\nIt's a controversy that escalated quickly, and it's not as simple as a block or charge call.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nUK players decide to kneel before game\n\nUK players decided 90 minutes before Saturday's game they wanted to kneel during the national anthem, coach John Calipari said. Veteran players approached Calipari before the game about their intentions, he said, and the coach offered to join them.\n\nPlayers and coaches locked arms and knelt during the pregame national anthem, with Calipari placing his hand over his heart. The Wildcats defeated Florida 76-58, marking UK's third win in a row.\n\nWhy did the Wildcats kneel?\n\nCalipari and guard Davion Mintz said after the game the decision to kneel speaks for itself, while forward Keion Brooks said the action was in response to Wednesday's riot along with some other things that we don't see that go on every day that are unacceptable.\n\nCalipari defended his players from criticism immediately after the game.\n\nThese kids are good kids, the coach said. They care about this country and all the other stuff. They're trying to figure out life and making statements they think they have to make. I want to listen to what they're saying, and then I'll support them if they want me to be there.\n\nAs controversy brewed back in the Bluegrass State, the coach took additional steps to clarify what happened on his Monday night radio show.\n\nSix UK players come from military backgrounds, Calipari said on the program, as does Mitch Barnhart, the university's athletic director. What the Wildcats did Saturday wasn't intended to disrespect the military, Calipari said; it was intended to bring people together peacefully.\n\nStill, the coach said, the players have made their feelings known at this point. While their statement should not have been taken as a sign of partisanship or disrespect toward the military, Calipari said, he requested that his team's players work toward uniting people.\n\nLook, you did your civic duty, you voted. Now, you want to bring people together. Let's figure out how you do that. Some of this might be off away from the media, Calipari said he told his players. I don't want these kids to be in anything that separates — including our fans.\n\nGerth:Stivers sheds tears of a clown over UK basketball players kneeling\n\nHow did people react?\n\nYou wouldn't be reading this story if everybody had just accepted the team's statement and moved on.\n\nLaurel County Sheriff John Root and Jailer Jamie Mosley made a statement of their own. In a viral video posted on social media, the pair, who were kind of disgusted and outraged about the disrespect that (the Wildcats) showed last night, set two old UK shirts on fire. Mosley encouraged fans who felt the same way to come to the Laurel County Jail on Monday to exchange their Kentucky gear for Back the Blue pro-police shirts.\n\nMembers of the Knox County Fiscal Court, meanwhile, denounced the team in a resolution and called for elected officials in the commonwealth to reallocate tax funding from unpatriotic recipients to hardworking Kentucky Taxpayer's (sic) across this commonwealth, as the team's pregame gesture lacks respect for the veterans that have served our country.\n\nThe most emotional response, though, came from Stivers. He delivered an emotional address Monday night on the Senate floor, noting that as a father of an active military member and the nephew of a Korean War veteran, he was hurt by the team's actions.\n\nTheir pregame statement was legal, he noted, but Stivers — who said he condemns what happened at the Capitol riot — questioned whether Saturday's game was the right time and place to take action.\n\nHe asked people to think about the older people like me who have read these letters of their uncles and know that their fathers and their grandfathers served and were willing to serve even to the point they may not come back.\n\nIn a joint statement, Barnhart and university President Eli Capilouto stood by the team. In a country built on free speech, they said, it's important for young students to find their voices.\n\nWe won't always agree on every issue, their statement said. However, we hope to agree about the right of self-expression, which is so fundamental to who we are as an institution of higher learning. We live in a polarized and deeply divided country. Our hope — and that of our players and our coaches — is to find ways to bridge divides and unify.\n\nWhat has Calipari previously said?\n\nCalipari has spoken out on social issues and against racism before.\n\nIn 2016 he noted he'd seen employees at stores and airlines offer different treatment to him as opposed to Bruiser Flint, a Black assistant coach at UK.\n\nI've been on an airplane where we're in first class and they come over to me, 'Hey sir, would you like something to drink?' Calipari told reporters. And then they go to Bruiser, and what do they say to him? 'Can I see your ticket?' Can you see his ticket? You know me: 'Why didn't you ask me for my ticket? Why you asking him for his ticket?'\n\nAnd in 2017, a memo UK gave to players that outlined talking points with media members discouraged athletes from discussing prospects of an undefeated season or jumping to the NBA but had a different message when it came to racial unity.\n\nOn the current social issues and political landscape, we are NOT going to tell you not to answer these or to express your opinion, the memo read. Some things are bigger than basketball, and the current landscape is.\n\nWhile the memo specifically stated players were welcome to speak out about social issues, it did request that those athletes know the facts and be prepared to deal with people who may disagree.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nIn the press conference Monday, forward Olivier Sarr said the team had not yet decided whether to continue to kneel during the national anthem in upcoming games, though the team has not been on the court for the anthem during home games this season at Rupp Arena in Lexington. Kentucky hosted Alabama on Tuesday night, and both teams stayed in the locker rooms for the anthem.\n\nCalipari said he still wants his players to express themselves peacefully in a heated political environment. In his eyes, however, the next steps should be about finding ways to unite fans.\n\nI said, you can stand up and scream and all the things, but at the end of the day, what are you doing to bring people together? he said. (We're) trying to keep these kids on track, trying to focus, trying to keep our fans being positive about these kids. That's why I keep coming back to how they pick people up and what they do. That's everything we've been trying to do here.\n\nSarr, who thanked Calipari for joining the Wildcats on one knee, said unity was the point of their statement.\n\nI think it sends a big message, Sarr said. We're a unit, and that's what we want this country to be. We are all together in it.\n\nContributing: Jon Hale, Emma Austin and Billy Kobin.
The Internal Revenue Service's handling of its private debt-collection program is harming lower-income Americans who can least afford to repay tax debts, a federal watchdog warned Wednesday.\n\nThe program also may be a waste of money, based on the cost of the program and a review of the actual payments recovered.\n\nWhile Congress directed the IRS to use private debt-collection firms to seek nearly $400 billion owed, the tax agency also was expected to follow an existing rule designed to ensure that taxpayers have an adequate means to provide for basic expenses, National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson said in the annual report to Congress.\n\nBut the watchdog's review of tax returns filed as of late September by 4,141 taxpayers who made tax payments after their cases were assigned to private collectors found that 19% of the group had incomes below the federal poverty level. These taxpayers had a median income of $6,386, the report said.\n\nAdditionally, 25% of the group had incomes below 250% of the federal poverty level, a common low-income marker. They had a median income of $23,096, the report said.\n\nMore:That call from an unlisted number? Might be a collections rep for IRS\n\nIRS turns to debt collectors to call about unpaid taxes\n\nThe IRS likely would have given these taxpayers hardship status and classified their debts as currently uncollectible if the tax agency had handled the accounts itself, Olson wrote. Instead, the tax agency assigned the cases to private debt-collection firms that don't conduct financial analyses before contacting the taxpayers for repayments, the report said.\n\nNo one is making the IRS make these bad decisions, wrote Olson, who called the actions an end-run around Congressional safeguards. The harm to these taxpayers is something IRS leadership consciously decided to do despite my personal efforts, and those of my organization, to stop it.\n\nThe report additionally suggested the private debt collections are a waste of money.\n\nThe tax agency assigned nearly $920 million of inactive tax receivables to private collection firms through Sept. 14. About $7 million, or less than 1% of the total tax debts assigned for collection, had been recovered as of that date, the report found in a review of IRS data.\n\nThe costs totaled approximately $20 million through Sept. 30, with roughly $1 million in commissions paid to the private debt-collection firms and the rest covering other program expenses.\n\nThus, it does not appear that the (private-collection agencies) are particularly effective in collecting the debts assigned to them, Olson's report said. In any event, the cost of the (private debt collection) program thus far exceeds the revenue it generates.\n\nThe IRS said private debt collectors return cases to the tax agency if a taxpayer said she or he was unable to make repayments now or in the near future. Although revenue from the collection program has been low, it is projected to increase over time, the IRS said.\n\nThe new criticism of private debt collection focuses on a controversial program the IRS launched at the direction of Congress in 2017, years after previous versions of private debt-collection efforts ended with limited success.\n\nConsumer advocates have argued that scammers potentially would harm taxpayers by posing as representatives of the private-collection companies used by the IRS. Separately, the union that represents IRS employees has said those workers would do a better collection job at less cost if Congress gave the IRS sufficient personnel funding.\n\nThen-IRS commissioner John Koskinen said in April when the collection effort launched that the tax agency would work to ensure that the four companies chosen for the job would work responsibly and respect taxpayer rights.\n\nWhile urging taxpayers to beware of potential scammers, Koskinen said the only people being contacted by the companies are taxpayers who had been contacted earlier by the IRS about overdue tax payments.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc
Jordan Wathen\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWhereas people bought homes with bank loans before the housing crisis and dot-com stocks on margin during the 1990s tech bubble, most people aren't using borrowed money to buy bitcoin. At least, that's what we think.\n\nTruthfully, there's little way to know how billions of dollars in daily bitcoin transactions are financed, because cryptocurrencies are largely bought and sold on unregulated markets. But it seems evident, at least to me, that a small portion of the bitcoin market thrives on other people's money, and lenders may be left holding the bag on bitcoin's plunge.\n\nBuying bitcoin on credit\n\nA recent LendEDU poll of bitcoin investors found that 18% of buyers used a credit card to make their investment. Of those, 22% could not afford to fully pay off their balance after buying the digital currency, suggesting that speculators were risking more than they could truly afford to lose.\n\nThe findings corroborate with other data that suggest credit cards may have helped fuel bitcoin's boom in 2017. As the price of bitcoin soared, the number of Google searchers looking for a way to use credit cards to buy the cryptocurrency jumped, too, reaching a peak in the week of Dec. 3 to Dec. 9, 2017.\n\nCredit card balances increased markedly at the same time bitcoin was soaring. Revolving consumer credit balances increased at an annual rate of 9.9% year over year in October 2017. In November, balances jumped by 13.3%, according to the Federal Reserve. To put the increases in perspective, consider that revolving balances increased at a 7.3% annual clip in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\nMore: Bitcoin drops below $10,000; $30B value wiped in a day as cryptocurrency sell-off deepens\n\nMore: 4 reasons cryptocurrencies shed $304 billion in value in just 3 days\n\nMore: Bitcoin sell-off deepens, digital currency now down 50% from recent peak as Dow closes above 26,000\n\nBanks are backing away\n\nSome banks are turning off their customers' ability to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on credit. Based on numerous reports, Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF) began blocking credit card transactions at known cryptocurrency exchanges on Jan. 12, 2018, when bitcoin had already lost a third of its value from its all-time high set one month earlier.\n\nIn a statement to Breitbart, Capital One said that it is currently declining credit card transactions to purchase cryptocurrency because of the limited mainstream acceptance and the elevated risks of fraud, loss, and volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market. It also said it would continue to evaluate allowing its customers to use their cards to buy digital currencies.\n\nThat a major credit card company is actively standing in the way of bitcoin purchases suggests, at least to me, that it found something it didn't like in the cohort of customers who had used their cards at online currency exchanges.\n\nLittle room for error\n\nIn light of declining prices of digital currencies, credit card lenders may have to set aside more cash for increased defaults, weighing on their profits. Capital One's domestic card business earned pre-tax income of $748 million on average balances of $93.7 billion in the third quarter of 2017. What it set aside for losses was roughly double what it earned in pre-tax profits that quarter.\n\nWhen margins are razor thin, any loan loss can be a significant loan loss. That goes double for credit card issuers, who often see their non-interest expenses increase with their loan loss provisions, as they spend more money trying to collect on bad debts.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying that the plunge in digital currency prices is likely to result in an economic catastrophe quite like the 2008 financial crisis. Far from it. But I suspect that bank earnings may take a bitcoin-related hit as bad debts emerge from the rubble of depressed cryptocurrency prices.\n\nJordan Wathen has no position in any of the stocks or cryptocurrencies mentioned.

MIAMI — The NFL might not have seen the last of Donald Trump.\n\nDespite being rebuffed in his efforts to buy the Buffalo Bills, and the leaguewide revulsion to his profane call to fire protesting players, Trump remains an NFL fan. And given the, oh, how shall we say it, intensity of his time in the White House, one associate said he could see the president trying to buy an NFL team again after he leaves office.\n\nI remember him telling me once, when we were meeting about the Buffalo Bills, he said to me, 'Look at these guys. Do you see how much fun they're having?'  said Michael Caputo, who helped Trump with his bid for the Bills and later was an adviser to his presidential campaign. I know it's not all fun and games. But I think after the presidency and the flames of politics he's walked through, he might be looking for a little more fun.\n\nI think he's found his life's work, Caputo added. After the presidency, he'll be looking for his life's hobby.\n\nAt first glance, Trump and the NFL would seem to be the most awkward of fits. His experience as an owner in the USFL was an unmitigated disaster. In fact, many involved in the league have said Trump led the USFL to ruin in hopes he could parlay it into buying an NFL team. Not exactly a trustworthy partner.\n\nThe NFL is also almost exclusively a billionaire boys club, emphasis on the billionaire, and it's no longer certain Trump qualifies. His former attorney, Michael Cohen, has testified Trump inflated his net worth during his attempt to buy the Bills.\n\nUSA TODAY INTERVIEW:Antonio Brown says 'I put myself in a bad predicament'\n\nSPECIAL REPORT:Super Bowl site Miami leads NFL in one category: player arrests\n\nThen there's the matter of where Trump's money comes from. He might not disclose his tax returns to the American people, but the NFL wouldn't approve any prospective owner without knowing the source of every dollar, ruble and riyal.\n\nAnd, with the exception of Jerry Jones, most NFL owners prefer to stay in the background unless they're hoisting a trophy. To say that isn't Trump's style is putting it mildly.\n\nAnd yet, the NFL is also exactly Trump's kind of people. Not the players, of course. More than two-thirds of the players in the league are black, and many have made no secret of their feelings about a president who has a penchant for demonizing people of color.\n\nWhen the Eagles won the Super Bowl two years ago, in fact, they actually found themselves uninvited to the White House because so many players said they wouldn't go. (Though, can you really be uninvited if you've already said you aren't going to go?)\n\nAsked during Monday's Opening Night how they would feel about having Trump as an NFL owner, most players begged off the topic. But one, Chiefs fullback Anthony Sherman, said he'd have had no problem playing for Trump.\n\nI think he would have been a great owner, he said.\n\nSan Francisco cornerback Richard Sherman wasn't so sure. A lot of owners aren't as involved and aren't as boisterous or around or seen by their teams, Sherman said. I'm sure he'd be more prevalent.\n\nFor many owners, though, Trump's management style, as well as his history of racism and bigotry, might not be a disqualifying factor.\n\nWoody Johnson, owner of the Jets, is Trump's ambassador to the United Kingdom. He and eight others donated to Trump's campaign or inaugural committee.\n\nIn August, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, then a member of the NFL's social justice committee, hosted a fundraiser for Trump with tickets ranging from $5,600 to $250,000.\n\nHe counts NFL stars and owners among his closest friends, Caputo said.\n\nSo what of his blistering criticism of the league two years ago, during the height of the player protests? Besides it being perfect fodder for a stunt that could gin up his base – he ordered Vice President Mike Pence to walk out of a game because some 49ers players demonstrated during the anthem – it was actually an indication of just how badly Trump craves NFL approval. Kind of like the 6-year-old boy who pulls the hair of the girl he likes.\n\nHe's been elected president, where maybe a great goal he had in life to own an NFL team is not very likely, Jaguars owner Shahid Khan told USA TODAY Sports at the time. So to make it tougher, or to hurt the league, it's very calculated.\n\nIt's about money, or messing with – trying to soil a league or a brand that he's jealous of.\n\nOne way or another, Donald Trump is determined to get his piece of the NFL.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

Any woman who isn't investing money in a 401(k) plan – or maybe only sets aside a tiny amount – needs to realize that the retirement game is stacked against her.\n\nWomen are more at risk in their older years for economic insecurity, said Amy Matsui, director of income security and senior counsel for the National Women's Law Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nHere are some thoughts to motivate everyone from their 20s to 60s to stick to New Year's resolutions and save far more aggressively in 2019:\n\nThere's a gender gap in retirement\n\nThe wage gap that women experience in their working years morphs into a gender retirement gap.\n\nUnfortunately, women have less income rather than more when it comes to retirement, Matsui said.\n\nBased on today's wage gap, a woman who worked full time, year round would typically lose $406,760 over a 40-year career, according to a report by the National Women's Law Center. The example assumes a constant wage gap of $10,169 each year.\n\nTo make up that lost money, a woman who fits this example would have to work nearly 10 years longer than her male counterpart.\n\nMore:From a chance of a recession to interest rates: 5 things to know about your money in 2019\n\nMore:How banks are helping you budget and track your money to avoid overspending\n\nMore:Why Ohio bitcoin tax gimmick is like paying with Beanie Babies\n\nTaking home less money, of course, means a woman has less discretionary income to set aside toward savings. A smaller nest egg ultimately would threaten economic security later in life.\n\nWomen in nearly every occupation face a wage gap, according to Matsui. Women in the United States, who work full time, year round are typically paid only 80 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts, according to the National Women's Law Center.\n\nStarting out at a lower wage often is hard to overcome, especially when raises or pay in a new job ends up being based on previous salary histories.\n\nMatsui noted that women find it harder to save for retirement several reasons. They tend to earn less than men. They're more likely to be low-wage workers. They're more likely to leave paid work to be caregivers. They're more economically affected by divorce.\n\nAnd they're more likely to work part time or for small employers, and may not be able to participate in a 401(k) plan as a result.\n\nSome experts note that some women may be held back because they aren't comfortable demanding a raise; others may be unwilling to apply for promotions for jobs that would conflict with raising children.\n\nLong lifespans mean bigger bills\n\nAfter a couple reaches age 64, two-thirds of the women will outlive their husbands by almost 12 years, according to a 2016 study by TIAA.\n\nThe expenses associated with living alone are dramatically higher than when two people are able to share household chores and expenses. Matsui noted that women also may be more reliant on their spouse's retirement benefits.\n\nWomen age 63 on average end up with only two-thirds of the retirement savings and benefits that men do.\n\nWomen face higher health care expenses\n\nWomen age 63 and up are projected to spend 30 percent more on health care in retirement than men, according to a study by HealthView Services.\n\nWomen may be more likely to suffer through chronic illnesses and may be less likely to benefit from a spouse who serves as a caretaker.\n\nMen and women have different life journeys\n\nWomen often can face a wealth gap, in part, because of family or life expectations set for women – ranging from parenting to care-giving duties for elders.\n\nTwo-thirds of care provided to older adults is done by women, whether involving a parent, grandparent, parent-in-law or other family member or friend, according to a Merrill Lynch-Age Wave study.\n\nLeaving a job or cutting back on hours to take care of young children or older adults can lead to lost benefits and promotions, in addition to extra out-of-pocket costs. The average caregiver spends $7,000 a year on their care recipient.\n\nMothers also experience a mommy penalty, a pay gap that is three times that of non-mothers because of lost income and missed opportunities for promotions caused by breaks from the workforce, the Merrill Lynch-Age Wage study noted.\n\nAs for good news, more women are going to college and may have access to better paying jobs than their mothers or grandmothers.\n\nWomen now graduate from college and graduate school in higher numbers than men, according to the study, which boosts their career options.\n\nAbout 42 percent of women ages 18 to 64 have a bachelor's degree or higher. That's up from 25 percent in 1992.\n\nHowever, women are juggling more student loan debt and then are likely to face the gender pay gap.\n\nWomen now hold about 65 percent of all student debt, according to the Merrill Lynch study conducted in partnership with Age Wave.\n\nIt's harder for women to save and subsequently invest if they are simultaneously paying down debt and accumulating less income, the Women & Financial Wellness: Beyond the Bottom Line study conducted in partnership with Age Wave noted.\n\nSuch statistics, of course, are depressing to read but they're realistic in many cases, according to Melissa Spickler, managing director for the Merrill Lynch office in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.\n\nMillennials need to pay attention early on, she said, and begin saving for retirement as soon as they begin working. If one doesn't have a 401(k) plan at work, it's possible to set aside money elsewhere using other retirement savings vehicles, such as a Roth IRA.\n\nMany times, Spickler said, women may not want to save for retirement when they're newly married because they think they have many years ahead to worry about retirement.\n\nOr the husband may argue that the couple can use the woman's salary to pay the bills, while the husband dedicates more pay toward retirement savings.\n\nBut she recommends that women start saving for retirement as soon as they get that first job and keep doing so throughout their lives.\n\nSpickler said some women may be less willing to seek outside financial advice, which they need, and instead depend too much on a husband to take care of all financial matters.\n\nWomen tend to be more risk averse when it comes to how they're investing their 401(k) savings, as well, according to the TIAA report called Income Insights: Gender Retirement Gap.\n\nMany times, women will have more money parked in cash instead of invested in mutual funds than men do, which can hold back how much money they'd ultimately have in retirement.\n\nEven young workers who may be paid the same amount of money at the same company won't necessarily be equally well off in retirement.\n\nIn order for two recent college graduates to have the same amount of money saved for retirement, the young man would need to save 10 percent of his salary, while the woman would need to save 18 percent, according to the TIAA study.\n\nShelly-Ann Eweka, a director of financial planning for TIAA in Denver, said many young women at the start of their careers might not take into account that one day they might stop working to care for children or an elderly parent.\n\nSome women, she said, also won't see the raises or promotions that their male counterparts would receive.\n\nThey may not realize that going forward in the future that they'll work less and they'll get paid less, Eweka said.\n\nTo deal with those challenges, women need to save more money upfront for retirement, she said. And they need to diversify their investments, including stocks and annuities into the mix, in order to build healthier retirement balances. TIAA has a site called Woman2Woman at www.tiaa.org that lists tips.\n\nWomen won't have an easy time playing catch-up.\n\nOften, experts say, it's hard to find a good-paying job in one's field of expertise after leaving the workforce to be a stay-at-home mom or serve as a caregiver for another family member.\n\nWe are always the ones that stop our work, Spickler said. Everyone else always keeps on working.\n\nContact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876. Follow Susan on Twitter @Tompor.
AP\n\nMADRID (AP) — Croatia midfielder Luka Modric has appeared in court in a tax fraud case in Madrid.\n\nOfficials said Tuesday Modric was in court for about 10 minutes along with his wife and lawyer. The player's wife, Vadja, is also being accused of tax irregularities.\n\nSpanish prosecutors have accused the Real Madrid midfielder of defrauding tax authorities of 870,728 euros (about $1 million) in 2013 and 2014.\n\nLocal newspaper El Mundo says Modric has already paid nearly 1 million ($1.2 million) to tax authorities to try to reach a settlement even though the player has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nCourt and tax officials say they cannot confirm or deny the payment. Details of Modric's court appearance have not been released.\n\nModric has been playing for Madrid since being signed from Tottenham in 2012.\n\nSeveral other players have been targeted by Spanish tax authorities recently, including Lionel Messi who two years ago was found guilty — along with his father — for defrauding 4.1 million euros ($4.9 million) from income made from image rights.\n\nOther players investigated include: Cristiano Ronaldo, Marcelo, Ricardo Carvalho, Angel Di Maria, Javier Mascherano, Radamel Falcao and Fabio Coentrao.\n\nFormer Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho, currently at Manchester United, is also being investigated.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Spanish soccer coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/LaLiga
Sarah Skidmore Sell\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nIt's a new year and time to put the last one to bed, which means filing your taxes.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service says to expect a few changes when the nation's individual income tax filing season opens on Jan. 23.\n\nHere are some of the changes you should be aware of:\n\nNEW DATE\n\nTaxes are usually due on April 15, but this year that falls on a Saturday. And Emancipation Day, a holiday in Washington, D.C., will be observed on Monday, April 17.\n\nSo that pushes the nation's deadline to file returns and pay any amount due to April 18.\n\nYou don't have to wait until then to meet with a tax professional or start the process though.\n\nDELAYED REFUNDS\n\nA new law may delay refunds for some low to moderate income taxpayers who file early.\n\nThe Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act, known as the PATH Act, requires the IRS to withhold refunds on tax returns claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit until mid-February. The change is designed to give the IRS more time to detect and prevent tax fraud.\n\nThe affected refunds will start being released on Feb. 15 but they may not arrive in bank accounts until the week of Feb. 27, as it will take more time for financial institutions to accept and deposit the refunds. The three-day holiday weekend involving President's Day on Feb. 20 may also affect the timing of when funds are available.\n\nThe IRS said it still anticipates issuing more than nine out of 10 refunds in less than 21 days.\n\nThose with questions can use the Where's My Refund? tool on the ?on IRS.gov website and the IRS2Go phone app to find projected deposit dates for early EITC and ACTC refund filers a few days after Feb. 15.\n\nNEW ID NUMBERS\n\nThe PATH Act also requires that certain individual taxpayer identification numbers, known as ITINs, be renewed.\n\nAny ITIN that hasn't been used on a tax return at least once in the past three years, as well as any ITIN with middle digits of 78 or 79, must be renewed before a return can be processed. Anyone filing a tax return with an expired ITIN could experience return processing and refund delays, as well as denial of some tax benefits until the number is renewed. An ITIN renewal application could take up to 11 weeks to process during tax filing season.\n\nITINs are used by people who have tax-filing or payment obligations under U.S. law but are not eligible for a Social Security number.
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIt's official: Government shutdown becomes the longest in history\n\nThe partial government shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, entered its 22nd day early Saturday, making it the longest in history. The previous longest shutdown on record lasted from Dec. 5, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996, when Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Democratic President Bill Clinton faced off over taxes. On Friday, some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck since the shutdown began. The shutdown is the result of an impasse between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border. Negotiations stalled again this week after Trump abruptly left a White House meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. The president traveled to Texas Thursday to review the situation at the border.\n\nNFL's best weekend loaded with playoff action\n\nFrom The Immaculate Reception to last year's Minneapolis Miracle, the divisional round of the NFL playoffs has produced some of the greatest games in NFL history. This weekend's slate of games begins Saturday afternoon with the Colts visiting the Chiefs (4:35 p.m. ET, NBC). At night, Cowboys fans in L.A. will storm the Coliseum to watch Dallas take on the Rams (8:15 p.m. ET, FOX). The action continues Sunday as Philip Rivers and the Chargers travel cross-country to play Tom Brady and the Patriots (1:05 p.m. ET, CBS) and concludes with the defending champion Eagles visiting the New Orleans Saints (4:40 p.m. ET, FOX). Check out who our NFL staff thinks will advance to the conference championship games, along with who's on upset alert and the X-factors for all four games.\n\nMidwestern states brace for winter storm to hit the region\n\nA winter storm system packing snow, sleet and ice is bearing down on more than 20 million people this weekend, with heavy snow expected from Denver to New York City. The storm will most likely disrupt travel in the mid-Atlantic as it settles in on Saturday night. Motorists along key Interstate highways will be hardest hit, especially the I-64 and I-70 corridors of the Plains and Midwest. For many areas, this will be a long-duration winter storm event that lasts more than 12 hours and perhaps as much as 48 hours in some cases. Most of the snow should be over for the NFL playoff game Saturday in Kansas City, and forecasts indicate New England will escape the snowy onslaught for the game in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Sunday afternoon. Several major airlines are also waiving change fees.\n\nStars pay tribute to Aretha Franklin at Los Angeles concert\n\nJennifer Hudson, Alicia Keys, Celine Dion, SZA and Patti LaBelle are among the artists who will pay tribute to Aretha Franklin at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium on Sunday.Aretha! A Grammy Celebration for the Queen of Soul, which will be televised by CBS at a later date, was announced by the Recording Academy and is the latest in a recent series of Grammy tribute events, including concerts devoted to Stevie Wonder and the Beatles. The tribute concert comes days after MGM announced that Liesel Tommy will direct the long-gestating Franklin biopic, Respect, starring Jennifer Hudson as the Queen of Soul. Franklin died at the age of 76 in August from pancreatic cancer.\n\nFrance prepares for revived anti-government protests\n\nAuthorities in France have deployed 80,000 security forces nationwide for a ninth straight weekend of anti-government protests. The movement, which waned over the holidays, appears to be resurging despite President Emmanuel Macron's promises of billions of euros in tax relief and an upcoming national debate to address demonstrators' concerns. Online groups mounted calls through the week for actions in Bourges, a provincial capital with a renowned Gothic cathedral and picturesque wood-framed houses, and the suburban Paris business district of La Defense. But authorities warned that could be a ploy to draw police away from key sites in the capital, which epitomizes the power and wealth that's the target of the provincially driven protest movement. Protesters want deeper changes to France's economy and politics, seen as favoring the rich.\n\nContributing: Associated Press
Patrick Brennan\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — One of the first things Linda Windey did after picking up her $1 million prize in Wednesday's Powerball drawing was take a needle in her arm at the blood drive in front of Kentucky Lottery headquarters.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt just made sense. I had a million dollars fall out of the sky, said Windey, 41, of Parish, N.Y., who bought her winning ticket in Walton, Ky., while staying with family.\n\nEverybody is fixated on who might have the three winning tickets sold in California, Florida and Tennessee for the $1.586 billion grand prize, but Windey was one of 73 $1 million winners in 23 states across the USA, according to Multi-State Lottery Association officials. Eight of the more than 26 million tickets sold were $2 million winners because they paid an extra dollar to kick in the Power Play option.\n\nThe single mother of three children ages 10 to 17 matched the five white balls on one of her three tickets but not the red Powerball. She said she has no grand designs for spending her windfall and doesn't plan to stop working.\n\nState lottery: Winning ticket sold in Chino Hills, Calif.\n\nShe wants to spend wisely and provide for her children, she said.\n\nIt's the wrong time to be irresponsible, said Windey, who drove her family Thursday to Louisville to claim the prize.\n\nShe has been living with her brother in Bethel, Ohio, east of Cincinnati, so she could work a temporary job at the eBay distribution center in Walton. She has worked as a nurse in the past and said at a news conference that she has had financial struggles.\n\nI'm just thinking I can take better care of my kids now, said Windey, a longtime lottery player.\n\nHer ceremonial check may have had $1 million written on it, but the federal government automatically withholds 25% of the winnings and Kentucky takes out 6%. That puts the amount of money that she takes home at $690,000, but it won't be all that she'll owe eventually in taxes.\n\nHead-of-household taxpayers with a taxable income of $441,000 in 2016 will end up in the 39.6% federal tax bracket, according to the Tax Foundation. And her status as a temporary Ohio resident and permanent New York resident may mean additional payouts that only an accountant can decipher — and potentially closer to $500,000 in money that's really hers.\n\nWindey's 17-year-old son, Edward Blunt, said his mother had played the lottery for as long as he could remember but never won more than $20 on a single ticket.\n\nThe idea of winning became a running joke between him and his mom, the teen said.\n\nCatfish or Powerball winner? Internet freaks out over skateboarder's claim\n\nSo when Windey woke up her son at about 2:30 a.m. with news of their bounty, he was skeptical, thinking it was a continuation of the joke, he said.\n\nI just went back to bed, Edward said. I didn't believe it.\n\nAt first, Windey didn't believe it either.\n\nI checked the numbers six or seven times, she said.\n\nContributing: Sheldon S. Shafer, The (Louisville) Courier-Journal.

Major-college sports' never-ending fight over competitive balance has a new point of contention.\n\nThe federal tax-law changes passed in December 2017 included the creation of an excise tax on the pay of non-profit organizations' most highly compensated employees, a levy that targeted any college or university with a coach or athletics director making big money.\n\nHowever, while many athletics departments are now facing a substantial new expense, there also are schools that employ some of college sports' highest-paid coaches and will not have to pay, according to newly issued guidance from the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service and the schools' assertions of their federal tax-exempt status through documents posted on their websites and statements to USA TODAY Sports from school spokespeople.\n\nThe excise-tax provision was supposed to cover all non-profit organizations, imposing a 21% levy on compensation above $1 million — including bonuses — that goes to any of their five highest-paid employees in a year.\n\nMore:Opinion: The three biggest questions in college football for the 2019 season\n\nMore:Season grades for all 130 college football teams in the Bowl Subdivision\n\nThe guidance means that the provision has created three groups of schools: Those that clearly will have to pay the tax; those that can claim they won't have to pay; and those that currently have to pay, but might have the ability change their status.\n\n►Private schools and public schools carrying one type of federal tax-exempt status clearly will have to pay. For example, Duke faces a significant tab based just on men's basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski's pay, who has made more than $5 million for years, according to the school's federal tax filings.\n\n►Other public schools — including Texas, Texas A&M, Clemson, Oregon, Minnesota and Houston — can claim they will not have to pay because they assert that they are government units that have federal tax immunity without holding any other tax-exempt status. Whether they ultimately will take this position remains to be seen. If Texas A&M does, it would save close to $1.4 million related just to the compensation of football coach Jimbo Fisher, whose basic annual pay is $7.5 million.\n\n►Public schools that have another type of federal tax-exempt status are currently subject to the excise tax, but the new guidance also says these schools may voluntarily relinquish that status, although doing so might still leave them subject to the excise tax. Alabama, Michigan, UCLA and at least a dozen other public schools in Power Five conferences are in this group, according to documents posted on the schools' websites. Alabama football coach Nick Saban's $8.3 million in basic compensation, plus $875,000 in bonuses, for this season means the school faces more than $1.7 million in excise tax for him alone.\n\nYou've got a major competitive imbalance here, said Roger Denny, an executive compensation attorney with the law firm Spence Fane LLP who assists USA TODAY Sports with its annual compilation and analyses of college coaches' compensation. You have schools from the same states and the same conferences that are going after the same recruits, and you have an artificial restraint that affects hiring decisions at the highest level of those programs. …\n\nAnd there's a trickle-down effect to that: You have a difference of $500,000 here, $1 million there (in the cost of paying a coach and the excise tax) and that can be the difference in being able to go after the best coordinator in the game or hiring a football staff full of analysts as some schools have done, or installing a camera system in your gym to help the basketball teams with video study, or putting WiFi in your stadium.\n\nThe excise-tax provision was an effort by Congress to bring high-paying non-profits into alignment with publicly held corporations, which cannot take tax deductions on pay above $1 million for certain employees and are now subject to a basic tax rate of 21%.\n\nIt also was at least symbolically part of an offset to wide-reaching tax cuts, plus it had the bonus of clear, high-profile targets: Colleges and universities paying coaches enormous sums. So, no school — public or private — was supposed to be spared.\n\nBut the new Treasury/IRS guidance doesn't take into account Congressional intent. It's based on what the law actually says.\n\nThe positions reflected in this notice constitute a good faith, reasonable interpretation of the statute, the document says.\n\nFormer House Ways and Mean Committee chair Kevin Brady, R-Tex.. has circulated a draft of a bill that would make technical and clerical corrections to the tax-law changes, including one designed to make the excise tax applicable to all public colleges and universities. For now, though, the new guidance means Treasury intends to enforce the law as it is written, Denny said.\n\nHad Congress' drafting matched its intent, Texas would be set to owe taxes based at least on football coach Tom Herman's $5.5 million in basic compensation and men's basketball coach Shaka Smart's $3.2 million. That would have come to 21% of $4.5 million for Herman ($945,000), plus 21% of $2.2 million for Smart ($462,000).\n\nTexas' athletics revenues and expenses were both in excess of $200 million in fiscal 2017, according to school's most recently available NCAA financial report – but the $1.4 million in tax that would have been connected to Herman's and Smart's pay is more than what Texas spent to field a men's tennis team that year.\n\nTexas says its tax-exempt status comes from the university being a branch of the State of Texas, and the new Treasury/IRS guidance says the excise-tax provision was written in a way that means the tax does not have to be paid by a school that is a governmental unit and does not have another form of federal tax-exempt recognition. Texas' position is similar to the ones held by Clemson, Texas A&M, Oregon, Minnesota and Houston.
WASHINGTON – Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wants a lower overall price tag.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, doesn't want a minimum wage increase included.\n\nDemocratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer still wants a bold and robust bill.\n\nCompeting interests, a thin House majority, and a Senate composition that gives an enormous amount of power to individual members mean President Joe Biden faces an uphill climb to pass his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package.\n\nMore aid for Americans could be on the chopping block, including a one-year expansion of the child tax credit, $1,400 stimulus checks and a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. The pending impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump and Republican resistance to the overall price tag also loom large.\n\nThe argument is centered on a key question: Are all of the bill's provisions related to the pandemic?\n\nTrump's second impeachment trial:As the numbers suggest a Trump acquittal, Senators explore censure and brace for impeachment trial\n\nRep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., the co-chair of the moderate House Problem Solvers Caucus, told reporters Wednesday that the inclusion of the minimum wage increase could make the package seem like it was contaminated by partisans who wanted to use it as a vehicle to legislate on things that are not related directly to the crisis.\n\nAnd Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, a key moderate, said the minimum wage increase was important to Democrats but really has nothing to do with COVID relief, pointing instead to provisions like the last package's $300 boost to unemployment benefits as a higher-priority agenda item.\n\nBiden says he's open to some negotiation, but not all\n\nBiden's proposal includes a broad variety of policy priorities, including $20 billion for national vaccination program, expanding unemployment insurance supplemental payments to $400 per week, expanding to 14 weeks paid sick and family and medical leave, and allocating $25 billion in rental assistance and an additional $5 billion to cover home energy and water costs.\n\nBiden and several administration officials have said they are open to negotiating the $1,400 stimulus check or the threshold around who will receive it.\n\nWell, there's a legitimate reason for people to say, 'Do you have the lines drawn the exact right way? Should it go to anybody making over X-number of dollars or why?' Biden told reporters Monday. I'm open to negotiate those things. That's all.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday on the Senate floor that the first draft of Biden's proposal misses the mark. He said he would support a smart and targeted package rather than what he called an imprecise deluge of borrowed money.\n\nMore:The filibuster may make it difficult for Joe Biden to pass his agenda - even in a Democratic Congress. Here's why\n\nMore:Homeland Security worries extremists 'emboldened' by Capitol riots may cause more violence\n\nAnd key Senate Republicans like Collins have concurred. She told reporters Monday she wanted a package that would focus solely on the pandemic rather than include a wish list of Democratic priorities like an increase to the minimum wage, though she said she would support debate over the minimum wage in a separate bill.\n\nDespite the Biden administration's openness to negotiate, Biden indicated it may be difficult to take out certain policies from the package as they are hand in glove issues.\n\nI'm reluctant to cherry-pick and take out one or two items here, and then have to go through it again to – because these all are kind of – they go, sort of, hand in glove, each of these issues, he said.\n\nDemocrats may decide to go it alone via reconciliation\n\nSchumer signaled Wednesday that he might move forward without Republican support anyway.\n\nWe must not repeat the mistakes of 2008 and 2009, when Congress was too timid to confront the national crisis, he said, referring to the federal government's relief packages passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis that progressives derided as too small to fully restore the American economy.\n\nThe Senate is split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats, with Vice President Kamala Harris available to break ties. That means that for most legislation, Democrats need to secure at least 10 Republican votes to pass a key procedural hurdle and break a potential filibuster. In the House, Democrats hold only a three-seat margin, leaving little room for error.\n\nIf they are unable to secure enough Republican support to break a filibuster, Democrats can skip that process if they use a procedure known as budget reconciliation, where they can pass legislation with a simple majority but are subject to certain rules that could make it more difficult to include some Democratic priorities like the $15 minimum wage increase.\n\nWhen asked about passing the bill through reconciliation, Biden said that decision will be one made by the leaders of the House and the Senate.\n\nBoth sides have used reconciliation to attempt to pass major legislation in the past. Republicans tried to use the process to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017, but failed when three Republican senators voted with all Democrats to reject the repeal. Republicans later succeeded, however, in passing a major tax code reform through reconciliation.\n\nNonetheless, Republicans are sure to raise objections if Democrats attempt to do so with COVID-19 stimulus.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt, R- Mo., a member of Senate Republican leadership, predicted Tuesday that litigation was possible if Democrats tried to force a minimum wage increase through the budget reconciliation process.\n\nMore:Now majority leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer explains plans for the nation, NY and impeachment\n\nMore:DC police details Capitol riot officer injuries\n\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said it would be irresponsible for Democrats to push through a package through reconciliation while negotiations were ongoing.\n\nGive us a chance, he said.\n\nPortman is part of a bipartisan group of 16 senators and two House lawmakers who met with top Biden administration officials by Zoom on Sunday. The lawmakers pressed the administration on the justification for the price tags for all of the programs the administration wanted included in the package.\n\nBut progressives are unfazed by Republicans' opposition to using reconciliation. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is the incoming chair of the Senate Budget Committee, told reporters Wednesday, The minimum wage has got to be raised to 15 bucks; we think that can be done by reconciliation and I think I can get that done.\n\nLawmakers have also raised concerns about their ability to work on COVID-19 as former President Donald Trump's impeachment looms over the Senate. The trial could put a halt to most work in the chamber as lawmakers deliberate over Trump's fate.\n\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., told reporters Monday that they had a two-week window to make progress on a COVID-19 relief deal before legislative progress might grind to a halt. Still, other senators took a longer view of negotiations.\n\nRomney told reporters Monday that the key was to have something in place that will extend unemployment insurance after March 14, when it's due to expire.\n\nSchumer, for his part, insisted Tuesday that the Senate will be able to work on Cabinet nominations, impeachment, and COVID-19 relief simultaneously.\n\nThe Biden administration wants to pass the relief package in the next month. Biden said Monday that time is of the essence.\n\nThere's an urgency to moving it forward, and he certainly believes ...there needs to progress in the next couple of weeks, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. She added that if the relief package was not passed soon, there would be a point where there would not be enough funding for vaccine distribution or funding to reopen schools this year.\n\nMore:Worried about your financial security?

Arlington\n\nOne of the most important species of fish in the ocean's food chain is getting a close look to help determine the health of its population. Two arms of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission are working on an assessment of the menhaden stock. The commission is an interstate board that regulates coastal fisheries. Menhaden are small, schooling fish that play a critical role in the ocean's health because they are important food for whales, larger fish, seabirds and others. They're also harvested commercially for use as fish oil and aquaculture feed. The Atlantic States commission says the health of the menhaden population will be the subject of meetings in Arlington in early April intended to inform the management of the Atlantic menhaden fishery.
Toyota and Mazda have reportedly picked Alabama as the location of their new $1.6 billion, 4,000-job assembly plant, capping a national race to score the biggest economic development prize in years for the auto industry.\n\nThe Japanese automakers are set to announce that they will locate their new joint-venture factory in a state that already has Toyota, Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz factories, according to Reuters and the Birmingham Business Journal.\n\nThe move suggests that Toyota and Mazda may be poised to capitalize on a sharp increase in state tax incentives recently signed into law by Gov. Kay Ivey.\n\nIt also reflects the strength of Alabama's manufacturing sector. The state assembled more than 1 million vehicles in 2016 at plants employing nearly 40,000 workers. The statewide unemployment rate was 3.5% in November.\n\nAlabama was long viewed as one of the leading contenders for the factory because of its tax incentives, low-cost labor and bustling automotive sector. The state's factories are also not unionized — a factor that seems to appeal to foreign automakers.\n\nOfficials from Toyota and Mazda declined to comment late Tuesday afternoon.\n\nReuters reported the plant would be located in Huntsville, while the Birmingham Business Journal reported the factory would be built at a mega site in Limestone County just west of Huntsville.\n\nA spokesperson for Ivey would not immediately comment on the reports, and other local officials could not be reached.\n\nJob-creating projects of this magnitude are rare. It would be only the fourth new U.S. assembly plant in about the last decade when it opens in 2021.\n\nToyota and Mazda announced their deal to collaborate in August, saying they would make a decision on where to locate the facility after Jan. 1.\n\nThe announcement marked a victory for President Trump, who had disparaged Toyota for selling vehicles in the U.S. that are made in foreign markets. About half of Toyota vehicles sold to Americans are made domestically, according to Barclays.\n\nBy contrast, Mazda imports all of its U.S.-sold vehicles.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.
Tina Orem\n\nNerdWallet.com\n\nIt's never been easier to do your own taxes, with software getting more user-friendly each year. But as your financial picture grows more complex, it's perfectly sensible to wonder if you're missing something and should get someone to prepare and help file your taxes.\n\nHere are some scenarios that can clarify whether you ought to hire a professional tax preparer or keep going it alone.\n\nWhen it's probably OK to DIY with tax software\n\nYou're a steady Eddie\n\nIf all of your income came from your employer, you're not itemizing on your return and nothing complicated is going on in your life, tax software could be a good choice, says Marianela Collado, a certified financial planner at Tobias Financial Advisors in Plantation, Fla.\n\nConsistency is also key, says Karl Frank, a certified financial planner and president of A&I Financial Services in Englewood, Colorado. If your tax situation is the same as it was last year and you're not taking many deductions, then software may be a great tool, he says.\n\nYou understand what the software is asking you\n\nIf you have some knowledge and you're comfortable navigating through the prompts and understanding the questions, then I think it's OK, Collado says.\n\nHowever, if, for example, the software asks whether you contributed to your employer's 401(k) plan, and you don't know the answer or don't know why it's asking the question, you probably need to meet with a human tax preparer, she says.\n\n» Know where you stand? A tax calculator can help\n\nWhen it's probably time to get help filing your taxes\n\nYou have a business or a side gig\n\nFreelancers, independent contractors and people with side gigs should hire a human tax preparer, Frank says. There are extra forms to fill out, along with many rules about the right way to report your income and even more rules about how to handle your expenses.\n\nIf this is you, then it's really advantageous to have a human being to talk to at least once a year for an hour or two — you may be paying more [tax] than you need to, he says.\n\nYou don't understand the forms you GET in the mail\n\nIf the tax forms landing in your mailbox are completely foreign to you, take them to a human preparer. For instance, Collado says many people are thrown by something called a K-1, which may arrive if they invest in certain types of companies.\n\nThey don't know what to do with it, she says. They should have a CPA. There are special rules on how to treat those things.\n\nYou actually want advice\n\nTax preparation involves a lot of data entry, but many people want guidance and help with planning too, Frank says.\n\nA lot of the logic can be handled by computers. A lot of the wisdom you can only get from a person, he says.\n\nCollado knows what he means.\n\nI've seen it time and time again, where either someone's been doing their own tax return or they have a friend do it. No one has asked them about being able to set up a Roth IRA. No one's talked to them about what it means to maximize 401(k) contributions. No one is telling them that maybe it's time to make estimated tax payments, she says. Two or three points that they recommend could be life-changing.\n\nMore From NerdWallet\n\nTina Orem is a writer at NerdWallet.

LEXINGTON, Ky. — After three days of backlash from the Kentucky men's basketball team's decision to kneel during the national anthem, coach John Calipari said the timing of the demonstration may not have been wise.\n\nThese kids, they're good kids, Calipari said Tuesday after his team's 85-65 loss to Alabama when asked about the criticism of Saturday's protest. They have good hearts. This political time, probably not a real good time to do it.\n\nCalipari learned his players wanted to kneel during the anthem before Saturday's game at Florida just more than an hour before the game. After explaining their rationale for the demonstration, players asked Calipari and the other Kentucky coaches to kneel with them.\n\nThe staff, including the Hall of Fame head coach, kneeled with players during the anthem, though Calipari did still hold his hand over his heart while the song was played.\n\nResponse to the protest has been mixed, but several of the most negative reactions have come from Kentucky politicians.\n\nThe sheriff and jailer in Laurel County posted a video to Facebook of them burning Kentucky T-shirts. The Knox County Fiscal Court adopted a resolution asking Gov. Andy Beshear and members of the state legislature to reallocate tax funds given to the University of Kentucky in response to the team's protest. Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, delivered an emotional address Monday night on the Senate floor, saying he was hurt by the team's actions because of his family's ties to the military.\n\nHalf of these kids come form military families, Calipari said. ...This had nothing to do with military. They had all the stuff that was going on, and they felt like they needed to do something.\n\nOn his radio show Monday night, Calipari said he told his team it was time to get on with basketball. In the first game since the backlash to the protest started rolling in, Kentucky was blown out by Alabama in a matchup for first place in the Southeastern Conference standings.\n\nYou don't need to speak now, Calipari said he told the team. You need to have action. How do you bring people together? How do you make a difference? Not just, how do you make a statement?\n\nCalipari said the team will work on finding actions to address the issues players knelt to bring awareness to in the wake of the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol, but the next steps likely will not come in front of cameras.\n\nAs has been the case at Rupp Arena all season, Kentucky players were not on the court for the anthem before Tuesday's game against Alabama. Asked for clarification why teams are not on the court for the anthem this year as they had been in previous seasons, a Kentucky spokesman pointed to an offseason SEC rule change eliminating the requirement teams be on the floor for the anthem.\n\nWe reevaluated our pregame routine to fit what worked best for our team, he said.\n\nAsked to clarify if his assessment that the politically charged climate may have made this an inopportune time to kneel meant he thought the protest was a mistake, Calipari said no.\n\nI'm not saying that, he said. It's what they wanted to do. ... They felt the timing was right because of what they're seeing on TV.\n\nFollow Jon Haleon Twitter at @JonHale_CJ.
In his first few days in office, President Joe Biden moved swiftly to deliver on promises to Hispanic voters, signing a directive to protect Dreamers from deportation and unveiling an outline for sweeping changes to immigration laws.\n\nTuesday afternoon, the president announced a task force to reunite families separated at the border and an executive order that reviews a Trump administration policy requiring migrants seeking asylum to wait in Mexico while they plead their case.\n\nBut executive actions are not permanent, and the White House already has begun tamping down hopes for passage of an omnibus reform measure.\n\nThat leaves some Latino advocacy groups looking at an untested fallback plan: a mass presidential pardon for at least some of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally.\n\nWe believe this is a viable option if the Senate fails to act on comprehensive immigration reform, said Domingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens.\n\nReversing Trump:Biden to create task force to reunite families separated at border, sign order to review asylum program\n\nReuniting families:628 parents remain separated from their kids after Trump's zero-tolerance border policy. Biden wants to find them.\n\nHector Sánchez Barba, executive director at Mi Familia Vota,said congressional action is the top priority, and Biden has put forth the most progressive plan I've seen, probably in our history.\n\nBut if Congress fails to reform immigration laws, he said, I am in an action mode. … We will advocate for anything that reverses the extremism and damage of the Trump administration.\n\nIt is unclear how Biden would respond if pressed to pursue a mass pardon. Moreover, not all immigrant-rights advocates want to pursue that controversial path while there is a chance Congress could act.\n\nJorge Loweree, policy director with the American Immigration Council, said a presidential pardon for immigration violators falls short because it wouldn't put people on a path to citizenship; it would just cure one of the barriers to getting there.\n\nThe clemency proposition is not new. In late 2016, before Trump was inaugurated, Garcia and others feared the new president would launch draconian deportations of undocumented immigrants – especially those brought to the United States as children, called Dreamers based on never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act.\n\nDozens of advocacy groups and at least three Democrats in Congress implored then-President Barack Obama to issue last-minute amnesty. In a letter to the president, Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California and her colleagues described the proposed pardon as a matter of life and death for many of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nObama denied the request. And Trump carried out his promised crackdown.\n\nBiden acts to undo Trump's immigration policies\n\nTrump's promise of a border wall was the hallmark of his first presidential campaign. In office, he tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows people brought to the U.S. as children to remain in the country, but he was largely blocked by court rulings. As part of a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry, children were separated from parents at the southern border. The administration tried to prevent most migrants from claiming political asylum and required those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico.\n\nCut to 2020 and Biden's platform was the polar opposite: He vowed to stop construction of Trump's southern border wall, protect Dreamers and overhaul U.S. immigration laws that have not changed significantlyin three decades.\n\nOn his first day in office, Biden signed an executive memorandum reinstating DACA and unveiled a sweeping immigration reform package.\n\nUnder that proposal, agricultural workers, people who arrived illegally as children and immigrants with what is known as temporary protected status would immediately qualify for green cards – giving them legal status and a right to work. Other undocumented immigrants in the United States as of Jan. 1 would receive temporary legal status for five years, with a path to citizenship if they passed background checks and paid taxes.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a Republican who had supported a bipartisan immigration reform plan, ripped Biden's legislative plan as mass amnesty – the exact words used by Trump loyalist Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.\n\nMeanwhile, congressional Democrats who once pushed Obama to pardon Dreamers went silent.\n\nLofgren,a former immigration attorney and the most recent chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, declined to comment on whether she may ask Biden to use his pardon power.\n\nIn a written statement, she said she's focused on working with the president to advance our shared bold vision to reform our country's immigration system.\n\nOther members of the House and Senate did not respond to emails and calls. Neither did a White House spokesman.\n\nA constitutional 'gray area'\n\nOn Jan. 21, 1977, more than 570,000 American offenders were given pardons.\n\nIt was the first full day in office for President Jimmy Carter, and he used it to grant amnesty to Vietnam-era draft dodgers. Nearly 210,000 had been charged with violating the Selective Service Act. Another 360,000 dodged but were not prosecuted.\n\nArticle II, Clause 1 of the Constitution is terse and clear: The President … shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\n\nThe authority covers all violations of federal law and may be used absolutely or conditionally, according to Cornell University Law School's Legal Information Institute. It includes a presumed power to pardon specified classes or communities wholesale, in short, the power to amnesty.\n\nDraft dodgers were nowhere near the first to benefit from mass clemency. Three years earlier, President Gerald Ford granted a conditional pardon to military deserters who were willing to perform public service.\n\nIn fact, presidents throughout history granted amnesty to large groups, beginning with the first pardon issued by George Washington in 1795 to participants in a tax revolt known as the Whiskey Rebellion.\n\nAndrew Johnson gave amnesty to all Confederate soldiers after the Civil War. And, in 1902, Theodore Roosevelt granted amnesty to residents of the Philippines – then a U.S. territory – who took part in an insurrection.\n\nYet, according to legal experts, no president has ever pardoned someone for illegal immigration during the nation's 245-year history. Presidential pardons historically have addressed criminal violations; entering or being in the country unlawfully is a civil offense unless it's a repeat violation.\n\nPeter Markowitz, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law, acknowledged it's a legal gray area. But he said immigration violations – civil or criminal – clearly constitute offenses, and there is ample reason to believe it is within a president's pardon authority.\n\nIn a 2017 law review article co-written with Lindsay Nash, Markowitz advocated just such an action, writing: The President possesses the constitutional authority to categorically pardon broad classes of immigrants for civil violations of the immigration laws and to thereby provide durable and permanent protections against deportation.\n\nOther experts say it's not so clear-cut, especially without any Supreme Court precedent on pardons for civil offenses. Some argue that a person in the United States illegally commits an ongoing violation. Pardon power may not be exercised to erase future offenses.\n\nMarkowitz conceded that executive clemency is an imperfect solution because, while it would protect undocumented immigrants from deportation, it would not grant them legal status or rights.\n\nEverybody would prefer that this type of durable protection be delivered through legislation, Markowitz said. But if that proves impossible, clemency at least gives undocumented immigrants peace of mind that they can't be deported.\n\n'We knew what was coming' with Trump\n\nDespite legal uncertainties and a likely political backlash, Markowitz suggested using pardon power for immigrants would have been worth it four years ago.\n\nIn a 2016 opinion piece, Raul A. Reyes, an immigration attorney and member of USA TODAY's board of contributors, argued that by inviting young Dreamers to sign up for DACA, Democrats later exposed them to deportation under the Trump administration.\n\nIt would be a cruel irony if Obama were to turn his back on those here illegally – through no fault of their own – after he helped expose them to risk of deportation, he concluded.\n\nDavid Leopold, immigration counsel for America's Voice, which advocates a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, said it made sense to consider amnesty at the close of Obama's presidency because Trump had characterized immigrants as criminals.\n\nWe knew the extremism. We knew the xenophobia. We knew what was coming, said Leopold, who served as a volunteer adviser in the Biden campaign.\n\nBut as Biden's presidency begins, Leopold does not see presidential pardon power as a serious consideration because about 80% of Americans favor changes in law to protect undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.\n\nThe answer right now is legislative, Leopold said. There's a moment in history right now when we can do it. … Hopefully, Congress will step up to the plate.\n\nDoris Meissner, former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said it would be a legal and political stretch for Biden to simply pardon people who entered the United States unlawfully – a very out-of-the-blue proposition, as she put it.\n\nI'm just having a hard time figuring out how the pardon power … could be justified for that, said Meissner, now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nSome say it's not the time to talk pardons\n\nIra Mehlman, media director with the Federation for Immigration Reform, which advocates for strict immigration enforcement and controls, said mass clemency would constitute a huge overreach by the president.\n\nIn a podcast four years ago, he noted, Cecilia Muñoz, then director of the Obama White House's Domestic Policy Council, declared that pardons wouldn't protect a single soul from deportation.\n\nSome immigrant rights advocates also resist talk of amnesty, at least for now, for fear it would undermine the push for legislation.\n\nKristian Ramos of Autonomy Strategies, a communications firm specializing in Latino issues, said Biden's executive order protecting DACA recipients and immigrants in temporary protected status has, for now, solved the most pressing problem.\n\nThey're protected, Ramos said. He has essentially provided the … reprieve that he could. There's no real need to pardon them.\n\nJuliana Macedo do Nascimento, a DACA recipient from Brazil and policy manager with United We Dream, declined to address the amnesty question in a written statement.\n\nInstead, she stressed that Biden and Democrats have a mandate from the people to transform America's immigration system. President Biden must use every tool at his disposal to provide relief for as many people as possible, she said.\n\nWe are tired and not satisfied by executive actions, said Fernando Garcia, executive director with Border Network for Human Rights. We need to actually change the law.\n\nGarcia expressed doubt that Biden would consider amnesty even if legislation fails. I don't think it's realistic that any president is going to say, 'We're going to pardon 600,000 Dreamers or 1.2 million Dreamers,' he said. And I don't believe Dreamers are guilty of any offense.\n\nLoweree, with the American Immigration Council, said America's support for Dreamers is higher than ever, and the president has a unique opportunity to fulfill campaign promises beginning with announcements Tuesday.\n\nLoweree said he doesn't buy into claims that Biden has a debt to Hispanics who helped him get elected. The issue here isn't who owes anyone anything, he said. Rather, it's about fulfilling a promise made during the Obama administration: 'Dreamers' who came out of the shadows and signed up for DACA were told they'd be protected and allowed to work, not deported.\n\nWith that in mind, Loweree suggested talk of presidential amnesty cannot be dismissed entirely: We expect President Biden will do everything in his power – and consider all options.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday granted Greenville-based Miracle Hill Ministries an exemption to continue its faith-based foster care program that works only with Christians.\n\nMiracle Hill has been operating its program for decades, but its recruiting policy came under scrutiny after the Obama administration implemented a new regulation for federal funding recipients shortly before the inauguration of President Donald Trump. The regulation prohibits groups receiving federal funding from discriminating on the basis of religion.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster had requested an exemption on Miracle Hill's behalf in March 2018, and the issue became the focus of a national discussion on religious freedom as the ministry waited on a decision from the federal government.\n\nThe Administration for Children and Families, a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, granted the exemption Wednesday to protect the religious liberty of all faith-based foster care providers in South Carolina.\n\nIt protects minors who are in need of as many options as possible for being placed in loving foster families, Lynn Johnson, assistant secretary for the Administration of Children and Families, said in a statement. The government should not be in the business of forcing foster care providers to close their doors because of their faith. Religious freedom is a fundamental human right.\n\nMiracle Hill, the largest provider of foster families in South Carolina for foster children who do not have significant special needs, does not allow gay couples or families that don't agree with its statement of faith to serve as foster parents through its program. However, it does direct those of different beliefs to other foster care programs.\n\nWithin the past 10 months, Miracle Hill Ministries and its board members have been the target of hate mail and hate calls. Someone even threatened to burn down the organization's building, Miracle Hill President and CEO Reid Lehman said.\n\nHe said he felt a mixture of relief and joy when he learned of the decision.\n\nIt was the right decision to honor the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, he said. It was the right decision to keep the pool of providers for foster care as big as possible, and the right decision to make sure the needs of South Carolina children are met.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union disagreed with the federal government's decision and considered it to be discrimination. Eight states have passed laws allowing state-contracted child agencies to exclude prospective families based on the religious beliefs of the agency, the ACLU said.\n\nThis is the first action by the federal government to sanction such discrimination, the ACLU said.\n\nThere are more than 400,000 children in foster care around the country, and today the Trump administration has turned its back on each of them, said Leslie Cooper, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT & HIV Project.\n\nProspective foster and adoptive parents should be judged only on their capacity to provide love and support to a child – not their faith, Cooper said.\n\nMore:ACLU sues Michigan over religious exemptions for adoptions\n\nMore:Reaction to Supreme Court same-sex wedding cake verdict: 'Huge win for religious freedom'\n\nCongressman Jeff Duncan said the decision is a big win for religious liberty, particularly for organizations in South Carolina who provide faith-based services.\n\nI have been working on this issue for over two years now, and I am happy to see the Administration protect religious liberty and the children and families who rely on these services in the Upstate, Duncan said.\n\nFaith-based foster and adoption services perform amazing work for communities in South Carolina and around the country, he said. These organizations care deeply about children and families in need, and they shouldn't be punished by the federal government because of their faith.\n\nMiracle Hill Ministries is the Upstate's largest, most comprehensive provider of services to homeless children and adults, its website said.\n\nSince its start in 1937, the organization has served with programs that include rescue shelters for the homeless, residential addiction recovery, transitional housing, and shelters for children.\n\nWe're clear in our identity, Lehman told The Greenville News. We look like a social service agency, but we're a community of Christ followers and our faith in Christ is the most important part of who we are.\n\nIt's important for Miracle Hill to partner with Christians in achieving its mission of serving the poor and especially children in the name of Christ, Lehman said.\n\nIf we had to choose between compromising our spiritual beliefs or not providing these services we would hold fast to our spiritual beliefs, he said.\n\nLehman said it has been argued that the pool of foster care families is reduced or restricted because Miracle Hill recruits just Christian families. Lehman said Miracle Hill would never deny a healthy person the chance to work with a child.\n\nLehman said that anyone in the state who wants to foster has a choice of other agencies they could foster with, as well as with DSS.\n\nIf anyone – Jewish, Muslim, atheist, any religion or no religion said 'I want to foster a child' and they looked like a healthy person, we would try to help them find someone to take them through the licensing process because kids need it, he said.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said HHS's decision is shameful, illegal and immoral, and that it allows a government funded foster care agency to openly discriminate against Jews, gay couples and others who don't follow their faith.\n\nAllowing a taxpayer-funded agency to discriminate against Jews and other minorities is outrageous and sets a dangerous precedent for our nation. This is clearly unlawful and will not hold up in court, said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nMost of Miracle Hill's existence comes from donations, Lehman said. But some of the funds it receives from the state DSS for reimbursements – about $600,000 a year – comes from the federal sources, Lehman said.\n\nAmanda Tyler, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, said the committee opposes government-funded religious discrimination, and said the action by HHS signals a dramatic and troubling shift.\n\nThis waiver shows more concern for the providers than children in need and willing foster parents, Tyler said.\n\nMiracle Hill recruits families for foster children, but it doesn't actually place them in the homes of its families. That's the role and decision of the state Department of Social Services, said Sandra Furnell, spokesperson for Miracle Hill.\n\nWhen DSS comes to Miracle Hill and says, 'We have this child. Do you have a home that would take this child?,' we look among the people we have, Furnell said.\n\nIf we have a family willing and able to receive that child, DSS makes that decision whether or not to place a child with our families, she said. We don't have the authority to place those children.\n\nRep. James E. Clyburn, U.S. House Majority Whip, is among the key house Democrats that issued a joint response condemning the waiver.\n\nI have stood against discrimination my entire career, and this waiver is unlawful discrimination based on religion and sexual orientation, Clyburn said. The real tragedy of this situation is that federal funding is being used to keep children out of loving homes.\n\nRep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., ) said the decision is morally wrong, unconstitutional, and sets a very dangerous precedent.\n\nMore importantly, we should not be in the position of denying families that want to help vulnerable children based on criteria that in no way impacts their ability to be a loving parent or mentor, he said.\n\nThe decision suggests that it is not the children, but the social welfare agencies themselves, who require protection, said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., lead House Democratic sponsor of the Every Child Deserves a Family Act and member of the Ways & Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal policy with respect to tax-exempt organizations and child welfare.\n\nIt is remarkable to me that making it easy for agencies in South Carolina to discriminate against adoptive or foster parents comes so easily to this administration, yet the emergency facing millions of vulnerable orphan or foster children falls on deaf ears, he said.\n\nOur state foster care system is facing many challenges recruiting loving and competent families, said Sue Berkowitz, director of SC Appleseed Legal Justice Center.\n\nAllowing caring families to be discriminated against and denied the opportunity to become a foster home hurts the very children our state is charged to protect and should not be allowed.\n\nThe Charleston Jewish Federation is dismayed to learn of the exemption, said Eileen Chepenik, president and Judi Corsaro, CEO of the federation. Jeff Ayers, executive director of SC Equality in a joint statement.\n\nThis flies in the face of the first amendment to our nation's constitution, they said. As Jews, we believe in Tikkun Olam, repair of the world, and support children's welfare, whatever an adopting family's religion, race, or sexual orientation.\n\n As Americans, we must work to fight against any form of discrimination that marginalizes individuals at the hands of government-funded dollars, said Jeff Ayers, executive director of SC Equality. Right now there are children in South Carolina who could be living in stable, loving homes, with parents who just happen to be LGBT. It's disgraceful that an agency working to provide suitable homes for children would deny then access to a bright future.\n\nColleen Condon, president of AFFA (Alliance for Full Acceptance) and a family law attorney in Charleston, said they are so disappointed that the federal government has granted an exemption allowing religious discrimination in adoptions.\n\nAFFA advocates for social justice for gay parents. And I work with wonderful parents seeking to care for a child who otherwise will be left in the tentative world of foster care and group homes. We will not let this stand.\n\nFederal law prohibits discrimination in federally-funded programs against foster parents on religious grounds, but 10 states permit discrimination by state-licensed foster care organizations against LGBTQ people, same-sex couples and others if doing so conflicts with the organization's beliefs, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) said in a release Thursday.\n\nThis waiver is unconscionable, in no small part because it prioritizes federal contractors over kids in need of families, said Cathryn Oakley, HRC state legislative director and senior counsel.\n\nFollow Angelia Davis on Twitter: @NewsAngelia
Sarah Skidmore Sell\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nTax season is here, and while you have until April 18 to file your return, you may want to think about doing so sooner rather than later. Here are a few expert tips on why:\n\nIDENTITY THEFT\n\nFiling early essentially beats criminals to the punch.\n\nIdentity theft is a growing problem and one often tied to tax refund fraud, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. Once your return is filed with the IRS, the information — in particular your social security number — is locked and cannot be used again by anyone else.\n\nSteber suggests filing early to secure the information and your refund. It's one of the easiest forms of identity protection.\n\nTax news and advice\n\nFASTER RETURNS\n\nIf you're due a tax refund, the sooner you file the sooner you'll get it.\n\nLisa Greene-Lewis, CPA and TurboTax expert, said that last tax season close to three out of four tax filers received a tax refund, and the average refund was about $2,800. That's a big boost to many households.\n\nWhile some delays are expected this year for filers claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS still expects to issue more than nine out of 10 refunds in under three weeks from the day a return is received.\n\nBETTER PREPARATION\n\nFiling early gives you time to more carefully prepare your returns.\n\nPeople who wait until the last minute may forget something in their rush, Greene-Lewis said. Starting earlier gives you more time to gather your paperwork and seek help if needed.\n\nYou should have received most of your tax paperwork by Jan. 31.\n\nIf you owe money, filing early gives you more time to save up the cash, as your bill isn't due until April 18th.\n\nThe bulk of taxpayers are not procrastinators, Greene-Lewis said. About 20 percent file in the last two weeks before the deadline, and another 10 to 12 percent pay later, but the majority file earlier. She pointed out that with all the improvements in tax filing software and support available, there are few excuses to delay.
WASHINGTON – The partial government shutdown is now the longest in American history.\n\nThe shutdown entered its 22nd day on Saturday, surpassing the previous 21-day record set in late 1995 and early 1996 during the Clinton administration.\n\nNine federal departments and several smaller agencies – one-fourth of the federal government – remain closed as the standoff barrels into its fourth week with no end in sight.\n\nMembers of the House and the Senate both went home to their districts on Friday and won't return until Monday, guaranteeing that parts of the government will remain closed at least through early next week.\n\nHere's what to know about the situation.\n\nWhen will it end?\n\nHard to say.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is threatening to declare a national emergency so he can access federal funds to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. That would allow the government to reopen since the shutdown stems from a budget battle between the White House and congressional Democrats over border wall funding.\n\nBut exactly when Trump might invoke an emergency isn't clear.\n\nTrump suggested during a trip to the border in Texas on Thursday that an emergency declaration could come at any time if negotiations with Democrats fail to yield a deal on his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding.\n\nBut Trump played down the prospects of an imminent emergency declaration on Friday, saying he wasn't going to do it so fast.\n\nA sign that he's serious about declaring an emergency: The Pentagon is already preparing options to build barriers along the southern border if Trump does declare a national emergency there. An emergency declaration would allow the Army Corps of Engineers to design barriers and allow contracts to build them.\n\nAn emergency declaration by Trump would be certain to face legal challenges that could drag on for years. But it would give the president an exit strategy from the budget impasse and end the government shutdown.\n\nMore:Donald Trump makes several misstatements during tour of U.S.-Mexico border in Texas\n\nWhat has been the impact?\n\nThe shutdown has rippled across the country since it started Dec. 22.\n\nOn Friday, some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck since the shutdown began. The employees have been forced to take unpaid leave or work without pay, leaving many wondering how they will pay their mortgage or rent, make car payments and make ends meet. Some businesses have resorted to offering furlough freebies, such as free meals and restaurant discounts, to tide the displaced workers over until their next check.\n\nTourists in the nation's capital have been forced to come up with alternative itineraries as a result of the shutdown. Popular tourist attractions like the National Zoo, the Smithsonian museums and national monuments are all closed.\n\nNational parks across the country have been feeling the shutdown's impact. The National Park Service has been relying on charities, nonprofit organizations and others to keep national parks open. But many of the rangers and others who staff campgrounds and keep the parks running have been furloughed, causing trash to pile up and creating other unsanitary conditions at treasured landmarks.\n\nVandalism also has been a problem. At Joshua Tree National Park, vandals created illegal roads through the southern California park by cutting down several Joshua trees, which are native to the desert and have an average lifespan of about 150 years.\n\nAir travel has been hampered by the shutdown. Aviation groups have warned of longer wait times and possible checkpoint closures at major airports and have raised concerns that passenger safety and security has been compromised. Miami International Airport is closing one of its terminals Saturday through Monday because many Transportation Security Administration officials are not reporting to work, and airport officials weren't confident they would have enough screeners on duty.\n\nThe shutdown is even causing reverberations in space. Repairs to the main camera on the Hubble Space Telescope have been delayed because of agency closures.\n\nMore:Government shutdown: How it impacts what you eat from food safety to beer\n\nHow have other shutdowns ended?\n\nBefore the current stalemate set a new record, the longest shutdown lasted 21 days and occurred in late 1995 and early 1996. The lapse in government funding was triggered by a budget battle between President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. It ended when the two sides agreed to a seven-year budget plan with some spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nIn 1978, the government shut down for 18 days when Democratic President Jimmy Carter found himself at odds with Congress even though Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. Carter vetoed a defense bill that included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and public works legislation that included funding for water projects. Funding for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare was delayed because of a dispute involving Medicaid funding for abortion.\n\nThat shutdown finally ended when Carter managed to get the projects he opposed stripped from the legislation, and the House and Senate passed a bill that expanded the exceptions to the Medicaid abortion ban to include rape and incest.\n\nA 16-day shutdown in 2013 stemmed from a fight over funding for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Unable to repeal President Barack Obama's signature health care law, Republicans in Congress approved a temporary measure that would fund the government but would cut funding to implement Obamacare. The Senate, controlled by Democrats, rejected the plan. The standoff ended when Republicans conceded defeat and a deal was worked out to reopen the government.\n\nContributing: USA TODAY reporters Tom Vanden Brook, Ledyard King, Bill Theobald, Kelly Tyko and Ben Mutzabaugh; and reporters Shane Newell and Colin Atagi of the Desert Sun.
Tom Nichols\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nIf President Donald Trump loses in 2020 (and it is by no means certain that he will), his defeat will come at the hands of a coalition led by the Democratic Party that will be composed, in the main, of energized and angry Democrats. In swing states, they could get the support of a small but important cadre of independents and surburbanites who tended to vote Republican in the past, and an even smaller handful of disaffected former Republicans for whom tax cuts and judges were not enough to keep them in their party.\n\nIf this happens, it will be a hopeful sign (along with the centrist Democratic victories in 2018) of an emerging truce among various partisans of both the right and left. It will show that Americans can put political differences aside when faced with the kind of threat Trump poses to our values and our Constitution itself.\n\nCan such a truce last? Can a center hold? For those of us exhausted both by Trump and by years of polarized infighting — and I am first among partisan sinners on that score — 2020 seems to hold out the promise of reconciliation. If we start from a basic respect for the Constitution and a commitment to rule of law, why can't we work out almost everything else?\n\nWe can agree to preserve democracy\n\nI feel this hope keenly myself. I am a former Republican who has already crossed over and publicly vowed to support the Democratic nominee in 2020, no matter who it is, in order to help end this nightmare. I have shared a political foxhole with people I once criticized, and I can never be as partisan as I once was.\n\nEven so, the idea of a lasting post-Trump coalition is probably too optimistic. There will be no magical consensus on abortion or guns or immigration on Nov. 4. But we can save the constitutional mechanisms that allow us to keep fighting over such things while preserving our commitment to an open democracy. Given how low we have fallen under Trump, that would itself be an achievement.\n\nWhether we can turn the defeat of Trump into a real American reconciliation, however, is at this point completely in the hands of the Democratic Party. What happens after November depends on who the Democrats nominate and how the victor governs.\n\nDemocrats will complain that this is horribly unfair. Republicans got us into this mess, they will object, and it is not up to Democrats to get us out of it. They are not wrong. But life is not fair, and dealing with reality is always better than wishing.\n\nAnd here's the most important reality: The Republican Party has been mainlining the pure, uncut narcotic of irrational rage for years now, and Republicans are not going to quit cold turkey. There will be no moment of clarity. Most of them are older people who will take this addiction to their graves.\n\nRealism before next fall should also lead to some stock-taking among Democrats. They have long pursued a strategy of narrow division along identity lines that produced big wins for some Democrats in reliably blue states while leaving 1,000 offices across the land in the hands of Republicans and keeping the Electoral College competitive for the GOP. As Columbia professor (and avowed liberal) Mark Lilla once wrote, Democrats became obsessed with the national media and the presidency rather than the daily task of winning over people at the local level.\n\nGOP politics of chaos:From Scott Brown to Donald Trump, can Democrats recover from the traumas of the 2010s?\n\nIncredibly, some Democrats are so convinced that a Progressive Promised Land is now in sight that they have even taken to criticizing the legacy of President Barack Obama, the man who saved them from the wilderness. For all their talk of how hard it will be to beat Trump, they seem convinced that 2020 will vindicate the ideologues of 1968, avenge the losses of the 1980s and repudiate the GOP advances of the 2000s.\n\nNone of that is going to happen.\n\nThink about defeating the next Trump\n\nSome Democrats will argue that this is just a plea to pick a pseudo-Republican. This is childish. I accept that elections have consequences, and I know what I will get with any Democratic president. Even as a Republican, I never argued for incessant warfare against Obama, whom I supported on any number of issues ranging from missile defense to Cuba. I opposed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denying the president's constitutional right to a Supreme Court nomination in his last year in office.\n\nBut I am not the voter Democrats need. They already have me. Not only am I on board for 2020, but I have also decided never to vote for anyone who enabled Trump in any way, so I could be walking alongside the Democrats a lot longer, into 2024 and for many years beyond (God willing).\n\nCrossing the line:Why this Never Trump ex-Republican will vote for almost any 2020 Democratic nominee\n\nThe Democrats, however, must think about defeating not only Trump but also the next Trump. There are plenty of GOP opportunists who are waiting to capture that national populist mantle, and it comes with a built-in reservoir of votes. To build a resilient consensus, the Democrats need to govern, instead of trying to outbid the GOP in the culture war, a game at which Republicans will always be better.\n\nIf the victor in 2020 is someone like former Vice President Joe Biden or Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, there is a chance that the Democrats can build a durable coalition that will hold off the next Trump.\n\nIf the winner is someone like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, she also could unify the country if she chooses to govern and heal rather than to engage in doomed and demonstrative politics. But if Warren shows up on her first day and tries to eliminate private health insurance while asking a preteen transgender child what he thinks of her Cabinet picks, the post-Trump Era of Good Feeling will be measured in minutes or hours rather than months or years.\n\nThe Democrats now have a historic opportunity. They can preside over a new majority without ditching their principles or abandoning the groups that have come to rely on them — rightly — for protection from howling mobs of people in red hats who think socialism lurks around every corner.\n\nWill they take it?\n\nTom Nichols is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and author of The Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters.

San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams says significant risks to the economy have faded for the first time since the recession and stronger growth could force the Fed to raise interest rates more rapidly than anticipated.\n\nIn a recent interview, Williams, who Trump is considering as vice chairman of the Fed's board, said he's comfortable with Fed policymakers' median forecast of three quarter-point rate hikes in 2018. But he believes there's a greater chance of faster growth and inflation prompting four rate increases than of slower gains forcing a pullback to two bumps.\n\nThere is some potential the economy is going to outperform my forecast, he said. I'm not really worried about the economy stalling, which was a concern a few years ago.\n\nMore:How the Fed interest rate hike could affect your wallet\n\nMore:Fed raises rates, keeps forecast for 3 hikes in 2018\n\nMore:Tax cuts: Economists see modest impact on workers, economy as corporate taxes fall\n\nBarring a downturn in the economy's performance over the next two months, he said it appears likely the Fed will raise its benchmark short-term rate in March, as markets anticipate, to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. But he stressed that economic data in coming weeks will guide the Fed's decision.\n\nWilliams also said he believes the tax cuts signed into law by President Trump last month will boost the economy modestly and won't crimp growth in a couple of years by swelling the deficit and pushing up borrowing costs. That sanguine view contrasts with many economists' forecasts that the tax overhaul will serve as a drag on growth as soon as 2020.\n\nWilliams' outlook is noteworthy not only because he may take the Fed's No 2. role. He's also considered a centrist who has voted in lockstep with both outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen, a Democrat, and Republican Fed Governor Jerome Powell. Powell is scheduled to take the Fed's reins from Yellen next month after his expected Senate confirmation. Williams, who was Yellen's research director when she headed the San Francisco Fed, will be a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee this year.\n\nNot long ago, Fed officials worried that hiking rates at even a moderate pace could derail a fragile recovery from the Great Recession of 2007-2009. But Williams cited the current confluence of positive economic forces, including a resurgent global economy, strong consumer and business confidence, record stock prices and the Republican tax cuts.\n\nI think the economy has very solid momentum, he said.\n\nSpeed bumps ahead?\n\nNot that the economy doesn't face speed bumps that continue to restrain growth. Those include vestiges of the recession, such as cautious lenders, fewer business startups and millions of prime-age men who remain outside the labor force. Those scars are probably going to be with us for the foreseeable future, Williams said. He also highlights long-term challenges such as an aging population and sluggish gains in productivity, or worker output.\n\nThe tax cuts, he projects, will result in a little bit faster growth, adding about a quarter percentage point a year for the next three years, largely by spurring businesses to increase investment and become more productive. By lowering individual tax rates, he said the plan also could draw some Americans back into the workforce, adding as much as another percentage point to economic output over a decade.\n\nStill, Williams said, We don't need a stimulus right now in terms of short-run growth.\n\nAt the same time, he disagrees with economists who believe the benefits of the tax overhaul will be offset by a $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion rise in the federal deficit that will drive up long-term interest rates and discourage borrowing and economic activity.\n\nBecause of the size of the tax cuts, there's not going to be dramatically higher interest rates, he says. He expects the added debt will increase long-term rates by about a quarter percentage point over the next few years. Williams forecasts economic growth of about 2.5% both in 2017 and this year, 2% in 2019 and a slowdown to 1¾% over five years. The economy has expanded at a tepid 2.1% average pace during the recovery. Trump has vowed his agenda of lower taxes and fewer regulations will deliver 3% growth.\n\nWilliams also downplays fears that the economic stimulus from the tax overhaul will lead to an excessive run-up in wage growth and inflation, especially with the 4.1% unemployment rate already sparking worker shortages. He points to long-term factors that have suppressed consumer price increases, such as slower-growing health care costs due to reduced government spending on Medicare.\n\nI'm not really worried about inflation taking off, he says.\n\nSlow wage growth, inflation\n\nIn fact, many economists have been puzzled that average annual wage growth has been stuck at about 2.5% the past couple of years despite the low jobless rate. But Williams said it wasn't until last year that the economy strengthened and unemployment fell below a normal 4.7%, increasing the competition for workers.\n\n I expect upward pressure on wages to really show up in 2018 and 2019, he said. He foresees pay increases approaching 3% by the end of the year.\n\nThat, he says, should help nudge the Fed's preferred measure of annual inflation from 1.5% toward its 2% target over the next two years. Williams is among Fed officials who have recently argued the central bank should consider letting inflation exceed its 2% benchmark for a period to make up for undershoots during and after the recession.\n\nYet while he isn't worried about a spike in inflation in the near term, he says gradual rate hikes would be the right thing to do to ward off such a scenario. I think that waiting too long could actually create some risk down the road that the economy does overheat, he says. I want to see this expansion continue as long as possible.
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The nation's first memorial to lynching victims is expanding. The Equal Justice Initiative on Saturday opened a new welcome center and exhibition space that will add to the existing lynching memorial and museum that documents the history of racial inequality in America. The downtown pavilion will serve as a hub for visitors to the two previously opened sites: EJI's National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which documents the era of racial terror lynchings between 1877 and 1950, and the Legacy Museum. The Legacy Pavilion will include a monument to women, men and children who were victims of racial terror lynchings in the Civil War's aftermath. It will also honor civil rights figures including Martin Luther King Jr., Claudette Colvin, John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Jonathan Daniels, Jo Ann Robinson, and E.D. Nixon and describe Montgomery's role in fueling a civil rights movement. It'll also include a gift shop, soul food restaurant, and a shuttle service to the memorial and museum.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The University of Alaska Southeast and other schools in the state university system have proposed increasing tuition starting in the fall to combat a decrease in state funding. The 5% increase was brought about after significant cuts to the state's funding of the University of Alaska system, the Juneau Empire reports. The increase would generate up to $500,000 for the system and apply to resident undergraduate students, university chancellor Rick Caulfield said. Students taking 15 credit hours of courses a semester would pay about $400 more each year, university officials said. Only three students participated in a meeting scheduled for them to address university officials about the proposal, Caulfield said. Teacher education, marine biology and science programs, and mining and maritime-oriented vocational training are some of the university's most successful programs, university officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nHeber-Overgaard: U.S. Forest Service officials confirm that seven more wild horses have been found dead in eastern Arizona after eight others were found earlier this month and say that at least some were shot. Several horses died due to bullet wounds, but other carcasses were too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests officials said in a statement Friday. The statement said the 15 carcasses were found in a ranger district headquartered in Heber-Overgaard, a rural community 109 miles northeast of Phoenix. According to the statement, evidence was limited because some of the carcasses had been exposed to extreme weather conditions over extended periods of time. Forest officials said law enforcement officials had taken steps to more quickly deploy equine experts and veterinarians to incident scenes to help collect evidence.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state commission has approved nearly $9 million in funding to repair levees damaged by record flooding last year. The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved the $8.8 million in grant funding Thursday for 14 groups overseeing levees along the Arkansas River that were damaged last year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The largest grants were for $1.6 million for the Riverdale area in Little Rock and $1.5 million for a levee district in Dardanelle. Last year, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created a task force to study how to improve the state's aging levee system. The group presented its final report earlier this month and recommended increased oversight, consolidation of some levee districts, and state grants to fund improvements. Last year's springtime flooding along the Arkansas River occurred because of heavy rainfall in Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state increased its efforts Friday to keep the federal government from allowing oil and gas drilling on more than 1 million acres of public land, suing to block the Trump administration from issuing new permits in the central part of the state. The federal lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management follows a new state law also intended to counter Trump administration plans to increase oil and gas production on protected public land. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued on behalf of Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration, saying the permits would allow the controversial extraction method called hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. Newsom in October signed a law barring any California leasing authority from allowing pipelines or other oil and gas infrastructure to be built on state property. Federally protected areas are adjacent to state-owned land.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: After former Gov. John Hickenlooper came under fire for how he spent money from a little-known account in his office, similar accounts have been noted throughout state government that hold millions of taxpayer dollars, KCNC-TV reports. The money in the accounts comes from sources like federal dollars and legal settlements, and departments don't have to disclose it to the Legislature. Democratic Sen. Dominick Moreno plans to change that with a bill he says the powerful Joint Budget Committee is drafting this year. As vice chair of the committee, Moreno has in-depth knowledge of state finances. But he says even he didn't know about all the money state departments take in that isn't reported and over which the Legislature has no control. The Colorado Sun reports the Hickenlooper account is paying ongoing legal bills related to an ethics complaint against the current U.S. Senate candidate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Democratic speaker of the state House says lawmakers should consider whether to ban Native American athletic nicknames and symbols at public high schools after one school restored its Redmen mascot just months after dropping it. I'd like to see a bill introduced to have a public hearing and have the discussion, Joe Aresimowicz told the Hartford Courant. The school board in Killingly voted in June to drop the high school's Redmen nickname and then replaced it with Red Hawks in October. The board, with an infusion of new Republican members, restored Redmen last month. Aresimowicz called the mascot highly offensive. Across the state, 19 public high schools use Native American-themed nicknames or imagery. Opponents of such names say they are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. The defenders of Native mascots and symbols say they are signs of respect.\n\nDelaware\n\nHockessin: A local temple is now home to a statue of a Hindu god said to be the tallest in the country. Hundreds of people celebrated the arrival of the 25-foot granite statue of the Hindu god Hanuman on Saturday morning at a temple in Hockessin. A welcome ceremony was held after a truck delivered the 60,000-pound statue. Across India, Lord Hanuman is often enshrined and worshipped in the form of a towering statue, and we are proud to bring that tradition to Delaware, says Patibanda Sarma, president of the Hindu Temple Association. Organizers of the effort to bring the statue to Delaware had said it would be the tallest statue of a Hindu god carved out of a single piece of stone in the United States. Sculptors in India spent about a year carving it.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Thousands gathered on Freedom Plaza on Saturday as part of the nationwide Women's March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration, though crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. The 2017 march drew close to 1 million people. Last year about 100,000 held a rally east of the White House. This year's protesters planned to march around the White House, but President Donald Trump wasn't there, as he was spending the weekend at his resort in Florida. Organizers faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize. Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that, Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter last week to Women's March organizers. Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The Legislature set a lot of lofty goals for its annual 60-day session: passing a budget expected to top $90 billion; lowering the cost of health care; preventing blue-green algae; and boosting teacher pay. But also on the agenda entering the second week of session are measures banning iguana breeding, protecting nude sunbathers, making shelter animals the official state pet, banning sunscreen bans, and giving hunters a sales tax break on guns and ammo. The full Senate will take up a bill that would ban local governments from banning sunscreens, while a House committee takes up its version of the bill, in reaction to Key West banning the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate, which some researchers say can harm coral reefs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is on track to have its new election system ready for the presidential primaries in March, lawyers for the state assured a judge Friday, but critics pushed for a more concrete backup plan in case things don't go as planned. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg tried throughout a conference call to strike a balance between the interests of the two sides while making it clear that she does not consider herself a guarantor for the state's election system rollout. Totenberg is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2017 by election integrity advocates and individual voters who alleged that the state's outdated touch-screen voting machines and election management system, in use since 2002, were not secure and were vulnerable to hacking. Critics argue that the new system has many of the same security vulnerabilities as the old system and that voters can't be sure the barcode read by the scanner accurately reflects their selections.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy is honoring a World War II hero in naming a new aircraft carrier for Mess Attendant 2nd Class Doris Miller. The announcement is expected to be made at Pearl Harbor on Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for valor. He was recognized for manning a machine gun on the USS West Virginia and returning fire against Japanese planes during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. USS Miller, a destroyer escort, was previously named in his honor. An African American was not allowed to man a gun in the Navy in 1941, said Doreen Ravenscroft, a team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial. Without him really knowing, he actually was a part of the civil rights movement because he changed the thinking in the Navy, Ravenscroft said. Two of Miller's nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state has the nation's sixth-highest growth rate for spending on corrections in the past 25 years, and with the governor proposing a 12.1% budget increase for the Department of Correction, the department's director says the state is at a critical juncture, the Idaho Press reports. Idaho increased spending on corrections by 207% between 1992 and 2018, according to a report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy in Boise. Idaho's expenditures outpace its spending during the same time period on education, which increased by 94% for public schools and 39% for higher education. At least some of that spending is the result of policy decisions the Legislature made in the past 40 years, according to the report. Idaho is one of only three states in the country where inmates are required by law to serve 100% of their fixed terms, the result of truth-in-sentencing legislation passed in the 1980s, according to the report.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will test updated bus routes on the West Side under a pilot program recently approved by the Chicago Transit Board. City officials tout the change as part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot's promise to invest in neighborhoods outside the downtown core. The pilot program is designed to provide streamlined service along the city's grid system and improve connections to city trains, according to city officials. For example, riders will have more access to jobs, services and schools near the University of Illinois at Chicago, where there are also several hospitals. The changes take effect in April and will last one year. Chicago Transit Authority staff will determine whether to make the changes permanent. The changes will cost about $550,000 and be funded with CTA operating funds, according to officials.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Portions of two parks are getting a special designation because of a rare tree species. Areas in Brown County State Park and Yellowwood State Forest will be considered high conservation value forest areas in an effort to preserve the yellowwood tree population. The Forest Stewardship Council's certification is a way to ensure that 591 acres where the trees are growing are managed so they remain part of the landscape, says Mike Spalding, resource specialist with Monroe-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests. Civilian Conservation Corps workers in Brown County State Park first discovered the trees in 1933. Forester T.E. Shaw and Charles Deam, Indiana's first state forester, verified and documented the discovery. One theory was that the yellowwood trees were brought north by Kentucky settlers, but that was proven false when the trees were analyzed. The results showed the trees were genetically distinct and had been in the area for thousands of years.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Organizers of an emergency warming shelter say they will have to close because the space doesn't meet fire code regulations. The Waterloo Warming Center opened Jan. 6 at Jubilee United Methodist Church's Freedom resource center. But after an inspection, officials noted the space didn't have a sprinkler system and ordered that the center close by Tuesday. Organizers began searching for a new location and implored city officials not to force them out of the current site until a replacement can be found. Temperatures are supposed to remain below freezing until later this week. We understand and appreciate the need for fire safety regulations, but we cannot close this location down until a new appropriate location has been secured, Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. The alternative is leaving folks out to freeze to death on our streets.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Former governor and plastic surgeon Jeff Colyer is about to add Chaka Khan backup singer to his resume. Colyer is part of a student and faculty choir that will join the Queen of Funk on stage for a Martin Luther King Day event hosted by Georgetown University at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, The Kansas City Star reports. I get to be a backup singer for Chaka Khan. That's pretty cool, said Colyer, who was was a fellow at Georgetown's Institute of Politics and Public Service during the fall semester. The performance will include a piece composed by Khan, who achieved success in the 1970s as a vocalist in the funk band Rufus and as a solo artist in the 1980s with her hit single I Feel For You. Colyer, of Overland Park, was lieutenant governor in 2018 and rose to the top job after fellow Republican Sam Brownback resigned to take an ambassadorship.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Inmate populations and deteriorating prisons are sapping the state of money needed for priorities like education and health care, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says. Stepping up his push for criminal justice reform as the fiscally responsible thing to do, Beshear said Friday that the state needs to reduce incarceration rates, which in turn would create opportunities to consolidate prisons. Criminal-justice reform isn't just the right thing to do – and I believe it is – it's the moral thing to do, he told reporters at the Capitol. It is absolutely necessary to do for this budget and most especially for every budget after that. Beshear, who previously served as the state's attorney general, stressed that he wants to revamp the criminal-justice system in a way that doesn't compromise public safety.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Plans are on again to implode a hotel building that partially collapsed last fall, killing three workers, city officials said Friday. Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said at a news conference that the implosion is expected to take place in mid-March. Implosion had been considered and then rejected in the weeks after the Oct. 12 collapse at the planned Hard Rock Hotel on Canal Street, at the edge of the French Quarter. But on Friday, officials said the implosion plan was back on. It was deemed safer than having workers dismantle the structure. Putting more people at risk, I cannot live with that and will not support that, Cantrell said. And it will mean commerce and traffic can return to the area around the unstable building more quickly. Implosion will also bring the building down ahead of hurricane season, which begins June 1.\n\nMaine\n\nWestbrook: What goes around comes around. An ice disk appears to be forming in the same river where an unusually large one formed last winter and quickly gained international fame. The City of Westbrook tweeted an aerial view of the disk in the Presumpscot River with the message: ICE BREAKING NEWS: Ice Disk 2020 is making a run for it…It's not a perfect circle yet, but it is rotating counter-clockwise again & the seagulls are along for the ride. The ice formation comes just about a year after a disk measuring about 100 yards in diameter was spotted in the Presumpscot River. It eventually had a devoted webcam; social media users compared it to an alien spacecraft and the moon; and ducks used it as a raft. A video of the disk shows a nascent ice blob that is thinner and less circular than the famous disk of 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city will formally name a courthouse after the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings in the first half of 2020. Mayor Bernard C. Jack Young on Friday unveiled the renderings of the bronze plaques that will be affixed to the building's exterior. One includes an image and biography of the congressman, and the other reads Elijah E. Cummings Courthouse. The powerful Democratic congressman and civil rights champion died Oct. 17 at age 68 of complications from long-standing health issues. He had represented Maryland's 7th Congressional District, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore, since 1996. Cummings graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law and practiced in Baltimore. Elijah was a son of Baltimore. He was proud of Baltimore, his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, said during the unveiling ceremony. His career as a legal professional started in this courthouse.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A push to expand school breakfast programs is making its way through the Legislature. The state Senate last week unanimously approved legislation aimed at increasing participation rates in the programs. The bill would require public schools with 60% or more of students currently eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program to offer breakfast after the school bell rings. Massachusetts currently requires all high-poverty schools to provide breakfast to every eligible student. Because breakfast is typically offered before the bell, participation levels are less than 40%, compared to up to 90% participation for free and reduced lunch. Supporters of the bill say moving breakfast to after the bell will boost participation and ensure all students have the nutrition they need.\n\nMichigan\n\nOwosso: A whopping $43,170 in forgotten cash was discovered inside a footstool donated to a resale shop. Howard Kirby bought the piece and other furniture for $70 after Christmas. He was stunned Sunday when his daughter-in-law unzipped the cushion and shouted. After the shock wore off, he began the extraordinary step of returning the money to the former owners. I do what I can to be as much like Christ as I can, and this is the moral thing to do, said Kirby, 54. This is going to help them. I'm so happy for them. The footstool was part of a living room set donated to a Habitat For Humanity store by Kim Fauth-Newberry and her husband. The furniture had belonged to her grandfather, Phillip Fauth, who died in July. Fauth-Newberry said Fauth was a frugal man who always paid in cash, even $9,000 for a new roof. The newly discovered money was separated with paper clips and topped with handwritten notes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state's voters on Friday became some of the first in the country to cast ballots in the presidential primaries as early voting began for the Super Tuesday contest. Eligible Minnesota voters can now vote at county courthouses across the state and early voting stations in some cities, and they can also request absentee ballots for the March 3 primary. But the votes won't be counted until primary night. Fifteen candidates are on the Democratic ballot, even though some already have dropped out of the race. The GOP ballot lists only President Donald Trump, though write-in votes are allowed. It's Minnesota's first presidential primary since 1992 after years of using precinct caucuses to kick off the process of selecting national convention delegates. Voters must request either a Democratic or Republican ballot, and their names will be shared with the state's major parties.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Board of Education is keeping the state's U.S. history exam, despite months of pressure from teachers and others to cut testing. The board voted unanimously Thursday to keep the test, one of four public school students must take in high school. A testing task force in August had recommended the state do away with what's the only state test not required by federal law. It was extremely disheartening that board members placed so much confidence in a staff recommendation over the recommendations of the task force, commission, and multiple surveys of practitioners throughout the state that favored elimination of the assessment, Mississippi Professional Educators, the state's largest teachers group, wrote in a message to members.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The president of a predominantly black police union says the city prosecutor's lawsuit is correct in pointing out racial concerns in St. Louis, including biases within the police department itself. Ethical Society of Police President Heather Taylor stopped short of endorsing Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's federal lawsuit accusing entrenched interests of impeding her efforts to reform racist practices, but Taylor questioned how anyone could ignore the department's long history of racial discrimination. She said in a statement that denying racial bias within the department is a slap in the face to minority and non-minority officers with whom we are proud to serve. She said the union has often cited racial disparities in discipline, promotions and job placement.\n\nMontana\n\nChoteau: An ice jam that has caused flooding along a creek in central Montana had nearly submerged a town park and was rising into residents' basements and crawl spaces, leading the city to declare a state of emergency Friday. The ice jam came after subzero temperatures and was exacerbated by high ground water. It is likely to remain until warmer temperatures thaw the blocked culverts and stream beds. Water up to 6 inches deep was reported on some streets after ice traveling down Spring Creek was backed up, weather officials said. The ice jam came after temperatures dropped to 20 degrees below zero, officials said. Residents were encouraged to take shorter showers and reduce the amount of times toilets are flushed to avoid overwhelming the sewer system. Sewer main lines were completely filled, and crews sandbagged manholes in the area to avoid further surface water infiltration, city officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Want to try your hand at waterfowl or turkey hunting, but leery of the expense of buying blinds and decoys? The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has a solution. UNL's Outdoor Adventure Center is now offering that equipment for rent to the public. The rentals had previously been offered for about a year only to the university's students. Officials recently decided to expand the policy to allow the public to rent the equipment, too. Micaela Rahe with the National Wild Turkey Federation and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said it's the first program of its kind in the state. Hunting gear currently available for rent includes a pop-up blind, layout blind, duck decoy set of 14 birds and a jake/hen turkey decoy combination. Each is individually available to the public for $6 per day, $12 for three days or $16 for a full week.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A pigeon wearing a tiny sombrero was discovered following sightings of its cowboy hat-wearing cousins in Las Vegas, a city manager says. Reno City Manager Sabra Newby tweeted about the bird Wednesday, saying it's quirky and fun but still inhumane, KOLO-TV reports. It is the first known sighting of hat-wearing birds in the region, Washoe County Regional Animal Services officials say. The sighting comes after a pigeon in Las Vegas with a miniature cowboy hat glued to its head died last week, animal officials say. People who see the bird are encouraged to call animal service dispatch officers, officials say. It is unclear who put the hat on the bird. Reno cares about our animals, Newby says. They need protection and don't need to become a punchline.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A group that organized a big memorial bike ride following the deaths of seven motorcyclists in a collision with a pickup truck is presenting the state agencies that helped out with a custom-made, wooden U.S. flag. The flag is etched with the victims' names from the June crash in Randolph. A presentation by the Ride for Fallen 7 Foundation is scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the state Incident Planning and Operations Center, where the flag will be displayed. The building houses agencies from the safety and transportation departments. An estimated 3,000 motorcycles, with 4,500 riders from around the country, took part in the Ride for the Fallen 7 in July. They rode 90 miles from Laconia to the crash site in Randolph, where a memorial service was held. Those killed were members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Barring health insurance that excludes coverage for preexisting conditions and letting children stay on their parents' plans until 26 would be preserved under a slate of new laws the state enacted last week, even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in court. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the nine bills Thursday. They're aimed at shoring up key provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, which is opposed by Republicans in Congress and the White House. Democratic and Republican attorneys general are fighting in court over the law, sometimes referred to as Obamacare. New Jersey has about 800,000 people benefiting from the law, with about half a million people getting covered through Medicaid expansion under the law and 300,000 on the individual marketplace.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nJemez Springs: A national preserve in northern New Mexico that is sometimes referred to as the Yellowstone of the Southwest has added another piece of property to its land holdings that contains sulfuric acid hot springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud pots. The National Park Service announced last week that it recently completed the purchase of a 40-acre parcel known as Sulphur Springs within the Valles Caldera National Preserve. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the Western United States, officials said. The acidic pools and streams in the area also are home to a range of extremophile algae and bacteria. Acquiring Sulphur Springs was critical to protecting the breadth of geothermal features within the preserve, officials said. The $500,000 purchase was made through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and nonprofit groups.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal authorities are turning to a new tactic in the escalating conflict over the city's so-called sanctuary policies, issuing four immigration subpoenas for information about inmates wanted for deportation. This is not a request – it's a demand, Henry Lucero, said a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. This is a last resort for us. Dangerous criminals are being released every single day in New York. Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration said Saturday that the city would review the subpoenas. New York City will not change the policies that have made us the safest big city in America, spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said in an email. The development came days after ICE sent similar subpoenas to Denver, a move that reflected the agency's mounting frustration with jurisdictions that do not honor deportation detainers or provide any details about defendants going in and out of local custody.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilson: Wilson County plans to add four new historical markers this year to commemorate African American heroes, including a 1946 effort to organize tobacco workers. Called Operation Dixie, the unionization effort was led by black women demanding better working conditions in the tobacco industry. The state unveiled a historical marker in Rocky Mount in 2011. The local chapter of the Tobacco Workers International Union formed in Wilson in 1946. Other markers to be unveiled in Wilson this year will honor the Wilson Normal and Industrial Institute, Dr. Frank S. Hargrave, and Charles H. Darden, the Wilson Times reports. The marker for Hargrave describes him as the founder of Mercy Hospital, which treated African Americans in an era when even hospitals were segregated by race. In 1914, he was elected president of the National Medical Association, which was the African American equivalent of the American Medical Association.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing. Burgum has said the policy change could help address North Dakota's workforce shortage and grow its economy, while removing the stigma for what are minor cases from years ago.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A woman who was among the Freedom Riders who challenged racial segregation in the 1960s will be the keynote speaker at a breakfast honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center says Betty Daniels Rosemond will speak Monday at the King Legacy Awards Breakfast recognizing participants in a youth leadership program. Three students will be given awards for their work. Rosemond grew up in New Orleans and joined the Congress of Racial Equality, a leading civil rights organization. She was among bus riders, black and white, who braved possible violence to advocate for racial equality in the segregated South. The center invites guests to join in the 45th annual MLK Coalition March in downtown Cincinnati after the breakfast that will include an interfaith prayer service at Fountain Square.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state panel that includes appointees of Gov. Kevin Stitt has approved more taxpayer subsidies for the Jenks-based company the governor founded and ran until after his election in 2018. The three-member Quality Jobs Program Incentive Approval Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to approve an application from Gateway First Bank. The contract was first reported by the online publication The Frontier. Two of the members who approved the application, Department of Commerce Director Brent Kisling and Oklahoma Tax Commission Chairman Charles Prater, were appointed by Stitt. Under the program, companies that create up to $2.5 million in new annual payrolls within three years can qualify for quarterly cash payments of up to 5% of new payroll costs. The company already has received more than $876,000 in taxpayer subsidies under an existing contract under the program, state records show.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state's changing climate and ocean conditions are already harming its native fish and wildlife, officials from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife say. That's making it difficult for ODFW to meet its statutory mandate to manage the resources in its care. In response, the department is developing a Climate and Ocean Change Policy that will help shape where its limited resources are spent. On Friday, the public and the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission had their first chance to hear about the proposal. Our climate and ocean are changing in ways that are not favorable for fish and wildlife, said Shaun Clements, ODFW senior policy analyst. We've been working on trying to address these impacts. For example, Oregon may have to abandon spending in some areas where species are unlikely to survive, in order to focus on those where they will, said Davia Palmeri, the department's conservation policy coordinator.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he will follow through on his plan to close another state prison, announced originally in August as a cost-cutting step amid a declining inmate population and rising prison costs. Wolf's administration carried out the required hearings on its plan, which was criticized by the corrections' officers union and state lawmakers whose districts surround Retreat state prison in northeastern Pennsylvania. Retreat, about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre, has about 400 employees and about 940 inmates. Closing could occur in four months at an annual savings of $40 million, the administration said. Employees will be offered jobs at another state prison within 65 miles of Retreat, it said. Retreat was particularly vulnerable to closing: Its original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania's 25 state prisons.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Political, community and religious leaders are celebrating the life of Martin Luther King Jr. at the state's annual commemoration of the civil rights leader. The public is invited to the event, beginning at 4 p.m. Monday at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Providence. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and other elected leaders plan to attend. The Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday Commission organizes the annual celebration. State Rep. Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat, leads the commission and will serve as the master of ceremonies. Hull said Friday that with the turmoil in the nation today, it's important to look back and reflect on what King stood for and how he brought people together to cure injustices. The commemoration includes speeches, awards and performances by the Ebenezer Baptist Church Choir and RPM Voices of Rhode Island.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A feature that has helped Furman University receive past honors as one of the most beautiful campuses in America has been taken away. Forty of the decades-old oak trees that lined Furman's Mall have been cut down. They'll be replaced with new species of oaks with life spans from 250 to more than 400 years: overcup, Nuttall's, scarlet and swamp white, the university says. The nearly 70-year-old trees were starting to die, and limbs were starting to fall and become hazardous, according to Clinton Colmenares, spokesman for the university. Their removal is the latest phase in a multiyear project to replace original trees with better species that live longer and are just as big, Colmenares says. Furman broke ground on its current campus in 1953. The trees along the mall were planted between 1956 and 1958, the university says.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem was the sixth-most-unpopular governor in the country in the final months of 2019, according to the Morning Consult's latest polling. Forty-five percent of South Dakotans surveyed disapproved of the job Noem was doing as governor, and 43% approved, while 12% said they didn't know, according to the 2019 fourth-quarter governors poll released Thursday by Morning Consult, a research services company. The poll had a 3% margin of error. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Thune was among the top 10 most popular senators in the Morning Consult's 2019 fourth-quarter poll. Thune had an approval rating of 52%, and U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds had an approval rating of 50%, with a 3% margin of error, according to Morning Consult. Both of their Morning Consult approval ratings have remained in the low- to mid-50s range throughout 2019.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee will introduce legislation this year that would amend a law requiring the state to honor Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Lee's office confirmed Friday that the Republican, who has previously expressed his displeasure over the honor, was working on the bill. The office did not provide further details. According to the law in question, Tennessee governors must sign six proclamations throughout the year designating as days of special observance Robert E. Lee Day (Jan. 19), Abraham Lincoln Day (Feb. 12), Andrew Jackson Day (March 15), Confederate Decoration Day (June 3), Nathan Bedford Forrest Day (July 13) and Veterans Day (Nov. 11). Lee received national backlash in July when signed the Nathan Bedford Forrest proclamation and declined to answer questions about whether he thought the law should change. Lee later clarified that he didn't like signing the proclamation and would prefer to see the law changed.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Demolition of the last of the city's three Columbus ship replicas began Thursday morning despite efforts to raise funds for repairs. The demolition of the La Nina comes after the Columbus Sailing Association was unable to raise enough money to support the reconstruction of a new bottom and main deck. The ship is one of three Columbus ship replicas that first sailed to Corpus Christi in 1992 as part of Spain's 500th anniversary of the Voyage to the New World celebration. La Pinta and La Santa Maria were too costly to repair. The association created a GoFundMe campaign in 2017 to raise $100,000 to fix the damaged La Nina. The fundraiser has raised $4,335.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: About a third of the state's registered voters are at risk of not being able to participate in March's Super Tuesday presidential primary if they don't request ballots. State and county election officials have been sending letters and trying to get the message out before it's too late. This will be the first time Utah takes part in Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote, after lawmakers moved up the primary to make the state more relevant in the process. The state's nearly 510,000 independent voters can request a ballot for the Republican or Democratic primary, but the process is slightly different. The Republican primary is closed, so voters who want to cast a ballot must return the form to become GOP registered voters by Feb. 3. The Democratic primary is open, so independent voters can get a ballot without registering with the party. They have until Feb. 25 to request the ballot if they intend to remain unaffiliated but need to send it in by Feb. 3 if they want to become a registered Democrat.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: State transportation officials said they are hopeful upgrades to the rail line between Rutland and Burlington can be ready sometime next year, which will make it possible to resume Amtrak rail service between the cities. Officials have been working for years to upgrade the 75 miles of rail and complete a number of other projects, such as station improvements and rail crossings. One of the major projects on the route, a new rail tunnel through downtown Middlebury, is slated for completion next year. Rutland Mayor David Allaire, who serves on the Governor's Rail Advisory Council, said he was hopeful the line will be done by the end of next year, the Rutland Herald reports. Once the improvements are completed, officials plan to have Amtrak's Ethan Allen Express, which now travels between New York City and Rutland, continue to Burlington.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials and U.S. hate-monitoring groups are warning about the potential for violence ahead of a gun-rights rally expected to draw a mix of militias, firearms advocates and white supremacists to the city. Citing credible threats of violence, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a temporary state of emergency days ahead of Monday's rally, banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square. Virginia's solicitor general last week said law enforcement had identified credible evidence that armed out-of-state groups planned to come to Virginia with the possible intention of participating in a violent insurrection. Online, threats of violence have been rampant among anti-government and far-right groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white supremacists and other extremists. Conspiracy theories and other misinformation have also proliferated.\n\nWashington\n\nNewhalem: The National Park Service is investigating the desecration of an archaeological site in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, and the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe is hoping to bring those responsible to justice. The Skagit Valley Herald reports evidence of digging was found over the summer at the Newhalem Rock Shelter camp used by the ancestors of the Upper Skagit tribe. We were shocked and dismayed that someone would do something like this at a cultural site, the tribe's Natural Resources Director Scott Schuyler said. Some of these places are thousands of years old, and the fact that someone would want to come in and purposely destroy, damage or steal, it's just unbelievable. The tribe is working with the Park Service on the investigation and offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to those responsible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRipley: Health officials are hoping a new initiative will help Jackson County residents quickly inform first responders about their medical conditions. WCHS-TV reports the Jackson County Health Department is offering free seat belt covers that will display personal and medical information that first responders can use during a car crash or other emergency situations. Known as Medical Seat Belt Safety Days, the county will provide the free covers March 26-27. People interested should bring their medical insurance information and a list of medications they currently take. Car seat safety checks also will be provided during that time at no charge.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Much of the west side of downtown and some areas east of the Milwaukee River will be inside a security zone during next summer's Democratic National Convention, officials announced Friday. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said every resident and business in the zone will have access to their property. The main inconvenience for residents will be travel times, officials said. It's still not known which part of downtown will be behind barriers or fences. Officials said they have outlined a broad security footprint, and the small, more restricted area should be announced later. The main convention venues include Fiserv Forum, UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, Miller High Life Theatre and the Wisconsin Center.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: State wildlife managers are criticizing plans by Grand Teton National Park to shoot nonnative mountain goats by helicopter. Inclement weather has so far prevented the aerial gunning, though park officials recently closed off a wide area of the Teton Range where shooting is to occur. Having government personnel kill mountain goats from helicopters and leaving them to rot and be wasted is unacceptable, Wyoming Game and Fish Commission President David Rael wrote to acting park Superintendent Gopaul Noojibail in a recent letter. The commission last week approved a resolution opposing the plans, favoring the use of volunteers to hunt the goats on the ground. The governor-appointed commission sets official policies and procedures for wildlife management, including hunting seasons and quotas, across Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
Kristan Hawkins\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIn the same month in which hundreds of thousands will come to Washington D.C. to March for Life in sad memorial of the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that created a legal right to abortion, the justices may take up a case that gives them the chance to reconsider. Vice President Mike Pence cracked the door to that possibility in 2016 with the stroke of a pen in defense of women in a unique #MeToo moment.\n\nPence was governor of Indiana when legislation was sent to his desk that prohibited doctors from discriminating against persons in the womb by aborting solely on the basis of sex, race or disability of the infant. The law also required that after an abortion took place, the broken bodies would be humanely handled by cremation or burial, rather than burned for fuel or dumped into landfills.\n\nThe case, Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, presents an interesting dilemma for the abortion industry, which actively opposes a review by the high court. In fact, last month the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky argued that the Supreme Court should reject the petition filed by the state.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTwitter feigns political neutrality, but my pro-life organization sees the bias firsthand\n\nAbortion rights advocates don't speak for all women on Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination\n\nOn the brink of a post-Roe world, pro-life movement needs a future beyond abortion\n\nWhy? Because the reason for abortion should not matter, they said, adding it would be perverse to be allowed to abort healthy babies but not unhealthy babies.\n\nBut perhaps their objection came from a desire to avoid a public relations reality — that most people recoil from discrimination and callous treatment of others based on prejudice or perceptions of their worth or ability.\n\nIn fact, in a poll just released by Students for Life of America's Institute for Pro-Life Advancement from the polling company, inc./WomanTrend, we found that 54 percent of Millennials surveyed opposed abortion as a form of contraception or when a mother doesn't like the sex of the baby.\n\nObjecting to this isn't rhetorical or theoretical. Actual people are impacted.\n\nAbortion impacts women, racial minorities\n\nConsider the abortion rate of those judged less than perfect who face discrimination in the womb because of perceptions of their abilities. With the rise of prenatal testing, many babies never draw a breath after their parents get a difficult test result. Data indicates that 67 percent of babies that are determined to have Down syndrome are aborted. Two of my four children have cystic fibrosis, and I can tell you that there is tremendous pressure put on mothers like me to abort, as though a life is only worth living when others decide that you will earn more in your lifetime than you cost.\n\nConsider the ultimate #MeToo reality of abortion's impact on preborn girls. The United Nations Population Fund reports that since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 percent more male births than female births with projections that by 2020, more than 142 million women and girls will be lost to gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination.\n\nAnd consider the experience of certain races and abortion. For example, African-American columnist Jason Riley at the Wall Street Journal has observed that more African-American babies are aborted than born alive in New York City, a tragedy that demands consideration, there and elsewhere as African-American women have the highest abortion rate of any other demographic. Looking at perceptions of black genocide through abortion, award-winning filmmaker Yoruba Richen in her PBS documentary Anti-abortion Crusaders: Inside the African-American Abortion Battle noted that for anti-abortion activists in the black community [t]he centerpiece of their message [is] 'The most dangerous place for an African-American child is in the womb.'\n\nMost millennials support limits on abortion\n\nWith that in mind, it's no surprise that Pence supported the life-affirming law as well as other policies designed to show respect to the people impacted by abortion. Our poll found that 7 of 10 millennials — projected to be the largest voting bloc in America — support limits on abortion, and that 65 percent would like to vote on the abortion issue, something that can happen when Roe is reversed and questions of abortion policy are returned to the states.\n\nIn fact, only 7 percent of those surveyed supported abortion without any exceptions and funded by tax dollars, the Democratic Party platform and the often-asserted viewpoint of this generation whom I have found to be much more nuanced in their views. In working with college, university and high school groups on more than 1,220 campuses in all 50 states, I know that this generation is motivated to help women and their preborn children, viewing abortion as a human rights concern.\n\nThis is not a partisan issue. As the Supreme Court decides whether to review this case, the real question is how best to treat the least of these and whether discrimination against those in the womb represents our American ideals.\n\nKristan Hawkins is president of Students for Life of America, with more than 1,220 groups on college, university and high school campuses in all 50 states.

Rep. Steve King, who has long courted controversy, has now courted a new opponent: a prominent Republican challenger will vie against him in 2020.\n\nIowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who helped lead an effort last year to approve massive tax cuts in Iowa, said Wednesday that he'll seek the GOP nomination for King's 4th Congressional District. King won re-election two months ago, after an unusually close race for the longtime House member.\n\nFeenstra did not mention King by name in his emailed announcement, but tacitly acknowledged the staunch conservative member of Congress, who's made offensive remarks on immigration, multiculturalism and other issues. King has previously dismissed the criticism.\n\nToday, Iowa's 4th District doesn't have a voice in Washington, because our current representative's caustic nature has left us without a seat at the table, Feenstra said in a statement. We don't need any more sideshows or distractions, we need to start winning for Iowa's families.\n\nKing says Feenstra is 'easily swayed by the left'\n\nKing has not indicated publicly whether he'll seek re-election in 2020, but he didn't hold back his feelings about Feenstra's run. An emailed statement sent by Jeff King, the congressman's son and employee, began by claiming that Feenstra told Jeff King in late December that he would never run against the elder King.\n\nSteve King's statement added: Today, misguided political opportunism, fueled by establishment puppeteers, has revealed that Mr. Feenstra is easily swayed by the lies of the left.\n\nKing has faced other primary challengers since getting elected to the northwest district in 2002. King noted that history in his statement, calling Feenstra's bid an attempt by the establishment in as many primary cycles to take the 4th District out of the hands of grassroots Republicans.\n\nKing's statement, which highlights that President Donald Trump has called the congressman the world's most conservative human being, concludes that Feenstra offers Republican voters nothing but warmed over talking points from liberal blogs and failed Democratic candidates.\n\nRepublican officials don't promise to support King\n\nBut Feenstra's announcement could be the beginning of a serious political fight for King. Feenstra has hired consultant Matt Leopold to help run his campaign. Leopold served as political director on Gov. Kim Reynolds' recent gubernatorial campaign during the primary.\n\nReynolds — who named King as a campaign co-chair during her election — would not endorse King during an interview Wednesday with a local television station. She said she wouldn't weigh in on a primary.\n\nThe last election was a wake-up call for it to be that close, she told WHO-TV. That indicates that it does open the door for other individuals to take a look at that.\n\nReynolds was referencing the fact that while the congressman was able to fend off an election challenge from Democrat J.D. Scholten, it was his closest race since his first election.\n\nNov. 6 appears to have put King on defense. He announced earlier this month that he will hold town halls in every county in his northwest district, a change from recent years.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley was noncommittal on Wednesday about his thoughts on Feenstra or any other primary challenger.\n\nIt's very rare for me to get involved in a primary, so any Iowan in office today where I say, 'I'm not getting involved in a primary,' they shouldn't take it personal, the Republican senator said.\n\nJeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, offered a similar response in a statement: As we are in all legitimate primary contests, the Republican Party of Iowa will remain neutral in this race. The good people of the fourth district will have the ultimate say.\n\nDemocrats don't like King or Feenstra\n\nIowa Democrats don't like King or Feenstra. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price said in a statement: The 4th District deserves a public servant who will put the people's interests ahead of political ambitions, but, unfortunately, that's not Sen. Feenstra.\n\nIn Feenstra's announcement, he expressed wanting to provide Trump with a strong voice who can help protect and advance a conservative agenda for America.\n\nFeenstra was critical of Democrats with their new majority in the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been in the midst of negotiations with legislative leaders and Trump to end a partial government shutdown over immigration that's stretched into more than two weeks. Trump wants $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico. Democrats do not support that funding, in part by noting that Trump had promised Mexico would pay for such a structure.\n\nWhat we've seen this past week from the new Democratic majority in Congress is appalling. ... The President needs effective conservative leaders in Congress who will not only support his agenda, but actually get things done, Feenstra said.\n\nFeenstra was elected to the Iowa Senate in 2008. He is currently the head of the powerful tax-writing Senate Ways and Means Committee.
Another potential problem caused by the government shutdown: a backlog of beer.\n\nThat's what led Washington D.C. brewery Atlas Brew Works to file a lawsuit against the federal government this week, saying the shutdown is preventing it from shipping new beers.\n\nOn Dec. 20, Atlas Brew Works applied for a new keg label for a beer called The Precious One, an apricot-infused IPA, set to be available in February. It had already received a label approval for the beer in cans.\n\nBut because of the shutdown, the Treasury Department's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has not been issuing new labels. Stuck in the backlog: five labels from Atlas, including for The Precious One.\n\nMore:Government shutdown: How it impacts what you eat from food safety to beer\n\nIf Atlas cannot get an approved label, making it legal to ship the beer to Maryland, Virginia and Tennessee, the brewery could lose $15,000 and see its continued existence threatened, because the lack of new approved labels effectively shuts down further production of new beers and the rebranding of existing beers, the brewery wrote in its complaint filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nIn the complaint, Atlas charged being prevented from getting new labels is an infringement on its freedom of speech. And even though the government may shut down, the First Amendment never shuts down, the brewery said.\n\nBecause the government is not issuing new labels, Atlas cannot legally comply with the law, it says. However, the right to free speech is not a favor that the government affords Americans when political circumstances allow, the complaint said.\n\nAtlas Brew Works is seeking an injunction to prevent acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker from enforcing labeling laws against the brewery.\n\nThe government is expected to file a response Friday. A hearing on the case is scheduled Tuesday.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.
The New York Mets' offseason to-do list included adding a power bat.\n\nWell, just days after signing free agent slugger Jay Bruce, the Mets also added veteran Adrian Gonzalez, according to a baseball official with direct knowledge of the deal.\n\nThe official spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been finalized.\n\nGonzalez, 35, was traded from the Los Angeles Dodgers to the Atlanta Braves as part of a five-man deal in December driven mainly by luxury tax considerations. After the trade, the Braves designated Gonzalez for assignment.\n\nA-Gone has 311 career home runs but has seen a decline over the past several seasons in his power numbers, questioning if he would retire after the season. He missed nearly half of the 2017 due to injuries, which also saw the rise of rookie Cody Bellinger. He had a slashing line of .242/.287/.355 with three home runs in 71 games and did not appear on the Dodgers postseason roster.\n\nGonzalez gives the Mets insurance in case rookie Dominic Smith is not ready to be the everyday starting first baseman.\n\nThe Mets get Gonzalez at the league minimum salary of $545,000 in 2018. The Braves are responsible for the $21.5 million owed to him for the 2018 season under his previous contract.\n\nGallery: Notable 2017-18 offseason trades
Barbara Marquand\n\nNerdWallet\n\nOnce the optimistic glow surrounding New Year's financial resolutions wears off — hello, February! — it's time to roll up your sleeves before losing momentum altogether.\n\nWhether you aim to save money or get stuff organized, many apps and websites are available to help. Here are some things you can do, along with a few caveats.\n\nShow proof of car insurance (and file claims)\n\nMany insurers offer apps that let you pay bills, access policy information and file claims. Your insurer may have an app to help you prove you have car insurance during a traffic stop, avoiding a frantic search through the glove compartment. Unless you're a driver in Connecticut, New Mexico or D.C. (or your state doesn't require insurance or ID cards), you can show insurance ID on your phone, according to the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.\n\nThe caveat: Keep the paper card in the glove compartment as a backup in case someone else drives the car or you leave your phone behind.\n\nComplete a home inventory\n\nIf a fire destroys your house, imagine listing from memory every item you lost in order to make an insurance claim. That would be tough on a good day. After a disaster, it's a nightmare, says Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a consumer advocacy group.\n\nI think the brain tries to protect you from the sadness of things you lost, making it harder to remember, she says. Apps such as United Policyholders' UPHelp Home Inventory and the Insurance Information Institute's Know Your Stuff guide you through documenting all your belongings. Proper documentation is a key to getting reimbursed fully by the insurance company. Your homeowners insurance company might offer an inventory app, too.\n\nThe caveat: Remember to update the inventory when you get new stuff.\n\nArchive important documents\n\nCompanies such as Estate Map, Everplans and My Life & Wishes let you digitally store documents, life insurance policy information and instructions for loved ones to access after your death. It's vital to keep information securely stored and let those who need access know how to find it.\n\nThe caveat: Some similar companies have already come and gone. Keep a backup paper file, and let your loved ones know how to find it.\n\nCreate legal documents\n\nOnline legal sites such as LegalZoom, Nolo and Rocket Lawyer provide do-it-yourself tools to create end-of-life planning documents, including wills, powers of attorney and health directives. Pricing is cheap, starting at under $100 for a simple will.\n\nThe caveat: Walk very, very carefully with online legal solutions, says Lawrence Lehmann, an immediate past president of the National Association of Estate Planners & Councils. He advises talking to an estate attorney or, if you can't afford one, seeking help through a low-cost legal aid clinic. These are powerful documents, and there are plenty of opportunities for missteps, which could wreak havoc later. The devil is in the details, he says.\n\nFor example, Louisiana law says you must sign every page of your notarial (typewritten vs. handwritten) will in front of a notary and two witnesses, among other rules. If you don't, the will is unenforceable.\n\nTrack spending, save money\n\nA variety of free and low-cost apps helps you budget and save:\n\nIntuit's Mint lets you link bank accounts, credit cards and bills and then shows where money is going and how to save.\n\nGoodbudget lets you set aside money upfront in digital envelopes, or categories, and tracks spending.\n\nAcorns rounds up to the next dollar your credit and debit card purchases and invests the change in a diversified portfolio.\n\nMint and Goodbudget offer free versions; Acorns charges $1 a month or 0.25% per year for accounts of $5,000 or more, but is free for college students.\n\nThe caveat: Understand how the fees work or, if the app is free, how the company makes money. Some of these apps might be right for you, but evaluate them objectively.\n\nApps can help you meet personal finance goals, but they can't do everything. Make sure you address big priorities, such as setting money aside in tax-advantaged retirement accounts and getting the right insurance coverage.\n\nMORE: Best budgeting and saving tools\n\nMORE: How to save on car insurance\n\nMORE: The best life insurance companies\n\nBarbara Marquand is a staff writer atNerdWallet, a personal finance website.

Robert Powell\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nQ: I am 64 and just retired. I haven't taken my Social Security yet. My husband will be 60 and plans on taking an early retirement next year. So, I am holding out on Social Security until then. We don't have huge savings. But my husband will get a pension, and he'll be able to collect on my Social Security until he takes his. He also has a 401(k) plan. Do we have to rollover his 401(k) plan once he retires? Or do we leave it there? If we have to roll it over, what's best to put it in? Savings, IRA? We don't think we should do any investing since it's all we have besides our home and cars.\n\n– Jackie Bogdanski, Illinois\n\nA: So, it's never easy to tell someone what to do with their money in the absence of knowing all the facts and circumstances. But there are some observations and general recommendations worth making.\n\nFirst, you're to be commended on not taking Social Security yet. Many people, about 62% according to recent research on the subject, do take it early and that decision costs them 8% of their income for every year they take early, says Joe Clark, a certified financial planner and managing partner of The Financial Enhancement Group.\n\nIn your case, Clark says delaying was probably the right call assuming you're in reasonable health.\n\nThat said, your husband and you should probably talk to a qualified, competent and knowledgeable expert (and/or crunch your numbers using any of the online Social Security claiming calculators) whether your plan to claim Social Security next year makes the most financial sense, whether it will produce the largest possible benefit to your household.\n\nFor instance, Clark says it might make more sense from a financial and income-tax perspective for your husband to collect his pension, for he and you to withdraw money from your 401(k) plans/IRAs for living expenses, and for both he and you to delay claiming Social for as long as possible, even to age 70 if possible. Doing so would likely result in the largest possible monthly benefit for your husband and you.\n\nGiven that you don't have a large savings I would recommend that you consider living off the 401(k) savings as long as possible and continue to allow your Social Security income to build, says Clark. This will allow you to manage the amount of income that goes on your tax return each year as you can control the distributions and you add 8% to your future Social Security income each year. If the 401(k) has enough you can delay collecting up until age 70.\n\nQ&A: Spousal issues with Social Security leave couples perplexed\n\nNow, the decision to roll all or some of the money in your 401(k) account to an IRA requires a good deal of analysis as well. For instance, at a minimum, you'll want to compare and contrast fees, expenses and investment options. You'll also want to determine what sort of services you require, whether you want to pay for advice or not and how much, whether you need creditor protection, whether you currently own a good deal of company stock in your 401(k), whether consolidating your respective investment accounts makes sense (note: you can only consolidate your own IRAs not each other's); whether you'll need to use the money in your IRA to pay for higher education expenses; whether – if you plan to keep working – you might want to delay taking required minimum distributions (RMDs), and so on. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to tell you want to do in the absence of learning more about your situation. As for how to invest your money, that too is another difficult question to answer. There are at least two strategies to consider: the floor-and-upside approach and the bucket approach.\n\nWith the floor-and-upside approach, you would use guaranteed sources of lifetime income – your pension and Social Security benefits – to pay for your essential expenses, however you define them. If you have a gap, you would buy additional lifetime income – an annuity, for instance. Or you might consider buying bonds and/or CDs and laddering the maturities.\n\nThen, once your essential expenses are covered with guaranteed sources of lifetime income, you would invest whatever was left over in so-called risky assets – stocks and bonds – to pay for discretionary expenses and to pay for living expenses many years from now. After all, you will want some of your investments to be safe and some to keep pace or outpace inflation, or the cost of living.\n\nThe other approach would have you invest in safe assets to pay for expenses over the next one to five years, a mix of safe and risky assets to pay for expenses five to 10 years from now, and risky assets to pay for expenses more than 10 years from now.\n\nGreat retirement planning looks at spending, not income\n\nKeep in mind that actuarial science suggests that when a couple makes it to age 60 and in reasonable health, there's a high probability one of you will be alive at age 90, says Clark. That's 25 years. The days of not having any investments because of age or retirement have passed. You do need to consider reduced volatility in your decision making but it shouldn't be all cash.\n\nNow, should you decide to use the strategy suggested above and spend down your husband's 401(k) and delay your Social Security benefits then you could consider a more cash-type position for your IRA if it will be exhausted in the next two to three years, says Clark. Keep in mind that your 401(k) should also have a money market or short duration bond choice so you don't have to transfer to an IRA to reduce volatility. Remember investing is not as much about age as it is purpose and need.\n\nRobert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, contributes regularly to USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.

Quick, take a look at your bank account — or your mailbox: Did up to $600 in stimulus cash show up yet?\n\nIf it didn't, the Internal Revenue Service is telling taxpayers don't call us — and don't call your bank. If you're worried and you're waiting for your money, your best bet is to visit the IRS.gov website.\n\nThe IRS said: IRS phone assisters do not have additional information beyond what's available on IRS.gov.\n\nMost people shouldn't be in panic mode, as the second stimulus money only began rolling out last week. We've got time to see that cash, especially if it's arriving via the mail.\n\nBut if you closed a bank account in the past few months, well, maybe you will need to worry.\n\nI've heard this past weekend from plenty of consumers who say they've spotted the deposit into their bank accounts already. So far, I've not heard from any who are complaining just yet about the second round of stimulus payments. I continue to hear from a few readers who did not receive their first stimulus payments.\n\n21 stocks to buy in 2021:Disney, AutoZone and PayPal are among stocks to consider buying\n\nEconomy in 2021:Vaccine-fueled rebound expected\n\nStarting on Monday, the IRS said, people could begin to check the status of both their first and second payments by using the Get My Payment tool, available in English and Spanish at IRS.gov.\n\nBut an early check of that site indicated that you might face a wait time trying to log into it. Due to high demand, you may have to wait longer than usual to access this site. We appreciate your patience, the IRS site said shortly after 2 p.m. Monday when I tried to access it.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nBank accounts: Most people will see this latest round of stimulus money via direct deposit into their bank accounts. According to the IRS, the scheduled payment date is Jan. 4, which is the official date funds are available.\n\nThe direct deposit is being made to those who have valid routing and account information on file.\n\nBut the IRS also warned that some individuals might experience some glitches.\n\nBecause of the speed at which IRS issued this second round of payments, the IRS stated Monday, some payments may have been sent to an account that may be closed or no longer active.\n\nIf that happened, the financial institution is going to have to return the money to the IRS. If so, you might not be too happy because you could have to wait and wait.\n\nWhile the IRS is exploring options to correct these payments, if you have not received your full payment by the time you file your 2020 tax return, you may claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on your tax return, the IRS said Monday.\n\nYou're not going to be able to call and try to fix things. The IRS cannot change payment information, including bank account or mailing information, the IRS said.\n\nThe second payments are up to $600 for individuals who qualify; up to $1,200 for a married couple filing a joint return with no children, and an extra $600 for qualifying children ages 16 and younger.\n\nPaper checks: Some checks went out Dec. 30 but the IRS noted on Monday that paper checks will continue to be sent through January.\n\nMailed payments will require more processing and mailing time, the IRS said. Those who reside abroad will have longer wait times for checks as disruptions to air travel and mail delivery in some countries will slow delivery.\n\nPlastic debit cards: It is possible that you will receive your second stimulus on a plastic Visa debit card issued by MetaBank. And you might get a debit card even if you received a paper check for the first Economic Impact Payment sent in 2020.\n\nDo not throw out these debit cards.\n\nThe Economic Impact Payment Card will be sent in a white envelope that prominently displays the U.S. Department of the Treasury seal, the IRS stated.\n\nThe Visa name is on the front of this plastic card. The issuing bank is MetaBank and listed on the back of the card. For more information about these cards, see EIPcard.com.\n\nA limited number of payments are being sent out by debit card.\n\nNot everyone gets the stimulus dough: Some people won't get any money or they might see a reduced payment, based on their income.\n\nThe IRS noted: Most people who have an adjusted gross income for 2019 of up to $75,000 for individuals and up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns and surviving spouses, will receive the full amount of the second payment.\n\nContactSusan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

Susan Tompor\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nCorrection: an earlier version of this story contained the wrong phone number for the IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center appointment hotline. The number is 844-545-5640.\n\nOpening Day for the IRS is Monday.\n\nThat's when the Internal Revenue Service will start accepting electronically filed tax returns. We have until April 18 to file returns but many file earlier in the season, if they're expecting large refunds.\n\nThe tax filing deadline this year is Tuesday, April 18, instead of the traditional April 15, because of some quirks of the calendar. April 15 is a Saturday. But the deadline won't be shifted to Monday, April 17, because that is Emancipation Day, which is celebrated in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat do tax filers need to know this season?\n\n1. Get an appointment if you want to talk to someone at IRS offices\n\nDon't expect to drop into an IRS office to get any help this tax season. All offices are appointment-only now.\n\nIf you need to visit an IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center in person, you must schedule a time by calling 844-545-5640 for the appointment hotline.\n\nTaxpayers are asked to check IRS.gov for the days and hours of service, as well as the services offered at the location they plan to visit.\n\nMore on taxes:\n\nTax refund advances get big marketing push in 2017\n\nSome families can't bank on a tax refund before Feb. 27\n\nMore W-2s to have a 16-digit code to fight tax fraud\n\n2. Beware of a new hurdle if you've used a special Individual Taxpayer Identification Number\n\nSome tax filers will be unable to file their federal tax returns if they do not update Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers. Warning: Any ITIN that has not been used in the past three years will no longer work for filing that return.\n\nOn top of that, individual tax identification numbers that have middle digits of 78 or 79 also expired this year.\n\nTax filers in these situations must renew an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number as early as possible because they cannot file a tax return without one.\n\nThe super-sized headache? The IRS notes that it can take up to 11 weeks during the peak of the tax season to get that number from the time you send in a renewal application, known as Form W-7, for the IRS to process the application and notify you about your status.\n\nWhy the change? A new federal law to combat fraud included the requirement that certain Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers expired on Jan. 1.\n\nAnyone filing a tax return with an expired ITIN could experience return processing and refund delay as well as denial of some tax benefits until the ITIN is renewed, the IRS said online in a statement.\n\nThese identification numbers often are used by people who have tax-filing or payment obligations under U.S. law but are not eligible for a Social Security number.\n\n3. Some struggling families will face delays for their tax refunds\n\nThe IRS notes that more than nine out of 10 refunds will be issued within less than 21 days, which is good news.\n\nBut tax filers who benefit from the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit should not expect their refunds until possibly the week of Feb. 27, even if they file as soon as this week.\n\nThe reason? Congress is cracking down on tax-return-related fraud. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act mandated the IRS delay issuing tax refunds for returns claiming the EITC or the Additional Child Tax Credit until Feb. 15. The move is designed to give the IRS more time to detect fraud and prevent refunds from being issued to ID thieves who file fake tax returns using such credits.\n\nBut consumers who depend on the refund cash will face extra delays, given holidays and weekends.\n\nAnother thing to note: The IRS online Where's My Refund tool will not show an estimated date for many tax returns involving the special credits until after Feb. 15.\n\nSo don't panic in late January and mid-February if you don't see a refund date on 'Where's My Refund.' That's just how the tool will operate given the special circumstances with the EITC and ACTC refunds, said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen in prepared remarks in early January.\n\nWhere's My Refund at www.irs.gov and the IRS2Go phone app will be updated a few days after Feb. 15 with projected deposit dates for the early filers who receive the earned income credit and additional child credit.\n\nMore from Susan Tompor:\n\nHow much is too much for a car payment?\n\nFinancial resolutions for the New Year: 17 for '17\n\nChase's 100,000 bonus points coming to a stop\n\n4. Look out for high-cost, quick-cash on tax refund advances\n\nTax filers might be tempted by refund anticipation loans that proclaim no fee will be charged. But Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center, warns that in some cases, borrowers could face other higher fees for tax preparation or another product.\n\nAdvance loans are being heavily marketed this year by some firms, including H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt, in light of the new delays ahead for tax refunds for those who file those Earned Income Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit.\n\nJackson Hewitt is marketing for its Express Refund Advance, a loan of up to $1,300 that has no fees, a 0% annual percentage rate and no credit check. To get the loan, you will have to pay to file your taxes with Jackson Hewitt.\n\nH&R Block began offering a tax-related loan for a limited time beginning Jan. 6. The H&R Block Refund Advance offers loans in the amounts of $500, $750, or $1,250 upfront for 0% interest.\n\nThe loan is loaded onto an H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard.\n\nThe amount of the advance will be deducted from tax refunds and reduce the amount that is paid directly to the taxpayer. Both Jackson Hewitt and H&R Block only offer the loans to customers who visit their offices and outlets; it's not available online.\n\n5. Take a close look at that W-2 Form\n\nSome tax filers are going to discover that they have to deal with a Form W-2 Verification Code.\n\nAbout 50 million W-2 forms will include a 16-digit verification code that tax filers or preparers will need to add when prompted by tax software. About 2 million W-2s had such a code during the 2016 filing season.\n\nThe IRS anticipates that the verification code ultimately will be used on all W-2 forms in future years.\n\nAgain, we're looking at another hurdle to try to corral the crooks and prevent the filing of fake tax returns.\n\n6. Remember, scam artists love tax season\n\nWe continue to ask the public to be vigilant because the scamming doesn't stop, said Luis D. Garcia, IRS spokesperson in Detroit.\n\nThe con artists pretending to be from the IRS might reach out via your e-mail inbox, your mailbox or even knock on your front door, Garcia said.\n\nAnd the crooks are going after tax preparers, too.\n\nEarlier in January, the IRS warned that cyber criminals were pretending to be tax filers who wanted help filing their returns.\n\nThe first e-mail says something like: I need a preparer to file my taxes.\n\nIf the tax preparer responds, a second e-mail is sent that has either an embedded web address or contains a PDF attachment that has an embedded web address.\n\nThe tax professional may think they are downloading a potential client's tax information or accessing a site with the potential client's tax information, the IRS warned.\n\nIn reality, the cyber criminals are collecting the preparer's e-mail address and password and possibly other information.\n\nOddly enough, I even got one of these phishing e-mails last week. The language was stilted and off-kilter, which can be a warning sign.\n\nIt began Hello, CPA, which I am not.\n\nI need a careful and experienced high-quality accountant, to handle all matters of accounting including tax preparation, IRS problem resolution, and matters expected of a CPAs to handle for Individual and Small Business, the e-mail read.\n\nI don't need that stereotypically dull, introverted and boring accountants, I believe in the value of partnership in business relationships.\n\nFind attached is my tax documents.\n\nLove that last line. I'd love to respond: Find this attachment for a way to learn how to diagram sentences and master subject-verb agreements.\n\nBut then again, we don't want the scammers to get even better at this game, do we? Best to kill and ignore all such phishing e-mails.\n\nContact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876. Follow Susan on Twitter @Tompor.
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Officials said Tuesday that the state will see a slight increase, about 16%, in COVID-19 vaccine doses coming in federal shipments, but the ongoing shortage remains the chief obstacle to getting more people inoculated. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the U.S. is boosting deliveries to hard-pressed states over the next three weeks to increase vaccinations. I'm pleased that Alabama will receive a slight increase in our vaccine supply. Any margin of increase is appreciated, but we have a long way to go to be able to provide them to any Alabamian who wants one, Gov. Kay Ivey said Tuesday. State Health Officer Scott Harris said Alabama will receive an additional 10,000 first doses in its upcoming delivery. The state had been receiving about 50,000 to 60,000 first doses each week but will see that jump to 70,000 in coming weeks, according to numbers supplied by Harris. That does not include second doses, and Harris said it is unclear if the increase will be sustained longer than three weeks. Ivey said the state will also have the flexibility to redistribute unused doses in the federal program to vaccinate nursing home residents.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: State health officials plan to launch a live phone service for residents trying to schedule vaccination appointments. The state currently provides an answering service through which residents seeking appointments can only leave messages, Alaska Public Media reports. The hotline will become available in anticipation of a February shipment of COVID-19 vaccine from the federal government, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's administration said Monday. Tessa Walker Linderman of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services said more than 40 staff members will answer calls from people wanting to book appointments. Many of the workers were previously tasked with tracing the contacts of people who were infected with the coronavirus. A decrease in the number of new cases has allowed those employees to shift to the hotline, Walker Linderman said. Callers may still have to wait, but the system should allow personal interaction within reasonable amounts of time rather than automatically requiring residents to wait for return calls. New appointment openings are expected to be added to the state's vaccine website starting Thursday, officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: In a move intended to accelerate a lagging COVID-19 vaccine rollout, Gov. Doug Ducey on Tuesday issued new rules, including giving the state authority to take unused doses back from providers and reallocate them. Dr. Cara Christ, Arizona Department of Health Services director, said that in addition to limiting factors in terms of the federal supply, said some providers may not be using all their vaccine doses. It's going to require certain providers that have 40% or more of their doses being reported as unused, they are going to have to submit a plan to the department that tells us how they are going to significantly increase and use that vaccine within the next seven days, Christ said of the new reporting requirements. If we don't agree they've got a great plan, we can take doses back at the state level. Health providers in Arizona are either not reporting that they are administering the COVID-19 vaccine or simply not administering it at the rate state officials want to see, Christ said. The new requirements will give the state authority to take back unused doses from providers who don't have adequate plans to use them, she said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit challenging the early closing time for bars and some restaurants that was temporarily imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The lawsuit argued Gov. Asa Hutchinson and state officials did not have authority to order bars and restaurants to close by 11 p.m. The Republican governor announced the order in November in response to a surge in coronavirus cases, and in December it was extended to Feb. 3. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen, who dismissed the suit, called the rational basis for the early closing time obvious given the number of people who have died from COVID-19 nationally and in the state. Public health and safety concerns is a rational basis for regulating how and when people gather to dine and drink alcoholic beverages in commercial establishments, he wrote. Hutchinson said he was glad Griffen dismissed the suit but said a decision had not yet been made on whether to extend the early closing time. An attorney for the group of Fayetteville bars and restaurants challenging the early time said they were discussing whether to appeal the decision.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A troop of gorillas at San Diego Zoo Safari Park appears to be recovering from the coronavirus – including a 49-year-old silverback who received antibody therapy – in what is believed to be the first known cases among such primates. The western lowland gorillas were infected with a variant that has been circulating in California and is believed to be more contagious than other strains, the safari park said Monday in a statement. Some gorillas showed symptoms including mild coughing, congestion and intermittent lethargy. The silverback named Winston had pneumonia, likely caused by the virus, as well as heart disease. He has been more active since being put on antibiotics and heart medication, as well as receiving an antibody treatment – a therapy to block the virus from infecting cells, San Diego Zoo Safari Park said in a statement. We're not seeing any of that lethargy. No coughing, no runny noses anymore, the park's executive director Lisa Peterson told the San Diego Union-Tribune, adding that the animals' fecal matter is no longer testing positive for the virus. It feels to us like we've turned the corner.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Out of dozens of requests for sentence reductions from inmates with health concerns amid the pandemic, federal judges in Colorado approved just three in the final four months of 2020. Judges have the power to apply legal criteria differently when weighing requests for so-called compassionate release, Colorado Politics reports. Federal inmates can petition courts directly if there are extraordinary and compelling reasons to leave prison, which could include elevated threat to life from COVID-19. In 24 opinions published from September through December in response to compassionate release requests, judges in the U.S. District Court in Colorado found the health condition of inmates or the level of virus transmission in prisons was not severe. The judges commonly denied requests to those who were not 65 or older, who had not served 75% of their sentence, or whose family circumstances did not merit release. In two opinions denying compassionate release, Senior Judge Marcia S. Krieger found that inmates may be safer from COVID-19 in prison than outside of it.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state's unionized prison guards expressed anger Wednesday over what they say is the lack of a plan to vaccinate them against COVID-19. Jody Barr, the executive director of AFSCME Council 4, said the union was told there would be a plan to vaccinate prison employees by early January, but they have yet to hear when they might get the vaccine or how it will be distributed to them. The department has not asked the correction officers how many of them are willing to take it, Barr said. And without knowing how many vaccines you are going to need, how can they have a plan to distribute it? Correction officers are among the essential workers in the state's 1b group, making them eligible for the vaccine. But the governor's office has said that, because it is receiving only about 46,000 doses a week for those getting a first shot of the two-dose regimen, it is limiting appointments for the time being to people over age 75. Appointments are expected to be expanded in about two weeks to those over 65. Only after those people are vaccinated will appointments be opened to those with preexisting medical conditions and essential workers.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Making mail-in voting permanent, mandating higher use of renewable energy and more than doubling education funding for disadvantaged students are among Democratic Gov. John Carney's plans for Delaware. Carney outlined those and other goals, including providing body cameras for every police officer in Delaware, in an online State of the State address Tuesday. He also pledged to continue working to ensure that as many Delawareans as possible receive the COVID-19 vaccine, even as restrictions he imposed on businesses and individuals remain in place. Over the course of my 30 years in public service, and even during the course of this administration, I have seen government tackle countless, serious and complicated challenges, Carney said while discussing the pandemic. Nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to the last ten months. Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus, civil unrest, racial tensions and a contentious election, Carney described the state of the state as resilient. It's determined. It's strong. And it's getting stronger, he said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Georgetown University confirmed some first- and second-year medical students received the COVID-19 vaccine when they were not eligible, WUSA-TV reports. Higher-level medical students have been approved to get the vaccine because they are in hospitals working with patients, according to a Georgetown University spokesperson. Neither Georgetown University nor MedStar Health/MedStar Georgetown University Hospital reportedly authorized the vaccine for students who did not fit the criteria. We've taken the necessary steps to ensure this is avoided in the future. These actions run contrary to Georgetown's values as a Jesuit institution, teaching our students to be in service to others, a spokesperson for the school said. The School of Medicine takes violations of professionalism extremely seriously and will be taking appropriate action as outlined in its Code of Professionalism in the Student Handbook. Georgetown University said in a statement that it would not discuss individual students and how many got unauthorized vaccinations because of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Seniors will get their second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared Tuesday, even as frustration grows nationally over spotty supplies of the life-saving medicine. Later in the day, President Joe Biden announced that states would get a roughly 16% increase in deliveries over the coming weeks, allowing more Floridians to get a shot in the arm against a disease that has killed more than 25,600 in the state. The rise in shipments translates to 307,000 first doses and 254,000 booster shots for Florida, according to the state health department. While good news for those waiting to get inoculated, it surely won't satiate the demand for the vaccine – even if the increased shipment does help ease concerns about availability for the growing number awaiting booster shots. Of the more than 1.4 million in Florida who have gotten shots, less than 11% have gotten their second dose, according to the latest records provided by the state Health Department. That means more than a million people – most of them at least 65 years old – are coming due for the second of two shots required to achieve the highest level of efficacy against the disease.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A member of the state House was removed from the chamber Tuesday for not abiding by the Legislature's coronavirus testing policy. Rep. David Clark, R-Buford, was asked to leave the chamber floor by House Speaker David Ralston. Clark refused to leave on his own and had to be escorted out by police. Members of the Legislature are supposed to undergo testing on Mondays and Thursdays. Ralston spokesman Kaleb McMichen said in a statement that the member in question had been advised numerous times about the requirements and had refused to be tested at any point during this session. The statement said he'll be able to return once he complies with the policy. Clark also had his office space in a building adjacent to the Capitol temporarily taken away. Clark, not wearing a face mask, told reporters he is abstaining from twice-a-week testing until it is available to everyone in the state, particularly teachers and first responders. Testing in Georgia is available to anyone who wants it and is widely accessible. You know, sometimes this job isn't all it's cracked up to be, Ralston said after having Clark removed. I don't know about you all, but I've been to too many funerals.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Birthday plans for one of Hawaii's most esteemed houses have raised concerns over the proposed $53,000 cost while the state deals with significant economic problems stemming from the pandemic. Democratic Gov. David Ige proposed the commemoration of Washington Place, the longtime residence of Queen Liliuokalani and a dozen governors, Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Honolulu property, which became a museum and state reception venue nearly two decades ago, turns 175 years old this year. The $53,000 tab represents a tiny portion of Ige's proposed $15.4 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. But the cost has been questioned in the face of impending cuts to state jobs, programs and services. Hawaii faces projected $1.4 billion revenue shortfalls for each of the next four years. What kind of celebration is being planned during COVID, with the inability to gather, that would require that much (money), Democratic Rep. Lisa Marten, a member of the House Finance Committee, asked Ige chief of staff Linda Chu Takayama at a recent budget hearing. Takayama said details have not been finalized, but it's not a whole lot of money. Private donations are expected to match the state's contribution.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State health care leaders are pressing federal officials to explain why Idaho was allotted far fewer doses of COVID-19 vaccine than most other states. Numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show Idaho has been distributed vaccine at a rate of 10,298 doses for every 100,000 residents, less per capita than any state but South Carolina. We've reached out to the new administration to lodge our concern, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said Tuesday. Officials with the Biden' administration told Jeppesen they weren't sure why Idaho's distribution was lower but would look into it, he said. Demand for the limited doses has been high and is expected to increase dramatically Feb. 1, when Idaho residents 65 and older will become eligible. It's been impossible for public health officials to adequately track whether the priority group guidelines have been followed correctly or whether some traditionally disadvantaged populations have been offered the vaccine at equitable rates. The legislation that created Idaho's voluntary immunization tracking system doesn't allow the state to collect some demographic information, including race or ethnicity and profession.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Chicago Public Schools should allow students back into classrooms in no more than 100 facilities and then gradually reopen others, an organization of school principals proposed Wednesday, saying most of them doubt the nation's third-largest school district can safely handle a mass reopening. Troy LaRaviere, the president of the Chicago Principals and Administrators Association, said during a news conference that a survey revealed its members don't believe there will be enough staff at schools to safely reopen, nor enough safety supplies to guard against the spread of COVID-19. And he said the members haven't received adequate guidance from the district on how to reopen the schools that have been closed since March. We salute the district's goals, LaRaviere said in a statement. However, their plans are not realistic or safe for most of our schools. The new plan also says vaccinating teachers and other staff at the first schools to reopen should be a priority. That, LaRaviere said, would not only make the schools safer but also make teachers more willing to return to classrooms. Some special education and pre-K teachers had refused to return to in-person teaching this month.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Crowd size limits will be relaxed starting next week following recent improvements in the statewide COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates, the governor announced Wednesday. The new rules will allow gatherings at up to 25% capacity at venues in counties with the two highest-risk levels of coronavirus spread on the state's four-level rating system, Gov. Eric Holcomb said. The new rules starting Monday will replace the current 25-person crowd limit for the highest-risk counties that's been in place since mid-November. Holcomb said he was trying to balance lives and livelihoods with the relaxed restrictions. All 92 counties remain at the highest restriction categories under two-week trends of the state Department of Health's weekly tracking map. But that number could drop in coming weeks, as Wednesday's updated map labels five of Indiana's 92 counties in the most dangerous red category, down from 34 counties last week and 73 two weeks ago. State health officials said they still aren't expanding COVID-19 vaccine availability to those younger than 70 because of limited dose availability. They expect to extend vaccine eligibility to those ages 65-69 in the coming weeks.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State lawmakers are considering allowing dentists to administer the COVID-19 vaccine and flu shots. The proposal, House Study Bill 71, received its first hearing at a House subcommittee Tuesday but did not advance. Lawmakers said they wanted more time to consider the measure. If it became law, dentists would be required to complete four hours of training related to prescribing and administering vaccines. They would not be allowed to delegate vaccine administration to dental hygienists or dental assistants. Rep. John Forbes, D-Urbandale, who is a pharmacist, said his practice is getting overrun by calls from people who want the vaccine. Forbes did not sit on the subcommittee but urged his colleagues to push the proposal forward. But Dennis Tibben, a lobbyist for the Iowa Medical Association, which opposes the bill, said there are enough doctors and pharmacists to administer the COVID-19 vaccine without adding dentists as well. It's not necessarily the case that we don't have enough folks to administer the vaccine; it's that we don't have enough vaccine, he said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Republican legislators suggested Tuesday that mistakes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly's administration are making it more difficult for older residents to get COVID-19 vaccines. But Dr. Lee Norman, head of the state health department and Kelly's top public health administrator, said the biggest problem Kansas faces in administering the vaccines is there's just not enough. Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature have grown increasingly critical of Kelly and the Department of Health and Environment, peppering Norman with pointed questions during Tuesday's joint meeting of the House and Senate health committees. One GOP lawmaker even argued that Kansas was wrong to focus on vaccinating health care workers first, rather than people 65 and older. I've never felt like our leadership, the Kelly administration, the KDHE, has learned lessons from this virus and adapted strategies to it, said freshman Sen. Mark Steffen, a Hutchinson Republican and a physician, who didn't wear a mask at Tuesday's socially distanced meeting and said he doubts the effectiveness of mask-wearing, despite a growing scientific consensus that masks provide protection for others as well as those wearing them.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Faced with a weakening of his executive powers, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has offered an outline for potential compromises in a letter to top Republican legislative leaders. Beshear sent the letter to House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers last week, soon after vetoing a series of bills that would limit his executive authority, including in times of emergency. The governor doesn't have much leverage unless he can mobilize public support for his proposals. GOP lawmakers have the numbers to override his vetoes when they resume their session in early February. The governor has said the measures would hamper the fight to slow the spread of COVID-19. Beshear's letter said his strong preference is to hold off on legislation altering executive powers until Kentucky has overcome the pandemic. But he told the House and Senate leaders his letter was an attempt to provide a potential framework for discussion and compromise. If the General Assembly is determined – even in the midst of a deadly pandemic and in spite of our comparatively successful response – on passing legislation, then I recommend we discuss narrowly tailoring that legislation to address concerns that you raise, Beshear wrote.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A judge has refused to toss out six criminal complaints filed against a pastor charged with violating gathering capacity rules put in place during the early days of the pandemic. Nineteenth Judicial District Judge Eboni Johnson-Rose on Monday dismissed pastor Tony Spell's motion to have the case against him dropped, news outlets report. The judge's ruling sided with a special assistant to the district attorney who argued that when the charges were filed in the early days of the outbreak, New Orleans was a national coronavirus hot spot, and Louisiana was under a declared emergency, The Advocate reports. Prosecutors alleged Spell violated public gathering capacity limits Gov. John Bel Edwards put in place last spring by continuing to host worship services at his Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge with hundreds in attendance. He was accused six times in March of violating the orders. Spell said he did not attend his hearing Monday because he refused to wear a mask inside the courthouse. He and more than a dozen supporters and church members instead gathered across the street to protest the charges, with Spell later telling The Advocate the judge ruled against God by not voiding his offenses.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state plans to launch a system to allow residents to register for a COVID-19 vaccine. The statewide system will include a website and a telephone option, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Nirav Shah said Tuesday. Maine is looking to launch the registry system in as little as a few weeks and at a time when demand for vaccines greatly outstrips supply. More than 115,000 doses of vaccine have been administered in the state, but most of the population is still not able to access it. The registry system will be designed to allow residents to consent to the vaccine and sign up for an appointment to receive it. Meanwhile, Maine's public university system has expanded its coronavirus wastewater monitoring program through the end of the spring semester. The University of Maine System said it's adding new sample collection sites and increasing sampling and testing frequency. The university system uses the program to track for the presence of the virus on its campuses and in surrounding areas. The system said samples will be collected twice weekly at campuses around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state Senate plans to add about $520 million to Gov. Larry Hogan's proposal to help Maryland recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, leading Democrats who control the chamber announced Wednesday. Democrats are keeping the Republican governor's proposals in his $1 billion plan over several years. The Senate's proposed additions would come this year, focusing largely on education, business, health, housing aid, transportation and unemployment assistance. It would bring the total amount of the proposal to almost $1.3 billion in the current fiscal year. This is the immediate relief that Marylanders need, said Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore. Hogan's plan includes direct stimulus payments to low-to-moderate income residents, with benefits of up to $750 for families and $450 for individuals. It repeals all state and local income taxes on unemployment benefits. The governor's plan also includes sales tax credits of up to $3,000 a month for four months for small businesses. The governor's proposal is on top of roughly $700 million the state already has allocated in aid relating to the pandemic.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: All residents 75 and older are now eligible to make an appointment to get a COVID-19 vaccine, but Wednesday's online rollout did not go smoothly for some. Residents could start scheduling an appointment starting at midnight for shots being administered starting Monday at one of more than 80 sites around the state, from mass vaccination sites like Gillette Stadium to local pharmacies and supermarkets. Monica Nelson, a retired nurse from Newburyport, told The Boston Globe she spent two hours trying to get her 75-year-old husband a slot with no luck. She called the rollout a disaster. Syracuse University student Ghael Fobes, on the other hand, logged on just after midnight and was able to make appointments for his grandparents. State health officials urged patience, warning that it may take several weeks to get an appointment and that as more vaccine supply arrives, additional appointments will become available. Once vaccinations are completed for residents 75 and older, those who are older than 65, and those with two chronic illnesses or medical conditions will be eligible.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republicans in the state House on Wednesday proposed a $3.5 billion coronavirus recovery plan but threatened to withhold billions to K-12 schools unless Gov. Gretchen Whitmer cedes her administration's power to prohibit in-person instruction and sports to local health departments. The state health department in November ordered a temporary ban on face-to-face learning in high schools to help curb a surge in COVID-19 cases, lifting it later. A prohibition on youth contact sports remains. Some Michigan school districts haven't had in-person classes since March. That's hurting kids in ways we can't even imagine, and not just academically, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Thomas Albert, R-Lowell, said in a statement. By law, K-12 districts and charter schools decide whether to allow in-person classes. Although the Democratic governor has strongly urged schools to offer a face-to-face learning option by March 1, House Republicans want to entice public schools by offering up to $250 per student in funding if they commit to reopening by Feb. 15.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Some hospital systems are flouting state and federal guidance on the hierarchy for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, according to health officials. The Minnesota Department of Health has deputized large health systems to distribute the vaccine as part of a public-private partnership. Currently the state has prioritized inoculating people who provide in-person health care services or people living and working in congregate care settings. But at places like Mayo Clinic, HealthPartners and Allina Health, people who don't have patient contact or who can work from home are getting vaccinated, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The health systems have been far more lenient in vaccinating people than was intended, and that's concerning, Minnesota Department of Health infectious disease director Kris Ehresmann said. We felt like we were pretty clear in the guidance. In some cases, people like fitness instructors and construction workers are getting shots, whether they are at high risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19 or not. The situation raises questions about distribution, access and equity with a limited supply of doses.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Mississippi is unconquerable after a year dominated by the coronavirus pandemic and natural disasters including tornadoes that cut wide paths of destruction last Easter, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said in his State of the State speech Tuesday. Speaking on the south steps of the Capitol, Reeves renewed his call for eliminating the state's personal income tax and said he would sign a bill to increase teachers' pay. He called on legislators to make wise investments in workforce training. And he vowed that the state will vaccinate people against COVID-19 as quickly as possible. We need to crush this virus and get back to our way of life, Reeves said. The virus is still here, and it cannot be solved by ignoring it. We have to defeat it because Mississippians are done. We're done burying loved ones who were lost to this virus. We're done with overwhelmed hospitals. We're done with the fearful talk of lockdowns and shutdowns. We're ready for community again. Reeves served eight years as state treasurer and eight as lieutenant governor before becoming governor last January. His first year in the job was dominated by the pandemic, with the first virus cases found in Mississippi in March.\n\nMissouri\n\nO'Fallon: Republican Gov. Mike Parson plans to divert thousands of unused doses of COVID-19 vaccine from CVS and Walgreens pharmacies to other state-enrolled vaccinators to help the slower-than-expected vaccination process, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. Spokeswoman Kelli Jones said the administration has requested the return of 25,000 doses from CVS and Walgreens, which would then be rerouted to county health departments, medical hospitals and clinics, and hundreds of other state-approved vaccinators. The pharmacy chains were tasked with providing vaccinations at long-term care facilities under a Trump administration plan unveiled in December. Jones said Missouri's new plan won't affect shots for workers and residents at those facilities that have been ravaged by COVID-19. Our objective, though, is for those vaccines allocated in Missouri to be administered into people's arms, and we're kind of disappointed how that federal pharmacy program has gone, Jones said. According to data posted Wednesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Missouri ranks last among states for the share of residents who have received an initial vaccine dose.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The Montana House Judiciary Committee held a hearing Wednesday on a bill that seeks to protect free speech on public university campuses in the state – even as university administrators say their campuses already protect free speech. Bill sponsor Rep. Mike Hopkins said current university policy allows some groups, including conservative organizations, to be silenced on campuses, and the measure would ensure students are exposed to a broad range of views even if they do not agree with them. I might make you angry; you might make me angry, said Hopkins, a Republican from Missoula, home to the University of Montana. But I'm not going to shut you up, and you're not going to shut me up. That sentiment was echoed by several university students who spoke in favor of the bill during the hearing. Some said they believed existing policies prevented them from voicing controversial viewpoints on their campuses. The current policies of University of Montana and other colleges around here put at risk that freedom and that right, that responsibility to develop ourselves intellectually and to grapple with things that we may not be comfortable with, said Ethan Holmes, who graduated from the University of Montana in 2019 with a degree in Russian and political science.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials in the Omaha area are allocating $10 million of unspent federal coronavirus relief aid for rent, food aid and mental health services. Douglas County Board member Mike Boyle said many people continue to be evicted from their homes despite a federal moratorium. And he described Tuesday's decision to give $2 million in rent and mortgage assistance to the Metro Area Continuum of Care for the Homeless to distribute as a rare opportunity to help people who are really hurting. County officials have said many people who needed help with rent weren't able to meet federal coronavirus relief requirements, the Omaha World-Herald reports. They aren't going to have to jump through all the hoops that are put together by the feds, Boyle said. Another $6 million will be earmarked for mental health, although the details haven't been finalized. Board Chair Mary Ann Borgeson said it may go to such things as training for 911 operators and dispatchers, or a program to send mental health professionals to crisis calls to 911. The board also unanimously approved allowing $2 million to the the Food Bank for the Heartland.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Health officials said second doses of COVID-19 vaccine will be offered at the Las Vegas Convention Center beginning next week. The Southern Nevada Health District said the appointment-only clinic will open Feb. 2 for people who received their first doses at a health district clinic and are eligible to receive their boosters. The district has started to notify people who are eligible, including those who received their first shots at Western High School, Cashman Center or the health district's main office in Las Vegas. People who were vaccinated at one of the locations and do not receive a notification can call the district to make appointments for the second doses. Residents who received their first doses at other locations will not be eligible. Health officials recommend that the second dose of vaccine be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. The interval for the Pfizer vaccine is 21 days, and for the Moderna vaccine it is 28 days. The two vaccines are not interchangeable.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Businesses that have been fined for violating emergency orders during the pandemic would get their money back under a GOP-sponsored bill that went before a House committee Wednesday. Rep. Andrew Prout, R-Hudson, told the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee that eight businesses have been fined a total of $10,000 so far. His legislation would require the state to reverse any findings that businesses violated the rules, refund any fines paid, and restore any suspended or revoked permits or licenses once the state of emergency has ended. I think a lot of people feel like this all came at them fast, they don't fully understand it, and even with the best intentions, they may get caught up in this, he said. Some lawmakers on the committee questioned whether businesses were given adequate warnings. But according to the attorney general's office, all had been repeatedly reminded of the rules before facing enforcement action. For example, a general store in Loudon was warned more than 10 times that workers must wear masks, but it refused to comply and posted a sign that read: Please refer to the Constitution of the United States! We know how to wash our hands, clean surfaces and NOT cough or sneeze on people.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state is set to get a 30% increase in COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next three weeks, a top health official said Wednesday. New Jersey's allotment of vaccines from the federal government will rise from about 100,000 doses a week to 130,000 for three weeks, Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. The boosted figure comes after President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that his administration would increase how much states got by about 16%. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy praised the Biden administration for setting a three-week window instead of a one-week interval that was in effect under the previous White House. More vaccines are desperately needed as the state aims to ramp up administration of the shots, with about 643,000 given so far since mid-December, Murphy said. The larger amount is still well below the 470,000 doses New Jersey officials calculated would be needed to meet demand. The state saw 107 additional deaths from the virus overnight, putting the total toll at 19,091. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases fell over the past two weeks from 6,190 a day Jan. 12 to 5,146 on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: An economic relief package is taking shape at the Legislature as a Senate panel endorsed a $600 rebate to low-income workers and a separate bill that would waive licensing fees on liquor stores. Residentswho earned up to $31,200 during 2020 would be eligible for the $600 payout or credit against tax liabilities under a bill that also provides a temporary tax break for restaurants as they endure restrictions on indoor dining. A panel of lawmakers unanimously advanced those proposals Tuesday. The concept of a rebate to low-income workers who labored through the pandemic at essential businesses was pioneered late last year by Republican lawmakers without approval. Democrats have embraced the approach under a bill from Sens. Peter Wirth of Santa Fe, Jacob Candelaria of Albuquerque and Siah Correa Hemphill of Silver City that also includes temporary tax breaks for restaurants and other food service businesses, from food trucks to craft breweries, for a four-month period starting March 1. The income tax rebate alone could distribute an estimated $95 million in credits and rebates. The bill received unified praise from business associations and a progressive-leaning advocacy group for solutions to childhood poverty.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he was erasing the handful of remaining orange zones in the state where tougher pandemic restrictions had been in place because of the fast spread of COVID-19. The Democrat cited a post-holiday dip in the number of infections, after a period in which rates had surged to more than 114,000 new cases in one week. Eliminating the zones will allow restaurants to again offer indoor dining, albeit at half-capacity. Indoor dining is still banned in all of New York City, but Cuomo promised to come up with a plan by Friday to address how restaurants might reopen that service, too. His administration is considering whether to again allow indoor dining in the city at 25% capacity. The orange zones had been in central and western New York, Staten Island and Westchester County. Cuomo said he's launching several yellow zones, which require schools to launch testing programs, in certain New York City neighborhoods and a part of Orange County where hospitalizations and infections are increasing. During the past seven days, the state has averaged about 12,800 new infections per day, a rate it last recorded in late December.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state has overpaid tens of millions of dollars in jobless benefits since the COVID-19 pandemic began to people who don't actually qualify for them or have committed fraud, North Carolina's unemployment program director told legislators Tuesday. Pryor Gibson, who leads the Division of Employment Security, described how nearly $70 million had been overpaid during the first nine months of 2020. Nearly all of that total was distributed since the virus lockdowns sent claims rocketing to historic levels. The overpayments remain a small percentage of the $8 billion in federal and state unemployment benefits distributed in North Carolina during all of 2020. That compares to $160 million in benefits paid overall in 2019, when the state unemployment rate fell below 4%. In 2019, the division reported nearly $7 million in overpayments. Overpayments can happen due to fraud or unintentional mistakes that lead a person to receive benefits to which they aren't entitled, Gibson said. The division reported that $9 million in benefits since March 31 have been paid out due to identity theft.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum on Wednesday lowered the statewide risk level for the coronavirus, increasing the recommended occupancy limit for bars, restaurants and other food service establishments. Burgum noted that active cases dropped by 1,016 Wednesday from more than 10,000 in mid-November and that the state's 14-day positivity rate has decreased to about 3%, the lowest since Aug. 22. The governor adjusted the risk level from moderate to low effective Jan. 29. We're grateful to all North Dakotans, including our medical, education and business communities, for their actions that have contributed to these positive results, Burgum said in a statement. We continue to use a data-driven approach to navigate this pandemic, and all data indicates North Dakota is heading in the right direction. A low risk level increased occupancy limits at bars and restaurants from 65% of the establishment's licensed capacity up to 200 patrons and to 80% of licensed capacity up to 300 patrons, with social distancing. Face covering are strongly recommended or required.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An anonymous donor has given Kenyon College a $100 million donation, the largest in school history, for the construction of three new residence halls, the liberal arts college announced Tuesday. The central Ohio school of about 1,600 students, which requires all students to live on campus, said the donation allows it to continue a focus on a residential college experience despite the disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic. Kenyon is conducting both online and in-person classes this year, and it reduced the on-campus population to allow all students to live in single rooms. To receive this record-breaking gift during a pandemic that is still gripping our country and disrupting our academic year speaks volumes about the strength of Kenyon's future, school President Sean Decatur said in a statement. Decatur said the donation will also allow Kenyon, founded in 1824, to renew its efforts to grow the college endowment for scholarships and financial aid. Kenyon received a $75 million anonymous donation in 2017 allowing it to build a new library and academic quad on the campus of the school in Gambier, about 58 miles northeast of Columbus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state attorney general's office is attempting to return $2 million worth of a malaria drug once touted by former President Donald Trump as an effective treatment for COVID-19, a spokesman said Wednesday. Alex Gerszewski, a spokesman for Attorney General Mike Hunter, said Hunter is attempting to negotiate a return of the 1.2 million hydroxychloroquine pills Oklahoma acquired in April from a California-based supplier, FFF Enterprises. He said the office was acting on a request from the Oklahoma State Department of Health, which authorized the purchase. A spokeswoman for FFF Enterprises didn't immediately return a message Wednesday seeking comment. The attempt by Oklahoma to return the hydroxychloroquine was first reported by the online news publication The Frontier. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt defended the purchase last year, saying the drug was showing some promise as a treatment in early March, and he didn't want to miss an opportunity to acquire it. The drug has since been shown to have little or no effect on severe cases of COVID-19, and a former state health official chalked up Oklahoma's purchase to something that happens in the fog of war.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Health officials in the tri-county Portland metro area said Tuesday that tens of thousands of front-line health care workers have not received the COVID-19 vaccine and that it will likely take weeks before most do. One solution is allocating more doses of the vaccine to the populated area, said Jessica Guernsey, the Multnomah County public health director. Guernsey said officials have spoken to the Oregon Health Authority about this option and have not received an outright denial. There really is no easy way to say this: Right now we are in a situation in the metro area where we have more people eligible for the vaccine than we actually have vaccine in the metro area, Guernsey said. This is an incredibly frustrating situation. Health leaders in Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties announced Tuesday that the online regional COVID-19 Phase 1A vaccination sign-up survey launched Jan. 12 is now closed because of the limited vaccine supply. Health officials said that while 60,000 eligible people applied for vaccines through the survey, only 11,000 were sent invitations to be vaccinated.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf defended the state's rollout of COVID-19 vaccines Tuesday, saying that it was left in the lurch by the Trump administration's overpromises and that a decentralized vaccine sign-up system should prove to be more efficient, as opposed to a centralized portal some states use. He also defended federal guidelines – adopted by his administration – that pushed smokers into the first phase of vaccination, calling it an objective assessment of who is most vulnerable, not a value judgment. Meanwhile, Philadelphia abruptly cut off a vaccine clinic operator amid concerns that it had sought to profiteer from the work. Officials said they ended their relationship Monday with the group Philly Fighting COVID, which had been chosen to run the city's largest vaccination site. Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said the city became concerned when the privacy policy on the group's website changed to allow sharing personal information for people signing up for vaccinations, and the group abruptly stopped its coronavirus testing operations. Farley said the organization assured the city that personal information had not been sold, but health department officials were working with the city's lawyers to determine next steps.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University allowed some smaller classes to meet in person starting Wednesday. Classes of 19 students or fewer are now allowed under Level 2 of the Ivy League school's coronavirus protocols. The campus has three activity levels, with Level 1 being the most restrictive. All levels still require face coverings and social distancing. Libraries are open, but students are required to reserve study space online and check out books using a contactless circulation system. Office hours and advising are still remote. Athletic and recreational facilities remain closed. Socializing is only allowed in groups of five or fewer students unless outdoors, where social distancing can be maintained. The university bookstore is open only to members of the Brown community, and a university ID is required for admission. Students are still required to follow all state and federal guidelines.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A bill that would assure lawmakers have a chance to change or end a prolonged state of emergency from Gov. Henry McMaster passed the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic, now more than 10 months old, exposed some problems with South Carolina's emergency law, which had not been altered in almost 60 years except to add the words public health emergency in 2002. Under current law, McMaster can only issue an emergency declaration for 15 days before the General Assembly has to weigh in. To avoid that, the Republican governor has issued different declarations with incremental changes every two weeks or so. He issued the 22nd such order Friday. The bill would allow the General Assembly to weigh in within 30 days. They could end or continue a state of emergency with one vote of each chamber or alter it through a more lengthy process. If they don't meet, the emergency declaration would last as long as the governor wishes. The current emergency law was created in a time when people thought more of hurricanes and less about pandemics and modern governments that require continuity and quick reactions, whether it means shutdowns or rapid vaccine rollouts.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state will be receiving more COVID-19 vaccine doses in the coming weeks, the Department of Health said Wednesday. The state will start to receive about 12,800 weekly doses next week, Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said, up from the previous weeks' 11,000 doses. The increase comes after the federal government changed distribution strategies and increased shipments to states, rather than keeping vials in reserve for second doses. Epidemiologist Joshua Clayton said South Dakota has had about 117,725 doses allocated so far. As of noon Tuesday, about 82,000 doses had been administered, and just over 60,000 people had received at least their first dose. Roughly 24,000 people have received both doses of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Those numbers do not include tribal vaccination distribution, which is being handled by the Indian Health Service. Most South Dakotans who have been eligible for the vaccine have opted to receive it. About 65% of health care workers offered the vaccine have taken it, and at least 95% of nursing home residents have received the vaccine.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state government at one point expected to get as many as 400,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses from the Trump administration's supposed reserve, which would've been a windfall for a state with untapped distribution capacity and limited supply, Tennessee's top health official confirmed. Instead, state leaders were stunned earlier this month when it was revealed the federal reserve was empty. Tennessee got no surge of doses from the release of the reserve and, separately, is still waiting for increased vaccine supplies that federal officials promised would start this week, said Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey. We had calculated internally, just internal calculations, that we could get up to 400,000 – like this big (influx) of 400,000 doses, she said. And it turns out, nah, that didn't happen.Tennessee's vaccine shortage is some of the latest fallout from the chaotic end of the Trump administration. Then-Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, in one of his final news interviews in the job, told NBC News on Jan. 15 that the stockpile was empty because the Trump administration already released those doses to states.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A federal judge on Tuesday expressed frustration over what she saw as a lack of progress in efforts to try to relieve overcrowding at Texas' largest county jail, where some inmates have described the facility as a metal can of contagion amid worries about a potential COVID-19 outbreak. Concerns about the Harris County Jail were raised this month by Sheriff Ed Gonzalez after its population ballooned to more than 9,000 inmates, leaving little room to quarantine prisoners who test positive for the virus or to separate new inmates when they first arrive. The jail population had only dropped to about 8,800 inmates as of Tuesday, with most awaiting trial. U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal, presiding over a lawsuit that accuses the county's felony bail system of keeping poor defendants locked up only because they can't afford to pay a bond, had asked the sheriff's office, prosecutors, public defenders and state court judges to see if some inmates facing low level, nonviolent felony charges and who were being held on bonds of $10,000 or less could be eligible for bond reductions. But the Harris County District Attorney's Office said it would only agree to bond reductions in 60 of 1,500 identified cases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The city's school district has reopened to elementary students after increased pressure from state lawmakers and parents amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Salt Lake City School District board first voted to reopen middle schools and high schools after all teachers and staff were vaccinated, but it extended its vote to open all schools by Feb. 8, KUER-FM reports. It's a little scary with the virus still going on, said Marissa Book, who dropped off her kindergartener daughter, Vivian, at Franklin Elementary School for its first day back Monday. But they honestly need it. Salt Lake County Health Department epidemiologist Mary Hill said the schools reopened with all safety precautions and will likely continue to follow measures closely, such as closing a school if 1% of its population tests positive for the virus. The question now is whether bringing older students back to campuses will lead to an increase in social gatherings outside of the school, she said. A lot of the transmission, I don't believe, has been occurring in school, Hill said. They take off their mask, and they go to their social activities and go to each other's houses and play. And then they bring it back to school.\n\nVermont\n\nHardwick: The COVID-19 vaccination program for residents 75 or older began Wednesday at a number of locations across the state. Registration opened Monday for people in the age group, and by Wednesday morning more than 29,000 people had signed up. A clinic held in the gymnasium at Hazen Union High School in Hardwick gave its first inoculation about 9 a.m. With three vaccination stations, officials hoped to vaccinate 150 people the first day, said Valerie Valcour, the public health nurse running the clinic. We are working through some of the little kinks, but I think it's working smoothly overall, she said. An estimated 49,000 people in Vermont are over 75. Officials estimate it will take about five weeks to give everyone in the category both the first and second shots. Then the focus will turn to people 70 and over, followed by those 65 and over. I believe the start of spring is a good projection for this, Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said when asked how quickly he felt those groups could be vaccinated. State officials are encouraging people to sign up online if they are able, even urging friends and relatives to help them.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The mayor has tested positive for the coronavirus. Mayor Levar M. Stoney said in a statement that he was informed of his positive test result Wednesday morning. Stoney said he began to experience mild COVID-19 symptoms Monday. He is isolating at home. And the people with whom he has been in contact are quarantining and taking other precautions. He said the pandemic is far from over and must be taken seriously. Since the coronavirus first started to spread in our region roughly a year ago, over 12,000 residents in our city have been infected with COVID-19. Today, I count myself as one of them, the mayor wrote. While I do not feel 100 percent, I am thankful that my symptoms are currently manageable and will continue to work from my home to ensure the continuity of city government. The mayor's annual State of the City address has been moved from this Thursday to Feb. 11. It will be delivered virtually. I look forward to sharing with all of you my vision for moving the city boldly forward in the coming year, and beyond, Stoney said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday touted big improvements in distributing COVID-19 vaccines, but he also urged residents to remain vigilant as new, more contagious variants of the coronavirus spread in the state. Inslee said more than 36,000 doses were administered in Washington on Sunday and 39,000 on Monday – a big jump from about 16,000 a week earlier and on the way toward the state's goal of 45,000 a day. The number of vaccines actually administered could be even higher, given lags in reporting, but as of Monday more than 500,000 doses had been administered statewide, with four mass vaccination sites due to open this week. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the federal government is boosting vaccine supplies to the states by 16% over the next three weeks, giving states more certainty about upcoming deliveries than the one-week notice the Trump administration had been providing. The shipments will also contain specially designed syringes to squeeze an additional dose out of vials of Pfizer vaccines. Still, problems persist, including that due to shortages many of the people now eligible for the vaccine, including everyone over 65, have had trouble finding appointments.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A judge on Tuesday denied an attempt by teachers unions to halt the state's decision to reopen classrooms last week amid the pandemic. Kanawha County Judge Carrie Webster denied a temporary restraining order that sought to reverse the resumption of in-person learning in all 55 counties. The two largest unions wanted local school boards to decide reopening plans and allow more teachers to get fully vaccinated before going back to teach. The West Virginia Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia had filed two separate lawsuits that were later consolidated. While we're disappointed with the decision, the judge did make a point of saying educators are at greater risk during this pandemic, Dale Lee, president of the West Virginia Education Association, said in a statement. Decisions to teach in-person, remotely, hybrid and online should be a local decision, made by those who are the most impacted and who best understand how to best educate students safely. The unions had said it is unsafe to put teachers and workers back in classrooms as coronavirus cases still climb.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state will become one of only 10 in the U.S. without statewide mask mandates if the Assembly votes as scheduled Thursday to overturn Gov. Tony Evers' order, but masks will still be required in some of its largest cities thanks to local ordinances. More than two dozen public health organizations, as well as state and local health officials, have urged the Republican-controlled Legislature to reconsider the vote. Wearing masks is one of the pillars of recommendations from health experts worldwide to slow the spread of the coronavirus, along with physically distancing and avoiding crowds. The move comes as Wisconsin lags in distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, health officials warn about the spread of contagious new variants, and total deaths due to COVID-19 near 6,000. This is no time to remove a mask mandate in our state, Wisconsin Department of Health Services Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said Tuesday. Vaccines alone won't stop the spread, she cautioned, noting the emergence of more contagious variants. Whether that mandate stands or not, everybody in our state, continue to wear a mask, to physically distance, she said, adding that it is not a bad idea to wear two masks.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A new supercomputer in the state will rank among the world's fastest and help study phenomena including climate change, severe weather, wildfires and solar flares. Hewlett Packard Enterprise won a bid to provide the $35 million to $40 million machine for a supercomputing center in Cheyenne, the National Center for Atmospheric Research announced Wednesday. The HPE-Cray EX supercomputer will theoretically be able to perform almost 20 quadrillion calculations per second – 3.5 times faster than the existing machine at the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center. The new machine's maximum speed per second will be roughly equivalent to each person on Earth completing a math equation every second for an entire month. That power will enable some of the most sophisticated simulations yet of large-scale natural and human-influenced events. It will support basic research in ways that will lead to more detailed and useful predictions of the world around us, thereby helping to make our society more resilient to increasingly costly disasters and contributing to improved human health and well-being, center Director Everette Joseph said in a news release. A contest among Wyoming schoolchildren will decide the new supercomputer's name.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and numerous other progressive Democrats have been appointed to the influential House Oversight and Reform committee, according to a Tuesday release from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nOcasio-Cortez — who has emerged as the face of a new movement of young, liberal-leaning Democrats — is set to join the investigative committee that will serve as a check on the executive branch, Chairman Elijah E. Cummings said in the days following the 2018 midterm election.\n\nAmong the other progressive Democrats appointed to the committee: Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who grabbed headlines in January for using a profanity in her call to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nThe committee was ranked one of the most influential in Congress in 2014 by The Atlantic, which noted that the committee investigates allegations of fraud and abuse within the federal government.\n\nWhen asked about the outspoken nature of several new appointees to the committee, Cummings was dismissive, Politico reports: If I based the choices going on the committee based on what people said or their reputations or whatever, I probably wouldn't have a committee.\n\nCalling the committee a powerful check on the Trump administration, Axios has gathered a list including dozens of potential subpoena targets for the committee.\n\nThe Associated Press, citing two Democratic congressional staffers who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported in November that the committee would likely seek Trump's business tax returns and other company-related financial records.\n\nTrump's personal income taxes, which he withheld during the 2016 campaign and during his two years in office, were at that time expected to be sought by the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press
WASHINGTON – Roger Stone, a political operative whose work on Republican campaigns spans from Richard Nixon to President Donald Trump, has links to several targets of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nStone was arrested Friday after a federal grand jury indicted him on charges of lying to Mueller's investigators.\n\nStone has been a pugnacious and longstanding force in GOP politics, allies say. His web site features pictures of him with Nixon and Ronald Reagan.\n\nAnother link leads to a 2008 New Yorker profile, which said he regularly cross(es) the line between respectability and ignominy. The profile featured a picture of his tattoo of Nixon on his back.\n\nStone has worked for decades for a variety of Republican campaigns. During the 1980s, he was a partner in a political consulting firm with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, another key figure in the Mueller investigation. Manafort, who worked for Trump's campaign from March to August 2016, has been convicted on a variety of bank, tax and witness-tampering charges.\n\nThe Stone indictment contains seven counts: five charges of false statements, one count of witness tampering and one count of obstruction.\n\nThe allegations revolve around Stone's alleged contacts with WikiLeaks, the organization that released thousands of emails about Democrats during the 2016 election in an effort to damage Trump opponent Hillary Clinton. Stone is charged with lying to the House Intelligence Committee during its Russia investigation and trying to conceal emails and other records the committee had requested.\n\nI intend to fight for my life, Stone told Alex Jones during an interview Friday on InfoWars.com.\n\nStone said he was calling the show after being released on $250,000 bond after being arrested at his home about 6 a.m.\n\nThey would like me to plead guilty to charges that are completely bogus, Stone said. There is no Russian collusion. There is no Wikileaks collaboration.\n\nThe indictment makes repeated references to Trump's campaign but doesn't accuse the president himself or other officials of wrongdoing.\n\n'Payload is coming'\n\nIn the summer of 2016, according to the indictment, a senior official on Trump's campaign was directed to contact Stone to learn about any other damaging information the organization had on Clinton's campaign.\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2016, according to the indictment, Stone emailed an unnamed person involved with the campaign to give them a heads-up about another release of information: Spoke to my friend in London last night, he wrote, a reference to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. The payload is still coming.\n\nStone previously acknowledged he is likely the unnamed person in last year's indictment of Russian military intelligence officers charged with hacking Democratic computers.\n\nOne Stone aide during the campaign, Andrew Miller, is fighting in federal appeals court to avoid a subpoena to testify before Mueller's grand jury. Another Stone associate, Jerome Corsi, has said he expects to be indicted for perjury.\n\nBut Stone insisted throughout the probe that he did nothing illegal. In a tweet on Oct. 23, Stone said that he didn't communicate with WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign and didn't receive emails allegedly hacked from Democratic computers.\n\nThe answer is no, Stone said.\n\nA Virginia jury convicted Manafort in August of eight counts of bank and tax fraud for not reporting millions in income. His sentencing is scheduled Feb. 8. Manafort also pleaded guilty in September to a conspiracy representing a pro-Russia faction in Ukraine and failing to report it, and obstructing justice by seeking to have witnesses provide inaccurate accounts to prosecutors.\n\nTrump adviser\n\nStone said he quit the Trump campaign in August 2015 after Trump suggested a television interviewer was menstruating. But Stone, who graduated from John Jay High School in Westchester County, New York, in 1970, remained an informal adviser to Trump and lingered on the periphery of the campaign.\n\nMueller's team charged a group of Russian military intelligence officers in July with hacking into computers of the Democratic National Committee and nominee Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Tens of thousands of emails and other documents were released online under the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0.\n\nThe indictment was revealed days before Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki.\n\nThe indictment said Guccifer 2.0 wrote to a person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump on or about Aug. 15, 2016, asking if the person found anyt(h)ing interesting in the docs I posted?\n\nStone has said he thinks he is the unnamed person in the indictment, but that the contact was benign.
AP\n\nHENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — The Oakland Raiders came one step closer to securing the land the team needs for its new headquarters and practice facility near Las Vegas — and at a steep discount.\n\nOfficials in suburban Henderson approved a resolution Tuesday that allows the city to move forward with a direct sale of 55 acres (22 hectares) to the Raiders for more than $6 million — half the land's appraised value. The city is using a Nevada law that allows for no-bid sales at under-market prices when they are considered to be in the public interest.\n\nThis is an opportunity to take the city of Henderson to a new level, Assistant City Manager Greg Blackburn said during the city council meeting ahead of the resolution vote. It's hard to put a dollar value to what this does to help us for the future.\n\nThe Raiders have promised that the venue will create an estimated 250 full-time jobs not counting players. The team will spend about $75 million to build the complex.\n\nThe team wants to kick off its 2020 season at a 65,000-seat domed stadium built partially with taxpayers' money across the freeway from the Las Vegas Strip. The team in May paid $77.5 million for the 62-acre (25-hectare) site and hosted a glitzy groundbreaking ceremony in November.\n\nGuests of hotels and other lodging facilities in the Las Vegas area are contributing $750 million to the project through a room tax increase. The Raiders and the NFL are expected to contribute $500 million to the project, while the team has also secured a $600 million bank loan for construction.\n\nHenderson's city council must vote again next month to give final approval to the offer.\n\nHenderson officials said the city will benefit from property taxes collected on the land and additional spending from visitors and team clients. City staff said similar projects have created an estimated $210 million tax impact over a decade after the venues are fully built.\n\nNot all residents were supportive of the city's decision.\n\nThe Raiders have been Gypsies over the years, starting in Oakland, then moving to El Segundo (LA) for a few years, then back to Oakland and now Las Vegas. Where to next? Henderson resident Adrian Woodhouse wrote the city council in an email.\n\nOn Wednesday, commissioners in Clark County approved a development agreement with the team that spells out public safety and infrastructure improvements that the Raiders will pay for in and around the stadium.\n\nThe agreement calls for widening sidewalks, improving roadways, installing and modifying traffic signals, and building any needed pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe team agreed to install about $1.4 million worth of public safety equipment at the stadium and an emergency operations center. The development agreement did not include a finalized plan for the thousands of county-mandated parking spaces.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that officials in Henderson, Nevada, approved the resolution Tuesday.

Bob Nightengale\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nGeorge Steinbrenner used to be every player and agent's favorite in the game of baseball, doling out contracts beyond their wildest dreams, refusing to let money become a deterrent to winning a World Series championship.\n\nThe game no longer has the late New York Yankees owner, whose old team has not spent a penny in the free-agent market this winter, but, we now have Mike Ilitch.\n\nIlitch, 86, who has owned the Detroit Tigers since 1992, refuses to leave God's green earth until he has a World Series ring on his finger.\n\nJustin Upton, Detroit Tigers agree to six-year, $132.75 million deal\n\nIlitch struck late again by instructing his front office to exceed baseball's luxury tax barrier of $189 million for the first time in franchise history, and signing free agent outfielder Justin Upton on Monday evening to a six-year, $132.75 million contract.\n\nThe deal will be officially announced at Comerica Park on Wednesday afternoon, after he undergoes his physical in the morning.\n\nThe Tigers have now spent $272.25 million this year on free agents, more than any team in baseball with the exception of the Chicago Cubs. It's $42 million more than the Boston Red Sox, and $272.25 million more than the Yankees.\n\nThey became only the second team in MLB history, joining the Yankees, to sign two free agents to contracts exceeding $100 million, after acquiring starting pitcher Jordan Zimmermann in November.\n\nI'm telling them, 'You have to go out and get me the best players,'' Ilitch said at the Zimmermann press conference. I don't care about the money. I want the best players, and that's it.''\n\nThere are no questions about commitment in Detroit, but instead, whether this will actually translate into that coveted title.\n\nThe Tigers have a beast of a lineup with all-world hitter Miguel Cabrera, Victor Martinez, J.D. Martinez and Upton. No team in baseball has a more imposing lineup. Yes, they are all right-handed except for switch hitting Victor Martinez, but they are lethal no matter whether the pitcher throws the ball with his right hand or his left.\n\nWhy, Upton has a career .805 OPS against right-handed pitching, including .848 last season. He hit 23 of his 26 homers against right-handers. Cabrera hit a major-league leading .344 against right-handed pitching last year. J.D. Martinez his .286 with 28 homers off righties.\n\nThe Tigers' lineup will be even more powerful than ever with Upton, 28, who truly believes the best is yet to come. It's why Upton and his agent, Larry Reynolds, refused to settle for a short-term contract. They had faith all along that someone could see his value, and realize that if surrounded by greatness, his potential would blossom.\n\nAfter all, Upton's 190 career home runs are more than any active player 28 years or younger, according to ESPN's Stats and Research. This will easily be the most talented lineup he's ever been part of in his career. We'll soon find out if it's also the best team.\n\nThe Houston Astros, Washington Nationals, Atlanta Braves and Texas Rangers were the most aggressive teams coveting Upton, but he made it clear to all of them that if Jason Heyward was going to get $23 million a year from the Chicago Cubs, he should get awfully close considering the power he provides. Tigers GM Al Avila and manager Brad Ausmus, who went to Upton's home in Scottsdale, Ariz., last Friday to recruit him, came away agreeing with him.\n\nYoenis Cespedes should cash in after Upton's huge deal\n\nUpton will earn $21.25 million every year in his deal, with an opt-out clause after two years, and a full no-trade provision.\n\nIlitch, of course, hopes that within those two years, whether Upton opts out or not, he'll have a World Series ring.\n\nThe future, everyone understands, is now for the Tigers.\n\nThis is a team that has four of their star players who will be 33 or older this season: DH Victor Martinez (37), closer Francisco Rodriguez (34), Cabrera (33) and Justin Verlander (33).\n\nIt's not as if their aging stars about to depart anytime, either, resulting in a bloated future payroll. Cabrera is signed for $240 million through 2023. Verlander has $112 million remaining through 2019. Martinez is owed $54 million through 2018. And Zimmermann, who will be 30 in May, is owed $110 million through 2020.\n\nThe Tigers have committed about $117 million to five players alone in 2018, but now, they have a young star to help supplant their aging stars.\n\nBesides, the Upton signing did nothing to hurt their future or farm system. The Tigers, who were protected because they had one of the 10 worst records in the major leagues last season (74-87) lost only a third-round pick by signing Upton, after losing a second-round pick with the signing of Zimmermann.\n\nHe also eliminates any holes in the Tigers' current lineup, enabling the Tigers to use Anthony Gose in center field with Cameron Maybin.\n\nWho knows if the Tigers have enough to knock off the defending World Series champion Kansas City Royals, but at least now they have a chance.\n\nThey've significantly upgraded their team after also signing starter Mike Pelfrey to a two-year, $16 million deal, signing shortstop Mike Aviles and catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, and trading for Maybin. Perhaps most important, they rebuilt their bullpen, which ranked 27th last season with a 4.38 ERA, with the acquisitions of closer Francisco Rodriguez, and setup men Mark Lowe and Justin Wilson.\n\nIlitch, who has watched his team reach the World Series twice during his tenure, and win four consecutive AL Central titles, now is giving his team one more shot. The window is closing, and Ilitch is aging, but the Tigers now have as great an opportunity as anyone in the American League.\n\nIlitch has four Stanley Cup championship rings as owner of the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nHe might be willing to give them all up for that World Series ring.\n\nIt's all,'' Ilitch said, I think about.''\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale
Drawing up a list of financial resolutions for the new year isn't the routine exercise it once was. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed that, as it has altered so many other behaviors.\n\nIt's not just a matter of plotting the usual ways to save more money, cut debt or re-evaluate your spending patterns – this year's three most popular money resolutions, according to Fidelity Investments' 2021 New Year Financial Resolutions survey. Rather, the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial pressures it has caused have brought a new sense of urgency to some goals, while posing different challenges and presenting new opportunities.\n\nEvaluate spending, budget\n\nBudgeting, for example, ranks as a top financial resolution year in and year out. But this time, things are a bit different because the pandemic changed spending patterns for many people. If you review how you spent money over the past year or two, you likely can spot key differences and perhaps areas for improvement.\n\nShipping deluge:Delays in holiday deliveries, delays in returns, plague small businesses\n\nChild labor and Girl Scout cookies:Palm oil industry in Southeast Asia tied to cookies, plus other snacks, breakfast cereals\n\nFor example, you're probably not driving as much anymore so you might not need a car to the same extent. Maybe you don't need to buy as many clothes, especially for work, or perhaps you're spending much less on entertainment and restaurants. Most likely, you cut back big time on travel. Maybe you can reduce these expenditures permanently.\n\nMake an inventory of what you did in 2020, and use it as a roadmap for 2021, suggested Bobbi Rebell, a certified financial planner and adviser for Splitit, a site that helps people make interest-free purchases on installment. Our definition of needs and wants has changed so much.\n\nAssess your insurance needs\n\nYou might have noticed that you don't require the same types or levels of protection as before. Auto insurance is an obvious example, now that more people are working or studying at home. That has meant fewer cars are on the road, with a sharp reduction in vehicle accidents and better insurance deals.\n\nThe staggering drop in accidents this year resulted in a dramatic drop in claims paid by insurers, said the Consumer Federation of America and the Center for Economic Justice in a recent review of accident statistics.\n\nThe groups want to see insurers lower premiums – and many have. It thus might be a good time to evaluate your insurance needs with an eye on shopping around.\n\nConversely, you might need more home-insurance coverage, or different types, if your dwelling has risen in value, you recently completed remodeling projects or you set up a new home-based business.\n\nCancel unneeded subscriptions\n\nWhile you're looking at spending, take the time to evaluate your various subscriptions, memberships and other accounts with an eye on eliminating those you no longer use, said Rebell. Look to cancel automated, recurring payments whether tied to your bank account, cellphone or other accounts if you rarely use those services anymore.\n\nCancellations don't need to be permanent and might bring about a better deal. If you change your mind, you can always resubscribe to a service and might receive a coupon, introductory rate or discount for doing so, Rebell added. Also, look to reduce paper clutter by signing up for email statements where possible.\n\nThese and other moves to get more organized weren't necessitated by the pandemic, but you might now finally have the time to get it all done.\n\nPlan for an unreliable tax refund\n\nMany Americans still haven't built up an emergency fund, and the COVID-19 outbreak with widespread job losses didn't help. But there could be a special need to accumulate a cash cushion now because you probably can't count on your annual income-tax refund arriving with as much predictability as in the past.\n\nTax refunds are the largest chunk of change many Americans receive all year and a key source of funds to pay down credit card balances and so on. But office-shutting measures to control the virus slowed tax-return processing and the issuance of some refunds by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nTaxpayers shouldn't rely on receiving a refund by a certain date, especially when making major purchases or paying bills, the IRS warned in December. Some tax returns may require additional review, and processing may take longer.\n\nThe IRS said it already expects that refunds tied to the earned income tax credit and the additional child tax credit won't be issued before mid-February.\n\nMaintain online vigilance\n\nThe IRS and other entities have warned of an uptick in cyber scams tied to stimulus payments, coronavirus-relief measures and the like. Given that many of these federal and state programs are new, it's easy to get confused. Plus, more people are shopping online amid the COVID-19 outbreak, raising the odds of falling victim.\n\nHence the need to stay alert. Among key points: Be skeptical about offers from unfamiliar companies, avoid clicking on attachments and be wary of unsolicited messages from tax authorities such as the IRS, which doesn't initiate contact this way.\n\nAlso, take the opportunity to change passwords to lessen the odds of having an account hacked. Americans don't change their passwords often. Nor do they utilize complex, lengthy passwords. Password manager NordPass said it determined this by examining 275 million passwords, with the help of a data-breach security firm. Of those, only 44% were unique.\n\nThe 2020 list of most common passwords was similar to those from 2019. For example, the numerical string 123456 was near the top both years. Other common ones include password, picture1, 111111, qwerty and abc123.\n\nReview all your online accounts and delete those you no longer use, NordPass suggests. Favor passwords that are unique, complicated and long.\n\nInvest in yourself\n\nEven before COVID-19 arrived, many Americans found that their job and financial-literacy skills were lacking. Now might be a good time to take courses or make other personal improvements, especially as so much of this can be done online.\n\nWhile people usually think of financial resolutions in terms of saving more or cutting debt, learning and earning more also are important, noted Dana Anspach, a certified financial planner with Sensible Money in Scottsdale, Arizona. Learning is the foundation of both making smarter investment decisions and increasing your earning power, she said.\n\nAs with any resolution, Anspach said it's critical to devise a plan to make it happen by defining actionable steps and putting them on a calendar, now. Other helpful tips include having a mentor or accountability buddy and following a course of action for at least three to four weeks, until the new behavior becomes routine.\n\nReach Wiles at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com.
NASHVILLE — Can you picture a fastball coming off the hand of a New York Yankees pitcher and hear the crack of it being hit by a Nashville batter?\n\nCan you see that ball sailing over the fence, then gaze beyond the outfield seats and across the Cumberland River at the downtown skyline of the Music City?\n\nJohn Loar, a 59-year-old businessman who moved here from the San Francisco Bay area about six months ago, can. He has a vision for a Major League Baseball franchise playing in a 42,000-seat stadium located on the East Bank.\n\nAnd he has a plan to make it happen.\n\nI think Major League Baseball is going to expand, and it's going to be either Charlotte or Nashville, he said. If you really want to have baseball, you've got to start now.\n\nSome civic leaders are skeptical.\n\nAnd although Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred last summer named Nashville as one of six cities the league is considering for future expansion, Loar has not met with him.\n\nIt's not clear whether Nashville could support a baseball team in addition to the Titans, the Predators and an upcoming Major League Soccer franchise. Nashville would need to build a new stadium, fill seats for 81 games per year and find corporate sponsors.\n\nHow it all started\n\nManfred caught Nashville by surprise when he dropped the city's name during a television interview last July at the MLB All-Star Game. He also mentioned Portland, Las Vegas and Charlotte, as well as Montreal and Vancouver in Canada.\n\nI was probably as surprised as anybody to read that coming from the commissioner, said Butch Spyridon, CEO of the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp., but I also would say that means he's been paying attention.\n\nNashville's success in hosting the 2016 NHL All-Star Game and the excitement of tens of thousands of fans flooding Lower Broadway for the 2017 Stanley Cup Final made the sports world take notice.\n\nThen Nashville was awarded the 2019 NFL draft.\n\nIt's a big event city, it's a great sports city when you look what we've been doing the past few years, the history of the Titans and the warm reception for soccer, said Predators CEO Sean Henry.\n\nA real estate developer who also has a background in sports and entertainment business, Loar says he was contracted — a non-disclosure agreement prevents him from saying by whom — in 2017 to analyze several cities as possible locations for a major league franchise. Nashville was one of those cities.\n\nI think Nashville is one of the hottest markets in the country — I'm not the only one saying that — and it's become a tourist destination. There's a reason to come here, he said.\n\nThe Las Vegas model\n\nThe metropolitan area has more than 1.9 million residents, according to 2017 U.S. Census estimates, ranking it 36th in the country. That's larger than Milwaukee, the smallest current MLB market, yet smaller than expansion contenders Portland, Charlotte and Las Vegas.\n\nMusic City has an edge in the television market. The Nielsen Company's fall 2018 numbers rate Nashville as the 27th-largest TV market.\n\nIn 2018, the Nashville Sounds Triple-A team attracted more than 600,000 — an average of 8,741 fans per game — to rank fourth in minor league attendance, according to Ballpark Digest.\n\nWe're proud of what we have accomplished, said Adam Nuse, the Sounds' general manager, but that's at the minor league level. Taking that next step is yet to be seen.\n\nMLB games averaged an attendance of 28,830 last season.\n\nSonny Gray, former Smyrna High and Vanderbilt star who pitches for the New York Yankees, said the city is big enough.\n\nIt has turned into a big city, and people love baseball around here, he said. Nashville has never been more ready for a major league team than it is now.\n\nJudging by how they have embraced the Predators and Titans, a Music City major league team could count on support from newcomers to the area.\n\nI came here from (Washington) D.C. and there's no major league team here, so I'm a (Nationals) fan, said Brian Kelley, a military retiree who moved to Nashville five years ago. I made the switch from the Capitals to the Predators, I made the switch from the Steelers to the Titans. I'm willing to switch.\n\nNashville also attracts about 15 million visitors per year.\n\nThis is one of the top tourist destinations in the country, and you want to tap into that, Loar said. If you're going to continue to build hotels, 81 (home games) a year can help fill those.\n\nLas Vegas has a successful hockey franchise and will add an NFL team in 2020 when the Oakland Raiders relocate. Those teams will rely on high rollers as much as local residents to fill seats. Loar wants to replicate that for baseball in Nashville.\n\nIt's the Las Vegas model, he said, without the gambling.\n\nCan Nashville afford another stadium?\n\nThe city has committed $275 million to build a 30,500-seat stadium at Fairgrounds Nashville for its new soccer team. Metro government spent $91 million in 2015 to build the Sounds' First Tennessee Park — a 10,000-seat stadium that can't be expanded to major league proportions.\n\nMayor David Briley told Loar during a 2018 meeting that no public funds would be available to bring baseball to Nashville.\n\nOur focus remains on our number one priority, getting our MLS team ready, said Thomas Mulgrew, a spokesman for the mayor.\n\nThat doesn't dissuade Loar.\n\nThe how to do that is it needs to be a real estate master plan community development, Loar said.\n\nHis plan includes a stadium and a mixed-use development on property near Nissan Stadium, home of the NFL's Titans. The two stadiums could then share parking lots.\n\nLoar notes a city-commissioned study shows the Titans' stadium needs nearly $300 million in capital improvements. He said spending that much on a facility that hosts eight home games per year along with a similar number of concerts or other events makes for a low return on investment. Baseball's big home schedule would increase traffic to the area.\n\nI think this may be a complementary use where potentially you could benefit in the long term to help the Titans accomplish their objectives, Loar said, and also bring Major League Baseball here and kind of find a way to pay for it using the back end tax revenues that exist.\n\nAn alternative site could be the PSC Metals scrap yard on the East Bank.\n\nThe whole flood plain along the East Bank makes a lot of sense, Spyridon said. There's a lot of real estate. There's a lot of interest. There are people that have compiled acres and acres of land, and then there's that obvious eyesore of the scrap yard.\n\nGov. Bill Lee hasn't met with Loar but supports the idea of bringing another professional sports franchise to the state.\n\nI think when we look at any potential significant employer that's coming into our state and is going to bring economic activity, we would look at incentive packages, he said.\n\nFinding corporate dollars\n\nA stadium needs a corporate sponsor to pay big money for naming rights, but baseball requires much more to thrive.\n\nYou've got to have a lot of big companies that buy 30 and 40 season tickets, said Farrell Owens, who was general manager for the Sounds in their first five seasons.\n\nSpyridon isn't convinced the city's corporate profile is ready for the demands of a baseball franchise.\n\nThat's always been the Achilles' heel for the market, he said. But that's starting to change with AllianceBernstein and Ernst & Young and certainly Amazon. So we're getting stronger, but we've got to have a significant base to support, in particular, for baseball — long season, lot of suite sales and a lot of signage.\n\nHenry thinks there's enough to go around.\n\nI always bristle at that, he said. It's on the teams to make that happen. Whether we're one of the biggest cities or small cities for corporate headquarters is almost secondary: It's your job to reach out and get them to engage with you.\n\nThe Titans wouldn't stand in the way. We have been part of the growth of Nashville as a sports town over the last 20-plus years and we wouldn't put any limits on is ceiling, the Titans said in a statement.\n\nBringing in heavy hitters\n\nThis isn't Loar's first attempt to acquire a major league ball club. In 2012, he worked with Hall of Fame manager Tony La Russa as part of a group's failed bid to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers. Five years later, he was involved with a failed bid to purchase the Miami Marlins.\n\nLoar said the next step is a feasibility study. He also has assembled an advisory board that includes Dave Stewart, a former World Series MVP.\n\nLoar also wants the Music City's entertainment community on board. He can count country star Vince Gill among those who want to see it happen.\n\nI think we're poised for it, said Gill, who played baseball growing up in Oklahoma. The city's on fire. I think it would be a home run.\n\nWe've got football and hockey and soccer. We're as big a city as St. Louis, we're as big a city as Milwaukee and a bunch of cities that have teams, so I don't see why we couldn't.\n\nVanderbilt baseball coach TIm Corbin is also on Loar's advisory board.\n\nThere's a lot of foundations that have to be built in order for it to happen, he said. The size of the city and where it's going, I think in time that's a real possibility.\n\nGrassroots support for baseball\n\nSkip Nipper is secretary of the Nashville Old Timers Baseball Association. He opened the Twitter account @mlb_nashville last April, before the commissioner mentioned the possibility of the big leagues coming to town.\n\nI started it on a whim to see if there was interest, he said. I just did it because I'm a baseball historian and I wanted to see if there was another opportunity to get information out about how important it is for Major League Baseball to come to Nashville.\n\nLoar believes the MLB expansion will come within the next five to seven years. The league says it won't consider adding teams until it solves local stadium issues in Tampa and Oakland, which raises the possibility that either of those franchises could relocate.\n\nWhat I'm hoping to accomplish is to have the people in Nashville and the surrounding communities just take a step back and really try to make in their own minds a determination whether they can envision Major League Baseball here and whether it would be good for the city, he said. If it is, how do we get there?\n\nNipper is skeptical, but he likes the idea.\n\nI hope I live long enough for that, he said.\n\nMANFRED SPEAKS: MLB commissioner names Nashville a potential expansion city\n\nCOLORFUL HISTORY: History of baseball at Sulphur Dell\n\nErik Bacharach, Joseph Garrison, Jamie Munks and Mike Organ contributed to this report.

And why wouldn't we suspect that the scammers would be tapping into all the buzz about the latest round of stimulus cash?\n\nNow, the Federal Trade Commission is warning Americans to be on the lookout for stimulus-related emails that supposedly are being sent by Joseph Simons, the FTC chairman who resigned Jan. 29.\n\nIn the past year, about 324,000 reports relating to COVID-19 and stimulus-related scams and ripoffs have been made to the FTC through Jan. 18. Consumers reported losing $307 million to fraud that plays up the pandemic.\n\nThe latest coronavirus relief scam involves emails that are designed to look as if they're coming from an official government agency, and Simons specifically.\n\nJoe Simons isn't emailing you; it's a scam.\n\nThe email includes a certificate of approval for your stimulus cash.\n\nThe scam demands that you pay taxes upfront to receive the money.\n\nRecently widowed? Here's what you need to know about Social Security survivors benefits\n\nTrying to pay off debt? Here are 4 mistakes to avoid when doing that.\n\nThe FTC noted that sometimes the scam involves a follow-up but fake letter from the IRS to make the deal seem that much more legitimate.\n\nIf you pay, according to an FTC alert, they say you must pay the State Department for a certificate that proves the funds are not related to any terrorist activity and the money is cleared for you to receive. (Yes, really!)\n\nAnd you'll even get some phony paperwork to show that the stimulus money is on its way to your bank account, if you fall for the scam and pay some reported taxes upfront.\n\nRed flags of a stimulus scam\n\nOne red flag: The Economic Impact Payments being sent by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department are not taxable.\n\nAnother red flag: You do not have to pay money upfront via gift cards or anything else to receive the stimulus cash.\n\nAnd yet another red flag: The FTC isn't involved in the stimulus payments in any way.\n\nAgain, the IRS isn't sending out emails, texting or making phone calls about the latest round of stimulus payments, which began being paid out Dec. 30. But scammers can rig up a caller ID to make a phone call look like it's from the IRS or another government agency.\n\nSome reports indicate that text scam might promise that the latest $600 stimulus check will be sent directly to your bank account – only if you click on a link, text back or email your bank account information. Don't do it.\n\nYou can go to IRS.gov/coronavirus for information about stimulus payments.\n\nDon't fall for any scammer who says they know a secret on how to get that stimulus payment by filing a tax return either. The Recovery Rebate Credit is on all 1040 forms and it's not a secret strategy. It's on Line 30.\n\nA variety of scams are likely to crop up and play off the stimulus money. The schemes are crafted to get your cash or your key personal information, such as Social Security account information, bank account numbers or passwords.\n\nYou might see something like a text message that asks for your bank account number so that that the Economic Impact Payment can be directly deposited into your account.

Sam Stebbins and Michael B. Sauter\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nFalling gasoline prices have, at least temporarily, slowed the improvement in the average fuel efficiency of cars Americans choose to buy. Since reaching a peak of 25.8 miles per gallon (mpg) in August of 2014, the average fuel economy of new cars sold in the U.S. market dropped to 25 mpg this past November, according to researchers at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.\n\nMethodology: To identify the cars with the worst gas mileage, 24/7 Wall St. used data on estimated combined city and highway miles per gallon from the EPA. We only reviewed 2015 and 2016 models and used data on the 2016 model when available. We further screened by eliminating any duplicate models, opting for the model and trim with the worst mpg. If multiple trim levels of the same model have the same fuel efficiency, we only looked at one model.\n\n7 States Where Americans Are Moving\n\nManufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) data came from third-party sources, when not available from the manufacturer. The vehicle's specifications came from the EPA's reports. Gas-guzzler data came from the EPA's most recent (2013) report on which vehicles are exempt from the tax and the EPA's overview of the gas-guzzler tax.\n\nThese are the cars with the worst fuel efficiency.\n\n10. Mercedes-Benz, G550\n\n> Miles per gallon: 13.4\n\n> MSRP: $120,825\n\nMercedes-Benz has been building the G550 for 36 years, and chances are the vehicle will celebrate its 40th year anniversary before the automaker decides to move on. For 2016, the SUV got a peppier and more fuel efficient engine. Despite the improvement, it is among the least fuel efficient vehicles on the market, getting an average 13.4 mpg. The G550 weighs 5,724 pounds, and the 4-liter, 416-horsepower engine can push that weight from 0 to 62 mph in 5.9 seconds.\n\n9. Pagani, Huayra Coupe\n\n> Miles per gallon: 13.2\n\n> MSRP: $1.07 million\n\nA boutique carmaker, Pagani has been selling hand-made cars for 14 years at a rate of less than 10 cars per year. The Italian automaker built the first of 100 Huayras in 2013, and even at around $1 million per vehicle, it sold all the cars. The Huayra, which can zip from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.0 seconds, has a top speed is 224 mph. The Coupe version sacrifices efficiency for speed as it gets an average 13.2 mpg.\n\n100 Largest Private Companies\n\n8. Ferrari, F12\n\n> Miles per gallon: 13.1\n\n> MSRP: $490,000\n\nFerrari plans to build only 799 units of the F12tdf. Named to honor the Tour de France auto race of the 1950s and 60s, the special edition was announced in October and sold out in a month. One of the fastest cars ever sold, the F12 accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in a mere 2.7 seconds and sports a 211 mph top speed. Though it gets an average of only 13.1 mpg, it still has better fuel economy than its slightly less expensive cousin, the Ferrari FF.\n\n7. Lamborghini, Veneno Roadster\n\n> Miles per gallon: 12.8\n\n> MSRP: $4.5 million\n\nThose who spend $4.5 million on a single automobile are paying for exclusivity as much as anything else. Lamborghini hand-crafted just nine Veneno roadsters — and all nine are already sold. The company claims a top speed of 221 mph for the Veneno and it accelerates from 0 to 62 mph in just 2.9 seconds.\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\n100 Largest Private Companies\n\n6. Ferrari, FF\n\n> Miles per gallon: 12.8\n\n> MSRP: $302,450\n\nThe EPA rates the FF as a midsize car — in the same class as the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry — because Ferrari offers it in a 4-seater version. Introduced in 2011, the FF of course is a high-end vehicle and one of the most expensive on the U.S. market, with an MSRP of around $300,000. The 12-cylinder engine generates 651 horsepower, and the car goes from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 208 mph.\n\n5. Lamborghini, Aventador Roadster\n\n> Miles per gallon: 12.2\n\n> MSRP: $550,000 (estimated)\n\nLamborghini's supercar Aventador has been in production since the 2012 model year. The 750-4 SV roadster uses a similar V-12 engine to the Veneno, and like the Veneno, the car goes from 0 to 62 mph in just 2.9 seconds with a top speed of 217 mph. The car is slightly less fuel efficient, however, gets an EPA rating of 12.2 mpg combined city and highway.\n\n4. GMC, Savana 2500 2WD Conversion Cargo\n\n> Miles per gallon: 11.9\n\n> MSRP: $32,410\n\nSome of the vehicles on this list are luxury vehicles, with automakers often sacrificing fuel efficiency for performance and luxury. The GMC Savana 2500 2WD is not such a vehicle. The Savana is a work vehicle, offered as a passenger van and as a utility vehicle for hauling cargo. Although a version of the van has been sold for roughly two decades, the years of production have not yielded a more fuel-efficient cargo van. The Savana 2500 gets just 15 mpg on the highway and 10 mpg in the city.\n\n3. Chevrolet, Express 2500 2WD Conversion Cargo\n\n> Miles per gallon: 11.9\n\n> MSRP: $30,550\n\nThe Chevrolet Express is mechanically identical to the GMC Savana — GM sells the same car under different names. Like the Savana, the Express focuses on effectively hauling cargo — at the apparent expense of fuel efficiency. The Express 2500 has 270 cubic feet of cargo space and is rated to haul 8,600 pounds of cargo.\n\n2. Mercedes-Benz, AMG G65\n\n> Miles per gallon: 11.6\n\n> MSRP: $218,825\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz G65 traces its roots back to 1979, when it was designed as an off-road vehicle for military use. Eventually, the car gained tremendous appeal in the civilian consumer market. Since the original car was released, the German automaker has added some creature comforts and tailored the vehicle to the high-end market. Perhaps its roots as primarily a utility vehicle explain its incredibly low fuel efficiency of 11 mpg in the city, and 13 mpg on the highway.\n\nMost Dangerous States to Drive\n\n1. Bugatti, Veyron\n\n> Miles per gallon: 10.4\n\n> MSRP: $2.25 million\n\nBuilt by luxury automaker Bugatti, the Veyron is one of the fastest cars in the world, capable of going from 0 to 60 mph in just 2.4 seconds and has a top speed of 254.04 mph. That is what a 16-cylinder, quad-turbocharged engine that generates 1,200-horsepower can achieve. Speed, however, does not typically translate into efficiency. The car gets just 10.4 mpg combined combined fuel economy. After marking its 10-year anniversary this year, production of the Veyron ceased, with a final production run of 450.\n\nSee the rest of the top 20 cars with the worst mileage:\n\nCars With the Worst Gas Mileage\n\nMore on the cars with the worst gas mileage\n\nThe recent Volkswagen TDI scandal — in which it came to light that the German manufacturer intentionally misrepresented the fuel efficiency of its diesel vehicles — highlights the importance of fuel efficiency to Americans, even in times like now, as gas prices are at a multi-year low. Much of the decrease in overall fuel economy is attributable to higher sales of pickup trucks and SUVs, cars that burn more fuel than smaller, lighter vehicles. Other extremely low efficiency luxury models continue to reach high-end buyers as well. The Bugatti Veyron gets roughly 15 miles per gallon on the highway and 8 miles per gallon in the city. Based on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 20 cars with the worst gas mileage sold in the U.S.\n\nThe manufacturers or importers of most vehicles with a fuel economy below 22.5 mpg are assessed a gas-guzzler tax. Pickup trucks and SUVs are exempt from the tax because of a concern on the impact such a tax would have on farmers and construction companies.\n\nIf a car is considered a gas-guzzler when getting less than 22.5 mpg, a car getting less than 15 mpg certainly has to offer buyers extra special features to justify the lost fuel efficiency. In the majority of cases, what is being offered is extreme luxury or performance or both.\n\nOf the 20 cars with the worst fuel efficiency, 14 cost at least $100,000, and four cost at least $500,000. Included on this list of low-efficiency vehicles are so-called hypercars such as the Lamborghini Aventador and the Ferrari FF. These vehicles are built to achieve peak speed and acceleration. Fuel efficiency is an afterthought.\n\nThe remainder of the cars with the worst fuel efficiency are built on light truck frames. Two are SUVs, two are large vans, and two are pickups. In all six cases, potential owners must choose to sacrifice fuel efficiency in order to gain utility.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Sid Mohasseb\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThe Gamestop debacle this week has reminded us of Biden's most important mission: to fix capitalism, and make it work for Main Street as well as Wall Street.\n\nBy doing this he can connect with two opposing camps and become a President for all Americans: on one side he has the social justice wing of the Democrats, and on the other the Rust Belt Trump supporters. Both groups — in the Black Lives Matter protests and the storming of the Capitol respectively — have shown their willingness to engage in civil disobedience, or worse.\n\nBut both groups ultimately want the same thing: the return of the American Dream and the restoration of true capitalism, rather than the elitism that has become entrenched in the US. If Biden really wants to heal and unify America, he must restore it to what it used to be: A nation of innovators, who are all given a fair shot. An economy built not on trickle-down but bubble-up.\n\nDisease of lack of opportunity\n\nThe symptom may be anger, but the disease is lack of opportunity.\n\nSocial justice activists ask for dismantling the system and claim that those who benefit from the current system are the privileged. Although this may be symbolized by race or gender, the ultimate form of privilege and power is economics. The same is true of the far-right / QAnon groups. Although their anger may be directed against globalists, globalization is only a negative because it isn't working for them.\n\nIt's easy to see why they are angry. 90% of the children born in 1940 ended up in higher ranks of the income distribution than their parents, while only 40% of those born in 1980 have managed to do so. The average Americans' purchasing power has not budged in 40 years.\n\nMaking America great again should not be about trade wars, blind nationalism, or creating short-term jobs in outdated industries. Neither should it be about starving police - the guardians of an inequitable order - of funds, or creating chaos on the streets.\n\nWhat we need is to give everyone an equal opportunity to prosper. That is difficult when launching a quintessentially American mom-and-pop enterprise means competing with the likes of Walmart and Amazon. While big business is propped up by government policies, the mom-and-pop businesses are dying almost as quickly as their founders.\n\nIn 2015, Americans were far less likely to start a company than they were in the 1980s. Business collapse now outnumbers business birth for the first time since records began in the late 1970's — even though people have more tools to start and grow a business.\n\nThe profit motives that triggered globalization have critically wounded America's car production sector, displacing a whole demographic of rust-belt, blue collar workers. The average white family wealth is almost eight times that of minorities. They all want to live in an America where hard work, innovation and grit is enough to ascend the social ladder.\n\nBiden and American unity:Let's get real. Joe Biden, Democrats and America need results much more than unity.\n\nBut while America has stayed true to its roots of defying socialism, over the years under the umbrella of trickle-down economics, we have practiced it. We have let the big corporations grow bigger and then give the money - through jobs - to the masses, rather than let individuals create their own jobs through entrepreneurship.\n\nWhile the responsibility for mass economic prosperity was shifted to big corporations, their focus remained on profits and stock prices.\n\nThe cracks in the system have become even clearer in the past year — the GameStop debacle is just the clearest crack of them all.\n\nWhile the stock market has skyrocketed and individuals like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have grown their wealth by billions, poverty and joblessness has impacted millions — all while Silicon Valley has had one of its highest investment years ever.\n\nBiden has to kill the notion that innovation and its benefits are reserved for the Silicon Valley investors and take away the privilege big corporates and wealthy individuals have enjoyed as gatekeepers in charge of the trickling down of prosperity.\n\nAmerica — on the vocal left, the radical right and the silent middle — does not need handouts. It wants a helping hand up towards self-sufficiency.\n\nBiden must allow the American power of entrepreneurship to flourish\n\nBiden must put America first by unleashing its power of entrepreneurship and give true capitalism a fighting chance by using tax policies to provide incentives to small businesses who re-tool, retrain and automate.\n\nHe can fund this by plugging the tax loopholes for big players, and by incentivizing them to become 'entrepreneurial philanthropists' (eg. by giving grants to small businesses)\n\nRather than talking about forgiving student loans, let's find ways for young educated entrepreneurs to turn that debt into investments for new businesses.\n\nBiden:Will America buy into Joe Biden's plans for unity? Don't get your hopes up.\n\nLet's incentivize early-stage investors to transition from Silicon Valley type deals to more localized small businesses.\n\nLet's give banks and credit card companies incentives to shift funding to smaller companies, with possibly riskier profiles.\n\nLet's re-vitalize the funding provided by the likes of the Small Business Aadministration, Defense Advanced Research Pprojects Agency, the National Science Foundation and more.\n\nLet's stop delegating America's future to Wall Street and let's once again bet on Main Street. It's time to turn up the heat on the bubble-up economy and let it boil.\n\nSid Mohasseb is adjunct professor in dynamic data-driven strategy at the University of Southern California and is the former national strategic innovation leader for strategy at KPMG.

Evan Comen\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nGas prices fluctuate wildly in the United States. Many factors can cause price swings, from seasonal conditions, global market trends, an announcement from a nation's oil industry, to the development of a new extraction technology. Taxes are perhaps the least volatile aspect of gasoline prices, yet gas taxes vary between U.S. regions and largely account for the price differences between states.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the combined state and average local gas taxes per gallon in each state from estimates provided by the American Petroleum Institute (API). Pennsylvania leads the nation with a gas tax of 50.4 cents per gallon. In Alaska, the average gallon of gas is taxed at just 12.3 cents, the lowest in the nation.\n\nMichael Green, a spokesman for the American Automobile Association (AAA), explained that beyond the federal fuel tax, which is levied uniformly across the nation, states have free reign to determine how they will fund transportation projects within their states. Green added, It often comes down to local and state politics. For this reason, taxes vary considerably across the country.\n\nStates With the Highest (and Lowest) Gas Taxes\n\nIn the states with the highest gas taxes, the price of gasoline tends to be high even when taxes are excluded from the overall cost, while the opposite tends to be true in low gas tax states.\n\nThis is largely due to the proximity of oil refineries. In the Southeast, for example, where state governments levy low taxes on gas and drivers pay low gas prices, there is an abundant supply of oil. Texas and Louisiana are home to 27 and 19 petroleum refineries, respectively — the most and second most nationwide. Such states are also subject to fewer supplementary costs associated with the fuel, such as transportation costs or price spikes brought on by local supply shortages.\n\nTo fund roads and other transportation infrastructure, states with numerous oil refineries can often extract tax revenue from the production side of petroleum and spare consumers at the pump by charging relatively low retail gas taxes.\n\nFor states in the Northeast, by contrast, most fuel arrives by pipeline from the U.S. Gulf Coast. The transportation costs add to the overall price of gasoline. In addition, since many of these states do not have any refineries, there is also no opportunity to tax fuel at the production stage. Northeastern states, therefore, may levy relatively high gas taxes in order to make up for the lack of other sources of revenue.\n\nThe federal gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon and has remained unchanged since 1993. For the most part, revenues from gasoline sales are reinvested in transportation infrastructure. According to Green, however, States do not receive enough money from the federal government for transportation, and have enacted state fuel taxes as a means to supplement their funding needs. Almost all state gas tax rates match or exceed the federal tax rate, and in some cases double it.\n\nThe Richest County in Each State\n\nGas taxes are also largely determined by local politics, which often parallels the general attitudes towards taxation within a given state. Often the highest taxes are in the Northeast and West Coast, whereas the lowest taxes are in the Southeast and the Central United States, Green said. New York, California, and Connecticut — states with traditionally high income and real estate taxes — also have among the highest gas tax rates.\n\nLike the federal gas tax, state gas taxes rarely change — and when they do, the changes are relatively modest. In the 15 years ending in 2014, 21 states made no changes whatsoever to their tax rates. Over the same period, only five states increased the rate by more than 5 cents per gallon.\n\nGas taxes, and the overall price of gas, can impact driving behavior. In six of the 10 states with the costliest gas, vehicle miles traveled per capita are also among the 10 lowest in the country.\n\nWhile driving behavior varies with transportation costs across states, Americans as a whole are driving more. Since the 1970s, the amount of miles the average American traveled has increased from an estimated 5,556 a year to 9,659 miles last year — the highest vehicle miles traveled per capita in history.\n\nTo identify the states with the highest and lowest gas taxes, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state and average local gas taxes from the American Petroleum Institute (API). Average gas prices as of January 29, 2016 for each state came from AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report. The number of operating oil refineries in each state came from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). We also reviewed average annual vehicle miles travelled in each state from the Federal Highway Administration (FHA). The number of licensed drivers in each state also came from the FHA. All data are as of the most recent period available.\n\nSTATES WITH THE LOWEST GAS TAX\n\n1.

LONDON — A ban on environmentally damaging microbeads found in toothpastes, face scrubs and shower gels came into effect Tuesday in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe moves prevents manufacturers of cosmetics and personal-care items from adding the small pieces of plastic to their products. They often end up in the ocean after being washed down the drain, damaging marine plant and animal life.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama signed a U.S. ban on microbeads into law in late 2015.\n\nMicrobeads are also a potential hazard to human health: Scientists believe some fish in lakes may soak up the toxins they release, which can then be passed back to people who consume the fish. These toxins can disrupt hormone levels and cause cancer.\n\nThe world's seas and oceans are some of our most valuable natural assets and I am determined we act now to tackle the plastic that devastates our precious marine life, the U.K.'s Environment Minister Therese Coffey said in a statement.\n\nMicrobeads are entirely unnecessary when there are so many natural alternatives available, and I am delighted that from today cosmetics manufacturers will no longer be able to add this harmful plastic to their rinse-off products, she added.\n\nMore:'Beautiful' and 'horrible': Microplastics are polluting Lake Winnebago's fish\n\nMicrobeads an irritation in N.Y., Jersey waters\n\nLast week, British parliamentarians called on the government to introduce a special tax — the so-called latte levy — on disposable coffee cups. Britons throw away about 2.5 billion of them each year, according to a study by Cardiff University.\n\nAnd two years ago, Britain introduced a law requiring all large stores to charge 5 pence, about 7 U.S. cents, for all single-use plastic bags.\n\nThe United Nations has called for specific international goals to reduce plastic waste in oceans. It has faced opposition from the U.S. and China.
Imagine seeing a tax form pop up in the mail which indicates that you need to claim an extra $5,000 or more in taxable income on your federal income tax return. And you never, ever saw a dime of that money?\n\nBut now, are you supposed to pay taxes on it? Whoa, what's that about?\n\nWe're looking at a shocking tax time headache for potentially millions of victims of ID theft nationwide. They really don't owe extra taxes but they will spend extra time trying to clear up a mess triggered by widespread phony unemployment claims in 2020 in order to file their federal 1040 tax return.\n\nRobert Pennock was surprised to see a 1099-G show up that reports $5,772 in taxable income. That's money, allegedly, that he received in state unemployment benefits through the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency in 2020.\n\nIf he received unemployment benefits, it would be taxable income. But he was not laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic. He did not face any furlough. He never applied and never received state unemployment benefits.\n\nPennock works as a reading specialist for Hulsing Elementary School in Canton, Michigan. He teaches students from kindergarten through the fifth grade.\n\nHe did get a couple of clues in the summer that something was up. The human resources office for the Plymouth-Canton Community Schools spotted that unemployment claims were being made in his name in June.\n\nHe confirmed with HR that he did not file for unemployment. He's thankful that his employer is trying to help him work out the mess.\n\nHe said he immediately went to the Michigan unemployment insurance website and filed both fraud and identity theft claims.\n\nIt appeared to him, he said, that those jobless claims were not paid out since he received letters in the mail that his unemployment claim was denied for various reasons.\n\nAnd I figured that would be the end of that, said Pennock, 55, who lives in Plymouth Township, Michigan.\n\nIt wasn't. He received the 1099 form in the mail around Jan. 22.\n\nWhy am I getting a 1099 form for jobless benefits?\n\nThe State of Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity is including a letter with the1099-G forms that it is mailing out now to address identity theft.\n\nIf you have received a Form 1099-G and you have not filed for or collected unemployment benefits in 2020, you may be a victim of identity theft, the letter states.\n\nThe letter then details some steps to take, including reporting the fraud by filing a Form UIA 6349, Statement of Identity Theft. Michigan taxpayers would go to michigan.gov/uia and click on Report Identity Theft.\n\nPennock, whose wife Pamela typically prepares their tax returns by using tax software, is researching what he needs to do next. He's also contacted the office of his state rep in Lansing, 20th District State Rep. Matt Koleszar.\n\nPennock's mother just passed away at age 89 last week, the same week he got the troubling 1099. He had only been able to visit her once in the past year in Ohio during the pandemic.\n\nMy mother used to say it will all work out in the wash, he told me Tuesday. And I'm sure it will.\n\nOn Thursday morning, he had more hope that his mother's words could come true.\n\nGood news, Pennock emailed me. Thanks to Rep Kolezcar, someone from the UIA just called me. They are sending a corrected 1099 and directed me to Form 6349, available on the UIA website, which I am to complete and return. The form is titled 'Statement of Identity Theft.'\n\nHe's not angry with the state Unemployment Insurance Agency, as he knows how swamped people who work there must be.\n\nMy anger lies with the people who are taking advantage and stealing money from people.\n\nMassive jobless fraud sweeps the country\n\nAll across the country, including Michigan, professional crime rings used stolen ID information to file fraudulent unemployment claims in 2020.\n\nThe problem is that if your information was used to file phony jobless claims, the state could soon issue you a Form 1099-G, Certain Government Payments, issued in your name. Unemployment benefits are to be included in taxable income that goes on Schedule 1, Line 7 of a 1040 return.\n\nExperts say you can't just ignore this 1099, as this is income that has already been submitted to the Internal Revenue Service. The incorrect 1099 might create extra headaches and delays when it comes to getting any tax refund.\n\nIdeally, you want the state Unemployment Insurance Agency to issue you a corrected 1099-G to both you and the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS notes in its own publications that you want to contact whoever issued the 1099 if it is not correct.\n\nIf you still haven't received the corrected 1099 form by the end of February, the IRS said, you may call the IRS at 800-829-1040 for assistance.\n\nBut, realistically, how long might that take? Will you receive a corrected form or an answer from the IRS in time to meet the April 15 tax filing deadline? How long would you have to wait for any tax refund that you're owed?\n\nRemember, the IRS will not even begin processing tax returns until Feb. 12. That's slightly more than two weeks later than last year.\n\nLynda Robinson, a spokesperson for Michigan's Unemployment Insurance Agency, said the state is currently not able to determine the number of people who are victims of ID theft.\n\nYet she noted that since March 15, 2020, the UIA has received more than 230,000 reports related to identity theft. Each case must be reviewed individually, she said.\n\nShe did not have a timetable for how long it might take for the state to issue a corrected 1099 so that people can file their taxes.\n\nUIA is working as quickly as it can to manually investigate each fraud referral, Robinson said.\n\nThere will be delays in getting a corrected 1099-G Form, she added.\n\nIf taxpayers receive a 1099-G because of a fraudulent claim and have not yet received a corrected 1099-G, she said the guidance from the IRS indicates that the taxpayer should not report the income from that 1099-G on a tax return.\n\nInstead, she said, the taxpayer should attach an explanation to the tax return explaining the discrepancy.\n\nThe IRS website has a guide on identity theft. See IRS.gov/identitytheft.\n\nLocal retiree questions what to do with 1099\n\nNow I have a 1099 that says it's for $4,880, said Karol Settergren, a retired high school counselor.\n\nTaking a close look at the 1099, she said, it shows that withholdings of $488 for federal income taxes and $270.40 for the state.\n\nIt has my Social Security number on here, she said.\n\nNow, I'm just concerned what happens when I go to file my taxes.\n\nSettergren, 73, did not file for unemployment benefits in 2020.\n\nShe remembers that she did get some paperwork in the summer that said she was denied her claim for unemployment benefits because she didn't provide enough identification. She did not keep that letter.\n\nAgain, though, she did not expect a problem since she received information saying the claim was reportedly denied.\n\nIt's just another thing to deal with, she said. It seems like everything is going wrong in this year of COVID-19.\n\nLast year, a large-scale imposter scheme hit state unemployment systems across the country. Many times, the crooks filed claims for people who didn't lose jobs, such as school teachers, retirees and even some small business owners.\n\nOn Monday, California officials confirmed that the state paid out more than $11 billion in unemployment claims relating to fraud during the pandemic, according to The Hill.\n\nAn independent report in November indicated that Michigan might have at one point through late May paid out up to $1.5 billion to such fraud.\n\nCon artists found phony jobless claims attractive and a way to steal generous jobless benefits of up to $1,000 a week offered in many states early during the pandemic.\n\nIn March, Congress passed the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act, which included a $600 supplemental federal unemployment benefit and offered benefits to workers who normally wouldn't qualify for state benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.\n\nThe crooks were very successful. It was estimated that at least $36 billion could have been scammed out of the system nationwide, according to the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Labor.\n\nTax professionals scramble\n\nGeorge W. Smith, a CPA with Andrews Hooper Pavlik in Southfield, Michigan, said he's looking at a 1099 for one client that reports $5,290 in state jobless benefits from the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency. Again, money that the taxpayer never received because no jobless claim was made.\n\nSmith's strategy is a bit of a judgment call – and one that isn't suggested by everyone. But he's going to try something different if a corrected 1099 doesn't arrive in time to file a return by April 15.\n\nSince there is a 1099-G out there, he said, he might report the income if a corrected 1099 doesn't show up.\n\nThe IRS computers will not be able to differentiate between what is legitimate and what is not, Smith said.\n\nHe would declare the 1099-G income on Schedule 1, line 7, Unemployment Compensation, on the 1040 federal tax return. But Smith said he will take a second step to make sure that his client isn't paying taxes on money that was never received in the first place.\n\nThen I am going to report it as negative income on Schedule 1, line 8 – Other Income, Smith said.\n\nThat way it nets out to zero taxable income on their return, Smith said. I am hopeful this will work. He also plans to attach a disclosure to the return explaining the situation.\n\nSmith said he wants his client to make sure that all documentation is in place to report the fraud and back up the claim that these fraudulent benefits aren't taxable, should the IRS challenge his reporting approach.\n\nEven so, your first step when you receive one of these letters has to be to contact the issuer of the 1099-G, usually the state unemployment office, and inform them of the fraud and ask for a corrected 1099-G, according to Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting.\n\nLuscombe said you do not want to include the amount on the 1099-G on your tax return if it was fraudulent.\n\nHopefully, you can get the state unemployment agency to correct the 1099-G and file a corrected version with the IRS, but if not, attach a statement to your tax return that the 1099-G was a response to a fraudulent application that you are trying to get corrected and you did not apply for and did not receive any unemployment benefits, Luscombe said.\n\nYes, expect more headaches, too.\n\nState unemployment offices have been overwhelmed with valid requests for unemployment benefits as well as fraudulent ones, so their response may take a while, Luscombe said.\n\nHe would not be surprised if it could take several months for some to resolve these issues.\n\nThe State of Michigan warns of potential delays in its letter: Please be patient. The rampant imposter fraud and identity theft across the country requires that UIA individually review each claim of suspected fraud. If you have already provided information to the UIA, there is no need to resubmit information unless asked by UIA.\n\nThe Michigan UIA will investigate a report of identity theft. Once identity theft is confirmed, UIA will issue a corrected 1099-G to both you and the Internal Revenue Service, according to the state's letter.\n\nStates across the country are issuing these 1099s to fraud victims and alerting the victims on what to do next.\n\nThe State of Washington, for example, notes on its website: When criminals fraudulently claim benefits in someone else's name, we must investigate and confirm fraud before we can update the IRS.\n\nColorado has a form online to report an invalid 1099 for its ID theft victims.\n\nLuscombe said ID theft victims can expect that they will be asked for some documentation, such as verifying that you are still employed with your employer.\n\nYou also want to document all the steps you have taken to correct the fraud and the names and dates involved when you reported the ID theft. You may want to contact your local police department to document the fraud.\n\nIf you have a valid claim for unemployment benefits in addition to the fraudulent claim having been filed, the fraud process could also hold up your valid claim for benefits, Luscombe said.\n\nYou'd want proof that you are a victim of ID theft and that the benefits should not be taxed because a scammer received the money, not you.\n\nMore:How scammers siphoned $36B in fraudulent unemployment payments from US\n\nMore:How scammers are using unemployment claims to cash in\n\nMore:Lost a job? How to pay taxes on unemployment benefits\n\nMore:Tax season 2021: How to get a bigger, quicker tax refund\n\nThe strange 1099 means you must try to limit future ID theft, too.\n\nID theft victims are encouraged to file a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which is monitoring unemployment benefits fraud on a nationwide basis. Go to IdentityTheft.gov. A special tab on the right corner directs you to claims about unemployment benefits identity theft.\n\nTake time to check your free credit report at AnnualCreditReport.com to see if there is evidence of other fraudulent activity, perhaps credit cards that are opened in your name by crooks.\n\nThe IRS notes that you can place a free one-year fraud alert on your credit reports by contacting any one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies online or through their toll-free numbers. The bureau you contact must tell the other two. Call Equifax at 800-525-6285. Experian: 888-397-3742. And TransUnion: 800-680-7289.\n\nExperts say you might request a fraud alert or credit freeze from the three credit reporting agencies. If you opt for a credit freeze, you would have to have the freeze lifted if you need to take out a loan or apply for credit yourself.\n\nWhatever you do, don't just toss this 1099-G in the trash. It's better to try to deal with this problem sooner, rather than later.
Sean Williams\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nYour credit report and credit score can open doors you may never have imagined they could.\n\nAs most people know, an excellent credit report and a high credit score will afford you ample choices when you're shopping for a home loan at an attractive interest rate. But they can do so much more, too. Your credit report could also help you nab the job of your dreams, or get auto or home insurance at a lower premium than the average American. A pristine credit report could also mean little or no deposit when opening an account with a utility company.\n\nHowever, the flip side of this is also true. If you don't take the time to manage your credit wisely, then doors of opportunity can be closed. Prospective employers could deny your application based on the impression that you're not a responsible individual, and lenders could deny you for home loans. Rental applications may be denied due to your poor credit history, or you may be required to put down an exceptionally high deposit with utility companies prior to commencing service.\n\nYou could be hurting your credit score without even knowing it\n\nI'd venture to guess that most Americans are somewhat familiar with the basic factors that can impact their credit scores. For instance, if you pay your bills on time, your credit score will probably climb. Conversely, if you're late with your payments or have collections on your credit report, then your score is going to take a hit.\n\nBut there are other shocking ways that your credit score can be harmed through seemingly benign activities. Here are seven ways you could be hurting your credit score without even realizing it.\n\n1. Closing unused accounts\n\nOne of the easiest ways to hurt your credit score without realizing it is to close credit accounts that you rarely use. You may be thinking that closing unused accounts could earn you brownie points with creditors by demonstrating that you're being responsible. However, closing unused credit accounts actually hurts your credit score in two ways.\n\nFirst, closing long-standing accounts may reduce the average length of time that your credit accounts have been open. The longer your average account has been open, the higher your credit score, generally speaking. If you wind up closing long-tenured, good-standing accounts because you're not using them much, you're wiping out the benefit of having that account open and in good standing for a long period of time.\n\nSecondly, closing an account means reducing your available aggregate credit amount. Reducing your available credit causes your credit utilization ratio to rise. Anything above 30% aggregate usage could lower your credit score.\n\n2. Not checking your credit report\n\nAccording to a Google Consumer Survey conducted by TransUnion in 2013, 33% of Americans admitted to never checking their credit reports or credit scores. Ignorance is unfortunately not bliss in this instance, because it's quite possible for errors to appear on your credit report from one or more of the three major credit reporting bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax). Not checking your credit report annually could allow these errors to remain on your report without your knowledge, dragging down your credit score in the process.\n\nHere's the good news: You can check your credit report from all three credit bureaus once annually for free. That's right, I did just say free. To check your credit report for free, head to AnnualCreditReport.com.\n\n3. Using more than 30% of your available credit (even if you pay your bill in full)\n\nEven if you're responsible and pay your bills on time each month, you could be negatively impacting your credit score if you're using too much of your available credit. Industry pundits suggest that you never use more than 30% of your available credit. Using more could be construed by creditors as irresponsible, and it may lower your credit score.\n\nEven if you pay your bills in full each month, it's still possible (and I can speak firsthand on this) to hurt your credit score by going over the 30% credit utilization threshold. The good news is that the dip in your credit score is probably temporary if you're paying your bill in full and on time each month, or at least getting your net balance owed below 30% of your aggregate available credit. However, the timing of when a credit report is run could certainly have some bearing on whether your credit score takes a hit or not.\n\n4. Ignoring traffic and parking citations\n\nChances are that if you receive a traffic citation or parking ticket near your home city, you're going to take care of it. That may not always be the case if you're vacationing 2,000 miles away and receive a parking ticket. If you ignore traffic or parking citations, they could be turned over to a collection agency, where they could pop up on your credit report and remain there for a period of between three and seven years.\n\nIgnorance to a citation won't excuse you, either. If the government agency mails your citation to an old address and you fail to pay, the fault remains with you. Make sure the U.S. Post Office has your most recent address on file and your driver's license is up to date.\n\n5. Unpaid utility bills\n\nUtility bills, such as an electric bill or water bill, can be something of a double-edged sword for consumers. On one hand, it's highly unlikely that utility companies will report timely payments to credit bureaus that'll determine your credit score.\n\nOn the flip side, if you're habitually late with your payment, or you have unpaid utility bills, then the utility may not hesitate to turn your account over to a collection agency. Having an account sent to a collection agency can show up on your credit report for years, and it can adversely impact your credit score.\n\n6. Unpaid federal income taxes\n\nBelieve it or not, tax disagreements between you and Uncle Sam could come back to haunt you in the credit column. If you have unpaid federal income taxes, the government, after enough time and effort to collect what's due, could place a lien on your property or wages to collect what you owe.\n\nFederal tax liens can show up on your credit report for a mind-numbing 15 years, meaning they could wind up wreaking havoc on your ability to open new credit accounts for more than a decade to come. Even paid federal tax liens remain on your credit report for a period of seven years from the file date.\n\n7. Fines from a library\n\nWhile this may be a bit of a stretch, and I'll admit it sounds almost comical, checking out books from the library and failing to return them on time could wind up negatively impacting your credit score. If you rack up late fees at the library and fail to pay those fees, it's possible – unlikely, but possible – that the library could turn your late fee over to a collection agency.\n\nFor example, in 1996, the Queens Library system in New York hired a professional collection agency to collect the daily late fines, as well as the missing materials that consumers didn't return. Having a library fine sent to collections could result in an almost laughably low fine, but it could have an impact on your credit report and/or credit score for years.\n\nSean Williams has no material interest in any companies mentioned in this article.

From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nJasper: Police are looking for a man who disguised himself as Batman while stealing musical instruments from churches. A burglary happened Dec. 11 at King's Way Church in Irondale, AL.com reports. The caped crook stole a keyboard and a guitar, according to Irondale Detective Sgt. Michael Mangina. The suspect came back to the same church Jan. 6 and stole two more guitars. Both times the impostor used a rock to enter the church, Mangina said. On Jan. 9, two churches in Jasper and one in unincorporated Walker County were also burglarized, Jasper police wrote on Facebook. Musical instruments and electronics were also stolen. Anyone with information can call Irondale police, Jasper police or the Walker County Sheriff's Office. We have to take this bad guy off the streets, Mangina said. Stealing from a church is not the way to get to heaven.\n\nAlaska\n\nSkwentna: Weeks after a man's remote cabin burned down, he was rescued by Alaska State Troopers who found him by a makeshift shelter with an SOS signal stamped in the snow. Tyson Steele, 30, was picked up Thursday in what appeared to be good health at his remote homestead 20 miles outside Skwentna, troopers said in a dispatch. A mid-December fire had killed his dog and left Steele with no means of communication, Steele told troopers. After his family members and friends hadn't heard from him for several weeks, they requested a welfare check. The trooper helicopter crew reached the homestead about 11 a.m. and saw Steele waving his arms near the makeshift shelter. Skwentna, with a population of 35, is 70 miles northwest of Anchorage. The trooper helicopter transported Steele to Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The force was strong enough at a local store to reunite Luke Skywalker with his long-lost vinyl record. Actor Mark Hamill is praising workers at Bookmans Entertainment Exchange for returning the Star Wars: A New Hope soundtrack that had been a gift from film composer John Williams. Hamill tweeted that it felt totally unexpected & positively surreal to get back the record he hadn't seen since the early 1990s. He commended the store for being honest and not selling it. Williams had written on the vinyl's sleeve: Dear Mark Hamill, May the force always be with us. The record was one of numerous Star Wars items brought in by a woman after her father's death in 2018. Micheil Salmons, the store's general manager, said Hamill signed a DVD of Star Wars: A New Hope and two medals that are replicas of those given to his character and Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, in the film.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Republican governor on Monday defended his decision to continue accepting new refugees, challenging skeptical GOP lawmakers to avoid creating fear about welcoming people from other countries. Gov. Asa Hutchinson told a legislative committee that fewer than 50 refugees will likely be resettled in Washington County in northwestern Arkansas under his decision. Arkansas is among 42 states that have said they will continue to accept refugees since the Trump administration issued an order in September that gave state and local governments the authority to refuse to accept them for the first time in history. Each of you are leaders in your community. You've got a choice to make: You can create fear, or you can help resolve fear, Hutchinson told lawmakers. He introduced them to two refugees from Congo and another from Afghanistan who have resettled to Arkansas in recent years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed adding a California butterfly to the list of threatened species, officials say. The agency wants the Hermes copper butterfly added to the list in recognition of the threats it faces in its home region of San Diego County, The San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The service filed its proposal Jan. 8, estimating it will take a year to finalize the listing and draw up critical habitat plans for the butterfly. A public comment period for the listing is expected to run through March 9. The Hermes copper lives only in Mexico's Baja California and California's San Diego County, which has a high concentration of endangered species, federal wildlife officials say. The butterfly is among a suite of local species suffering from urban sprawl and wildfires that have altered the landscape in recent decades, officials say.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The state Department of Public Safety announced Monday that it will scale back proactive investigation of mysterious drone sightings that have perplexed residents since late last year. The department has confirmed no incidents of criminal activity, and investigations have not substantiated reports of suspicious or illegal drone activity, according to a report released Monday. Beginning before the holidays, the drones – which were initially spotted traveling in grid-like formations – were reported to be seen flying at high altitudes from about 7 to 10 p.m. in northeastern Colorado, as well as in southwestern Nebraska, according to the Denver Post. The FAA, 25 other government agencies and private companies, including Amazon, claimed to know nothing about the initial sightings in northeastern Colorado, according to a list compiled by 9News.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city planned to mark the birthdate of the nation's most famous traitor, Benedict Arnold, by turning off the Christmas lights at City Hall on Tuesday. Regan Miner, the executive director of the Norwich Historical Society, said the event serves as a tongue-in-cheek way to mark the 279th anniversary of Arnold's birth. Danye Rugh was to deliver a lecture after the lights were turned out, accompanied by period-themed cocktails and food. The son of Norwich was born in 1741 and fought for the Continental Army before wounding his leg in the Battle of Saratoga. The region handles Arnold's legacy in different ways. In New London, Arnold's body is burned in effigy, and a replica of his leg is placed in a coffin and sent to Norwich.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The First State's roads are still some of the nation's most deadly. After some improvement a year ago, the state's number of traffic deaths grew from 111 in 2018 to 132 last year, a rise of about 19%, according to the Office of Highway Safety. The number of pedestrian deaths rose from 24 to 30, returning Delaware to among the nation's leaders. There's no silver bullet to solve this, says John McNeal, chairman of the state's Pedestrian Council. Education campaigns and some road improvement projects have been implemented since 2015, when Delaware ranked as the most deadly state for pedestrians. But officials acknowledge the efforts haven't been enough and say more needs to be done. Two weeks into 2020, at least three pedestrians have died in crashes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Unsafe and filthy conditions at Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority parking garages have prompted changes in how the structures are cleaned. Feces, bottles of urine, used condoms, overflowing trash and other unsanitary conditions were found at several Metrorail station garages, the transit authority's Office of the Inspector General said in a summary of its report. The transit authority spent $2.2 million on contracted cleaning services, according to the inspector general. The audit found the employees weren't doing their job properly 84% of the time. The Metro system took action immediately and began pressure-washing efforts after learning of the inspector general's findings, spokeswoman Sherri Ly said in a statement, according to news outlets. The agency also plans to phase out contractors in favor of hiring custodial workers in-house, according to the statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: In his State of the State address Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis called for teacher raises, the eradication of Burmese pythons in the Everglades, and a new law to force girls to get their parents' permission before getting an abortion. DeSantis said keeping taxes low, improving education and protecting the environment will help Florida continue to grow. The speech marked the opening of the Legislature's annual 60-day session. He spoke in the House chamber, where lawmakers desks' were covered in flowers. Members of the Supreme Court and the state's three Cabinet members also attended the address. While touting a boost in adoption, DeSantis told lawmakers he wants them to pass a bill that would require girls under the age of 18 get their parents' permission to get an abortion. The state already requires girls' parents be notified if they have an abortion.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: An endangered newborn right whale spotted with grievous injuries to its head off the state's coast is unlikely to survive, though scientists may try to inject the calf with antibiotics using a syringe fired from an air gun if they can safely get close enough, government experts said Monday. Foggy weather along the coast was delaying efforts to relocate the wounded baby whale and its mother by plane. The calf was first seen from the air last Wednesday, and a boat crew got close enough Friday near St. Simons Island for scientists to conclude its injuries were worse than initially feared. Scientists estimate 400 or fewer North Atlantic right whales still exist. Dr. Teri Rowles, a veterinarian for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said the wounds were likely caused by the propeller of a boat.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: This tropical state is getting its first Olive Garden. A popular Honolulu bar and restaurant will close and be replaced by a new outlet of one of the nation's biggest restaurant chains, officials say. The Mai Tai Bar and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. at Ala Moana Center, the state's largest mall, are slated to close next month, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Bubba Gump Chief Operations Officer Jim DuFault said the closure is the result of a rental dispute, and Bubba Gump is prepared to file a lawsuit if the landlord or a future tenant attempts to steal our Mai Tai intellectual property. Olive Garden filed a $50,000 building permit for the mall location. The Italian-American restaurant chain, owned by Darden Restaurants Inc., is coming to Hawaii after years of television commercials running in the state.\n\nIdaho\n\nGrangeville: The screen of a 65-year-old drive-in movie theater was destroyed by high winds, and the owner says he hopes to rebuild – if he can find someone who can do the specialized work. Chris Wagner, owner of Sunset Auto Vue drive-in theater in Grangeville, told The Lewiston Tribune the screen has only been damaged by winds twice since it was built in 1955. The first time, in 2007, he rebuilt with a modern design that was intended to withstand wind gusts up to 110 mph. But last week, high winds estimated by the National Weather Service at about 60 mph flattened the 32-by-72-foot outdoor screen, leaving behind a mass of twisted metal. I'll be making a call to the manufacturer, but he was 75 years old when he showed up the last time (in 2007) to do it, Wagner said. There are only a handful of drive-in theaters in the Gem State.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state is updating its birth certificate system to affirm the gender identities of transgender parents, after a transmasculine person asked to be officially recognized as a father who gave birth to their daughter. Myles and Precious Brady-Davis of Chicago learned after their daughter, Zayn, arrived in December that the Illinois Department of Public Health automatically names the parent who gives birth as Mother/Co-Parent on a birth certificate. Myles Brady-Davis is transmasculine, which describes a person who was born female but is typically masculine in gender expression. Transmasculine people do not always identify as male. Myles, who uses they/them pronouns, carried and gave birth to Zayn and wants to be listed as her father, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Precious Brady-Davis is a transgender woman and the baby's mother.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb has declared Jan. 27 Eva Education Day in honor of the late Eva Kor, the Holocaust survivor who dedicated much of her life to educating the world about the experiments of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. Jan. 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where Kor and her twin sister, Miriam, were subjected to Mengele's experiments. The Terre Haute woman's experience was chronicled in a documentary titled Eva: A-7063. That film is part of an Eva Educational Toolkit that has been distributed to every middle school and high school in Indiana. Kor died July 4, 2019, while conducting her annual group tour of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland.\n\nIowa\n\nHarlan: A man has asked a judge to let him engage in a sword fight with his ex-wife and her attorney so he can rend their souls from their bodies. David Ostrom, 40, of Paola, Kansas, said in a Jan. 3 court filing that his former wife, Bridgette Ostrom, 38, of Harlan, Iowa, and her attorney, Matthew Hudson, had destroyed (him) legally. The Ostroms have been embroiled in disputes over custody and visitation issues and property tax payments. The judge had the power to let the parties resolve our disputes on the field of battle, legally, David Ostrom said, adding in his filing that trial by combat has never been explicitly banned or restricted as a right in these United States. He also asked the judge for 12 weeks' time so he could secure Japanese samurai swords. Shelby County District Court Judge Craig Dreismeier said in his own filing Monday that he won't be issuing a decision anytime soon, citing irregularities with both sides' motions and responses.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A former Newman University professor who alleged the university discriminated against her because she was a woman should receive more than $800,000 in damages and be reinstated, a federal jury ruled Monday. The jury found in favor of Cindy Louthan, former assistant professor of elementary education at Newman, who sued the private Roman Catholic university in Wichita in 2018. Cindy Louthan alleged a supervisor was hostile toward women and harassed and discriminated against her because she is female. She also contended the university did not investigate her concerns and punished her when she complained about the supervisor, ending in her losing her job, The Wichita Eagle reports. Louthan was one of five former university employees who sued the school alleging unfair treatment or termination in recent years. The university has denied the allegations in each case.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A Christian school expelled a student last week after her family says school officials discovered the 15-year-old had celebrated her birthday with a rainbow-themed cake. Kimberly Alford says that until Jan. 6, her daughter had been a freshman at Whitefield Academy. That's when Alford says she received an email from the academy's head of school, Bruce Jacobson, explaining how her daughter was being expelled immediately due to a post on social media. Alford had recently posted a photo on her Facebook page showing her daughter celebrating her birthday at a Texas Roadhouse restaurant, wearing a sweater featuring a rainbow design and sitting by a colorful, rainbow-themed cake. Alford says someone shared the photo with school officials. Alford says Jacobson wrote that the picture demonstrates a posture of morality and cultural acceptance contrary to that of Whitefield Academy's beliefs and follows two years of lifestyle violations. Alford says her daughter is not gay, and the cake was simply a fun treat.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The zoo in the capital city is asking for the public's help to name its newest male giraffe. The Baton Rouge Zoo is holding a contest for people to nominate their favorite names for the facility's latest addition, born last month. Nominations will be accepted through Jan.22. Zoo staff will take those public submissions and narrow them to three finalists, which will be up for a final vote from the public after that. The zoo will announce the finalists and more details about the voting at a later date. Six-year-old giraffe Rosie gave birth Dec. 26 to the male giraffe, the 20th giraffe to be born at the Baton Rouge Zoo.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A proposal in the Legislature would halt a form of discrimination against people who take medication to prevent HIV infection. Democratic Sen. Heather Sanborn of Portland said the state's insurance code should be amended to prevent denial of life insurance for people who take pre-exposure prophylaxis medication to prevent HIV. The prophylaxis is commonly called PrEP. The proposal received a public hearing before the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee on Jan. 8. It will be subject to committee votes before it can move on to the full Maine Legislature. Sanborn said the state's insurance code should reflect modern medical practices, instead of perpetuating discriminatory behavior.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan highlighted initiatives to fight violent crime in Baltimore, improve education statewide and protect the environment Tuesday in presenting his budget plan for the next fiscal year. Hogan, a Republican, referenced a violent weekend in the state's largest city in calling on lawmakers to support his crime-fighting proposals this session. On Saturday, 12 people were shot – five of them fatally – in Baltimore. It marked the third time in the past month that at least eight people were shot in a single day. The No. 1 concern of Marylanders by far is crime, Hogan said at a news conference. Citizens are demanding more accountability for the violent criminals for shooting and killing people in the streets of Baltimore. The city had 348 homicides last year, the fifth straight year with more than 300 slayings in the city. It was Baltimore's most violent year ever on a per capita basis.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A group working to make it legal in the state for doctors to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to mentally competent patients with terminal illnesses says it will continue its fight despite a recent legal setback. Compassion & Choices in its suit filed in 2016 said legalizing the practice, referred to as medical aid in dying or MAID, would help terminally ill patients avoid needless suffering. In a decision Dec. 31, a judge said the issue should be left up to lawmakers. Compassion & Choices said in a statement Monday that it intends to appeal. This setback is disheartening, but we will continue this legal battle, Dr. Roger Kligler, a Cape Cod physician with terminal cancer and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in the statement. Second Thoughts Massachusetts, a group that opposes medical aid in dying, praised the decision.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Michigan State Police has suspended the contract with the company that issues the state's breath alcohol testing devices amid concerns the results could be flawed. In a letter written to police and prosecutors statewide, state police officials warned law enforcement agencies about performance-related issues with the Datamaster DMT breathalyzer devices, according to the Detroit News. Such issues could affect drunken driving cases. The letter did not identify the problems or how they were uncovered. State police Lt. Michael Shaw said the agency will take over calibration of the devices, as well as the contractor's duties of certifying and serving the breathalyzer units. Oakland University criminal justice professor Daniel Kennedy said such issues with the breathalyzer devices could be troublesome for drunken driving cases in Michigan.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMoorhead: The city might consider requesting a state permit to remove aggressive wild turkeys after some residents complained about the birds, a police official said. Moorhead Deputy Police Chief Tory Jacobson said the police department doesn't have the skills or resources to add wildlife management to its list of responsibilities. The department, which also runs the city's animal control unit, estimates about 300 turkeys are currently roosting and walking in residential neighborhoods. Moorhead residents shared tales about living in close proximity to the wild turkeys during the department's meeting last week, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Some feel as though the turkeys are taking over. But others welcome the animals as neighbors. Brett Bernath says about 20 to 30 congregate in his backyard, leaving behind filth.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Republican Tate Reeves was inaugurated as governor Tuesday, pledging to provide economic opportunities for all people in the state and to defend a loving culture that underpins our quality of life. Reeves, 45, is the 65th governor of Mississippi. He succeeds Republican Phil Bryant, who served two terms. This will be an administration for all Mississippi, Reeves said during his inaugural speech. Reeves served two terms as lieutenant governor and two terms before that as the elected state treasurer. He took the oath as governor before family, friends, lawmakers and other officials in the House chamber of the state Capitol. A culture of love and kinship has knitted Mississippi families together, and tied them to each other, for ages, Reeves said. It is what makes us special in a fast-paced and transient world. I will defend that culture against the erosion that frays societies.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Planned Parenthood is challenging the state's denial of claims for Medicaid payments for a second time in two years. KCUR reports that Planned Parenthood's affiliates in Overland Park, Kansas, appealed Missouri's cutoff of their fiscal 2020 funding last week in Jackson County, Missouri, after an administrative law judge ruled against them last month. Meanwhile, an appeal of the cutoff of 2019 funding is pending before the Missouri Supreme Court. It's kind of a continuation of the same old song and dance, said Charles Hatfield, Planned Parenthood's attorney. Republican lawmakers in Missouri have for years sought to stop any taxpayer money from going to Planned Parenthood, even clinics that do not provide abortions. But legislators struggled with loopholes that allowed Planned Parenthood clinics that provide other health care to continue receiving funding.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A campaign to legalize, regulate and tax marijuana use has submitted two proposed ballot initiatives for state review, the group New Approach Montana announced. The first ballot proposal would legalize recreational use of marijuana for adults in Montana and establish a regulatory framework and a 20% sales tax. Part of the tax money would be used to reduce the tax on medical marijuana from 2% to 1%. The second ballot issue is a constitutional amendment that would restrict marijuana consumption, like alcohol, to people age 21 or older. The initiatives were delivered to the secretary of state and the Legislative Services Division on Monday, Montana Public Radio reports. The Attorney General must approve the language before the group can start gathering signatures in an effort to put the issues before voters in November 2020.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Game and Parks Commission has prepared special Valentine's Day offers for people who want to mark the day at a state park. Guests who reserve a cabin or lodge room – at a 30% discount – at Eugene T. Mahoney State Park between Feb. 10 and Feb. 14 can add a Valentine's Special package to their reservation. The $25 offer includes a gift package consisting of a rose, two wine glasses, sparkling juice, a 2020 Nebraskaland Calendar, chocolates and more. For a getaway at Ponca State Park, make a reservation and celebrate Birds and Breakfast, Feb. 14-15. Enjoy dinner and a 30% discount on cabin lodging on Valentine's Day night at Platte River State Park. Or reserve a cabin at Lewis and Clark State Recreation Area from Feb. 14 to Feb. 16 for a 30% discount. Add the Silver Package for $25 and get complimentary champagne, wine or cider; sausage and cheese platter; bouquet of flowers; cheesecake dessert; drink tickets and more.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Animal rescuers have confirmed one of three hat-wearing pigeons that gained popularity on social media has died. Lofty Hopes Pigeon Rescue employees say fumes from glue used to affix the hats could have poisoned Bille the Pidge. Lofty Hopes Pigeon Rescue tweeted Sunday that the female bird was weak and had lost toes to a condition where its toes are isolated by a string and fall off. Officials say the three pigeons were first discovered in December wearing miniature red cowboy hats in Las Vegas. Rescue employees say the hats were glued on. Employees say pigeons have fragile respiratory systems, and a veterinarian had to trim feathers to remove the hats. It wasn't certain if the bird's death was connected to the hat. It is still unknown who put the hats on the birds. Billie is survived by two other former cowboy pigeons – Cluck Norris and Coolamity Jane.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Animals are on the agenda at the Statehouse with bills aimed at both protecting and pursuing them. Lawmakers have filed at least a dozen bills this session focused on wildlife or domesticated animals, including measures to ban the declawing of cats and docking of dog tails. Both bills have public hearings Thursday. Three bills before a House committee Tuesday were about killing other species. One would repeal a prohibition on hunting with ferrets; another would create a new safari hunting license for those taking elk and boar at a private game reserve; and a third would lower the bar for killing animals that damage crops or other property. Current law allows someone to kill wild animals that cause actual and substantial damage, but a bill sponsored by Rep. Howard Pearl, R-Loudon, would remove the and substantial language. He said requiring substantial damage was too subjective.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: State lawmakers on Monday passed legislation to prohibit flavored vaping products, sending the measure to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy's desk. The Democrat-led Senate passed the bill 22-15, with the Democratic-controlled Assembly voting 53-11 with eight lawmakers not voting on the measure that bans e-cigarettes flavors, including any fruit or candy among others. Lawmakers say the flavors are meant to hook young people, who are using the products in increasing numbers. Opponents of the legislation, who crowded part of the Statehouse complex Monday, say officials should better enforce the smoking age instead of barring of-age adults from buying products they enjoy using. The smoking age in New Jersey is 21. Murphy has been supportive of the idea of a flavor ban, but his office didn't respond when asked how he'll handle the legislation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The National Science Foundation has awarded two universities in the state and the New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute a $5 million grant to establish a comprehensive forestry research center for the Southwest. The five-year grant will fund the development of a Center of Excellence in Forest Restoration. It will be charged with advancing the understanding of the effects of restoration activities on forested areas through a combination of multidisciplinary research and education. The center will train students in fire management as well as forest ecology and restoration, offering undergraduate and masters programs at Highlands University. Plans also include developing a collaborative Ph.D. program between Highlands and New Mexico State University.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city's policing of subway fare beaters is drawing scrutiny from the state's attorney general for possible racial bias. Letitia James announced Monday that her office is investigating the New York Police Department's fare-enforcement practices after the department released new data showing black and Hispanic people account for the vast majority of its fare-related summonses and arrests. James' office sent a letter to the police commissioner Monday seeking additional data, such as the number of officers assigned to each subway station each day – figures she said could shed light on whether officers are targeting communities of color. James, a Democrat, promised to take legal action if her office finds evidence of discrimination. NYPD spokeswoman Devora Kaye said officers patrol day and night to keep 6 million daily riders safe and enforce the law fairly and equally without consideration of race or ethnicity.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCorolla: A group that manages herds of wild horses on the state's coast is warning drivers to watch out for the animals taking advantage of unseasonably warm weather by sleeping on the sand at night. Temperatures in the 60s and 70s across the Carolinas have the wild horses acting more like it's June, not January, the Corolla Wild Horse Fund said in a message posted to social media. The pleasant weather has coaxed the animals out of the islands' forests, where they usually shelter from cold winter winds, and into the path of recreational vehicles, The News & Observer reports. Daniel T. Myers III was driving on Corova Beach over the weekend when he spotted the horses in the dark. He told McClatchy News Group the animals are very hard to see and warned others to keep an eye out. Crashes are one of the leading causes of death among the Outer Banks herds, the newspaper says.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A pipeline spill of oil-field wastewater has affected cropland in northwestern North Dakota. State environmental scientist Bill Suess said regulators were notified Monday of the 8,400-gallon pipeline leak in Renville County. The pipeline is operated by Wichita Falls, Texas-based Cobra Oil and Gas. Suess said the spill of produced water happened 2 miles north of Sherwood and within a mile of the U.S.-Canada border. The cause of the pipeline leak is unknown. Produced water is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals. It's a byproduct of oil and gas development. Suess said about 1,000 square feet of cropland was affected. He said no water sources were harmed.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Self-driving shuttles will do a circuit through a residential neighborhood in the capital city as part of a yearlong pilot program starting in late January. Three 12-passenger, disabled-accessible electric shuttles will travel the 2.8-mile route in the Linden neighborhood. The shuttles, which are autonomous but monitored by on-board operators, will run between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m and connect riders to locations with social services like St. Stephen's Community House, which has a food pantry and health and job resources. Other stops include a recreation center and a transit center. The circuit will be timed so riders can connect to Central Ohio Transit Authority buses. The route will be suspended for 30 minutes in the morning and afternoon as a precaution because of students walking to school, says Mandy Bishop, the program manager for Smart Columbus, the city's mobility initiative.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state has adopted a new electronic tracking system that will allow sexual assault survivors to monitor the location and status of their rape kits. The purpose of the system is to empower survivors with information, help law enforcement with investigations, and foster transparency and public trust, The Oklahoman reports. Only survivors and entities that update the system can access the records. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation operates the system, which was authorized through legislation passed last year. A task force made recommendations in an effort to improve the state's response to sexual assaults. I'm hoping it will hold all of us accountable to make sure that we don't let victims fall through the cracks, says Andrea Fielding, division director of criminalistics for the OSBI.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The City Council has voted unanimously to draft an emergency declaration legally allowing car camping in certain areas. Many members of the public who spoke at the council meeting Monday supported the push for car camping but stressed more needed to be done to help the homeless population. Most demanded immediate action. Mayor Chuck Bennett said he was deeply concerned about the homeless crisis, but it has been 30 years in the making, and officials are working to fight that crisis in a matter of weeks. He said the actions made during Monday's session will help meet the needs of the community. A study researching the option found the city has neither the funds nor the resources to manage a city-sponsored program. A privately sponsored program – where site owners provide supervision, trash receptacles and access to bathrooms – was suggested as an alternative.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state's second lady, Giselle Fetterman, will help lead a campaign to raise awareness of this year's census and encourage residents to respond, state officials said Monday. Fetterman, whose husband is Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, said she will tour the state, making stops in Philadelphia and in Centre, Erie, Allegheny, Lancaster and Luzerne counties over the next three months. Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order in 2018 to create a commission to help ensure a robust census count and signed legislation in October authorizing up to $4 million to buttress the count. Meanwhile, 94 nonprofit community organizations are working together to encourage their targeted communities to return census forms. Current census projections show Pennsylvania is growing more slowly than the rest of the country and is expected to lose a congressional seat in 2023.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The federal government is finally paying for baggage screening systems at the state's main airport that were upgraded after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said. The Democrat met Friday with officials from the Rhode Island Airport Corp. and the Transportation Security Administration at the T.F. Green Airport in Warwick to discuss air travel safety. Reed said millions were allocated nationally in a 2020 spending bill to reimburse airports for baggage screening systems and security improvements, of which $5.5 million will be directed to T.F. Green. The airport upgraded its baggage screening systems after the terrorist attacks, enhancing safety and saving the federal government millions in reduced labor and worker's compensation costs, but the airport corporation wasn't fully reimbursed, Reed said. The payment brings the total reimbursement so far to $18 million of $30 million owed, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Mayor Knox White says he's found a way to commit up to $5million toward buying land for affordable housing at County Square, although he says he's still working on the details. The mayor says the $5 million would be in addition to $2 million Greenville County had previously pledged toward affordable housing in the neighborhood that includes County Square. It's the latest step in a project that has been in the works for three years: the $1 billion public-private redevelopment of county-owned land along University Ridge. Negotiations have intensified since since last summer among city and county leaders, downtown residents and RocaPoint over how best to hash out a plan everyone can live with. It is the biggest project Greenville has ever seen, promising thousands of jobs, millions in tax revenues, and a 37-acre expansion of the downtown business district.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nElk Point: A school district will pay $65,000 to settle a discrimination lawsuit brought by a former honor student. Addison Ludwig says she was singled out by the former Elk Point-Jefferson High School principal after she was featured in the student newspaper in 2017 and described a hobby as Netflix n' Chill with my boyfriend. Ludwig says she didn't know it was a term some use to describe casual sexual encounters until the principal, Travis Aslesen, made her look it up on the internet. Aslesen revoked her senior privileges and honors study hall and removed her as editor of the newspaper. Ludwig in her lawsuit said male students who used the term had not been disciplined, including a boy who had used the term in a profile in the newspaper earlier in the year, the lawsuit said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Senate started the 2020 legislative session passing its first bill of the year: a controversial measure that protects religious adoption agencies if they choose to discriminate against same-sex couples. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Paul Rose, R-Covington, declares that no licensed adoption agency would be required to participate in a child placement if doing so would violate the agency's written religious or moral convictions or policies. It also prohibits the state from denying an agency's license or grant application for public funds because of the group's refusal to place a child with a family based on religious objections. The adoption agency would also be protected from lawsuits for such a refusal. The Senate passed the bill 20-6, with five Republican members declining to vote on the measure, including Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge. The House passed the bill in April, and it now heads to Gov. Bill Lee for his signature.\n\nTexas\n\nStephenville: Researchers at Tarleton State University's Southwest Regional Dairy Center are using devices similar to Fitbits to track the health habits of dairy cows, the Weatherford Democrat reports. The researchers say tracking a cow's eating, sleeping and movement helps them take better care of the animals, according to a press release from the Texas A&M University System. The devices track how long cows eat, how long they lay down and how many steps they take, while another wearable device monitors how much milk each cow gives. We have two Fitbits on every cow, Southwest Regional Dairy Center Director Barbara Jones says. The data can warn producers that a cow may be sick before the animal starts showing symptoms. The devices also free up time for the dairy producer, who can tend to other business instead of monitoring their herd visually, according to the press release.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Membership growth in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has slowed to its lowest level in decades. The church added just 4,900 members in the state in between October 2018 and September 2019, according to statistics it provided to The Salt Lake Tribune. Utah's total population grew by 53,000 people over the same period, according to estimates. The church grew by fewer than 10,000 people in a year only one other time since 1989, the first year the newspaper had access to membership data. That was in 2018, when membership rose by just over 9,000 people. By comparison, the faith widely known as the Mormon church added more than 40,000 new members in 2013, which was the high mark of the last decade. In Salt Lake County, the state's largest, the number of Latter-day Saints fell by 6,710 even as the county's total population grew by 10,000 people.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A bill has been proposed in the Legislature to decriminalize adult prostitution. The legislation is co-sponsored by four female legislators. Rep. Selene Colburn, a Burlington progressive, said she thinks decriminalizing sex work will improve safety and health of prostitutes, mynbc5.com reports. The underlying question is do we need to criminalize consensual sex between adults on any terms? she said. Sex trafficking, exploitation and solicitation of minors will remain a serious felony, she said. The bill is in the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state moved a step closer to ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment on Tuesday, even as the measure's future nationally remains in doubt. A House committee approved a resolution to ratify the gender equality measure, which advocates hope will become the next amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The 13-9 vote split along party lines, with all Democrats supporting it and all Republicans opposing it. A Senate committee already advanced a similar resolution. The resolutions are now before the full House and Senate, where floor votes are expected Wednesday. Democrats control both chambers, and their legislative leaders have said their caucuses unanimously support the measure. Each action we take to move this resolution forward signals to the country that we're more than ready to do our part in creating a world where women are treated as equals, Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, a sponsor of the House resolution, said in a statement.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Seattle Police Department's civilian watchdog has found that an officer's ruse in a 2018 hit-and-run case contributed to the driver's suicide. The Office of Police Accountability said that to get the suspect to turn himself in, the officer told one of the suspect's friends that the crash left a woman in critical condition and that she might not survive, The Seattle Times reports. In reality, it was a fender-bender with no injuries. The driver's friend told him what the officer had said, and the driver began to think he had possibly hit a pedestrian without knowing it. The friend reported that the driver had been addicted to heroin for two decades and became increasingly despondent over the possibility he killed someone. Soon thereafter, in June 2018, he died by suicide. The officer was suspended for six days without pay.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Rescue dogs could soon become the state's official state dog under a proposal approved Tuesday in the Senate. The resolution, sponsored by state Sens. Ryan Weld and Stephen Baldwin, says it seeks to bring attention to dogs living in the more than 500 animal shelters in West Virginia. Just because a dog is at a shelter doesn't mean that there's something wrong with the dog, said Weld, a Republican. That dog needs a second chance and is looking for a new friend, just like you might be. The proposal now moves to the House of Delegates. West Virginia already has a bunch of official state flora and fauna. The black bear is the state animal, the sugar maple is the state tree, the cardinal is the state bird, and the rhododendron is the state flower.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans are introducing a package of bills that would impose tougher sanctions and sentences on criminals. The legislation would require the Department of Corrections to recommend revoking a person's extended supervision, parole or probation if he or she is charged with a crime; prohibit people convicted of violent crimes from finishing probation early; and block violent criminals from participating in early release programs. The bills also would impose a mandatory 180-day jail sentence for shoplifting; forbid prosecutors from amending charges of illegally possessing a gun against a person convicted of a violent felony or attempting to commit a violent felony; and expand the violations that could land a child in a youth prison to include any act that would be a felony in adult court.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A company has settled a federal lawsuit by a former employee who claimed she was pressured to take Scientology courses as a condition of her employment. Julie A. Rohrbacher filed the lawsuit in 2018 against Teton Therapy, which operates physical and occupational therapy offices in four Wyoming locations. Rohrbacher claimed that owner Jeff McMenamy declined to promote her and then forced her to resign in 2013 after she refused to enroll in Church of Scientology courses. She sued under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits religious harassment and discrimination at work. The suit was settled Jan. 2, and Chief U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl dismissed the case, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Scientology is a church founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in the early 1950s. The church has about 10 million members worldwide.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
Trump touts tax overhaul as boon for farmers\n\nUS President Donald Trump is hailing the Republican tax overhaul law during a pitch to rural America at a meeting of the American Farm Bureau Federation. (Jan. 8)
Tina Orem\n\nNerdWallet\n\nMost people know that breaking tax rules, even accidentally, can bring serious consequences like an audit. It may seem like a one-way street, but the IRS has to follow rules, too. Here's what three tax attorneys say you should know.\n\nTaxpayers do have rights\n\nThe Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which the IRS adopted in 2014, summarizes taxpayer rights scattered throughout the tax code, making it easier to understand what the IRS can and can't do. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights groups taxpayer rights into 10 basic tenets. Under them, taxpayers have the right to:\n\nBe informed. Quality service. Pay no more than the correct amount of tax. Challenge the IRS's position and be heard. Appeal an IRS decision in an independent forum. Finality. Privacy. Confidentiality. Retain representation. A fair and just tax system.\n\nIt's often helpful to reference these rights when talking with the IRS, says Glen Frost, a tax attorney in Columbia, Md. When talking with the IRS, Frost says he often points out that it's the taxpayer's right to be heard, for example.\n\nYou can push back\n\nIRS disputes can be intimidating. Frost says he's seen even certified public accountants become submissive around IRS agents. But the Taxpayer Bill of Rights provides the grounds to challenge the agency's position.\n\nThe first principle here is, these aren't rights that are granted by the IRS, but they're simply recognized by the IRS, and they all come down from the law that's either made by Congress or made by the courts, says Fred Daily, a tax attorney in St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\nTax news and advice\n\nTaxpayers have the right to retain representation. Taxpayers also have the right to talk to an IRS supervisor — a move that might save hours of time and frustration, Frost adds.\n\nThere are limits\n\nThe Taxpayer Bill of Rights may help you navigate disputes, but it's not necessarily a tool for things like resolving problems with a specific employee, for example, says Alvin Brown, a tax attorney in New York City.\n\nThe [Taxpayer] Bill of Rights is incomplete, and it needs some more backbone. It needs more structure, more specificity, Brown says.\n\nOther options for taxpayers include filing a complaint with the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, an IRS watchdog, or turning to the courts, he says.\n\nMORE:\n\nTina Orem is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

AP\n\nNFL owners will try again to settle the issue of relocation to Los Angeles, this time knowing that Commissioner Roger Goodell has declared the stadiums inadequate in Oakland, St. Louis and San Diego.\n\nTwo days of meetings in Houston start Tuesday, six weeks after owners delayed a vote because they wanted more information on possible moves involving the Raiders, Rams and Chargers. Any move would involve one or two teams.\n\nAll three cities have tried to make their cases with the NFL, and each team recently submitted a formal relocation bid.\n\nThe latest development was Goodell's report last week to all 32 teams that says the existing stadiums are inadequate and unsatisfactory, and that the proposals the Raiders, Rams and Chargers received to remain in their current cities lacked certainty. The report is required in the relocation process.\n\nRams owner Stan Kroenke is planning a $1.8 billion stadium in Inglewood, California, at the site of the old Hollywood Park racetrack. The Raiders and Chargers have a joint project in mind for nearby Carson. Kroenke also is willing to share his proposed stadium with either the Chargers or Raiders.\n\nA move requires approval from at least 24 owners.\n\nIt's a long, tedious process, New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch said at the December meetings in the Dallas area. There's a lot of questions and there are not answers to every question yet. And there will be more questions when we meet in mid-January for sure.\n\nThe St. Louis proposal calls for an open-air, $1.1 billion stadium along the Mississippi River north of the Gateway Arch to replace the Edward Jones Dome.\n\nThe plan includes $150 million from the city, $250 million from Kroenke, at least $200 million from the league, and $160 million in fan seat licenses. The rest of the money comes from the state, either through tax credits or bonds. Goodell has countered that NFL policy limits the league's contribution to $100 million.\n\nSan Diego has a $1.1 billion proposal to replace aging Qualcomm Stadium, but it will require a public vote that likely wouldn't happen before June. The Chargers walked away from negotiations with the city and have focused their efforts on the Carson project.\n\nHouston owner Bob McNair, a member of the relocation committee, canceled a meeting with San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer last month, and made disparaging public remarks about city leadership.\n\nOakland is still in debt from a renovation 20 years ago when the Raiders moved back from Los Angeles. City officials have said they won't seek help from taxpayers with a new stadium, and asked the NFL for more time to develop a project in a league-required response to the Raiders' relocation plan.\n\nNo NFL franchise has moved since the Houston Oilers went to Tennessee in 1997.

John W. Schoen\n\nCNBC\n\nIf the ongoing congressional budget standoff forces a government shutdown, homebuyers and sellers could be subject to more headaches than usual before their deals close.\n\nThat's because buyers looking for mortgage approval could hit paperwork roadblocks if the shutdown furloughs workers at the IRS or Social Security Administration. This is what happened in October 2013, the last time budget gridlock forced a 16-day shutdown that sent millions of government workers on furlough and gummed up the works of the U.S. housing market.\n\nHere's how another shutdown could make buying or selling a home even more stressful.\n\nDoesn't the bank decide whether I get a loan? Why does the government have to get involved?\n\nWhile lenders use government guidelines for mortgage approvals, the decision ultimately belongs to the lenders. That's not the problem.\n\nAs anyone who has applied for a mortgage learns the hard way, the application includes a big stack of paper documenting your financial status, including records like tax returns.\n\nIn most cases, lenders want to verify all that paperwork, especially after the housing crash a decade ago when lenders went light on documentation, an approach that ended badly.\n\nIf the government does shut down, that includes workers at the IRS who are usually asked to verify the tax returns aspiring homebuyers submit to their mortgage lenders. (If you hear there's a problem with IRS Form 4056-T, you may have hit that particular roadblock.)\n\nIf the government shuts down, does the IRS stop completely?\n\nSome IRS workers would be exempt from furlough, including those who provide essential services like making sure records are maintained and the computers keep recording tax payments.\n\nBut verifying information and processing mortgage paperwork isn't considered essential. So those employees would have to stop working.\n\nThere's no working from home either. When the government shuts down, employees are not only barred from the buildings they work in, they're kicked off the network they access at their job.\n\nWhat else can go wrong with my mortgage application?\n\nBorrowers who are applying for an FHA or VA mortgage could run into delay if workers from those departments are sent home, and there's no one available to process the loan.\n\nA loan could also be delayed if a lender tries to verify a Social Security number. That's often required if something in an application doesn't match the information associated with a Social Security number in a credit report or other database, even if it's just a typo. If the lender tries to verify the number with the Social Security Administration, and no one at the agency answers the phone, that borrower could be out of luck.\n\nThe FHA hasa FAQ to help lenders and borrowers figure out how to work around some of these roadblocks.\n\nWhat if I can't get approved in timefor my closing date?\n\nIt's possible the deal could fall through, but it's much more likely the contract will just be extended. The last time the government shut down, some 17 percent of closings were delayed, according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors.\n\nA handful of transactions were scuttled, and a few sellers reported that they lost bids because of the shutdown. Some 3 percent said they got a weaker offer, likely because of the uncertainty buyers faced over the length of the furloughs.\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Fredreka Schouten\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – Taxpayer funding for presidential campaigns would end under a measure moving through the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nBy a 5-3 vote, the Committee on House Administration on Tuesday approved a bill to kill the program, which is funded by a $3 checkoff on federal tax returns. This fund is antiquated, said Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., the committee's chairman.\n\nIn 2008, then-senator Barack Obama opted against using public funds in his presidential campaign, becoming the first major party nominee to reject taxpayer money. No Republican or Democratic presidential nominee has used public funds since.\n\nThe fund has died of its own lack of use, Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., said during the brief debate on the bill Tuesday.\n\nLawmakers said $317 million remains unused in the public funding account. The measure approved by the committee would funnel that money to deficit reduction and pediatric cancer research.\n\nThe political landscape has changed dramatically since the public-funding system took effect in 1976. Most candidates now reject taxpayer money – and the spending limits that come with it – to remain competitive in races flooded with unlimited funds from super PACs and other outside groups.\n\nJust two presidential contenders used public money in the 2016 election: Democrat Martin O'Malley, who collected nearly $1.1 million and Green Party nominee Jill Stein, who received more than $590,000, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe system needs improvement, not repeal, said Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Brady, the top Democrat on the House Administration panel. He pointed to a proposal by Rep. David Price, D-N.C., that would boost the amount that taxpayers donate and would give candidates $6 for every $1 they raised from small donors.\n\nThe measure approved Tuesday faces other obstacles before clearing Congress. But lawmakers already have demonstrated they want to reduce taxpayers' role in funding campaign-related activities. In 2014, Congress ended public funding for the Republican and Democratic national conventions.
Kay Bell\n\nNerdWallet\n\nOne of the biggest decisions taxpayers face each year is how to file their returns. Last year, 86%, nearly 132 million, of returns were filed with tax software. But most of those computer-prepared and e-filed returns — almost 79 million — were completed by tax professionals.\n\nWhy hire a tax pro to do your taxes online when you can use similar software to do the job yourself? Here are four questions to help you decide.\n\n1. How much are you willing to spend?\n\nPaying a tax professional can add up, especially if your filing requires a lot of forms and time. A National Society of Accountants survey released in 2015 found the average fee to complete a Form 1040 with itemized deductions on Schedule A and a state tax return was $273. That's along the lines of IRS estimates, which found the cost of filing a 1040 was $270.\n\nYou can buy tax software, on the other hand, for less than $100. Discounts common during tax season can slash the retail price even more. And if your adjusted gross income falls below $64,000, you can use the IRS' Free File, which, as the name suggests, allows you to prepare and file your taxes at no cost.\n\nTax news and advice\n\n2. How much time do you have?\n\nThe dollar cost to do your taxes is worth consideration, but don't forget the value of your time.\n\nThe IRS estimates that you'll need 16 hours to complete a Form 1040. That's the individual return that, according to the IRS, 69% of us use. The hours to complete this longest of the three options take into account gathering records, tax planning and filling out and submitting the return.\n\nIf you use a tax preparer, you'll also have to commit some time to gathering tax statements and other material. But once you deliver the necessary documents, you'll have more time for other tasks.\n\n3. How complex (or not) is your tax life?\n\nIf you're a single filer who rents an apartment and your workplace 401(k) is your only investment, tax software should work fine. Even when things get a bit more complex — you get married, have a child and itemize deductions for the first time — most software will walk you through these tax situations.\n\nBut if you run your own business, either as your main job or on the side, buy a home or inherit property, it's probably a good time to get some personal tax advice and guidance.\n\nWhile comprehensive tax software can handle these more complex tax situations, it cannot talk with you about your plans that could affect your taxes. A tax professional, however, can outline what might happen if you want to donate rather than sell the stock your Uncle Henry left to you. A tax adviser can offer insight into tax law changes that might affect you and whether you should make certain moves now or wait.\n\n4. Are you ready, willing and able to deal with the IRS?\n\nBy signing your tax return, you are responsible for all the information on the forms. If you do your taxes yourself, that means you're the one the IRS will come to with any questions — possibly years after you've filed.\n\nA tax pro, however, can be your point person. By filling out a line on your 1040, you can direct the IRS to bring any questions about the filing to your tax preparer. If you want to go further, you can give certain kinds of tax preparers — enrolled agents, CPAs, attorneys — power of attorney to represent you before the IRS.\n\nMORE:\n\nThe Fastest Way to Get Your Refund\n\nFind the Best Tax Preparation Software\n\n7 Tips to Find the Best Tax Preparer Near You\n\nKay Bell is a contributing writer at NerdWallet.\n\nNerdWallet is a USA TODAY content partner providing general news, commentary and coverage from around the web.

Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk has increased his investment in the electric-car maker, using more than $50 million of his own money to cover the taxes on shares that cost him less than $7 apiece.\n\nMusk exercised and held 532,000 Tesla TSLA, -4.29% stock options this week, adding to his position in the electric-car maker, which amounted to 21.7% of the company as of August, according to FactSet. According to an SEC filing detailing the transaction, Musk now owns slightly more than 28.9 million shares, which would be worth more than $5.5 billion at Friday's closing price.

A decline in Federal Reserve earnings remitted to the Treasury also contributed to the smaller amount of receipts.

Here is the text of Sen. Bernie Sanders' speech on Wall Street and the economy, as prepared for delivery on Tuesday in New York:\n\nThe American people are catching on. They understand that something is profoundly wrong when, in our country today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when the 20 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans – half of our population. They know that the system is rigged when the average person is working longer hours for lower wages, while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.\n\nThey also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country. As most people know, in the 1990s and later, the financial interests spent billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force through Congress the deregulation of Wall Street, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the weakening of consumer protection laws in states.\n\nThey spent this money in order to get the government off their backs and to show the American people what they could do with that new-won freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people. In 2008, the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly destroyed the U.S. and global economy.\n\nMillions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes and their life savings.\n\nWhile Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider. And Wall Street executives still receive huge compensation packages as if the financial crisis they created never happened.\n\nGreed, fraud, dishonesty and arrogance, these are the words that best describe the reality of Wall Street today.\n\nSo, to those on Wall Street who may be listening today, let me be very clear. Greed is not good. In fact, the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of our nation. And, here is a New Year's Resolution that I will keep if elected president. If you do not end your greed, we will end it for you.\n\nWe will no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.\n\nWhile President Obama deserves credit for improving this economy after the Wall Street crash, the reality is that a lot of unfinished business remains to be done.\n\nOur goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of billionaires\n\nThat means we have got to end, once and for all, the scheme that is nothing more than a free insurance policy for Wall Street, the policy of too big to fail.\n\nWe need a banking system that is part of the productive economy – making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments, making huge profits and assured that, if their schemes fail, the taxpayers will be there to bail them out.\n\nIn 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were too big to fail. Yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. Incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP. Enough is enough.\n\nIf a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. When it comes to Wall Street reform that must be our bottom line. This is true not just from a risk perspective and the fear of another bailout. It is also true from the reality that a handful of huge financial institutions simply have too much economic and political power over this country.\n\nIf Teddy Roosevelt, the Republican trust-buster, were alive today, he would say break 'em up. And he would be right.\n\nAnd, here's how I will accomplish that.\n\nWithin the first 100 days of my administration, I will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a Too-Big-to Fail list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout.\n\nWithin one year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy as authorized under Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nAnd, I will fight to reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking, investment banking and insurance services. Let's be clear: this legislation, introduced by my colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren, aims at the heart of the shadow banking system.\n\nIn my view, Senator Warren, is right. Dodd-Frank should have broken up Citigroup and other too- big-to-fail banks into pieces. And that's exactly what we need to do. And that's what I commit to do as president.\n\nNow, my opponent, Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits.\n\nSecretary Clinton is wrong.\n\nShadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks – something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act.\n\nLet's not forget: President Franklin Roosevelt signed this bill into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression. And, it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton.\n\nAnd, let's not kid ourselves. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department didn't just bail out shadow banks. As a result of an amendment that I offered to audit the emergency lending activities of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, we learned that the Fed provided more than $16 trillion in short-term, low-interest loans to every major financial institution in the country including Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, not to mention large corporations, foreign banks, and foreign central banks throughout the world.\n\nSecretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry. I disagree.\n\nAs former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote: Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully … Hillary Clinton's proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain the Street's excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can't be watered down – busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.\n\nSecretary Reich is right. Real Wall Street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking.\n\nMy opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to cut it out and end their destructive behavior. But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to cut it out. The reality is that Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street. Wall Street, its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress. We must change that reality, and as president I will.\n\nIt is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don't vote. They don't believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don't think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair – and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice.\n\nWe live in a country today that has an economy that is rigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt and a criminal justice system which, too often, does not dispense justice.\n\nNot one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy.\n\nThat will change under my administration. Equal Justice Under Law will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans.\n\nIt seems like almost every few weeks we read about one giant financial institution after another being fined or reaching settlements for their reckless, unfair and deceptive activities.\n\nSome people believe that this is an aberration: that we have an honest financial system in which, every now and then, major financial institutions do something wrong and get caught. In my view, the evidence suggests that would be an incorrect analysis.\n\nThe reality is that fraud is the business model on Wall Street. It is not the exception to the rule. It is the rule. And in a weak regulatory climate the likelihood is that Wall Street gets away with a lot more illegal behavior than we know of.\n\nHow many times have we heard the myth that what Wall Street did may have been wrong but it wasn't illegal?\n\nLet me help shatter that myth today.\n\nSince 2009, major financial institutions in this country have been fined $204 billion. $204 billion. And that takes place in a weak regulatory climate.\n\nHere are just a few examples of when major banks were caught doing illegal activity.\n\nIn August 2014, Bank of America settled a case with the Department of Justice for more than $16 billion on charges that the bank misled investors about the riskiness of mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the crisis.\n\nIn November of 2013, JP Morgan settled a case for $13 billion with the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency over charges the bank knowingly sold securities made up of low-quality mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nIn June of 2014, BNP Paribas was sentenced to five years' probation and was ordered to pay $8.9 billion in penalties by a U.S. District Judge in Manhattan after this bank pled guilty to charges of violating sanctions by conducting business in Sudan, Iran and Cuba.\n\nLet me read you a few headlines and you tell me how it makes sense that not one executive was prosecuted for fraud.\n\nCNN Headline, May 20, 2015: 5 big banks pay $5.4 billion for rigging currencies. Those banks include JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.\n\nHeadline from the International Business Times (February 24, 2015): Big Banks Under Investigation For Allegedly Fixing Precious Metals Prices. The Banks under investigation included Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nHeadline from The Real News Network (November 26, 2013): Documents in JPMorgan settlement reveal how every large bank in the U.S. has committed mortgage fraud.\n\nHeadline from The Washington Post (March 14, 2014): In lawsuit, FDIC accuses 16 big banks of fraud, conspiracy, which included Bank of America, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase.\n\nHeadline from the Guardian (April 2, 2011): How a big U.S. bank laundered billions from Mexico's murderous drug gangs. This article talks about how Wachovia (which was acquired by Wells Fargo) aided Mexican drug cartels in transferring billions of dollars in illegal drug money. Here is what the federal prosecutor (Jeffrey Sloman) said about this: Wachovia's blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations.\n\nYet, the total fine for this offense was less than 2% of the bank's $12.3 billion profit for 2009 and no one went to jail. No one went to jail.\n\nAnd, if that's not bad enough, here's another one.\n\nHeadline: The Wall Street Journal, February 9, 2011: J.P. Morgan Apologizes for Military Foreclosures. Here is a case where JP Morgan Chase, the largest bank in America, wrecked the finances of 4,000 military families in violation of the Civil Service Members Relief Act, yet no one went to jail.\n\nAnd, when I say that the business model of Wall Street is fraud that is not just Bernie Sanders talking. That is what financial executives told the University of Notre Dame in a study on the ethics of the financial services industry last year.\n\nAccording to this study, 51 percent of Wall Street executives making more than $500,000 a year found it likely that their competitors have engaged in unethical or illegal activity in order to gain an edge in the market.\n\nMore than one-third of financial executives have either witnessed or have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace.\n\nNearly one in five financial service professionals believe they must engage in illegal or unethical activity to be successful.\n\nTwenty-five percent of financial executives have signed or been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit reporting illegal or unethical activities to the authorities.\n\nHere's what one banker from Barclays said in 2010, when he was caught trying to price-fix the $5 trillion-per-day currency market: If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying.\n\nHere's what an analyst from Standard & Poors said in 2008, Let's hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters.\n\nThis country can no longer afford to tolerate the culture of fraud and corruption on Wall Street.\n\nUnder my administration, Wall Street CEOs will no longer receive a get-out-of jail free card. Big banks will not be too big to fail. Big bankers will not be too big to jail.\n\nAs president, I will nominate and appoint people with a track record of standing up to power, rather than those who have made millions defending Wall Street CEOs. Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks will not be represented in my administration.\n\nAnd, if we are serious about reforming our financial system, we have got to establish a tax on Wall Street speculators. We have got to discourage reckless gambling on Wall Street and encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy.\n\nWe will use the revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition free. During the financial crisis, the middle class of this country bailed out Wall Street. Now, it's Wall Street's turn to help the middle class.\n\nWe cannot have a safe and sound financial system if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial products. And, the only way we can restore that trust is to make sure credit rating agencies cannot make a profit from Wall Street.\n\nInvestors would not have bought the risky mortgage backed derivatives that led to the Great Recession if credit agencies did not give these worthless financial products triple-A ratings – ratings that they knew were bogus.\n\nAnd, the reason these risky financial schemes were given such favorable ratings is simple. Wall Street paid for them.\n\nUnder my administration, we will turn for-profit credit rating agencies into non-profit institutions, independent from Wall Street. No longer will Wall Street be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate their products.\n\nIf we are going to create a financial system that works for all Americans, we have got to stop financial institutions from ripping off the American people by charging sky-high interest rates and outrageous fees.\n\nIn my view, it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the ATM.\n\nIt is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent.\n\nThe Bible has a term for this practice. It's called usury. And in The Divine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for those who charged people usurious interest rates.\n\nToday, we don't need the hellfire and the pitch forks, we don't need the rivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law.\n\nToday, we need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent.\n\nIn 1980, Congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent. And, that law has worked well. Unlike big banks, credit unions did not receive a huge bailout from the taxpayers of this country. It is time to extend this cap to every lender in America.\n\nWe must also cap ATM fees at $2.00. People should not have to pay a 10 percent fee for withdrawing $40 of their own money out of an ATM.\n\nBig banks need to stop acting like loan sharks and start acting like responsible lenders.\n\nWe also need to give Americans affordable banking options.\n\nThe reality is that, unbelievably, millions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no normal banking services. Today, if you live in a low-income community and you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency, where do you go?\n\nYou go to a payday lender who could charge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious cycle of debt. That is unacceptable.\n\nWe need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans. Post offices exist in almost every community in our country. One important way to provide decent banking opportunities for low income communities is to allow the U.S. postal Service to engage in basic banking services, and that's what I will fight for.\n\nFurther, we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street.\n\nWhen Wall Street was on the verge of collapse, the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to save the financial system. We need the Fed to act with the same boldness to combat unemployment and low wages.\n\nFurther, we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street.\n\nIn my view, it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve. That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president. When I am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed. Under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and handpick its members and staff.\n\nFurther, the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed. Incredibly, the excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the Federal Reserve has grown from less than $2 billion in 2008 to $2.4 trillion today. That is absurd.\n\nInstead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the Fed should charge them a fee that could be used to provide affordable loans to small businesses to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nFinally, let me tell you what no other candidate will tell you. No president, not Bernie Sanders or anyone else, can effectively address the economic crises facing the working families of this country alone. The truth is that Wall Street, corporate America, the corporate media and wealthy campaign donors are just too powerful.\n\nWhat this campaign is about is building a political movement which revitalizes American democracy, which brings millions of people together – black and white, Latino, Asian-American, Native American – young and old, men and women, gay and straight, native born and immigrant, people of all religions.\n\nYes. Wall Street has enormous economic and political power. Yes. Wall Street makes huge campaign contributions, they have thousands of lobbyists and they provide very generous speaking fees to those who go before them.\n\nYes. They have an endless supply of money. But we have something they don't have. And that is that when millions of working families stand together, demanding fundamental changes in our financial system, we have the power to bring about that change.\n\nYes, we can make our economy work for all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy speculators. And, now more than ever, that is exactly what we must do.\n\nAnd so my message to you today is straightforward: If elected president, I will rein in Wall Street so they can't crash our economy again.\n\nWill they like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I'm president? You better believe it.\n\nThank you and I look forward to working with the most powerful force in our great nation, not the Barons of Wall Street but the people our government was created to serve.
U.S. Treasury yields jumped on Wednesday after early voting indicated Democrats were on track to win both Senate seats in Georgia and thus control of Congress, an outcome that would give the Biden administration more room to enact his policy agenda.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.660% was at a March high of 1.041%, 8.6 basis points higher than in the previous day. The 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.125% edged 2.2 basis points up to 0.143%, while the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.442% climbed 11.4 basis points to 1.819%, more than an eight month high.\n\nWhat's driving Treasurys?\n\nPreliminary voting results show Raphael Warnock won one of two Senate runoffs in Georgia early Wednesday, according to the Associated Press, bringing Democrats a seat closer to a Senate majority.\n\nAlso with 98% of the expected vote total reported, Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff was leading Republican Sen. David Perdue by just 0.4 percentage point.\n\nWith control of the Senate in sight, Democratic lawmakers may now have more scope to pass more aggressive fiscal measures that could weigh on the bond market through increased debt issuance and higher inflation expectations, according to analysts.\n\nIndeed, the 10-year note broke through the key 1% level that has contained the benchmark maturity since March.\n\nRead: U.S. bond market could face 'taper tantrum' risk after Georgia Senate runoffs, says Jefferies\n\nThe Treasury selloff slowed later in the session, however, after violent pro-Trump protesters broke into the U.S. Capitol building, forcing the halt of a joint session of Congress to certify Joe Biden's presidential victory.\n\nIn U.S. economic data, Automatic Data Processing Inc. said private-sector employment fell by 123,000 in December, the first decline in 8 months, after increasing 304,000 in the previous month. Factory orders rose 1% in November.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's minutes from its December policy meeting showed only a small share of its 17 members of its interest-rate setting committee were in favor of expanding purchases of long-term Treasurys last month.\n\nWhat did market participants say?\n\nThe expected increase in spending translates into more back-end supply and higher inflation, hence the steeper curve, said Kevin Walter, co-head of Treasurys trading at Barclays.
As we head into 2017 and consider New Year's resolutions that usually involve dieting, here's an idea that can make you, or someone you care about, a lot of money: Take full advantage of the company 401(k) match. Yes, a lot of money.\n\nIn May 2015, Financial Engines released the results of a study that concluded workers in the U.S. were leaving $24 billion a year on the table because they don't contribute enough to take full advantage of employers' matching 401(k) retirement-plan contributions.\n\nA 401(k) is a tax-deferred retirement plan that allows you to contribute a portion of your salary before taxes. The money is then invested according to your selections and remains tax deferred. The price is that you cannot withdraw any of the money until the year you turn 59 and a half, without paying a penalty. Then, when you are retired and begin withdrawing the money, it will be taxable income, presumably at a lower rate.\n\nDon't miss: Ditch your New Year's resolutions and set three realistic money goals for 2017\n\nBut what can be even more significant is that many employers offer matching contributions, up to a certain percentage of your salary.\n\nHow credit scores predict what you will buy next\n\nLet's say your annual salary is $75,000. Your employer offers, for example, a match of up to 5%. (In my own experience, the lowest employer match I was ever offered was 3%, and the highest was 8%.)\n\nIn this example, if you were to contribute 5% of your salary, or $3,750 a year, to your 401(k) account, your employer would also contribute $3,750 a year. Contributions are typically made every pay period. The bottom line is: Each of your contributions would earn an immediate 100% return — a doubling of your initial investment. You will need to check to see how long it takes for the employer's contribution to be vested. This means you may lose recent matching contributions if you change employers. For some companies, after an initial vesting period, all employer matching contributions are immediately vested.\n\nChances are, especially if your career has decades to go, that your 401(k) money will be invested in stock mutual funds, including low-priced index funds. That instant 100% return provides plenty of downside protection. Yes, it's a tall order to sock away 5% of your gross pay. It may feel as if you took a painful pay cut. But watch your account grow, and you will be amazed.\n\nHow about a New Year's resolution, each year?\n\nDespite that wonderful 100% return if you contribute what your employer is willing to match, you should consider, over time, working your way up to making maximum annual contributions to your 401(k).\n\nThe operative word here is consider. Maxing out your 401(k) contribution isn't for everybody. Your salary might not be high enough. Or you might have another opportunity to invest money outside your 401(k) to make even higher returns. Maybe so, but if you do not contribute to a retirement account, will you really make other investments, or will you simply spend the money on a larger house, a better car or more toys?\n\nThink about it.\n\nThe maximum annual 401(k) contribution is $18,000 a year, and you can contribute an additional $6,000 a year if you are at least 50 years old. Here's more information from the IRS.\n\nThat's a lot of money, especially for our example of a $75,000 salary, for which $18,000 in contributions would amount to 24%.\n\nBut you can start small. Let's say that, in our example, you begin by contributing 5% a year to take full advantage of the match. Over the years, as your salary increases or you get promoted or move on to higher-paying jobs, you might slowly increase your annual contributions. How about increasing it by at least 1% per year? Eventually you will be maxing out your contributions, without feeing too much pain in any one year.\n\nHere's another example, this time with a $100,000 annual salary. You still receive a 5% match for your contributions, but you also max them out at $18,000 a year.\n\nThe employer's 5% match comes to 28% of your annual contribution. That is a wonderful instant return on your investment, and a very high level of downside protection, if the stock market has a bad run.\n\nAnd here's a bit more icing on the cake. Check out this S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% chart:\n\nMarketWatch\n\nAs you can see, the three-year trend is favorable, despite the occasional decline. Decreases may be worrisome, especially if you look at the stock market's results every day. But your 401(k) contributions would continue to be made as long as your employer pays you, so you would have paid lower prices and beaten the market's overall return.

Forgot protectionism — if President-elect Donald Trump wants U.S. car makers to outdo the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz, then the American auto industry needs to step it up a gear, a top German minister has said.\n\nSigmar Gabriel, Germany's economy minister, was responding to Trump's warning in an interview that the country's auto makers will have to pay a 35% tax on every car imported into the U.S.\n\nSee:Some fear Trump will knock out economy, as others predict a modest boost\n\nWhen you walk down Fifth Avenue, everybody has a Mercedes-Benz parked in front of his house, Trump said in an interview with The Times of London and German tabloid Bild. How many Chevrolets do you see in Germany? Not many, maybe none, you don't see anything at all over there. It's a one-way street.\n\n 'The American car industry is getting worse, weaker and more expensive ... The U.S. needs to build better cars.'  — Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's economy minister\n\nGabriel — who as vice-chancellor, is seen as deputy to German leader Angela Merkel — responded by saying the U.S. should focus on building more attractive auto models, rather than penalizing competition.\n\nThe American car industry is getting worse, weaker and more expensive, Gabriel told Bild on Monday. If U.S. buyers are choosing German models, as Trump suggests, then that's why the U.S. needs to build better cars, he said.\n\nRead:Trump on the EU: 'Others will leave' the union\n\nTrump has been on a campaign to get U.S. auto makers such as Ford Motor Co. F, -1.58% and General Motors Co.

Shares of Daimler fell 2% on Monday, while BMW's stock 2.1% lower.\n\nWhile GM's Chevy brand doesn't have a big presence in Germany, the car giant's Opel unit last year said that its market share in Germany was roughly 8%. Mercedes-Benz and BMW each have achieved U.S. market shares of about 2%, according to Statista.

Dear Moneyologist,\n\nI'm planning to divorce my husband of eight years, as he's never worked in this time or contributed to bills. We live in California, a community property state. We live in a house which I bought before the marriage for $700,000, and it's appreciated to $1.2 million. I continue to pay my mortgage on it. I don't have much in savings, just $20,000, and $100,000 in retirement. Is there anything I can do to protect my money? Should I put extra money towards my car or house payments? Should I send money to my parents?\n\nUnlucky in California\n\nDear Unlucky,\n\nYou could do that, but a judge is likely to notice your sudden generous payments towards your mortgage and car loan, and could even penalize you for them. That's the kind of surreptitious action that has gone against others years after the fact. In 1996, a California woman won $1.3 million in the lottery and filed for divorce 11 days later. She didn't tell her husband or anyone else about her windfall, and two years later her husband found out about it (they always do) and sued her. Superior Court Judge Richard Denner ruled that she acted out of fraud or malice and awarded her husband all of her winnings. Had she been honest, they both would have walked away with half.\n\nListen to our new podcast:Money, Markets & More (or subscribe on iTunes): Walking a mile in dead men's shoes and Millennials tap home equity for frivolities.\n\nIn most divorce cases, especially in California which is a community property state, couples are instructed to divide their shared assets down the middle (in monetary terms) and, as part of that settlement, they're allowed to keep what they own personally, such as clothing and jewelry. In your state, you take out of the marriage what you brought into it, but this grows more complicated when a home has appreciated during a marriage and/or when marital assets were used to pay the mortgage (even though, in this case, your husband never actually worked). I'm not against your giving a little money to your parents if they need it for a specific reason, but not to hide it before your divorce is over. If you do have to split those savings, $10,000 is a small price to pay for your freedom. (Interestingly, I told a similar thing to a fellow earlier this week, who learned a $10,000 lesson.) One more consideration: You may need that $10,000 in savings for legal fees.\n\n You could spend your savings, but a judge is likely to see your sudden generous payments to your mortgage and car, and could even penalize you for them. That's the kind of surreptitious action that is likely to go against you in the long run.  — The Moneyologist\n\nWhat's more, the judge is likely to take into account that your husband never worked over this time, or paid the bills, and a good lawyer will make sure that's front and center in your divorce case should your husband's lawyer ask for alimony in lieu of you living in your house (sorry to bring that up). The upside: Alimony is tax-deductible for the payer and must be reported as income by the payee. Divide it all down the middle, start over and look to the future, says Randy Kessler, an Atlanta-based lawyer who wrote the book, Divorce: Protect Yourself, Your Kids, and Your Future. You should feel better that when the case is over, you will still have a job and can replenish so even if it is all divided, you will still be better off than him. It pays to have a good (and honest) divorce lawyer.\n\nThere are so many dirty deals that happen before people file for divorce. I recently heard of a case where a husband took $1 million equity out of the home that he lived in with his wife (his name was on the deed) shortly before they filed for divorce. That's the kind of paper trail that leads all the way back to a disgruntled judge in divorce court. I've had so many letters in recent months from or about people who want to pull a fast one: The wife who wanted to disinherit her stepchildren in the event that her husband of one year dies, and even a psychotherapist who wanted to be in cahoots with his client to cheat the insurance company.\n\nYou've lived honorably up until now and paid your own way and, yes, your husband was a mooch. Leave this marriage with your head held high and don't let him change who you are.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? Send them to MarketWatch's Moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nWould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new Moneyologist column has been published?

The recently enacted U.S. tax law restricts federal deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) to $10,000 — including local property and sales taxes as well as local income taxes. While this new restriction will have many implications, it will have a particularly draconian impact on states with large unfunded liabilities for pension benefits and retiree health care, in particular the residents of Illinois, Kentucky, Connecticut, and New Jersey.\n\nUnless states can implement effective ways to circumvent the SALT restriction, they will face much higher political barriers to meeting their unfunded benefit obligations through increased tax revenues. Instead, states will be forced to severely cut spending on public services and/or adopt major reforms of their benefit plans.\n\nA state has payment obligations from three main sources — interest on its outstanding bonds, unfunded liabilities for pension benefits, and unfunded liabilities for health care payments to state retirees (before Medicare at age 65). The interest on outstanding state bonds is relatively easy to estimate; the total outstanding amount of all state bonds was $500 billion in 2016. With the advent of improved accounting rules, it is now possible to compute the unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities of each state.\n\nThe table below summarizes the situation for each of four states with the highest unfunded liabilities relative to their revenues in 2016 — Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut and Kentucky. The data in the table come from the Investment Strategy Team at JP Morgan Asset Management.\n\nThe table shows the current obligations ratio for each state — the percentage of its revenues currently devoted to paying down its unfunded pension and retiree health care obligations plus interest on its state bonds. The table then compares that ratio to each state's full accrual obligations ratio. This latter ratio was calculated based on two reasonable assumptions — first, that state should pay down their unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities over 30 years, and, second, that annual investment returns of states would average 6% over this period.\n\nAs the table shows, the gap between the two ratios could be filled by increases in state tax revenues. To cover the gap, however, states would have to raise local taxes by an eye-watering amount — ranging from 14% in Connecticut to 26% in New Jersey.\n\nThese large increases in state revenues are not feasible, as illustrated by Illinois. To cope with its mammoth unfunded benefit obligations, Illinois has sharply raised tax rates on both individuals and businesses over the past few years. But higher tax rates in Illinois have backfired — driving local residents and firms to other states. In 2015, for example, Illinois lost $4.75 billion in adjusted gross income to other states, according to IRS data.\n\nFinancial instability, debt, and the American Dream\n\nThe new federal restrictions on SALT deductions ring the death knell for this strategy of raising state taxes to meet unfunded benefit obligations. For instance, middle-class residents of these four states are already paying effective tax rates of 9% to 12% — from local income, property and sales taxes. Since Congress has now limited SALT deductions to $10,000, residents of high-tax states are likely to push hard on their elected officials to lower local income and property taxes.\n\nStates could also deal with unfunded benefit obligations by making substantial cuts in non-retirement spending — between 13% and 24% of state revenues according to the table. But local voters will vociferously object to substantial cuts in public services in areas such as education, transportation, and police protection.\n\nThat leaves one more avenue for states to pursue — enacting benefit reforms. According to the table, if the funding gap were closed entirely by increases in worker contributions, that increase would have to be monumental — by at least 400% in each of the four states. Such an increase would not be acceptable to public unions, and further would not be legally permissible in many states because of constitutional protections for accrued pension benefits.\n\nYet there is a light at the end of this tunnel. The U.S. Supreme Court has opined that health care benefits of retirees may be legally modified at the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement – unless expressly guaranteed for life. So the scope of health care benefits and premium sharing by public retirees will become a subject of political negotiation between elected officials and public unions.\n\nReform of public pensions will be much more difficult. Although states may establish a different retirement system for their newly hired employees, this will take years to have much of a financial impact. Already accrued benefits are sacrosanct in most states — with the notable exception of reduced adjustments for costs of living, which have been allowed by many courts.\n\nThe big question: Will courts allow modifications of pension benefits with respect to future years of work by public employees? Historically, California has led the way in blocking such forward-looking pension changes. However, two California courts have recently allowed such changes as long as public employees still receive a substantial and reasonable pension.\n\nIn short, the new federal restriction on SALT deductions will open up a new window on reforming state benefit plans with large unfunded liabilities. As voters absorb the financial implications of the new restriction, they will probably oppose tax increases and service cuts to deal with these liabilities. Instead, they will pressure elected officials to renegotiate benefit plans to the extent legally permissible.\n\nRobert C. Pozen is a senior lecturer at MIT Sloan School of Management and a non-resident senior fellow of the Brookings Institution.
Stocks of movie-theater chains have suffered over the last few months, in part because the box office in 2016 isn't expected to match the record set in 2015, but RBC Capital Markets analyst Leo Kulp said things will look up once the market turns focus to 2017.\n\nIn a note on Tuesday, Kulp said his analysis suggests domestic box-office receipts will fall 4% in 2016 from 2015's $11.12 billion, due to fewer potential megahits — think trying to keep up with Comcast Corp.-owned CMCSA, -1.84% Universal Studio's Jurassic World and Walt Disney Co.'s DIS, -0.50% Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\n\nCheck out:Imax is adding 50% more cinemas in Japan\n\nKulp expects ticket sales to rebound in 2017, hitting $11 billion in revenue as anticipated megahits Star Wars: Episode VIII and Fast 8 are expected to be released, and that's one of the main reasons he holds an overall positive outlook for film exhibitors, as cinemas are called in the industry. Among them, he particularly likes AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC, +4.66% , which operates 4,937 screens located primarily in the U.S. The stock has dropped 22% over the last three months.\n\nWith a potentially stronger 2017 film slate, better exhibitor film rents — the amount theaters pay to studios per ticket sold to screen a movie — and the possibility of mergers and acquisitions throughout the sector, Kulp said AMC's stock is at a level that positions it to outperform its rivals. He upgraded the stock to outperform from sector perform, while lowering his 12-month price target to $27 from $32.\n\nThe stock has underperformed peers due to its limited liquidity and is now trading at a meaningful discount, Kulp wrote. We have a positive outlook on the 2017 box office that we think the market currently isn't focusing on, but will begin to around [the second quarter]. Given the below-peer multiple, we believe AMC has the most upside over the next 12 months.\n\nKulp is among the 15 analysts tracked by FactSet who have the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock; two say hold.\n\nShares of Regal Entertainment Group US:RGC, the nation's largest film exhibitor, are down about 10% over the past three months but have performed better than its peers, leading Kulp to downgrade the stock to sector perform from outperform and knock the price target to $19 from $24.\n\nSee also:Regal Entertainment Group decides against selling company\n\nLooking at others in the industry, Kulp dropped his 12-month price target for Cinemark Holdings Inc. CNK, -0.17% to $36 from $46, maintaining an outperform rating. He said Cinemark's underleveraged balance sheet provides opportunities, with growth in Latin America likely to outperform the domestic market. Cinemark pulls about a quarter of its revenue from Latin America, according to data gathered by FactSet.\n\nHe also cut his Carmike Cinemas Inc. US:CKEC price target to $27 from $32, but also maintained an outperform rating. Carmike, which has about 2,800 screens, generally in midsize communities, has the greatest upside of any other exhibitor from either buying another company or being bought, he said. The theater chain will also likely outperform peers as it institutes a tax-on-top pricing strategy — essentially a stealthy way to increase ticket and concession prices. Rather than an all-inclusive price of, for example, $5 for popcorn, the price would stay the same but no longer include tax. Kulp said AMC benefited from a similar strategy last year.
Treasury yields rose for the first time in six sessions on Monday, as traders returned from a long holiday weekend to the first trading day of 2018.\n\nTreasury prices extended a drop, pushing up yields, after the final reading of the Markit U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 55.1 versus a reading of 53.9 in November and a preliminary December reading of 55.0.\n\nBond trading was closed on Monday for the New Year's Day holiday.\n\nWhat are Treasurys doing?\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.682% rose 5.2 basis points to 2.461% from 2.409% on Friday. The yield is hovering at the same level it was a year ago.\n\nThe 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.402% advanced 6.7 basis point to 2.809% from 2.742% on Friday.\n\nShorter maturities also moved higher, with the 2-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.149% up 3.2 basis points to 1.915% from 1.883% on Friday.\n\nBond prices move in the opposite direction of yields.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nWith the economic calendar light on Tuesday, Treasury prices have taken their cue from U.S. equity markets, which began 2018 on a high note. The S&P 500 rose 0.8% to notch fresh record high at 2,695.79 on Tuesday.\n\nYields got a slight boost from better-than-expected manufacturing data. Traders will turn their focus on ISM manufacturing and monthly jobs report later in the week.\n\nThe rebound in yields follows five straight sessions of declines, when optimism about tax reforms that sent the 10-year yield to as high as 2.5% in late December fizzled out by the end of the last year.\n\nLong-dated Treasury yields, which rose during the second half of the last year, remained below their peaks in March, however, largely due to lack of inflation.\n\nWhat are market participants saying?\n\nWe maintain that the most exciting story during 2018 will be about the curve and as we approach the March FOMC meeting and odds of a hike firm, we'll be watching for the risk that the curve inverts more quickly than many expect, wrote Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets.\n\nThe bullish momentum in the Treasury market that commenced last week should prove to be the primary driver of the market in the days ahead and as such we're content to play for a continued bullish flattening of the curve, Lyngen said.\n\nWhich other assets are in focus\n\nEuropean bonds were also mostly higher. The Italian 10-year government bond yield TMBMKIT-10Y, 0.670% continued to climb, jumping 10.8 basis points to 2.097%.\n\nItalian bond yields rose sharply over the past three weeks as antiestablishment parties such as the 5 Star Movement have amassed broad support, according to opinion polls. The rising popularity of these parties raises the chance of a hung parliament, leading political inertia and delaying of reforms for one of the eurozone's economic laggards.\n\nMeanwhile German 10-year bond TMBMKDE-10Y, -0.294% was up 3 basis points to 0.464%.
McDonald's Corp. is a super-sized threat to the competition, with analysts highlighting the potential market-share losses other fast-food chains will suffer as McDonald's initiatives launch throughout the year.\n\nInstinet analysts named the fast-food giant its top U.S. restaurant pick for 2018 citing a number of factors, including the rollout of fresh-never-frozen beef for quarter-pound patties in nearly all of its restaurants by midyear.\n\nWith the test of new Archburgers in seven restaurants, fresh beef could be headed to burgers with different-sized patties as well, analysts say.\n\nThe company's new Dollar Menu, which includes a sausage burrito for $1, a Bacon McDouble at $2, and the Classic Chicken Sandwich for $3 and will be introduced nationwide in the coming days, is also seen as a potential boost to same-store sales.\n\nSee also:Chipotle, Domino's and other restaurant stocks haven't taken into account all the tax reform benefits\n\nHow the 'grocerant' is disrupting the $500 billion food industry\n\nIn addition to the initiatives highlighted in the Instinet note, McDonald's MCD, -0.54% is rolling out a new experience of the future at its restaurants, which includes digital ordering kiosks and table service.\n\nTaken together, Instinet analysts led by Mark Kalinowski think McDonald's is poised to snap up market share, particularly from Subway. Media reports say the sandwich chain is struggling with a 25% traffic decline in the last five years.\n\nSubway, which is privately held, is the third-largest U.S. restaurant chain, with Instinet estimating U.S. sales of $10 billion in 2017. Instinet thinks hundreds of Subway franchisees are in financial trouble, and would not be surprised to see hundreds of closures during 2018. Subway currently has more than 25,800 stores domestically, analysts say.\n\nRead:Chipotle's search for a new CEO may help it 'rediscover the magic,' says analyst\n\nSubway is clearly troubled, and this continues to represent a market-share opportunity for other quick-service concepts in the U.S. — including McDonald's, and arguable perhaps even to a greater degree than any other single quick-service concept, Kalinowski wrote.\n\nInstinet rates McDonald's shares buy and raised its price target to $190 from $180.\n\nAnalysts at BTIG also raised their McDonald's price target, to $200 from $175, based on some of the same efforts as those emphasized at Instinet, including the new Dollar Menu and mobile ordering and delivery.\n\nAfter several years of playing defense, we believe McDonald's is finally returning to an offensive strategy which will yield stronger comp growth and increased market share, wrote analysts led by Peter Saleh.\n\nThe Dollar Menu should help the company regain some of the 500 million transactions it has lost, adding a potential 125-to -175 basis points to same-store sales annually over the next several years, he added\n\nBTIG rates McDonald's shares a buy.\n\nDon't miss:Mobile orders are creating headaches for restaurant chains\n\nOne of the companies that Saleh thinks will suffer as a result of the McDonald's upswing is Jack in the Box JACK, -0.79% , which the team downgraded to neutral from buy.\n\nOur view of the strength of McDonald's initiatives around value, digital and food quality… leads to a dimmer view of competing concepts which we expect will be market share donors, Saleh wrote in a separate note. We recognize there are still positives to the Jack in the Box story including the finalized sale of Qdoba, refranchising and tax reform benefit, but the weaker sales outlook leads to a more balanced view of the shares and we are downgrading accordingly.
You don't always get what you pay for. But you don't often get much more.\n\nThis twist on an old saw serves as a good reminder for self-directed investors hunting online for stock ideas. That's because we're deep into a substance light era of online content, dominated by vapid Twitter rants, pesky blogs offering puff posts and a hollowed-out financial press corps.\n\nSure, sell-side analysts on Wall Street still write substantial research, which sometimes appears online. But you have to take it with a grain of salt. Under the same roof there's typically a division looking to do investment banking for the same companies that the analysts cover. Are the analysts really impartial?\n\nAll of this highlights the value of the humble stock newsletter writer — those scribes who charge a fee for what can often be high-quality, independent stock research.\n\nSure, I have a bias, because I write one of them: Brush Up on Stocks.\n\nBut quantitative analysis has shown that newsletter writers can be a profitable source of stock ideas. For years, financial columnist Mark Hulbert has painstakingly tracked dozens of newsletter writers. He's found many performed consistently well.\n\nHulbert tracks newsletter performance at Hulbert Ratings. I've followed his work for over 15 years to find the best stock letter writers for an annual roundup of their market outlook and favorite stocks. Several letter writers regularly hit the top of his rankings.\n\nHere are five newsletter writers and their two favorite picks for 2018, bringing the total to 10 stocks.\n\nGeorge Putnam, The Turnaround Letter\n\nAs the name suggests, Putnam is a deep-value investor looking for troubled companies that can right the ship.\n\nMarket outlook: Unsurprisingly, given his penchant for value, Putnam thinks the market looks pretty rich. He's also troubled by elevated investor sentiment.\n\nGiven that a lot of people have a rosy outlook, any surprises are likely to be negative, he says.\n\nOne problem is that investors in popular exchange traded funds (ETFs) and index funds haven't really researched the underlying stocks they hold. So they may lack the conviction to stick with them when the going gets rough. That could compound the selling.\n\nExchange traded funds and index funds have been spiraling up. If there is a stumble, they could spiral down just as rapidly, cautions Putnam.\n\nFavorite stocks: Shares of General Electric Co. GE, -2.65% have declined over 42% in the past 12 months to levels not seen since the late 1990s. Chalk it up to a string of disappointing quarters and a dividend cut. But the venerable industrial giant is not down for the count.\n\nUnder new CEO John Flannery, GE will hunker down in three core areas: aviation, health care and power. These are all sectors where GE has a strong position. Flannery plans to sell non-core assets, and focus on cost cutting to boost cash flow.\n\nI think they are doing all the right things, says Putnam. They have good franchises in the businesses they are going to stay in.\n\nNext, Putnam singles out the turnaround Weatherford International Ltd. US:WFT in oilfield services. Under prior management, Weatherford branched out into too many businesses, and took on too much debt to do so. That didn't work out so well. The stock now trades near an eight-year low. Under the new leadership of Haliburton Co. HAL, -5.05% veteran Mark McCollum, Weatherford is unloading non-core assets and paying down debt.\n\nThere is a lot of inefficiency to be shaken out, says Putnam.\n\nWeatherford's stock could produce big gains. Just remember, turnarounds require time — and patience.\n\nAlso see:Oilfield-services stocks are about to stage a big rebound, Credit Suisse says\n\nJohn Buckingham, The Prudent Speculator\n\nBuckingham invests in what he thinks are undervalued stocks with solid potential, both via managed accounts and his mutual fund, the Al Frank Fund VALUX, -0.95% .\n\nMarket outlook: Buckingham is an eternal optimist. But this year he's expecting no more than typical market returns of around 9%-10% for the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% , driven by continued economic strength, earnings growth and benefits from tax reform. He thinks value stocks will outperform this year, after a long spell of lagging growth stocks.\n\nFavorite stocks: Buckingham dislikes singling out favorites because he thinks diversification is crucial. But he plays along. One favorite is Walt Disney Co. DIS, -1.52% . Buckingham thinks the shares have been beaten down too far by investors overly worried about weakness in its ESPN division, and competition from Netflix Inc. NFLX, -3.75% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.44% .\n\nAfter all, Disney has great content, too, says Buckingham. And it's bulking up with a planned purchase of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox Inc. FOX, -0.12% .\n\nThey have history of making good acquisitions, he says, citing the purchases of Pixar Animation Studios and Lucasfilm. They have unparalleled content, and an unrivaled machine to monetize that content.\n\nBuckingham also likes the pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. MRK, -0.04% , whose stock has been hit by concerns about the prospects for cancer drug Keytruda, and upcoming competition as drugs roll off patent. Those worries have knocked Merck shares down to attractive levels. It trades for around 14 times forward earnings, compared with a 10-year average price-to-earnings multiple of 19.\n\nThat is too low, says Buckingham. This is one of the highest-quality pharmaceutical companies out there. He cites its strong pipeline of drug candidates and solid financial strength.\n\nKelley Wright, Investment Quality Trends\n\nWright favors high-quality companies, based on factors that include financial strength, and consistent dividend and earnings growth. Then he suggests them when they appear to be at relatively low valuations because their dividend yields are near historical highs. (When stocks decline, their dividend yields rise, barring dividend cuts.)\n\nMarket outlook: Wright thinks the S&P 500 could advance 8% to 10% in 2018, as long as the Federal Reserve doesn't hike interest rates and proceed with quantitative tightening too quickly.\n\nFavorite stocks: Plans in Washington, D.C., to increase spending on infrastructure have been overshadowed by tax reform. But Wright thinks infrastructure could be a big deal, especially for companies that will benefit. Two of them happen to look relatively cheap right now, because their dividend yields are not too far from historical highs.\n\nOne is Fluor Corp. FLR, -3.15% , in engineering and construction. Nobody can do big construction projects like Fluor, says Wright.\n\nNext, he likes Cummins Inc. CMI, -0.51% , which makes engines used in heavy construction equipment like earth movers.\n\nRichard Greifner, Motley Fool Inside Value\n\nGreifner looks for well-run companies whose shares are trading at attractive levels, to hold for the long term.\n\nMarket outlook: A core tenet at Motley Fool is that it's impossible to make market calls. So Greifner has none for 2018. If you have a long-term perspective with stocks, then the near-term market outlook doesn't really matter, says Greifner.\n\nFavorite stocks: Greifner singles out MRC Global Inc. MRC, -4.45% , a huge distributor of equipment used in energy production and industry, like pipes, valves and fitting products. The company has been cutting costs, paying down debt and repurchasing shares. Meanwhile, its customers are increasing their spending because of strength in energy and the economy. Greifner also likes Michaels Cos. MIK, -0.23% , a large arts-and-crafts retail chain. Unlike a lot of retailers, Michaels isn't beaten down by worries about competition from Amazon. But this makes sense, says Greifner, because customers like to see and touch crafts products before they buy them, to make sure they are right for the task at hand.\n\nMichael Brush, Brush Up on Stocks\n\nI watch insiders closely to look for the right kinds of buying patterns, according to a system I've developed over the years. Then from among those names, I favor companies with financial strength that look relatively cheap, as long as there's a plausible reason why business will improve. As a contrarian, I especially like stocks where insiders are challenging consensus negativity toward their companies either by investors or sell-side analysts. Unlike the letters above, I've never been ranked by Hulbert.\n\nMarket outlook: Investor sentiment is running high, a potential negative. But stocks overall still look reasonably valued given how low interest rates are. A selloff is possible at any time, given investor exuberance. But a recession is not on the horizon, so any significant weakness should present a buying opportunity.\n\nFavorite stocks: My favorite company and largest personal holding at the moment is Tellurian Inc. TELL, -7.25% , an undiscovered company that will become a big player in liquid natural gas (LNG) exports over the next few years. How do I know this? I don't, for sure. But it's a reasonably safe bet given that CEO and founder Charif Souki and his management team are responsible for creating 25% of the LNG export capacity around the globe.\n\nSouki founded Cheniere Energy LNG, -3.56% , a big company in the space. But he got edged out by investor Carl Icahn in a disagreement on how to use cash flow. Souki left and founded Tellurian, where he's developing an LNG export project he presumably would have launched inside Cheniere.\n\nI also recently suggested Lending Club Corp. LC, -0.85% , in part because of the huge buying by Chinese technology and internet expert Tianqiao Chen, who founded the online gaming company Shanda Interactive Entertainment years ago while he was in his 20s.\n\nHe owns around 20% of Lending Club, an online peer-to-peer lending platform. LendingClub recently tightened its lending standards, which hurt loan growth, so the company missed earnings estimates and guided down. But it still expects 15%-20% annual revenue growth over the next few years. This seems plausible given how many people with OK credit would like to refinance their credit card debt with loans. Lending Club estimates $300 billion to $350 billion in credit card debt could potentially be refinanced in this way.\n\nAt the time of publication, Michael Brush held TELL. Brush has suggested GE, DIS, NFLX, AMZN, MRK, FLR, TELL and LC in his stock newsletter Brush Up on Stocks. Brush is a Manhattan-based financial writer who has covered business for the New York Times and The Economist group, and he attended Columbia Business School in the Knight-Bagehot program.
Fear is on the rise. Wall Street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% Thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since Nov. 3, 2016, according to FactSet data. The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market. On Wednesday, the VIX also tipped higher on the heels of Trump's conference.
How close was the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday to hitting an eagerly awaited milestone? Less than six pennies. That is essentially the difference between oh-so-close and maybe-next-session for the blue-chip gauge's frustrating march to 20,000.\n\nThe Dow DJIA, -0.46% on Friday reached a high of 19,999.63, or about .37 point from achieving history—at least in psychological terms. In other words, a 5.5 cent move in any one of the price-weighted Dow's components would have tipped it over the edge, based on the Dow divisor of 0.14602128.
Q.: Dan. I have two daughters, 21 and 23, and their mom (my ex- wife) died March 2020. My daughters inherited 401(k) money as their mom was currently employed and they inherited IRA money too. I read an article you wrote concerning turning an inherited 401(k) funds into a Roth. I'm unsure of the process and can't really find any literature pertaining to the topic. Might you be able to help? Thanks, Jay\n\nA.: I'm so sorry for your family's loss, Jay. A few thoughts come to mind.\n\nIf the 401(k) was funded with pretax contributions, any amount converted will be taxable to them but converting to Roth could be a good move because at 21 and 23, they are likely in a low tax bracket. If they convert, invest prudently, and leave the funds alone, in 2030 they could get a good chunk of money tax-free at a time when they may be in a higher tax bracket.\n\nInherited IRA money cannot be converted to Roth IRAs, but it is allowable under the law to convert inherited 401(k) assets directly into Inherited Roth IRA accounts. The girls would each set up an Inherited Roth IRA account. Then they instruct the 401(k) to send their shares directly to their Inherited Roth IRA accounts. The checks should be made payable to the Inherited Roth IRA not your daughters as individuals. If they get a check individually, it is considered a distribution not eligible for rollover.\n\nThe amount converted is taxable income to the girls in the year of the conversion but once that is done, they can get any of those converted funds out tax-free at any time. The normal 5-year rule for conversions does not apply because the distribution from the 401(k) is due to the death of the participant.\n\nIf they do not withdraw all the amount converted before the fifth tax year after the conversion, they will then be able to get earnings out tax-free, too. Because their mother died after 2019, they could choose to leave the money alone and let it grow tax-free until 2030. At the end of that year, they must empty the account, but all the money received will be tax-free.\n\nOne complication for your daughters if they are still in school is the effect these funds may have on their financial aid. Generally, inherited retirement accounts are not counted as assets on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). However, income from such accounts, including income from a conversion can count. Even distributions from an Inherited Roth IRA that are not taxable can be counted as income for student aid purposes. If they are receiving financial aid, they should consult with an adviser to assess all the tradeoffs. They may want to delay taking any funds from the inherited accounts or converting.\n\nIf you have a question for Dan, please email him with 'MarketWatch Q&A' on the subject line.\n\nDan Moisand is a financial planner at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Orlando, Melbourne, and Tampa Florida.

The Dow and S&P 500 on Monday booked their sharpest daily drop in almost 10 weeks, with investors facing concerns around the potential for borrowing costs to rise, the spread of COVID-19 and the slow pace of the vaccine rollout.\n\nTo end 2020, the markets finished at or near records: The Dow added 1.4% in the final week of the year, 3.3% in December, 10.2% in the fourth quarter and 7.3% on the year. The S&P 500 rose 1.4% for the week, 3.7% in December, 11.7% in the fourth quarter and gained 16.3% for the year.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index saw its best annual return since 2009, rising 43.6% in 2020, aided by a 0.7% rise in the final week of 2020, a 5.7% in December, and a 15.7% in the final three months of last year.\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nStocks buckled under selling pressure as investors worried about the potential for U.S. rates to move higher as the American economy looks to recover from the pandemic.\n\nWhat I think is taking place is the 10-year Treasury break-even rate has exceeded 2% for the first time in more than two years, said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist, Capitol Securities Management, pointing to the closely watched gauge of what holders of Treasury inflation-protected securities anticipate inflation will average over the next decade.\n\nEvery selloff since 2009, except for March, has been because of higher rates, Engelke said, adding that Monday's climb in inflation expectations is being driven by the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, massive amounts of stimulus from the federal government and the potential for more spending from a Biden administration.\n\nIn other words, good news might be bad.\n\nBut on Monday, Chicago Federal Resere President Charles Evans said it likely will take years to get average inflation up to 2%, which means monetary policy will be accommodative for a long time, in a speech at the annual meeting of the American Economics Association. Evans said that Fed officials shouldn't settle for just getting inflation slightly above 2% if it wanted to achieve its 2% average inflation target.\n\nThis comes as the global tally for confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 rose above 85 million on Monday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while the death toll rose above 1.8 million. Some experts warned that the COVID data could be undercounted because staffing at many centers is reduced.\n\nThe rapid spread of a variant of the deadly pathogen that was first reported in Britain prompted the UK prime minister on Monday to order a new national lockdown until at least mid-February. Also raising anxieties are new aggressive variants reported in South Africa, New York, Colorado and California, where Gov. Gavin Newsome has extended regional stay-at-home orders remain in place as the vaccination effort continues.\n\nThe parabolic rise in new cases seems to be leveling off, a sign that perhaps the fall surge is running its course. But the economic impact will remain for a few more months at least, said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisors.\n\nStill, Meyer also expects markets to look past the pandemic's toll and focus on the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, which has come under scrutiny as the pace of the rollout has fallen short of earlier forecasts.\n\nU.S. vaccine czar Moncef Slaoui on Sunday said that the U.S. could increase its vaccine rollout by giving out half doses of the medication developed by Moderna MRNA, -5.43% . The biotechnology company on Monday said it was ramping up production of its COVID-19 vaccine for distribution in the U.S. and globally.\n\nWall Street also has been keeping an eye on Georgia's as runoff elections on Tuesday in which two U.S. Senate seats have the potential to inject fresh volatility into markets, particularly if the outcome sparks political turbulence in Washington around recent fiscal spending measures and easy-money policies out of the Federal Reserve.\n\nSome market participants say any complacency about the runoff among investors might be misplaced, namely if Democrats win both Senate seats and help President-elect Joe Biden reverse the corporate tax cuts of 2017, which could put company earnings and stock prices under some pressure.\n\nRead: Why the Georgia runoff elections for the U.S. Senate could turn into a 'big deal' for markets\n\nAnticipating the policy agenda of the incoming Biden administration is a key focus for investors in the new year, Jason Pride, chief investment officer, private wealth at Glenmede wrote in a team strategy note Monday. If the GOP wins just one seat, they will likely stonewall some of Biden's more ambitious proposals, but a Democratic sweep of both elections might give the incoming administration free rein on their policy agenda.\n\nCheck out: U.S. political polarization presents biggest 'risk' to the world in 2021: Eurasia Group\n\nInvestors saw fresh manufacturing sector data in Asia and Europe that was better than expected, reflecting improvement from the stultifying levels of economic expansion prevalent during the pandemic, according to surveys of purchasing managers for December.\n\nIn U.S. economic data, the final IHS Markit manufacturing survey for December was upgraded to a reading of 57.1, compared with an initial reading of 56.5. Construction spending rose 0.9% in November.\n\nWhich stocks were in focus?\n\nElectric car-battery developer QuantumScape Corp. QS, +5.00% plunged 40.8%, the most ever, on Monday, a day that saw stocks of EV makers soaring on sales news.\n\nShares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +3.68% ended shy of a new $700 billion market cap milestone, after trading above that level earlier Monday, with the stock price needing to close at or above $738.474, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nBrookfield Property BPY, +1.29% shares rose 17.6% after parent company Brookfield Asset Management offered $5.9 billion to buy out public shareholders in the entity for $16.50 per unit. Brookfield is a large, global holder of office properties and shopping malls.\n\nTeledyne Technologies Inc. TDY, +0.32% plans to acquire Flir Systems Inc. FLIR, +0.09% in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $8 billion. Teledyne was down 7.7%.\n\nHealth care insurer Centene Corp. CNC, -1.72% said Monday it has agreed to acquire Magellan Health Inc. MGLN, -0.19% for $95 a share, in a deal with an enterprise value of $2.2 billion. Centene Corp. shares advanced 3.4%.\n\nDentsply Sirona Inc. XRAY, +0.21% shares gained 2.7% after it announced its acquisition of Byte, a privately owned clear dental-aligner provider, in an all-cash deal valued at $1.04 billion.\n\nShares of U.K. gaming company Entain ENT, -0.20% jumped 17.6% after rejecting the proposed 1,383 pence per share bid from MGM Resorts MGM, +3.31% that valued the company at £8.09 billion.\n\nWhich assets were on the move?\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.659% was 0.2 basis point higher at 0.915%. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields.\n\nFebruary U.S. benchmark crude futures CL.1, -0.50% closed down nearly 1.9% at $47.62 a barrel, while gold GCG21 settled 2.7% higher at $1,946.60 an ounce.\n\nThe dollar was mostly flat against its major rivals, based on the ICE U.S. Dollar Index. DXY, +0.05%\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index FXXP00, +0.19% closed up 0.7%, and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 UKX, -0.60% climbed 1.7%. The Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.53% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.35% both close 0.9% higher, while Korea's Kospi 180721, +0.78% surged 2.5%.\n\nMark DeCambre contributed reporting
Chinese passenger-vehicle sales fell last year for the first time since 1990 as economic uncertainty weighed on consumers, producing a wreck for Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and other manufacturers.\n\nThe slump, shown in official data Monday, ended the growth that many foreign and domestic auto makers had expected to last for years to come. Facing saturation elsewhere, global auto makers have banked on China, the world's largest car market.
Who says you have to be an energy drink to advertise like one?\n\nCanada Dry, part of the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc. portfolio of brands, is making a push with the sporting crowd as the popularity of energy drinks grows among consumers. But it's not actually launching a new energy drink.\n\nThe ginger ale brand has previously pushed a message about relaxation in ads focused on the drink's ginger-farm roots. It's now turning to scenes from the gym for its latest spots, which will debut Monday on ESPN and NBC Sports. But the ads still hang on to their relaxation theme.\n\nConsumers are increasingly turning away from traditional carbonated drinks and toward beverages like energy drinks. Cowen & Company analysts suggested last month that Coca Cola Co. KO, -1.31% acquire the remaining stake in Monster Beverage Corp. MNST, -0.77% in order to take full advantage of this trend.\n\nWhile consumers are clearly showing increased concern over sugar consumption, the consumer has not rejected sugary beverages outright as we consistently see outsized growth for sugar beverage categories that also offer consumers a functional benefit to help justify that sugary beverage occasion, analysts wrote in a note.\n\nRead also:It's time to sell Coke and P&G stocks, Goldman says\n\nThe new ad also comes on the heels of an upgrade of Dr. Pepper Snapple US:DPS by Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile in general we do not favor large companies buying into growth, we believe the recently announced acquisition of Bai, should it close on announced terms, is a strategic fit that could bolster Dr. Pepper Snapple's sales growth and de-risk a potential distribution loss that could occur if Bai is sold to another company, the Monday note said.\n\nBai is a line of antioxidant beverages made with smart sweeteners like those from the Stevia leaf.\n\nAnalysts also believe that Dr. Pepper Snapple is well-positioned if tax policies change.\n\n[I]n the even broader tax policy changes occur as currently proposed, Dr. Pepper Snapple would be a relative beneficiary given its current high tax rate (35%), limited mismatch from a destination-based tax perspective, and low likelihood of sizeable incremental debt post the announced Bai acquisition, the note said.
WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden has selected Merrick Garland, a federal appeals court judge who in 2016 was snubbed by Republicans for a seat on the Supreme Court, as his attorney general, two people familiar with the selection process said Wednesday.\n\nBiden is expected to announce Garland's appointment on Thursday, along with other senior leaders of the department, including former homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco as deputy attorney general and former Justice Department civil rights chief Vanita Gupta as associate attorney general.\n\nIn picking Garland, Biden is turning to an experienced judge who held senior positions at the Justice Department decades ago, including as a supervisor of the prosecution of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nThe pick will force Senate Republicans to contend with the nomination of someone they spurned in 2016 — refusing even to hold hearings when a Supreme Court vacancy arose — but Biden may be banking on Garland's credentials and reputation for moderation to ensure confirmation.\n\nSee also: Warnock projected winner, while Ossoff clings to slim lead in second Georgia race\n\nGarland was selected over other finalists including Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates. The people familiar with the process spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIf confirmed, Garland would confront immediate challenges, including an ongoing criminal tax investigation into Biden's son, Hunter, as well as calls from many Democrats to pursue inquiries into Trump after he leaves office. A special counsel investigation into the origins of the Russia probe also remains open, forcing a new attorney general to decide how to handle it and what to make public.\n\nGarland would also inherit a Justice Department that has endured a tumultuous four years and would likely need to focus on not only civil rights issues and an overhaul of national policing policies after months of mass protests over the deaths of Black Americans at the hand of law enforcement.\n\nIt was unclear how Garland's selection would be received by Black and Latino advocates who had advocated for a Black attorney general or for someone with a background in civil rights causes and criminal justice reform.\n\nSee also: Big Tech Stocks Are Falling. Why the Possibility of a Blue Wave Raises Risks.\n\nGarland would also return to a Justice Department radically different than the one he left. The Sept. 11 attacks was years away, the department's national security division had not yet been created and a proliferation of aggressive cyber and counterintelligence threats from foreign adversaries have made counties like China, Russia and North Korea top priorities for federal law enforcement.\n\nBut some of the issues from Garland's first stint at the department persist. Tensions between police and minorities, an issue that flared following the 1992 beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, remain an urgent concern particularly following a summer of racial unrest that roiled American cities after the May killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nAnd the FBI has confronted a surge in violent from anti-government and racially motivated extremists. That is a familiar threat to Garland, who as a senior Justice Department official in 1995 helped manage the federal government's response to the bombing of a government building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. The bomber, Timothy McVeigh, who was later executed.\n\nGarland has called the work the most important thing I have done and was known for keeping a framed photo of Oklahoma City's Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in his courthouse office in Washington.\n\nAt the time of the bombing, Garland was 42 and principal associate deputy attorney general, a top lieutenant to Attorney General Janet Reno. He was chosen to go to Oklahoma City, the highest-ranking Justice Department official there, and led the prosecution for a month until a permanent lead prosecutor was named.\n\nGarland was selected over other contenders for the job including former Alabama senator Doug Jones, who lost his Senate seat last month, and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates.\n\nIt is rare but not unprecedented for attorneys general to have previously served as judges. It happened in 2007 when President George W. Bush picked Michael Mukasey, a former federal judge in Manhattan, for the job. Eric Holder, President Barack Obama's first attorney general, had also previously been a Superior Court judge.\n\nGarland was put forward by former President Barack Obama for a seat on the Supreme Court in 2016 following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but Republicans refused to hold hearings in the final year of Obama's term. The vacancy was later filled by Justice Neil Gorsuch during the Trump administration.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to let the nomination move forward in the Senate in the final months of Obama's tenure. He was criticized by Democrats this fall when he took the opposite approach toward confirming President Donald Trump's Supreme Court pick, Amy Coney Barrett. He said the difference this time around was that the White House and Senate were controlled by the same political parties.\n\nOne year later, after the firing of FBI Director James Comey, McConnell actually floated Garland's name as a replacement for that position, though Garland was said to be not interested.\n\nGarland has been on the federal appeals court in Washington since 1997. Before that, he had worked in private practice, as well as a federal prosecutor, a senior official in the Justice Department's criminal division and as the principle associate deputy attorney general.
Dear Moneyist,\n\nI have a question about the stimulus checks. I happened to have inherited my mother's house, so if I don't qualify, that's fine. I'm working. I have a coworker who works massive amounts of overtime, and owns 10 homes, nine of which are rented. How did he get a stimulus check?\n\nCurious Colleague\n\nThe Moneyist:My mother gave me a substantial financial gift. I gave it back. My soon-to-be ex-husband says half belongs to him\n\nDear Colleague,\n\nIf you don't need a stimulus check, and you don't qualify, leave it at that. You will drive yourself crazy peeking over the office silo wondering why somebody else got one, trying to size up their socioeconomic status like RoboCop. Today, it will be the colleague with 10 homes who is bragging about his/her stimulus check in the office and what they're going to spend it on. Tomorrow, it will be your neighbor. The day after that, you could be browsing the dark web. It's a slippery slope.\n\nThe economic impact payment does not measure how much is in your bank account. There is no way the government can browse the property records of every single American. It is an advance payment of a tax credit on your 2020 return, and that is used as a guide on how people are faring. If you are earning $75,000 a year as an individual or $150,000 a year as a couple, you qualify. After that there is a sliding scale, which bottoms out at $99,000 for an individual or $198,000 as a couple.\n\nThe Moneyist:My boyfriend's ex-wife claimed her 2 sons as dependents on her taxes, and received their stimulus checks, but they live with us\n\nNearly one-third of people who received a stimulus check last summer used it to pay bills and, in a Twitter poll TWTR, +1.37% of 889,000 people, over 60% said a $600 payment would not be enough to get by on. It's half of what folks got last time. Another YouGov poll said bills were the No. 1 priority for stimulus-check spending. It's alarming to look at how many Americans used these funds to keep a roof over their head and pay for necessities, said the report by YouGov.\n\nGiven that you have a job and can put food on the table and a roof over your head, not qualifying for a check is something to be grateful for. We could all look at people buying televisions, video games, sporting goods and toys at Walmart WMT, -0.83% , Costco COST, +0.59% and Target TGT, -1.00% and get mad when they say, Thank God for my stimulus! But there are many more people in the supermarket using the money for food, or writing checks to their electricity company.\n\nWe don't know what is going on with people when we look at them across the office kitchen and think, How did they get the last cup of coffee in the jar? How is that fair? I could kill for a cup of coffee. I've been looking forward to it all morning. They just had a coffee an hour ago. Maybe your colleague has a spouse at home with a serious illness, who hasn't worked in 10 years, or is swimming in debt on those 10 houses. Maybe he has a serious illness.\n\nSometimes (actually, make that often times) the greatest wisdom comes from children. In that spirit, listen to what this little tells her father when he asks to help undo her seat belt. That's the kind of spirit we need in a deeply polarized America right now. Be careful about coveting other people's stimulus checks, homes or even their lives. It's easy to believe we deserve more than our neighbor or, hell, even our identical twin, and how everything is easier for them.\n\nThe truth, however, is that we never really know.\n\nThe Moneyist: I earned $100,000 in 2019, but far less in 2020. Why did I not get a stimulus check? How is that fair?\n\nYou can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nWant to read more?Follow Quentin Fottrell on Twitterand read more of his columns here
As we enter the new year it's a good time to reflect on major life changes that may have occurred for you and your family during the past year.\n\nChanges like; a marriage, birth of a child, death of a family member, a change in health status, divorce, change of jobs, caring for a special needs child, entering retirement, charitable giving decisions, selling of a primary residence or investment property. Any one of these events could trigger the need to revise your estate plan by making adjustments to your will or creating an amendment to your trust or reassigning beneficiary(s); both primary and contingent.
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak on Tuesday unveiled a fresh £4.6 billion ($6.2 billion) support package for struggling U.K. businesses, just hours after the government imposed a third lockdown in the country to curb a rapid rise in coronavirus cases.\n\nBusinesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors will be able to claim up to £9,000 ($12,235) in one-off grants to help them cope with the latest restrictions, which were announced late on Monday night by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nUnder the new lockdown, all hospitality venues and nonessential shops must remain closed until at least mid February, heaping more pressure on those already-struggling sectors.\n\nThe new lockdown grants are expected to benefit more than 600,000 business properties across the U.K., and will be worth around £4 billion, the treasury said. A further £594 million will be made available to local authorities and devolved administrations to support businesses not eligible for the grants.\n\nRead: Third national lockdown confirmed as new variant spreads across England\n\nThe new strain of the virus presents us all with a huge challenge — and whilst the vaccine is being rolled out, we have needed to tighten restrictions further, Sunak said in a statement. This [support package] will help businesses to get through the months ahead — and crucially it will help sustain jobs, so workers can be ready to return when they are able to reopen, he added.\n\nThe new one-off grants come in addition to billions of existing business support, including grants worth up to £3,000 for closed businesses, and up to £2,100 a month for impacted businesses once they reopen.\n\nSunak said in November that government support measures to that date to help businesses cope with the COVID-19 pandemic would cost about £280 billion this financial year.\n\nNews of the cash injection lifted shares in pub groups Marston's MARS, -2.23% and Mitchells & Butlers MAB, -2.87% , which rose 2.39% and 2.43% respectively in London trading on Tuesday morning. Restaurant Group RTN, -1.50% , which operates 350 restaurants and pubs across the U.K. including the Frankie & Benny's and Wagamama chains, saw its stock rise 3.69%.\n\nRead: European markets slide as new lockdown measures set to take effect in the U.K. and Germany\n\nBusiness leaders welcomed the support package, but warned that on its own, the support wasn't enough to keep businesses afloat longer term.\n\n This is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills  — Kate Nicholls, CEO, UKHospitality\n\nWhile this announcement is most welcome, make no mistake that this is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills — it is not enough to even cover the costs of many businesses and certainly will not underpin longer-term business viability for our sector, said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality.\n\nTo address the inevitable and existential challenges that hospitality faces, we need confirmation of extensions to the business rates holiday and of the 5% VAT [value-added tax] rate, she added.\n\nThe U.K.'s hospitality sector suffered lost sales of more than £53 billion ($72 billion) in 2020 due to the impact of coronavirus restrictions on trade, according to a data report by CGA and UKHospitality published in December.\n\nAdam Marshall, director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said on Twitter TWTR, +1.37% that ministers need to set out a clear support package for the whole of 2021 — not just until spring — to help businesses of all shapes and sizes survive this difficult and uncertain year.\n\nRoger Barker, director of policy and corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, said the new cash injection would go some way to reassuring the worst affected businesses, but warned that the chancellor must remain wary of a spring cliff-edge in business support as the furlough program and other support measures unwind.\n\nRead: Europe hopes next COVID stimulus will be the last
Ford Motor Co. F, +1.06% said Tuesday it expects a record 2015 pre-tax profit, around the upper range of the car maker's guidance of $10 billion to $11 billion. The results for 2016 are expected to be equal to or higher than 2015, the car maker said. The company also declared a supplemental dividend of 25 cents a share, which would be on top of first-quarter dividend of 15 cents a share. Ford said it plans another active product year with 12 global car product launches, including a new Ford Focus electric, with a projected 100-mile range. Shares of Ford fell 1.6% in late trading Tuesday after ending the regular trading day up 0.6%.
There's a lot written about converting a traditional IRA to fund a Roth IRA, and with good reason.\n\nThe benefits of owning a Roth IRA are nothing short of amazing. A Roth grows without any taxes and all amounts withdrawn are tax-free.\n\nThe problem is that it's difficult to get money into a Roth. That's because you have to pay taxes today on the amount you choose convert from a regular IRA.\n\nThe taxes are due in the year you convert at your regular income-tax rate. If you move a large sum all at once that can bump you into a higher tax bracket.\n\nConverting in smaller amounts for several years is a wise move, but even then your income will be higher every year. Because taxes are progressive, you end up paying your highest personal tax rate on those converted IRA dollars.\n\nRoth 'sweet spot'\n\nFor that reason, people often go online and use a Roth IRA calculator to try to figure out if converting is worthwhile for them.\n\nYet Roth calculators can be of little use. You have to know your tax rate in the future, which is difficult to estimate. Tax rates could rise or fall, and your future income might be more or less than you expected.\n\nWhat can you do to get the biggest bang for your buck? Plan today to hit the Roth sweet spot.\n\nThis is when an individual has stopped working, is not taking Social Security, and income has dropped to close to zero. Sometimes there is income from dividends in a taxable account or rental property, but broadly speaking they've hit a dramatic income trough.\n\nNaturally, their income-tax rate dives just as dramatically.\n\nThis is a wonderful opportunity to take advantage of converting to a Roth before one turns 70.\n\nWhy 70? Because after that age the government forces us to take money out of traditional IRAs and 401(k) plans and pay income taxes on those withdrawals.\n\nThis is known as a required minimum distribution (RMD) and it happens every year after age 70½, increasing each year.\n\nHow to avoid the biggest 401(k) mistakes\n\nTax-rate trough\n\nFor people in their early 60s but not yet 70 who are in an income trough, I suggest working with their CPA to suggest an appropriate amount to convert year by year.\n\nThis can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in a Roth IRA by the time one turns 70.\n\nAn extra bonus is that, after 70, owners of Roth IRAs are not required to make yearly RMDs on those contributions, unlike with a traditional IRA.\n\nSo now they have money that is literally tax-free forever, will grow tax-free forever, and which is not subject to IRS distribution rules.\n\nAnyone who is in this situation in their 60s should carefully consider this strategy to fund a Roth IRA while they are in an income and tax-rate trough.\n\nHitting the Roth sweet spot can make a huge difference in your retirement lifestyle and your legacy — everything that matters financially in retirement.
Clinton Nominates Reno at Justice By Ruth Marcus\n\nWashington Post Staff Writer\n\nFriday, February 12, 1993; Page A01 President Clinton yesterday named veteran Miami prosecutor Janet Reno to be his attorney general, selecting a woman he described as a front-line crime fighter of unquestioned integrity to fill the vacancy that has plagued the first three weeks of his administration. Announcing his nomination in a Rose Garden ceremony, Clinton said his selection had been guided somewhat, but not entirely by the desire to name the first female attorney general. Clinton said the position was not set aside for a woman and that he seriously considered at least four men for the job. But he said that he thought it would be a good and an interesting thing to do to name a woman to the position and said that if he had it to do over again, I would have called Janet Reno on November the 5th. In December, Clinton nominated corporate lawyer Zoe E. Baird, who was forced to withdraw because she had violated immigration and tax laws in hiring illegal immigrants. He was poised to name federal judge Kimba M. Wood before she withdrew last week after the disclosure that she had also employed an illegal immigrant to care for her child. Reno, who is not married and has no children, said, I've never hired an illegal alien and I think I've paid all my Social Security taxes, adding with a smile, Certainly in the vetting process in the last week, we've covered everything. An administration official said Clinton decided yesterday morning to name Reno, after interviewing her Tuesday. The Florida native, 54, turned aside a question about how she felt about being appointed to a position that was seen as having been reserved for a woman, saying simply, I'm just delighted to be here and I'm going to try my level best. She said her efforts would include restoring civil rights enforcement as one of the top priorities of the department, seeking to protect America's children from abuse and violence and establishing diversion programs to give nonviolent offenders a new start while incarcerating dangerous and career criminals. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said he welcomed the nomination and would schedule a hearing as expeditiously as possible. But committee sources said they did not expect a hearing before next month. Reno, who once swore I would never be a prosecutor because I thought they were more interested in securing convictions than in seeking justice, has been the elected chief prosecutor in Dade County since 1978. She supervises a 900-person office that handles more than 120,000 cases annually. Reno's start in the job was marred by riots that broke out after the 1980 acquittal of four police officers in the beating death of black insurance agent Arthur McDuffie. She has also been criticized for losing several high-profile public corruption cases and for failing to bring charges in other local scandals. But after her appointment to the position, she waged five successful campaigns for the job – a fact noted admiringly by Clinton yesterday -- and worked to cement good relations with the black and Hispanic communities in Miami. She pushed for a special court to handle drug cases, cracked down on parents who fail to pay child support and presided over the expansion of the county prosecutor's office into one of the largest in the country. Noting that Reno's phone number is listed – unusual for a prosecutor -- Clinton said, She has lived the kind of life in real contact with the toughest problems of this country that I think will serve her very well as the nation's chief law enforcement officer. Before becoming state attorney, Reno was a partner in a prestigious Miami firm that, she noted in a 1984 book on women lawyers, had first refused to hire her after she graduated from Harvard Law School in 1963 because she was a woman. Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Reno offered forthright answers that contrasted with Baird's reticence when Clinton nominated her to the position Dec. 24. She said she was personally opposed to the death penalty but probably asked for it as much as any prosecutor in the country and will advocate for it as the law of the land in particular situations. She described herself as pro-choice on abortion rights and – asked if she considers herself a feminist – said, My mother always told me to do my best, to think my best and to do right, and to consider myself a person. Women's rights groups expressed delight with the selection of a woman who Women's Legal Defense Fund President Judith L. Lichtman described as a stellar attorney with an extraordinary track record. The lesson of the agonizing nomination process, said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center, is that there are superb women as well as men who can serve the country with distinction and having someone like Janet Reno in charge of the Justice Department is a wonderful step forward. But the American Family Association of Florida, a conservative Christian group, said it would oppose Reno's nomination because of what it called her deplorable record on prosecuting pornography cases. Since Reno took office, said organization President David Caton, Dade County has become stomping grounds for pornographers. In turning to Reno, Clinton departed from the practice of most presidents who choose either close advisers or nationally known figures. Clinton said he settled on Reno – whose extensive criminal law background also distinguishes her – because he wanted someone with management as well as legal experience, and who had dealt with a wide range of real-world problems. He said he had known of Reno for some time because his brother-in-law Hugh Rodham is a public defender in the drug court that Reno established. But he said he did not pursue her as a possible candidate because of her lack of federal experience. But the more I dug into it and the more I talked to people about it and the more I realized that you couldn't be the state's attorney in Dade County for 15 years without having enormous exposure to a wide range of issues that the Justice Department deals with . . . , he said.

Her most lasting legacy may be a sweeping directive governing how schools handle allegations of sexual assault and harassment. Those rules, which give more due-process rights to the accused, will be difficult to unwind, though President-elect Joe Biden has said he will try.\n\nAD\n\nShe also used executive authority to roll back Obama-era guidance on affirmative action and to require college campuses to recognize free-speech rights.\n\nAD\n\nOther DeVos priorities required legislative action, and she was able to move almost none of them through Congress.\n\nIf you want to make lasting changes in public policy, you need to enact laws, said Terry Hartle, senior vice president for government relations with the American Council on Education, which represents colleges and universities. If you're going to live by executive-branch action, you die by executive action. That's the world we live in.\n\n\n\nDeVos was a stalwart ally to Trump, even as White House aides whispered that the president did not think much of her. She rarely said anything that could be read as criticism of Trump until Thursday, when she resigned with 13 days remaining, to protest his role in igniting a mob that breached the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAD\n\nThere is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me, she wrote in her resignation letter to Trump.\n\nAD\n\nHer last day was Friday. It has been a privilege to serve America's students alongside you, she wrote in a brief goodbye note to the Education Department staff Friday morning.\n\nHer final chapter was a consequential one, as the coronavirus pandemic shut down U.S. schools. DeVos joined Trump in pushing schools to reopen for in-person learning, with mixed success. Some experts agreed with her, fearing remote learning is leaving many children behind. Critics noted that the federal government failed to provide schools with clear guidance or funding that would have made it easier to open doors.\n\nAD\n\nBefore and during the pandemic, DeVos trained her focus on what conservatives call school choice policies, which allocate taxpayer money to families who choose alternatives to traditional public schools. For DeVos, that includes private schools, religious schools, parent-organized pods, home schooling and charter schools of all sorts.\n\nAD\n\nShe branded it education freedom and suggested federal dollars to support traditional schools had been wasted. When the pandemic hit, DeVos saw the failure of some schools to open doors as evidence that parents needed taxpayer-supported alternatives.\n\nIn an interview last month with Frederick Hess, director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, she was asked what her most significant accomplishment was. Hands down, it's changing the national conversation around what K-12 education can and should be, she replied.\n\nAD\n\nHer work was welcomed by conservatives who argue that power over education belongs with parents, not systems.\n\nNot beholden to the education establishment and teachers unions, Betsy was clear from the beginning that she was the secretary of education, not just traditional public education, said Kay C. James, president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that DeVos and her husband have supported through their family foundation.\n\nAD\n\nHer supporters note that several states have expanded school choice programs and say DeVos's advocacy made a difference in the public debate. But the issue went almost nowhere in Washington.\n\nShe'll be remembered as an unapologetic voice for expanded school choice, and I think after racking up no legislative victories over the past four years, it's hard to see a lot of concrete impact of that, Hess said in an interview.\n\nAD\n\nHer signature proposal would have created a type of federal school voucher program, in which donations to state scholarship programs would be reimbursed in the form of federal tax credits. It garnered GOP support in Congress but was opposed by Democrats, who control the House, and some Republicans.\n\nDeVos has said she regrets not pushing the issue harder earlier in Trump's term, when Republicans controlled the House and the Senate. Her best chance was probably in a sweeping tax bill, signed in 2017, but the White House did not include school choice proposals even in its blueprint for the bill.\n\nShe also tried to funnel additional dollars from a pandemic relief bill to private schools. That effort was blocked by a federal judge, and even some Republicans called it misguided.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDeVos advocates for a light touch from the federal government when it comes to education, and she shrunk the size of the Education Department workforce by 11 percent, as of June, declining to fill positions. She seemed more comfortable leaning down to talk with children on school visits than interacting with official Washington.\n\nThe White House proposed annual budgets slashing the Education Department's funding, and DeVos defended them on Capitol Hill, although Congress — even when controlled by Republicans — rejected the cuts.\n\nThe result was an annual drubbing of DeVos by congressional committees in service of proposed cuts that were never going to happen anyway. That was never more painful than in 2019, when DeVos absorbed three days of hits over a proposal to cut funding for the Special Olympics that the White House had insisted upon, only to watch as Trump dramatically announced that he was restoring the funding.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHer tenure also will be known for rolling back Obama-era civil rights protections, including those aimed at protecting transgender students and eliminating racial disparities in school discipline rates. Under DeVos, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights jettisoned most systemic investigations, focusing instead on clearing a significant backlog of cases.\n\nCritics said she failed to protect students' civil rights. Speed is not the measure of whether justice is served, said Liz King, senior director of the education equity program at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Secretary DeVos's primary legacy is an agenda of discrimination and exclusion.\n\nIn higher education, her most consequential work involved regulating how colleges and other schools investigate sexual harassment and assault under the federal civil rights law known as Title IX. Earlier in her term, DeVos rescinded less formal guidance issued by the Obama administration. The new regulation, published last year, carries the force of law.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt creates a clear but controversial road map to navigating these highly charged investigations, including mandating a judicial-like process in which the accused has the right to a live hearing and to cross-examine accusers. Supporters say it provided much-needed due-process protections. Opponents argued it would allow assailants and schools to escape responsibility and discourage victims from coming forward.\n\nUnraveling it would require legislation or another complex rulemaking process.\n\nThis is an extraordinarily big, complicated task, said Hartle, of the American Council on Education, which opposed the rule. He expects the Biden administration to roll it back but said that will not be quick or easy, partly because the regulation is complex and has many elements. You can't do this by fiat. You have to go through a regulatory process.\n\nAD\n\nDeVos quickly proved herself an ally of for-profit colleges by withdrawing, delaying or announcing plans to revamp more than a half-dozen Obama-era measures that affected the industry, all within her first year. The secretary tapped former for-profit college executives to marshal higher-education policies that critics say gave predatory schools a pass.\n\nDeVos hired for her team a group of former for-profit college executives, and they worked to dismantle all the protections, block debt relief for ripped-off students, and ensure that federal dollars kept flowing to the worst colleges, said David Halperin, an attorney who has been critical of the for-profit industry.\n\nDeVos was also a fierce critic of the Obama administration's consumer regulations, accusing her predecessor of putting taxpayers at risk with policies that made it too easy for college students to shirk their financial responsibilities. She once complained that all one had to do was raise his or her hands to be entitled to so-called free money.\n\nIn her first year in office, she delayed an Obama-era regulation that granted loan forgiveness to borrowers who had been defrauded by their colleges, known as borrower defense to repayment. Her move was challenged in court and in Congress but took effect in July. It limits the time borrowers have to apply for relief and requires they prove financial harm.\n\nHer legacy is clearly one of disdain for the public good in higher education, students' rights and lawful proceedings of government, said Toby Merrill, director at the Project on Predatory Student Lending, a legal-aid group.\n\nDeVos was also sued by former Corinthian Colleges students, angry that their debts had not been fully forgiven. DeVos refused to change course and was held in contempt by a federal judge for violating an order to stop collecting loan payments.\n\nIt took nearly four years for DeVos to dismantle Obama-era consumer protection rules. The Biden administration could restore many of those policies in much less time, but some will be easier than others to revive.\n\nRestoring the 2016 borrower defense rule would require negotiated rulemaking at the Education Department, a process that could take months, if not longer. The same is true for restoring the gainful-employment regulation, which penalizes career-training programs for producing too many graduates with more debt than they can repay.\n\nIn the meantime, the Biden administration could clear out the backlog of borrower defense claims using a more generous methodology for approval and loan forgiveness.
The reversal came as the Trump administration tries to rapidly get stimulus payments out to Americans in the face of the quickest economic decline in modern history.\n\nAD\n\nSocial Security recipients who are not typically required to file a tax return need to take no action, and will receive their payment directly to their bank account, said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.\n\nAD\n\nThe $2.2 trillion aid legislation, passed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, directed the Treasury to look at Americans' 2019 or 2018 tax returns to determine if they are eligible for a payment. But the law also said Treasury should look at Social Security data for seniors and the disabled.\n\nCriticism poured in after the IRS posted a notice on its website on Monday instructing Social Security recipients who do not normally send in a return to file a simple tax return, which would be available soon.\n\nAD\n\nMore than 15 million Americans on Social Security do not file an annual tax return because their income is so low, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nForty-one Democratic senators sent the White House a letter Wednesday asking why the Trump administration is placing this significant burden on senior citizens and the disabled. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri called it ridiculous.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the last recession, when the U.S. government sent most Americans a stimulus check and required a filed tax return to get it, 3.5 million Social Security recipients were left out because they never sent a return, according to a 2008 Treasury Department analysis.\n\nAD\n\nThere were concerns that even more people won't file during the pandemic. But the Trump administration ultimately reversed course.\n\nSpeaking at the coronavirus task force briefing on March 17, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced plans to send checks to struggling businesses. (The Washington Post)\n\nMnuchin said direct deposits should begin by April 17, followed by checks in the mail. About 60 percent of tax filers gave the IRS direct-deposit information in recent years, said Nicole Kaeding of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. The IRS said there would soon be a web-based portal for people to update their direct-deposit information.\n\nBeyond the tax-filing hurdle, millions of other Americans are realizing that they don't qualify for a coronavirus relief check.\n\nMost high school seniors and college students won't get any money. The bill gives nothing to families for their children older than 16, a shock to many households already reeling from canceled graduations, and college students readjusting to life at home with so many universities shut down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany immigrant families are also learning that they are ineligible. In order for anyone in the family to receive a payment, each person in the household — including children — is supposed to have a valid Social Security number.\n\nNick Guerrero of Mesa, Ariz., has learned that he's one of those who won't be getting any money because he's 18, another blow to his senior year of high school that is quickly unraveling.\n\nOn Sunday night, Guerrero was video chatting with a dozen friends and they laughed at the thought of having to hold a virtual prom and getting their high school diplomas via email. It still seemed unreal. On Monday, they woke up to the news that school was canceled for the rest of the year in Arizona.\n\nAD\n\nIt was like a shot to the heart, Guerrero said.\n\nSome of his friends have lost their after-school jobs. He planned to get one soon to help save for college, but that is no longer possible. He has been applying for college scholarships, but some applications require him to use a fax machine or send a hard copy of his paperwork, and he no longer has access to the school printer.\n\nAD\n\nMoney is tight and his family had to borrow from a relative to pay for his Advanced Placement tests this spring. His parents — an education professor and a golf coach — expect to receive the government relief payment in April, which should help, but they won't get $500 for him.\n\nAD\n\nGuerrero trades text messages on a chain with about 25 friends — classmates he hasn't seen since spring break started on March 6. Each day brings more harsh news about people they know getting sick and families hurting for money. His mom's phone pings frequently with SOS messages from college students who can't pay their rent.
Emancipation Day usually is celebrated April 16, the date in 1862 when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act, which freed about 3,100 slaves living in the District.\n\nAD\n\nBut this year, April 16 falls on a Sunday, so the District will celebrate the holiday the following day. D.C. holidays are treated as federal holidays for tax-filing purposes, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nAD\n\nThat pushes the official tax-filing deadline to the next business day, April 18. And, everyone — residents of Florida, California and everywhere in between — will receive an extension, not just D.C. residents.\n\nWhen April 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, a return is considered timely filed if it is filed on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, IRS spokesman Ubon Mendie said in an email last year. The term 'legal holiday' includes a legal holiday observed in the District of Columbia.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, the country had a three-day reprieve on filing taxes because April 16 fell on a Saturday, so the District celebrated the holiday on April 15, a Friday. That moved the tax filing deadline to Monday, April 18.\n\nThe country had a similar reprieve in 2007 because of Emancipation Day.\n\nD.C. government shuts down for Emancipation Day, although the federal government and most businesses in the city remain open. In 2000, then-D.C. Council member Vincent B. Orange Sr. (D-Ward 5) prepared legislation — which the council passed unanimously and then-Mayor Anthony A. Williams (D) signed — declaring April 16 D.C. Emancipation Day, a legal private holiday. The day was officially observed for the first time as a public holiday, one that closed the city government, in 2005.\n\nThe holiday is marked by a parade in which city leaders and schoolchildren march along Pennsylvania Avenue. This year, the rest of the country also might learn about the District holiday.
MAYOR MURIEL E. BOWSER (D) took painstaking care in pointing out to the D.C. Council her grave concerns with legislation establishing an extravagant paid family leave program for people who work in the District. One of the largest tax increases in recent city history, she wrote the council, would be imposed to establish one of the largest government agencies, which would mostly benefit non-D.C. residents, while people who live in the city but work outside it or for the federal government would get nothing. Pretty convincing arguments to veto the bill — but instead Ms. Bowser took the easy way out, at least for her, and decided to let the bill become law without her signature.\n\nIn trying to have her cake and eat it, Ms. Bowser proved to be just as feckless as the council in setting up the city for enormous fiscal risk. In truth, she may have been even more irresponsible, since some council members seemed to sincerely (but naively) think they were doing the right thing. Instead of being worried about the politics if her veto were not sustained, Ms. Bowser should have stood up for the principles articulated in her letter.\n\nWe — like Ms. Bowser — have never questioned the desirability of giving families the time off they need to care for newborns or tend to ailing parents. But the District's plan that is set to be enacted into law, barring interference from Congress, is expensive and ill-designed and, in the opinion of the city's chief financial officer, presents multiple risk factors. Not only do most of the benefits go to Maryland and Virginia residents, many of whom already get employer-provided leave, but also it is unclear if a government that still struggles to provide some basic city services is capable of pulling off a program unprecedented in its complexity.\n\nWhat is most maddening is that better alternatives exist, including some being developed by the business community that would target resources to the workers most in need without a vast new bureaucracy. They also have the advantage of being able to be implemented far sooner than the 2020 start envisioned under the council's bill.\n\nSo manifest are the problems that it appears Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) may be having a bit of buyer's remorse. After the mayor announced she would not veto the bill, he signaled a willingness to revisit and perhaps refine parts of it. Had he been hoping a mayoral veto would get him off the hook for ramming such a bad bill through the council? Did it suddenly dawn on him the challenges the city faces in coming up with $40 million to $80 million to design a first-of-its-kind technology infrastructure; hiring 113 new government workers with the expertise to implement and administer the program; and finding a place to house both?\n\nIt is not too late for the council to undo its mistake and start to act responsibly. We urge it to do so.
The same year, Gregg Berhalter, coach of the middling U.S. men's squad, received $304,113 in base salary and a substantial bonus — except he had been on the job for only a month.\n\nThose figures came to light this week in the U.S. Soccer Federation's latest tax form. They illustrate a significant, if narrowing, pay gap between the head coaches of senior national teams with differing levels of success.\n\nAD\n\nThey also come as the U.S. women's players prepare for an unrelated court case this spring involving a gender discrimination suit against the nonprofit governing body.\n\nAD\n\nTax records show Berhalter, a former MLS coach, received a $200,000 signing bonus upon accepting the offer in fall 2018, plus $104,113 in salary and moving expenses after starting the job in December.\n\nHis 2019 annual salary was not specified, but based on the latter figure, he was to make between $1 million and $1.2 million.\n\nA USSF spokesman said the organization did not want to comment on the salary differences. The latest 990 tax form is for the fiscal year from April 2018 through March 2019, but the USSF said salaries are for the entirety of 2018.\n\nBruce Arena collected $1.275 million ($900,000 base salary) for 9½ months of work in 2017 before stepping down after the U.S. men's team failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. He received a $300,000 settlement.\n\nAD\n\nBetween Arena's departure and Berhalter's appointment, interim coach Dave Sarachan made about $240,000 from January through November 2018, tax records show.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. men have not advanced past the World Cup's round of 16 since 2002, though the number of fully invested programs in the men's game dwarfs the women's game and the pathway to a World Cup berth is much more difficult for the American men.\n\nEllis, who stepped aside last year after 5½ years of service and consecutive World Cup titles, had a base salary of $291,029 in 2017 and close to $390,000 the next year.\n\nIn the run-up to the World Cup, she received another raise, which did not fall within the time-frame of the latest tax records. Estimates placed her base salary at $500,000. She did not receive a bonus for success in the World Cup qualifying tournament but did earn considerable bonuses for winning the World Cup.\n\nAD\n\nThose figures, as well as new coach Vlatko Andonovski's salary, will appear on next year's tax records.\n\nAD\n\nEngland's Phil Neville is believed to be the second-highest-paid women's coach in recent years with a base salary of at least $350,000.\n\nThe highest-paid U.S. coach in 2018, though, was someone long out of a job: Jurgen Klinsmann, the men's boss who was fired in fall 2016. Because he had a long-term contract, the federation had to make payments of $3.35 million in 2017 and $1.475 million in 2018, totaling more than $4.8 million, tax records show.\n\nThe 2018 records also show full-time players on the women's team received about $170,000 in base salary (for playing for both the U.S. squad and a National Women's Soccer League team) and up to $146,000 in bonuses, tied to appearances, performance incentives and qualifying for the World Cup.\n\nAD\n\nThe rewards for winning the World Cup are dictated by the collective bargaining agreement between the players and federation. Those figures have not been disclosed but reportedly top out at $110,000 apiece.\n\nFIFA, the sport's global governing body, paid $30 million in bonuses at the Women's World Cup last year, including $4 million to the winner.\n\nAD\n\nThat was twice as much as in 2015 but still a fraction of what the men received in 2018: $400 million overall, led by champion France with $38 million.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has pledged to double the women's prize money for the 2023 tournament.\n\nRevenue generated by the men's and women's competitions is complicated because FIFA bundles such things as TV rights and sponsorship deals.\n\nAD\n\nGlobal viewership of the 2018 men's tournament (64 matches) was three times higher than the 2019 women's competition (52 games), though for the first time, the Women's World Cup surpassed 1 billion viewers over four weeks.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by the U.S. women's players against the federation concerns broader issues; the players say there is inequitable compensation and support compared with the men's program.\n\nAD\n\nThe teams, however, have separate collective bargaining agreements, and the men do not receive base salaries. Most of the men's earnings come from contracts with professional clubs around the world.\n\nMediation between the women's players and USSF broke down in August.\n\nAD\n\nLast week, the union representing the men's national team players spoke out in support of the women, saying the USSF has been working very hard to sell a false narrative to the public and even to members of Congress. They have been using this false narrative as a weapon against current and former members of the women's team.\n\nIn response, the USSF said, Our goal is to determine fair and equitable compensation for our USMNT and USWNT, while also being mindful of how and where we invest our overall financial resources so that we can continue to focus on investing in the development of our players, coaches and referees at all levels.\n\nAD\n\nThe 2018 tax form also shows chief executive Dan Flynn was the USSF's highest active employee that year at almost $900,000 in base salary and bonuses. Jay Berhalter, the chief commercial and strategy officer, was close to $800,000.\n\nAD\n\nFlynn retired last year, and Berhalter, older brother of the men's coach, is leaving this month.\n\nOthers were on a pay scale higher than Ellis's in 2018.\n\nTab Ramos, the former under-20 men's coach and youth technical director, made $460,000 overall. He is now coaching MLS's Houston Dynamo.\n\nEarnie Stewart received $291,667 of base salary in six months as the men's general manager; he had been hired midway through the year. Stewart, a former national team player, is now the USSF's sporting director, overseeing the men's and women's programs.\n\nThe salaries of men's general manager Brian McBride and women's GM Kate Markgraf were not listed on the latest tax form because they were hired in the past six months.
The company said Tuesday it plans to dismiss between 5,000 and 5,500 people and sell or close about 10 manufacturing facilities in what chief executive Thomas Falk described in a Tuesday call with analysts as difficult but necessary actions to make the Kimberly-Clark an even stronger company going forward.\n\nAD\n\nExecutives declined to say which factories the company would be closing, citing the need to consult with unions, work councils and other stakeholders. They said some of the savings would be used to expand production at other facilities.\n\nAD\n\nChief Financial Officer Maria Henry said the company's gains from the tax overhaul would help offset the cost of the restructuring plan. The company had an effective tax rate of 28.6 percent in 2017, and the rate would drop to between 23 and 26 percent in 2018 as a result of congressional action, boosting year-over-year earnings growth by 6 percentage points, she told analysts during a conference call to discuss recent financial results.\n\nWe also anticipate ongoing annual cash flow benefits from tax reform, Henry said. That provides us flexibility to continue to allocate significant capital to shareholders while we also fund increased capital spending and our restructuring program over the next few years.\n\nAD\n\nAlong with many of its peers in the retail industry Kimberly-Clark has been buffeted for years by falling commodity prices. The company's revenue rose by 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period a year earlier, but the numbers are down significantly from 2014. Profits rose by 21 percent, or $1.75 a share for the quarter.\n\nAD\n\nExecutives cited declining fertility rates in the United States and South Korea as factors that have contributed to a decline in diaper sales, long considered one of Kimberly-Clark's bedrock lines of business. Competition is also heating up. Amazon.com, for instance, launched its own private label brand of diapers late last year. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nExecutives have tried to fill the gap through a cost-cutting program it calls FORCE, or Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere, which is meant to make its factories and distribution lines more efficient. Executives told analysts the company has saved about $450 million in the past year as part of that program, as part of a planned $1.5 billion cost-reduction over the next four years.\n\nAD\n\nPart of that has come from eliminating certain full-time service positions while hiring elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nWe are moving to a global business services platform for our more transactional and standard work, Henry said Tuesday. And when you do that, when you think about it, we are removing a role that is in country, so we are paying the full severance on that position that we are taking out, and we are hiring that role in a different location in our shared services center.\n\nThe company has seen some initial success expanding to new markets, with sales in its personal care segment up by wide margins in Latin America, China and Eastern Europe.
The Episcopal Dioceses of Washington and Virginia said churches including Washington National Cathedral would close for two weeks. The Walter E. Washington Convention Center canceled upcoming events, as did the promoter of concerts at the Anthem, the 9:30 Club, the Lincoln Theater and U Street Music Hall.\n\nOrganizers said parts of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival would be shelved, the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon had its city permit pulled, and the St. Patrick's Day parade scheduled for Sunday was postponed indefinitely.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread, phrases like quarantine, isolation and social distancing are making news. Here are the key differences of each. (The Washington Post)\n\nMore colleges and schools announced plans to close for deep cleaning or move to online classes.\n\nBowser announced six new coronavirus cases, including two not linked to any known source of infection, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the District, Maryland and Virginia to at least 34. Officials in Alexandria, Va., announced the first case there late Wednesday.\n\nBowser said the District has leased an undisclosed location that can be used to quarantine up to 50 people.\n\nI want to continue to remind everyone to be vigilant, Bowser said at a news conference. Our duty now as citizens is to try to contain the spread of germs and this virus in our communities.\n\nBefore the emergency declaration, the owner of the Washington Wizards and the Washington Capitals said their games would go on as scheduled at Capital One Arena in the District's Chinatown neighborhood.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLater, the National Basketball Association announced that it would suspend its season indefinitely after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the virus.\n\nCity health officials earlier Wednesday had recommended canceling all non-essential mass gatherings of 1,000 people or more through the end of the month.\n\nHealth officials also expanded a self-quarantine recommendation for people who have visited Christ Church Georgetown, which is now linked to three confirmed coronavirus cases.\n\nRev. Timothy Cole, 59, the church rector, was diagnosed with the virus after attending an Episcopal leaders conference in Louisville. Organizers of the conference said Wednesday that two other conference attendees have also tested positive.\n\nAD\n\nIn recent days, Christ Church organist Tom Smith and a church member from Loudoun County also were diagnosed with the virus.\n\nAD\n\nAfter Cole's diagnosis, city officials urged people who had been at the church on Feb. 24 or between Feb. 28 and March 3 — days when Cole was there — to quarantine at home and monitor themselves for symptoms.\n\nBut the city has since extended the recommendation to include people at the church March 4 through March 6, to account for the days Smith was there. Smith played at a funeral on March 6, and those who attended that service are also being alerted, the church said in an email to members. City officials want people to stay isolated until two weeks have passed since their last time at the church.\n\nAuthorities say anyone who develops symptoms, such as a fever, cough or shortness of breath, and believes they have been exposed to the virus, should consult their health-care provider about whether to be tested.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHealth-care experts say that those who are sick should stay home and that everyone should wash their hands thoroughly and regularly, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Those with compromised immune systems are also advised to take precautions.\n\nThe six new coronavirus cases in the District include a 59-year-old man and a 39-year-old man who traveled abroad; a 58-year-old woman who attended a conference where other participants tested positive; and a 59-year-old woman who came in contact with another person who previously tested positive in the District. Officials said they have not identified a probable source of exposure for the other two people, a man in his early 20s and a 69-year-old woman.\n\nSuch cases — when there is no obvious likely origin — are the most concerning to health officials and are a primary reason for considering widespread closures and disruptions, officials say. The goal is to limit the spread of the virus by patients who have not yet been diagnosed and quarantined.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe have person-to-person transmission occurring in the District of Columbia, as well as at least two individuals whose reasons for covid-19 have yet to be identified, D.C. Health Director LaQuandra S. Nesbitt said at the news conference where Bowser announced the state of emergency.\n\nAlexandria officials said a resident who tested positive for the coronavirus had been in contact with a District resident with the virus who was associated with Christ Church and had spent time at the Immanuel Chapel of the Virginia Theological Seminary, according to a news release. The age and gender of the person was not immediately available.\n\nEarlier in the day, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) on Wednesday reported on another new coronavirus case in his state: a male teenager in the Chickahominy Health District, in the area of Hanover County.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe teen, who does not attend school, visited a country where there is ongoing transmission of the virus, said Caitlin Hodge, a spokeswoman for the health district. He returned from his trip on March 4, started having symptoms on March 8 and was tested.\n\nNortham said steps were being taken in several agencies — including schools, transportation and health — to make sure the commonwealth is prepared to deal with the virus. He has not yet declared a state of emergency but said he is prepared to do so.\n\nThe state's public lab has testing supplies for 300 to 400 patients, and it anticipates receiving additional tests soon to increase that capacity to 600. Until testing capacity increases, health department officials will give priority to people who have had contact with others with confirmed cases, who have traveled to impacted areas and who live in nursing homes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDaniel Carey, Virginia's secretary of health and human resources, said that given the limited number of tests available, it makes sense for doctors to first test patients for flu, pneumonia or bacterial infections to rule out those conditions.\n\nIn Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) announced four new cases: a woman in her 70s who tested positive in Anne Arundel County after having close contact with someone else who had the virus; a Montgomery County man in his 20s who recently traveled to Spain; a Baltimore County man in his 60s who was at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference in the District; and a Prince George's County man in his 60s, who is currently hospitalized. That man's travel is being investigated.\n\nThe governor told residents to brace for social-distancing measures and warned of significant disruption to your daily lives for a period of time. He urged local governments to consider canceling large events, ordered nursing homes to bar nonessential visits, curtailed walk-in visits to the Motor Vehicle Administration and instructed local schools and preschools to be prepared with contingency plans for potential long-term closures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nState businesses will have an automatic extension on state tax filings, until June 1, Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot said.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service deadline of April 15 for income and corporate taxes remains unchanged.\n\nEvents D.C., the District's tourism arm, said Wednesday that officials have learned of two other AIPAC attendees — from Ohio and Toronto — in addition to three cases announced earlier.\n\nOfficials say there was a low risk of exposure for people who attended the conference, because the patients did not show symptoms during the conference, said Gregory A. O'Dell, president and chief executive of Events D.C.\n\nIndoor venues managed by Events D.C. — including the convention center, the D.C. Armory, and the R.I.S.E. Demonstration Center — will undergo a deep cleaning in coming days, he said, out of an abundance of caution.\n\n\n\nHe said the suspension of operations at the convention center and other facilities will affect three Capital City Go-Go basketball games, a circus and the finish line and expo associated with the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon.\n\nThe decision to shut down immediately affected Satellite 2020, an annual technology convention that has been held in the District for 39 years. The convention started Monday, was scheduled to end Thursday, and was expected to draw more than 15,000 attendees from more than 100 countries, organizers said.\n\nPete Schramm, a sales engineer based in Maryland, said the mood at the convention was subdued Wednesday over concerns about the coronavirus.\n\nNobody wants to touch you and people are keeping their distance, he said while having a cigarette outside the convention center. People are very reserved, they're quiet and they seem to have a lot on their minds.\n\nRestaurateurs such as Jamie Leeds, the chef-owner of Hank's Oyster Bar, were bracing for a significant drop in customers, especially in neighborhoods anchored by large event spaces.\n\nThe Anthem is a huge driver of business for us, said Leeds, referring to the huge new concert venue in Southwest Washington that has canceled all events until April 1.\n\nBut Leeds, who has three other locations in the D.C. area, said the restaurant is also a neighborhood destination with many regulars.\n\nLeeds said she supports the Anthem's decision to cancel events. It's important to follow the guidance of the city and what's best for people's safety, she said.
How can you expect people to make educated decisions about the right thing to do when they have absolutely no idea what the cost is? Levine said. It's crazy.\n\nSo Levine set out to build a tool that would provide some quick and reliable answers. On Wednesday, Yale University and 15 other schools announced that they would use a version of his calculator now known as MyinTuition. (Get it?) That brought the total involved in his nonprofit initiative to 31, including Wellesley, which in 2013 became the first to use Levine's calculator.\n\nLevine is quick to point out that his calculators are meant to complement, not replace, the net price calculators that colleges have been required to post online since 2011. But the net price calculators are often cumbersome. Levine and other experts say many users, facing a slew of complicated questions about tax returns, assets and home equity, fail to take advantage of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLevine's tool aims to give families a fast and effective answer to the question of whether they could afford a given school at a time when listed prices — counting tuition, fees, housing, meals and other expenses — for private colleges can top $70,000 a year.\n\nIt asks users a series of easy-to-follow questions about citizenship status, living situation, family income, home value, mortgage balance, cash on hand, retirement plans and other investments. It also asks whether any siblings are in college. Then, using the college's aid policies, the calculator produces an instant estimate of what the student and family might expect to pay out of pocket and what might be provided as grants, loans and work-study. The whole exercise is meant to take about three minutes.\n\nTake a family of four with income of $70,000 a year, cash of $5,000, non-retirement investments of $25,000, and home equity of $25,000. If the sibling is not in college, the estimated expected family contribution for Wellesley would be $5,000 to $15,500 a year. If the sibling is in college, the family's contribution range for the women's college would be $3,000 to $9,300 a year. In addition, the calculator tells this prospective student that she would be expected to borrow $1,800 a year and earn $2,100 through a work-study program. The rest of the college's $68,000 annual expense would be covered by grants and scholarships.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe calculator cautions consumers that a detailed analysis of family finances could produce a considerably different result. It points them to the net price calculator to get more information. Levine said financial circumstances can be especially tricky for students from divorced families. But he noted that retirement savings are not included in the formula. The calculator only asks about retirement savings to ensure that families don't include that sort of funding when they seek aid estimates.\n\nMisperceptions about price matter hugely, Levine said. This whole issue is about social mobility, he said. Here you have opportunities where kids are qualified to go to high-level institutions, and don't because they don't understand the price. That's a huge failure.\n\nMark Dunn, associate director of admissions at Yale, said the university hopes the MyinTuition calculator will fill an information gap about college expenses. Like many other highly selective schools, Yale promises prospective students that it will meet their financial need. But Dunn acknowledged that many remain skeptical. Our sense is that until you can actually see what a need-based financial aid award would mean for your family, it's hard to honestly believe what colleges say, Dunn said. He said Yale plans to promote the MyinTuition calculator prominently as it begins outreach in coming weeks to high school juniors who would enter in 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther schools now using the calculator are Amherst, Babson, Boston, Bowdoin, Carleton, Colby, Colorado, Dartmouth, Davidson, Grinnell, Hamilton, Middlebury, Mount Holyoke, Pomona, St. Olaf, Skidmore, Smith, Vassar and Williams colleges; Brown, Columbia, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Rice, Wesleyan and Washington and Lee universities; and the universities of Rochester and Virginia. U-Va., the only public institution on the list, adopted the calculator in 2015.
The transit agency can legally ask for up to a 3 percent yearly increase from the state of Maryland and cities and counties of Virginia that, along with D.C., provide Metro with the bulk of its annual operating budget. Metro has asked for the increase each year since the cap was passed two years ago, but this year, transit officials say they are cognizant of the financial constraints the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked on tax revenue that regional governments depend on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt would certainly help, said Tom Hucker (D), a Montgomery County Council member who chairs the Transportation and Environment Committee.\n\nUntil late last month, Metro officials were staring down a looming deficit of nearly $671 million starting in March because of ridership losses. The transit agency had proposed severe service cuts that included no weekend rail service until Congress came through with a $900 billion stimulus in late December that included $14 billion for transit.\n\nOf that, Metro will receive about $610 million, which should keep buses and trains running at their current levels for about a year.\n\nThe federal bailout was a needed injection for households and several industries, but it didn't directly provide financial help to local governments served by the Metro system.\n\nAD\n\nThe annual subsidies that Metro gets from regional and state governments make up more than half of the system's annual operating budget. Revenue from fares, parking, advertisements and other services make up the rest.\n\nAD\n\nThe subsidy increase is capped by Virginia and Maryland at 3 percent. Both states passed a law in 2018 limiting subsidy growth as part of a condition of permanently dedicating and significantly increasing money for long-term capital projects. The District did not adopt the limit, and the cap applies only to Metro's operating costs.\n\nMetro has annually asked for as much as it can because officials say expenses have risen at least 8 percent annually in recent years, outpacing mostly flat fare revenue growth. The transit system felt so stretched that it had lobbied the states to increase or alter the cap before the pandemic struck.\n\nAD\n\nBy not asking for a subsidy increase, Metro could save the jurisdictions tens of millions of dollars, according to Wiedefeld's latest $1.89 billion operating budget proposal for the 2022 fiscal year, which starts on July 1. An exact figure wasn't available Monday.\n\nAD\n\nMetro's proposed budget includes $1.15 billion in subsidies, less than the $1.25 billion Metro had counted on receiving at the beginning of the current fiscal year. That amount was later revised down in November to $1.11 billion.\n\nEven as Metro has been running buses and trains at a reduced level because of lower demand, costs for cleaning, disinfecting and personal protective equipment have risen. Metro officials said they hope to make up the money they wouldn't receive in subsidies through cost-cutting starting in January 2022, the second half of the fiscal year.\n\nAD\n\nWiedefeld proposed that Metro would seek to work with unions to defer raises and enact service cuts in the last six months, leaving the agency with a $171.4 million deficit. Officials previously have said they might seek more federal assistance at that time to bridge the gap unless ridership rebounds.\n\nAD\n\nMetro officials said none of the local or state governments asked Metro for a break in their subsidy payments. The agency said it wanted to be cost-conscious toward its funding partners.\n\nWhile Metro did not receive a specific request, [Wiedefeld] is aware that our funding jurisdictions did not receive additional revenue in the recent Covid Relief package and face enormous financial pressures, Metro spokesman Ian Jannetta said in a statement.\n\nFairfax County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jeff C. McKay (D-At Large) said an increase in Metro's subsidy request would be tough to swallow this year, particularly when Congress didn't include local governments in its bailout.\n\nAD\n\nAn increase in the local subsidy at this time would be another expense on Fairfax County residents, he said in a statement.\n\nThe Metro Board ultimately will decide if the transit system can lower its subsidy request. Members will discuss during a Thursday meeting.\n\nAD\n\nBoard members said the lack of an additional subsidy could increase the amount of money the agency requests from federal government next year if ridership doesn't significantly turn around.\n\nBut Metro Board Chairman Paul C. Smedberg said the agency needs to consider the financial health of cities and counties across the Washington region as it moves forward with its own needs.\n\nHaving talked to a lot of them and hearing about their situations and comments that were coming up again, it's just one of the options we wanted on the table, said Smedberg, who represents Virginia cities and counties on the board.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the state of Maryland has the direct responsibility of providing Metro with its annual subsidy, local officials in counties and cities Metro serves can provide responses to state transportation officials.\n\nAD\n\nPrince George's County Council member Todd M. Turner (D-District 4), who also is a member of the Washington Suburban Transit Commission, said a lower subsidy request should be welcomed by state legislators.
Forget about keeping up with the Joneses. This time of year you want your house to be as crummy as possible. Why? Because it's property tax assessment time, which means it's also assessment appeal time. And if you can successfully argue that your house isn't worth as much as the government says it is, you can save a bundle of money on your property taxes.\n\nJosh and Alicia Green embraced the concept of trashing their own house, writing a description for their appeal that was the polar opposite of a real estate agent's gushing ad. We reminded them we lived on a busy road, Western Avenue, Josh Green said. We also told the city about costly repairs we needed, like a new roof. In addition, the Greens noticed that the District listed their house as having three bedrooms. But we alerted them that the previous owner had knocked out a wall and made it two bedrooms, thus lowering the value more, Green said.\n\n[How to figure out the value of your home]\n\nAccording to the National Taxpayers Union, less than 5 percent of homeowners do what the Greens did, even though the union estimates that between 30 and 60 percent of properties in the United States are over-assessed. The vast majority of assessors are not malicious or careless; they are simply making judgment calls about how to utilize limited resources in tackling a big job, said Pete Sepp, the union's president. Homeowners shouldn't take it personally, but they shouldn't assume the government is right, either. Sepp says that when well-prepared homeowners take the time to appeal, most win at least a partial victory. Here's how to improve your chances of being one of the winners:\n\n●Meet the deadline. Tax assessments in the District, Maryland and Virginia are mailed out January through March. (In some parts of the country, they arrive in the last quarter of the year.) Once you receive your assessment, you typically have just 30 to 120 days to file your appeal. Check the rules for your jurisdiction and make sure your paperwork is postmarked by the deadline.\n\n●Understand assessment ratios. Some jurisdictions tax your house based on 100 percent of its value, but others assign a lower assessment ratio, such as 60 percent. This means a house with a market value of $100,000 would have an assessed value of $60,000. If you see a number that's lower than your home's true value, check the assessment ratio before assuming you don't have a case. You can find that ratio on your actual tax assessment notice or on the assessor's office website.\n\n●Look for errors on your property work sheet. Contact your tax assessor's office and request the internal notes and data the assessor used when setting a value for your property. Different jurisdictions call this paperwork different things, including property work sheet and property card. What you're requesting are the internal notes and data the assessor used when setting a value for your property. Study these documents, checking for lot size, house age and dimensions, number of bedrooms and baths, most recent purchase price, and anything else that could affect your home's value. If you find mistakes that make your property seem more valuable than it is, that is strong ammunition. This is the tactic the Greens used when they pointed out that their house had two bedrooms, not three.\n\n●See if the comparables are really comparable. The government's internal notes will also include comparable properties the assessor used to help determine the value of your house. Look for reasons the properties the assessor chose are not appropriate. Are they bigger? Newer? Newly remodeled? Do they have watertight roofs, while your house needs a new one, as the Greens' did? Next, identify three to six alternative comparables that are more favorable to you. You can find them free using such websites as Redfin, Trulia and Zillow. Or you can consult a real estate agent or appraiser.\n\n[Grocery shopping in person or online: Which is best?]\n\n●Escalate as needed. Some property tax disputes can be settled through informal discussions with the assessor's office. For example, Fairfax County, Va., encourages homeowners to call. More commonly, you will be asked to fill out forms and the entire process will be done on paper. If your initial appeal fails, most jurisdictions offer an in-person hearing as the next step. Tip: Attend somebody else's hearing first to get a feel for the process.\n\n●Hire help if you must. If you don't have time to follow the steps above, you can hire help. Some real estate lawyers take property tax appeals on a contingency basis, which means you don't pay unless you win. If you prevail, a typical fee is one-third to one-half of the first year's savings.\n\nThe Greens ended up appealing their property tax assessment several years in a row and won every single time. Fighting our tax assessment was less time-consuming than filling out my kids' summer camp forms, Alicia Green said. And for the time invested, you get money back instead of forking it over. The Greens estimate that they spent about five hours and saved at least $5,000 in property taxes over the seven years they lived in that house. We made a strong, truthful argument, and it was effective, Green said.\n\nSepp says the Greens got it right by sticking to nuts-and-bolts information about their property, rather than complaining that their assessment was unfair. A homeowner who marshals proper evidence, sticks to facts rather than make political statements and follows procedure is more likely to meet with success because they've made their own luck, Sepp said. You wouldn't go into traffic court to challenge a parking ticket by arguing the mayor is corrupt. Rather, you'd provide evidence you were parked there properly during nonpaying hours.\n\nAnother benefit of appealing your assessment: When you successfully lower your property tax rate, it resets from that lower rate for years to come. By the way, it did not affect the value of our house when we sold, Alicia Green said. I imagine people would wonder that. It's a common misconception, but think of it this way: Lower property taxes are a benefit for potential buyers as well.\n\nElisabeth Leamy is a 13-time Emmy winner and 25-year consumer advocate for programs such as Good Morning America and The Dr. Oz Show.

But some provisions present potential business pitfalls. The bill would generally provide less financial support to lower-income people who currently sign up for insurance through the exchanges. That could create big problems for insurers if it deters people — especially healthy people — from buying coverage, as insurers depend on a mix of healthy and sick people to keep their plans profitable and premiums affordable.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd the bill wouldn't affect all health insurances companies equally. Many large insurers have pulled back from offering plans on the laws exchanges, leaving them less exposed to future risks.\n\nMario Molina, the chief executive of Molina Healthcare, a small insurer that is a big player in both the Medicaid market and the exchanges, said that the bill does not inspire confidence.\n\nThe present bill, in the current form, doesn't do much to reassure this is a long-term, viable insurance product, Molina said. I'm actually more concerned about Medicaid and what this is going to do to our safety net.\n\nThe bill would preserve much of the status quo until 2020, when the Affordable Care Act's financial assistance to consumers would be replaced by age-based tax credits.\n\nAD\n\nHow the tax credit plays out will be critical, said Elizabeth Carpenter, a senior vice president at Avalere Health. The change in the tax credit amount may cause some individuals — especially at the lower end of the income scale — to have to pay more for premiums and make coverage unaffordable. From an insurance company's perspective, who continues to buy insurance is critical.\n\nAD\n\nHere's more of what companies wanted, and what they got:\n\n1) Elimination of taxes\n\nInsurers wanted the health insurance tax repealed. Drug companies wanted the prescription drug tax repealed. Medical device makers wanted to kill an excise tax. Big employers wanted to abolish the Cadillac tax, a 40 percent excise tax on high-cost employer health plans. With the exception of the Cadillac tax — which was previously delayed to 2020 and now will be been delayed to 2025 — they all got what they wanted.\n\nAD\n\nAn analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that, over a decade, repealing the health insurer tax would cost $145 billion; repealing the prescription drug tax would cost $25 billion; repealing the medical device tax would cost $20 billion; delaying the Cadillac tax would cost $49 billion.\n\nStill, companies are pushing for the Cadillac tax to be scrapped entirely, instead of the current delay.\n\nAD\n\nThe delay is better than current law, said James Gelfand, senior vice president of health policy at the ERISA Industry Committee, a lobbying group that represents large companies. Now is the chance, and this is the bill that must completely eradicate the Cadillac tax.\n\n2) A replacement for the individual mandate that will encourage healthy people to sign up for insurance\n\nHealth insurers need both healthy and sick people to sign up for insurance to have a balanced risk pool. This was a major problem in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, where too many healthy people were willing to pay a fine rather than sign up for insurance.\n\nAD\n\nInstead of a mandate and a fine if people don't sign up for insurance, the bill would create a continuous coverage requirement that would penalize people who have a gap in their coverage. Anyone who lets their insurance coverage lapse could experience a 30 percent premium hike the next time they sign up.\n\nAD\n\nOne possibility is that people will be incentivized to avoid any gaps in coverage, to avoid that 30 percent premium surcharge. But here's another scenario: A young, healthy person lacks coverage. She goes to sign up, but she faces a penalty that would make her plan more expensive. Why not just wait until she really needs insurance, since she'll be paying the penalty either way? In contrast, sick people who need insurance are more likely to pay the penalty.\n\nMolina argued the requirement could result in confusion and more gaming of the system — he questioned how it would even work logistically, with insurance companies researching whether people had been continuously covered or issuing some certificate that people had coverage ending at a certain date. And, he said, the premium hikes still wouldn't cover the cost of people who are really waiting until they are sick to sign up — on average, he said those members cost about twice as much as a normal member, not 30 percent more.\n\n3) Help providing affordable coverage\n\nThe bill would replace the premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies in the Affordable Care Act with a flat tax credit, based on age. Currently, only people who make between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty limit are eligible for tax credits that defray their premiums. The size of the credits are pegged to people's incomes and the cost of a benchmark plan in the marketplace where they're buying insurance. That helps account for the fact that the average premium can vary widely depending where a person is buying insurance.\n\nThe new tax credit would gradually peter out for people who make more than $75,000 a year or $150,000 for a couple, but it ignores the fact that care costs more in different geographical regions or that someone who makes $20,000 a year might be more strained in trying to buy an insurance plan with the same amount of financial help as someone who makes $74,000. The graph below shows how a flat tax credit would do little to defray the monthly cost of insurance in markets where health insurance is more expensive.\n\n4) Continued support for subsidies that help people pay for insurance in the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces\n\nThe insurance industry has been clear that it wants a stable transition, meaning that subsidies that help people pay for their insurance premiums shouldn't be abruptly yanked out from underneath them. The bill keeps in place those tax credits and cost-sharing reductions that help lower the out-of-pocket costs for people based on their income — until 2020.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMolina, however, said that since the money hasn't been appropriated yet, he fears that Congress could stop funding the cost-sharing reductions as early as May.\n\nWith the possible lost of the cost-sharing reductions, I think insurers will probably raise their prices as much, if not more than they did this year, Molina said. I wouldn't be surprised if we see rate increases and more plans dropping out.\n\n5) More flexibility in the ability to design health coverage benefits\n\nInsurers requested fewer rules, regulations and red tape. The draft bill takes steps toward easing insurers' ability to design health coverage, but leaves in place the 10 categories of essential health benefits that must be covered.\n\nAD\n\nInsurers currently charge more to people based on their age, but current rules limit the spread to three times the costs of the youngest group of insured people. The bill would allow them to charge five times as much to older people. It also does away with a requirement that plans offer products with a specific value — a provision that created bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans that were progressively more expensive.\n\nIn general, plans would like flexibility to design a product to meet the needs of their consumers in a particular market, and certainly getting rid of those tiers is one way to increase flexibility for plans, Carpenter said.
But everything changed after Geary connected with InReturn Strategies, a start-up intent on making hiring more inclusive by bridging the gaps between employers and job candidates with disabilities. Its founder, Jim Atwater, helped Geary prepare for interviews, showing him how his perspective and experiences could be an asset to potential employers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, Geary works at Cerner, a global health-care technology company, where his decades of experience navigating the medical system inform his work as a data analyst. He said he's happier than he has ever been.\n\nFor me, it means that I can start building the life that I want, Geary said, rather than having to go along with what other people had planned for me.\n\nAbout 61 million Americans have some kind of disability, which the Americans With Disabilities Act defines as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. But even as inclusion becomes a marketing buzzword and major brands such as Nike roll out disability-friendly products, unemployment among groups with disabilities is more than double that of the general population. Less than 20 percent of people with disabilities held a job in 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has been like this for decades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAtwater said he created InReturn Strategies to tackle what's known as the disability employment gap. As one of roughly 400 deaf entrepreneurs in the United States, he knows how workers with disabilities can be overlooked and undervalued by employers. He says members of this demographic are often the last to be hired and the first to be let go, and they are often relegated to jobs below their skill level.\n\nThere's lots of people talking about inclusion and making tons of money from consulting, but very few people are doing anything about it, Atwater said. We are the mechanism to turn intent into action.\n\nResearch shows that hiring disabled workers benefits firms' bottom lines. A 2018 report from Accenture, which analyzed the disability protocols and financial performance of 140 companies, found that firms with the best practices saw 28 percent higher revenue, double the net income and 30 percent higher profit margins, on average, over a four-year period.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf the number of people with disabilities in the labor force grew just 1 percent, the nation's gross domestic product could expand by as much as $25 billion, the Accenture report found.\n\nCompanies looking to hire workers with disabilities usually follow traditional hiring channels, which often include processes that can be exclusionary. Meanwhile, access providers — organizations offering services to people with disabilities — don't tend to have many connections in the private sector.\n\nWe're building bridges where there aren't any, said Scott Brouillette, InReturn's chief executive. How are you going to hire someone you don't understand and have no relationships with?\n\nNathan Beck, who has spent 20 years helping people with disabilities access jobs in Hamilton County, Ohio, said it can be hard to get companies to care.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLots of times, people with disabilities don't want to disclose that they're disabled, because they're scared they won't be interviewed, Beck said. The way Jim and InReturn are approaching businesses is about trying to integrate people with disabilities into the business strategy, as opposed to the opposite. It's a whole new approach.\n\nInReturn's platform connects private-sector companies with more than 4,500 access providers across the country. InReturn then helps companies tailor their practices to better work with candidates with disabilities.\n\nAs director of human resources at Lead Bank, a Kansas City, Kan., bank, Angela Blackburn has striven to a build a workforce that reflects the community. But like many hiring managers, she has struggled with how to wade into a different talent pool.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI feel like when people feel like they're not knowledgeable in that area, they shy away from it, Blackburn said. Not because they aren't interested in including the population, but because they don't know what to do. And that's where InReturn comes into play.\n\nWorking-age people with disabilities in the United States have nearly $500 billion a year in disposable income, according to a 2018 report from the American Institutes for Research, making the group one of the largest market segments in the country. But, on average, they make 63 cents on the dollar compared with their non-disabled counterparts.\n\nMatteo Lieb, who works on employment policy and programs at the National Down Syndrome Society, said employers often treat hiring people with disabilities as an act of philanthropy. It should be about snagging the best talent, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe really work with employers to have them realize that this is not just something they're doing out of the kindness of their hearts, he said. This is something good they're doing for themselves.\n\nIn a testimonial, the parents of a young man with autism described his difficulties landing a job before InReturn. Although he holds a master's degree in business administration and passed his certified public accountant exam on the first try, the interview process presented major hurdles.\n\nThose with high functioning autism lack pragmatic language skills, skills we use in daily interaction with others, the family wrote in the testimonial. Employers need to be aware of these challenges and find a way to bridge the gap.\n\nAD\n\nInReturn helped communicate those challenges to potential employers, giving them the context they needed to make their screening processes more inclusive. Within two weeks, the man was hired as a tax associate at a wealth management firm.\n\nAD\n\nOur son was at ease, gained confidence and gained success, the testimonial reads. It is our hopes that all companies will get on board and make inclusiveness a priority. There is great talent just waiting to be tapped into.\n\nSome companies are beginning to understand the untapped value of workers with disabilities. Microsoft has a dedicated website for job-seekers with disabilities to learn about the company's hiring practices and accommodations. Procter & Gamble, Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, Ford and other giants have neurodiversity hiring initiatives to seek employees with neurological differences, such as autism, dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n\nAD\n\nBut the challenge goes beyond changing the way companies see workers with disabilities; it's also about helping these workers access all the opportunities available to them, said Chris Lee, who is working with InReturn to set up a pilot program with the Kansas State School for the Blind.\n\nAD\n\nFor a lot of people with disabilities, their self-awareness of what their future can look like is very low, Lee said. A lot of it is about introducing them to businesses or career paths they never knew existed.\n\nIn a case study, InReturn brought a group of young people with Down syndrome to an Apple store in Kansas City, Kan. When the store manager asked about their job aspirations, they uniformly said they imagined working in a grocery store or restaurant.\n\nThat's all they've ever seen someone like them do, Atwater said. The visibility to what their opportunities can be is just nonexistent.\n\nIn the fall, InReturn was appointed to the CEO Commission for Disability Employment, a group of companies and other organizations working to help people with disabilities achieve and maintain equal access to meaningful employment. Its message of dignified, profitable inclusion is one it hopes can be shared with all companies, regardless of size or field.
Egypt's decision was probably fueled by memories of the so-called Arab Spring, when Tunisia's massive anti-government protests spread to similar protests in 10 other countries in the Middle East and North Africa in 2010. In Egypt, the protesters forced the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak after almost 30 years in power.\n\nShould Egypt's government and other governments worry about France's yellow vest protests triggering similar protests in their countries?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOur forthcoming research on the diffusion of democracy protests suggests they should not. Protests about domestic issues, we find, do not generally spread from one country to its neighbors. But here's what can spread: the symbols and approaches that highly visible protests use. Let us explain.\n\nHere's how we did our research\n\nWe collected daily data from newspapers, NGO reports and so forth on the specific dates in which a democracy protest began and ended in every country around the world between 1989 and 2011. We then examined whether a protest beginning in one country made it more likely that a similar protest would begin in a neighboring country (i.e., one within 30 to 500 miles of its borders) within the next 30, 45, 90, 120 or 360 days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe found no evidence these protests spread. When a protest occurred in one country in this period, it did not significantly increase the likelihood of similar protests taking place in neighboring countries. This was true not just of democracy protests, whose primary demand is open and competitive elections, but also for other forms of anti-government protests, such as the yellow vest protests.\n\nWhy are protests unlikely to spread?\n\nDemocracy protests do not tend to spread, we argue, because they are about domestic issues that are generally unrelated to what is happening in other countries. Democracy protests tend to arise when elections, economic crises and other events within the country focus the public's existing anger about political, social or economic grievances, prompting collective action.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn general, protests in neighboring countries do not provoke new discontent in other countries [remind citizens of their own discontent]; nor do they bring people together on behalf of existing [that] discontent. In fact, most democracy protests are small, short-lived, repressed and unsuccessful — and are thus poor models for protests in other countries.\n\nLike democracy protests, the French yellow vest protests are not good models for protests in Egypt and other countries where fuel prices are high. That is because France is a Western democracy where freedom of speech is not only protected but also extolled. It is also known for its protest culture; its citizens and voters could reasonably expect their government to make concessions, as indeed happened.\n\nEgypt, in contrast, is an authoritarian state known for being increasingly repressive toward dissenters. Last year, an Egyptian court sentenced 75 people to death for protesting the 2013 coup d'etat that brought the current president, Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, to power.\n\nSo why do protests appear to trigger demonstrations in other countries?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNeighboring countries tend to be similar in many ways. The domestic forces that set off protests in one country may well exist in its neighbors as well. What's more, it is much easier for academics and the news media to take note of protests that happen soon after one other than it is to track all the protests that were not followed by similar events in neighboring countries.\n\nBetween 1989 and 2011, 24 democracy protests began in countries within 45 days of a similar protest in countries within 30 miles of them. But 258 protests — more than 10 times as many — began even though there had not been a similar protest in a neighboring country within the previous 45 days. For instance, in May 2018, Brazilian truck drivers staged massive — and eventually successful — protests against increased fuel prices. Yet we have not seen similar protests in other Latin American countries.\n\nEven if protests do not spread, their symbols and strategies might\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough democracy protests and anti-government protests do not spread to other countries in general, their symbols, strategies and tactics can. By wearing yellow vests, activists outside France have been able to make their protests appear to be part of a larger movement, attracting more international and domestic media attention. The Egyptian government's decision to ban yellow vests may not be absurd after all.\n\nBut many of these protesters have made demands, including anti-Muslim demands in Germany, that are very different from those seen in France. These non-French protests were often triggered by events within their own countries and sometimes even began before their French counterparts. In Bulgaria, the so-called yellow vest protests against fuel prices began a week before those in France; protesters only began wearing yellow vests after they had become iconic in France. In Iraq, protests against unemployment, corruption and poor public services had been going on for months before Iraqi protesters began sporting yellow vests last December.\n\nIf we are witnessing a yellow vest wave, it is not a wave of unified protests; rather, it is a spread of the symbols.\n\nDawn Brancati is visiting scholar at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies, Columbia University.

I'll get Congress, Trump replied. I've been getting politicians to pass whatever I wanted all my life. Nobody has more experience — you know, it's sort of interesting, nobody has more experience dealing with politicians. I've been dealing with them all my life.\n\nAD\n\nHow? As a developer.\n\nWhether it's big New York City zoning deals — which, by the way, are probably tougher than most of the things I'll be dealing with foreign countries, he continued. I mean, I built a city on the West Side of Manhattan. You talk about getting zoning. Getting zoned for Trump Tower: 68 stories on 57th and 5th. Let me tell you, I've been dealing with politicians all my life. They're fine. They're wonderful. They're all talk, they're no action. They're selling this country down the tubes, and they're easy to deal with. Believe me.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1980, the New York Times explained how Trump finessed the zoning board for the development of Trump Tower. After quoting a business partner of Trump's, who said that Trump knows how to get things done in New York, the paper explained: In part, that is a matter of politics. The only donor who gave more money than Trump to the campaign of the incumbent governor, it reported, was the governor's brother. While a deputy mayor also said that Trump could be very convincing when selling a project, a city council member told the Times that Trump runs with the same clique that continues to manipulate things behind the scenes in this city, including links to a Democratic Party machine in Brooklyn connected through his father.\n\nAD\n\nThe Times also reported that the final negotiated height of Trump Tower was 56 stories, not 68.\n\nWhy re-litigate 40-year-old news articles and four-year-old news conferences? Because it's worth remembering that Trump at no time was prepared to manage the process of passing legislation through the House and the Senate. The current government shutdown, approaching three weeks in length, stemmed from dual failures on Trump's part: Most recently in an inability to cajole members of Congress to see his side on funding for a wall on the border with Mexico and, earlier, a failure to passing a funding mechanism for that wall during the two years when Republicans controlled the House and the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nTrump will note (and has noted) that the existence of the filibuster makes passing legislation trickier than bare majorities might make it seem. And that's fair — but it also means that Trump at no point was able to use those zoning-board skills to persuade even eight Democrats to join his view of an issue. At one point, a deal seemed to be in the works with the Democratic minority, trading wall money for the protection of immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nAD\n\nTrump rejected that deal, and here we are.\n\nAt times over his first two years in office, Trump was unable to even navigate issues popular with the Republican base and that didn't require a 60-vote margin. He deferred to congressional leaders on the outlines of an overhaul to the Affordable Care Act, later disparaging a House-passed bill before it got to the Senate. When a reform effort came to the Senate under reconciliation rules that required only 50 votes, Trump could not persuade those easy-to-deal-with politicians to pass it, despite his party's majority.\n\nAD\n\nThat Trump's team didn't advance the overhaul legislation is the least surprising part of this. At the same news conference in Iowa, he proudly proclaimed that he was reticent to put together position papers — both because voters don't really care about them (fair enough) and because they would tie his hands in negotiations. Part of it, too, was obviously that the specifics of drafting legislation never appealed to him. So he has continually left the details up to his colleagues on the Hill, then has had to advocate for things that he himself didn't develop. Pun intended.\n\nAD\n\nThere are a lot of reasons that the current fight with Congress is unwinnable for the president. He chose to make a stand on his most politically divisive proposal precisely because it is so divisive and, therefore, so important to the most vocal part of his base. But it also gives his opponents even less incentive to side with him than they might otherwise have. He has been ineffective at making his case, in part because the case he's making is the same one he has made over the entire course of his political career. He is left flailing, with no obvious way out but to fold.\n\nThat, too, is part of the Trump business legacy. Over his multiple decades in the real estate industry, he has walked away from bad or failing projects, such as his casinos in Atlantic City.\n\nAD\n\nOr that city Trump built on the West Side of Manhattan.\n\nAD\n\nIt was not the evidence of his savvy that Trump presented in Iowa. Intending the development to feature the tallest building in the world, he had hoped to lure NBC to it. That never materialized, thanks in part to tax concessions that NBC received to stay in Rockefeller Center — concessions that Trump had sought to aid his development project.\n\nThe Times noted at the time that Trump had suffered only defeats in advancing the project, writing that Trump does not so much avoid failure as know how to land on his feet and change course so deftly that no one catches on.
THE DISTRICT\n\nMan wounded in SE shooting\n\nA man was shot and critically wounded Wednesday morning when at least one gunman opened fire on a vehicle on Wheeler Road in Southeast Washington, D.C. police said.\n\nThe shooting comes six days after four other people were shot and wounded in separate shootings in two hours on Feb. 23, along a six-block stretch of the same street.\n\nActing D.C. police chief Peter Newsham said there certainly is some kind of dispute going on in the area, but he would not be more specific.\n\n— Peter Hermann\n\nMARYLAND\n\nPaid sick-leave bill advances\n\nMaryland's House of Delegates on Wednesday gave preliminary approval to a bill that would require businesses with 15 or more workers to provide paid sick leave.\n\nThe measure, which the House passed in 2016, faces an additional vote in that chamber before being taken up in the Senate, where it failed last year. The legislation is sponsored by Del. Luke H. Clippinger (D-Baltimore). It would ensure a minimum of one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours of work, up to seven full days per year.\n\n— Josh Hicks\n\nVIRGINIA\n\nDemocrats line up to\n\nrun for county board\n\nFour Democrats have lined up to run for the Arlington County Board a week after longtime board member Jay Fisette announced that he would not seek reelection.\n\nThe party will hold a caucus May 11 and May 13 to select a nominee for the November general election. The candidates are Erik Gutshall, a business owner; Peter Fallon, a tax accountant; Kim Klingler, an emergency medical technician; and Vivek Patil, a biotech professional.\n\nIndependent Audrey Clement is also running.\n\n— Patricia Sullivan\n\nMan, 20, is arrested\n\nafter alleged assault\n\nA Virginia man was arrested Wednesday after allegedly sexually assaulting a woman on Tuesday in Annandale, police said.\n\nOn Tuesday, officers responded to the 7900 block of John Adams Court after a 27-year-old woman said she was sexually assaulted at knifepoint while moving out of her apartment, Fairfax County Police said in a statement.

A class-action complaint filed in the Hamilton County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas on behalf of Matthew Adam and all others similarly situated, alleges that Walmart used a fraudulent, unlawful, deceptive and unfair course of conduct to market and sell its four Trouble Brewing beers as craft beers, and because of this, Members of the public were fraudulently induced to purchase Defendant's Craft Beer at inflated prices.\n\nRagan Dickens, Walmart's national director of media relations, said in an email statement, We hold our suppliers to high standards and are committed to providing our customers the quality products they expect. While we have not yet been served with the complaint, we take this matter seriously and intend to defend ourselves against the allegations. Adam's attorney did not respond to email or phone messages seeking comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 12-page complaint, published online by Consumerist, reiterates most of the facts laid out in a story I wrote last month, down to quotes from a senior buyer for Walmart's adult beverage team: The four Trouble Brewing beers were created for Walmart by WX Brands, a company that develops exclusive brands of wine, beer and spirits for retailers around the world. Though the cans say the contents were brewed by Trouble Brewing in Rochester, N.Y., no American brewery with the name Trouble Brewing actually exists. They're actually produced at Genesee Brewing, makers of Genesee and Genesee Cream Ale, on a contract basis. Genesee is owned by North American Breweries, a subsidiary of Costa Rica-based Florida Ice and Farm, which includes breweries among its holdings.\n\nThese statements and omissions were material to the transaction at hand, the complaint says, as Plaintiff would not have purchased [the Trouble Brewing beer] otherwise.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeyond the issue of where the beer is made, the lawsuit is partly based on the fact that it's not craft beer, a claim that Trouble Brewing never makes outright on its label, though Teresa Budd, a senior buyer for Walmart, told me, We were intentional about designing a package that conveyed a look and feel you'd expect of craft beer. The Brewers Association, a national trade group for small brewers, defines craft brewery as being small (under 6 million barrels produced per year); independent (less than 25 percent owned or controlled by a non-craft brewer) and traditional (making traditional beers, not flavored malt beverages, alcoholic sodas or other products). Further, Julia Herz, the Brewers Association's craft beer program director, told me last month that we do not classify contract companies as brewers because they don't have a brewers' notice from the Tax and Trade Bureau.\n\nThis is not the first lawsuit filed by a consumer who alleges being misled into thinking that a product made by a large company is in fact produced by an artisan brewery or distillery, and it certainly won't be the last. The problem is that the track record of these lawsuits isn't very good. Last June, for example, a federal judge dismissed a case brought by a California beer lover who claimed that Blue Moon, which is owned by Coors, was marketing itself as a craft beer produced by the Blue Moon Brewing Company. The judge found that a reasonable consumer was not likely to be deceived by Blue Moon's packaging or website.\n\nIn 2015, a federal judge dismissed several lawsuits against Tito's Handmade Vodka from consumers who complained that the vodka was not, in fact, handmade as the label asserted; Maker's Mark had similar suits dismissed the same year.\n\nAD\n\nAD
When a property isn't selling, owners often asks whether they should consider renting it out. While we are generally big fans of owning investment property, most sellers in this situation fail to think through all of the factors that should be considered in making this important decision.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn many cases, it may be better for the homeowner simply to lower the sale price.\n\nBut it may make sense for homeowners to pull the house off the market and rent it out if they are moving away for a relatively short term but will return to the area; or if they have a long-term time horizon for holding the property as a rental, have built a financial model that takes into account all the costs of being a landlord and are comfortable being a landlord.\n\nIf you're thinking of going down this road, the first thing you should do is to identify and acknowledge your emotional reasons for selling. What we typically hear is that homeowners didn't get the sale price they wanted so they consider renting out the property for a while as a placeholder so they can wait for the market to bounce back. This logic often has less to do with the actual costs/benefits of renting, but rather the emotional burden of selling at a perceived loss.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSecond, you should look at the actual numbers. Many homeowners do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to see whether renting out the home would cover the direct carrying costs of owning it. The costs they typically consider are their mortgage payment, taxes and insurance. However, the problem is that this quick calculation almost always underestimates the true costs of being a landlord.\n\nHere are a few of the common expenses/costs overlooked by sellers:\n\nVacancy : Sellers need to account for the time it takes to lease their property and any gap between tenants. Landlords typically assume 5 percent vacancy a year, which diminishes gross rental income by the same amount.\n\nProperty management : Homeowners often overlook property management costs (roughly 8 to 10 percent of gross rents) in our area. Even if homeowners plan to manage properties themselves, they should account for the value of their own time and effort.\n\nLeasing fees : It takes work to find a tenant. Management companies typically charge one month's rent to find a tenant.\n\nOngoing maintenance and capital reserves : Sellers should remember to budget for ongoing maintenance (leaky toilets, appliance repairs, etc.) and larger capital expenses (roof repairs, HVAC repairs, etc.). Ten percent of gross rents is a good rule of thumb.\n\nOpportunity costs: The opportunity cost is defined as what the homeowner could earn on the equity in his home if it were invested elsewhere. Sometimes, the opportunity cost can be substantial. For example, homeowners with $100,000 in equity in their home (after paying off all debt, taxes, fees, etc.), should factor in an additional cost of $3,000 to $5,000 per year, depending on what the expected return on capital might be.\n\nThird, a would-be seller should consider the soft costs of renting as well. For example, renting can put tremendous wear and tear on a property (both from acts and omissions from a tenant). Tenants typically do not take as good care of the property as does a homeowner. A lot of damage can happen to a home in a short time frame, especially for a single-family detached house.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen the owner is done renting and ready to sell, it can be costly to get the property in the same condition as it was before the tenant moved in. The moment a house becomes an investment property, the resale market typically discounts the value of it as compared to an owner-occupied home.\n\nFinally, if there is significant appreciation in the property, an owner may lose out on a valuable tax break. The U.S. tax code allows homeowners who have lived in a home at least two of the previous five years to exclude up to $250,000 of capital gains ($500,000 for a married couple) from their taxes. Homeowners who rent out their home for more than three years therefore will lose out on this valuable exemption. (Consult an accountant on this.)\n\nOnce homeowners factor in all of these costs, the rental option often turns from a roughly break-even scenario to one that generates a deficit each month. This puts additional pressure on the capital appreciation required to make the rental option a sound choice. In other words, the capital appreciation has to more than compensate for the monthly deficit. In a flat or down market, the rental option can be financially devastating.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the end, owners who do their homework and conduct a thorough analysis of their options will make a better decision.
Bond prices also fell, sending yields higher, and oil prices plunged to an 18-year low amid continued uncertainty over the duration of the coronavirus shutdown.\n\nAD\n\nEven the prospect of roughly $1 trillion in emergency federal aid, including $1,000 checks for taxpayers and an airline industry bailout, was not enough to halt the retreat. Dire predictions about the global pandemic's spread and its likely economic toll discouraged traders.\n\nAD\n\nAfter growing without interruption since mid-2009, the U.S. economy will likely shrink in the second quarter at an annual rate of 14 percent — a staggering decline that exceeds the worst of the global financial crisis, according to economists at JPMorgan Chase. A sudden stop that began in China, where the virus originated, is now rippling through the U.S., Europe and vulnerable emerging markets, likely shrinking global output for the entire year.\n\nOn March 18, the stock market took another hit amid coronavirus fears as the Dow fell 1,300 points, nearly erasing the gains made under President Trump. (Reuters)\n\nTomorrow's Labor Department report of initial jobless claims is expected to show evidence of the first layoffs triggered by the pandemic. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expects claims to reach 250,000 this week, up from 211,000 last week and to top 1 million next week.\n\nAD\n\nThe thing that has me the most concerned is the speed and severity of what's playing out here, said Gibson Smith, a prominent bond fund manager with Denver-based Smith Capital Investors. There's just a lot of stress in the system.\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, markets for U.S. government and corporate debt strained to handle a flood of sell orders. Investors sold 10-year Treasury securities to raise cash, sending prices down and yields up to 1.2 percent. The 10-year yield has more than doubled since March 9, when stocks and bonds began plunging in tandem. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.\n\nTreasurys have been whipsawed during the coronavirus pandemic as investors seeking a safe haven initially drove bond prices up and yields down, said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer of Penn Mutual Asset Management. In the past week, as institutional investors sought to raise cash by selling treasuries, prices sagged while yields jumped.\n\nAD\n\nSome analysts said concern over Washington's unprecedented spending plans, which will balloon the already swollen federal budget deficit and debt, were behind the latest moves.\n\nAD\n\nGlobal fixed income markets this morning have lost confidence in the ability of the governments of the world to finance the fiscal stimulus they are proposing, Carl Weinberg, chief international economist for High-Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients. Traders, investors and speculators have looked at the size and cost of the fiscal stimulus proposed by the United States and other governments — especially Italy — and decided to sell sovereign debt of all kinds.\n\nInvestors said corporate debt markets also are not yet operating smoothly. Companies have taken advantage of record-low interest rates in recent years to load up on debt. That strategy worked well so long as short-term borrowings could be periodically refinanced.\n\nAD\n\nNow, some cash-strapped companies that are not earning enough to make their loan payments may struggle to roll over their debt, said Anne Van Praagh, head of global credit strategy for Moody's Investors Service.\n\nAD\n\nLike most investors, Moody's anticipates a wave of credit downgrades and corporate debt defaults. Energy companies hit by the abrupt oil price decline and businesses that are most exposed to the evaporation of consumer spending — such as airlines, hotels, cruises, and automakers — face the greatest risk.\n\nWe're going to go into a period of severe and extensive credit shock across many regions, sectors and asset classes, she said. This is unprecedented.\n\nAD\n\nAmid unpredictable day-to-day changes in market conditions, former Fed Chairs Janet L. Yellen and Ben Bernanke called for the central bank to begin purchasing high-quality corporate debt as part of its economic rescue efforts — something it has never before done.\n\nThe Fed's intervention could help restart that part of the corporate debt market, which is under significant stress, the pair wrote in The Financial Times.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow's plunge from its all-time high of 29,551 on Feb. 12 has eliminated one of the president's favorite campaign arguments. As stocks soared since the 2016 election, Trump repeatedly took credit at campaign rallies and in White House remarks. He drew attention to the market setting all-time highs and boasted about the effect on voters' investment accounts.\n\nAD\n\nAs late as Feb. 24, the president took to Twitter to talk up stock prices, tweeting: Stock market starting to look very good to me.\n\nThe Dow has lost more than 8,000 points since then.\n\nShares of Boeing, once the showcase of the bull market, closed just below $102, less than one-quarter of its March 2019 peak. Trump has pledged federal aid for the wheezing aerospace giant.\n\nIf 2008 was the Great Financial Crisis, this is the Great Virus Crisis, said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. It's all at once a health crisis, financial crisis and economic crisis. We need to fix the health part of it before we have it solved, but we can take financial and fiscal steps to blunt its effects. We are starting to do that now.\n\nAll three major U.S. stock indexes are in a correction, having declined beyond 20 percent from their highs.\n\nThe Dow marked its eighth straight day of 1,000-point swings, which was considered unthinkable until recently. Stocks are moving on every news conference, financial proposal, headline and medical utterance. The blue chips closed up more than 1,000 points Tuesday off news of a $1 trillion stimulus proposal from the White House.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut that gain was wiped out on Wednesday, as investors sold stocks despite extreme government intervention aimed at cushioning the economy against a coronavirus-fueled recession. The Federal Reserve began the week by slashing interest rates to near zero and reviving a financial crisis-era quantitative easing program, and on Tuesday the central bank announced plans for a special fund to keep credit flowing during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe longer the economy is in a deep freeze, the strain is only going to increase, said Heppenstall. There's just so much uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus. It makes it hard for anyone to plan.\n\nEuropean markets also tanked Wednesday as governments introduced sweeping, blank-check stimulus moves to prop up their economies, with the benchmark Stoxx 600 index closing down more than 4 percent as oil and gas stocks plunged. Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom have hurled hundreds of billions in rescue package funding at the virus. French President Emmanuel Macron went so far as to promise that no French company will be allowed to fail because of the coronavirus impact, saying the government would provide assistance through loans or delayed tax payments and even nationalize industries to keep them afloat.\n\nYields on Italian debt rose to 2.3 percent, roughly twice what they were less than one week ago.
Torres could not recall the name of the person who modified the list or the exact date of the incident. But she said she continued in her job at the club and was later working in the kitchen when Trump visited the club under Secret Service protection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTorres's account, first reported by the New York Times, suggests that the presence of undocumented workers at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., was known by at least some managers. Last month, several women went public to say that they worked at the club without legal immigration status.\n\nTrump Organization officials and White House officials declined to comment.\n\nThe presence of undocumented workers at one of the president's signature golf clubs stands in sharp juxtaposition to his staunch rhetoric against illegal immigration. Since launching his White House bid, Trump has vowed to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out undocumented migrants, accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the country. His demand for more than $5 billion to build the wall has led to the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump touted his company's hiring practices. In the fall of 2016, when he opened a new Trump hotel in Washington, he told the assembled audience: We didn't have one illegal immigrant on the job. Everybody knows it.\n\nAnibal Romero, a Newark-based immigration attorney, said he now represents five immigrants who say they had worked at Trump's Bedminster club without legal status in recent years. Investigators with the FBI and the New Jersey attorney general's office have collected employment documents on his clients in recent months, he said, an indication that the agencies may be scrutinizing the hiring practices of the president's club.\n\nMeanwhile, Torres's experience and that of another worker suggest that the Secret Service may not have had a full picture of who was in proximity to Trump and his guests when they visited the Bedminster club.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVictorina Morales, 45, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who said she worked as a housekeeper in a different part of the club cleaning Trump's villa, said Secret Service agents gave her a pin to wear every time Trump visited.\n\nI had to wear the pin to get into the golf club, Morales said in an interview Thursday.\n\nHer supervisor asked her to sign her name to receive a pin, but Morales said she explained that she did not know how to write, so she didn't sign. I told them I couldn't write, so they let me go at that, she said.\n\nMorales said she recalls one pin having an American flag and another with a design that she did not recall.\n\nSecret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said a Secret Service pin bearing the U.S. flag is a novelty item and is not used by the Secret Service as a means of identification, verification or access control. She declined to discuss what kind of pins agents may have provided Morales.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOfficial pins indicating someone has permission to enter secure areas have other designs; they are provided to venue staffers by the Secret Service only after a background check, according to former officials.\n\nIt is unclear whether Morales received such a screening. She said she did not recall being asked to submit her information in advance but said she assumed her supervisor provided it.\n\nIf that person got a pin without being screened, that's a serious violation of the protocol, according to a person familiar with the Secret Service screening process who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nMilhoan said the agency does not comment on our protective operations, including the administration of our name-check program. She declined to say whether officials ever screened Morales or Torres for a Trump visit to the Bedminster club.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe revelations about undocumented workers at Bedminster surfaced publicly in the Times last month, when Morales and Sandra Diaz, a 46-year-old Costa Rican native, said they were hired by the New Jersey club despite their lack of legal immigration status.\n\nMorales said Thursday that she told a Bedminster supervisor when she applied for the housekeeping job in 2013 that she did not have proper immigration papers to work legally in the United States. She recalled being told: It's no problem here. You don't need papers.\n\nThey knew I didn't have good papers, said Morales, who worked at the club until last month. Romero, her attorney, provided The Washington Post with payroll and tax documents from recent years that list her employment at the Bedminster golf course.\n\nAD\n\nTrump Organization officials have repeatedly declined to address the specific allegations by the workers. Last month, spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a statement: We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices. If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately.\n\nAD\n\nA person close to the organization said that an internal investigation of claims made by former workers at Bedminster produced no credible information to support a range of allegations they made, including that managers were aware of employees without legal status.\n\nTorres said she began working at the club in early 2015 doing housekeeping and then moved to the kitchen staff, first as a dishwasher and later in food preparation, earning $14.50 per hour. She said she got the job with a fake Social Security number.\n\nAD\n\nMorales said she worked with Torres in housekeeping and said she recalled her transferring to the kitchen staff.\n\nTrump visited Bedminster at least a half-dozen times during the 2016 campaign, according to news coverage of his travel. Around the time he became the Republican nominee, Torres said, security got tighter at the golf club, particularly when he was visiting.\n\nAD\n\nFor presidential candidates under Secret Service protection, the agency seeks to check the backgrounds and criminal records of anyone who will be in proximity to the candidate at events. Agents from a local field office who are preparing for a candidate visit require the management of the venue hosting the visit — whether it is a hotel, a convention center or a golf club — to provide, several days before, the names of all employees who will prepare food, entertain or wait on the candidate.\n\nAD\n\nThe Secret Service's protective intelligence division then runs those names through a national FBI database to determine whether anyone is wanted for a bench warrant or has any history of arrests or convictions for drugs or violent crimes.\n\nAt one point, Secret Service agents arrived at the Bedminster club and kitchen supervisors asked all kitchen staffers to put their names, ages and Social Security numbers on a list, Torres said. She said she could not recall exactly when that occurred.\n\nAD\n\nTorres said she and other undocumented employees gave their information but then grew concerned that it would be used to discover their immigration status.\n\nShe said she grabbed a golf cart and drove to an administrative office, where she asked a human resources employee to remove her name from the list. When asked why, she recalled, she said: Because I'm undocumented. I don't have papers.\n\nTorres said the human resources official agreed to take her and several other undocumented Hispanics off the list.\n\nShe took a pen and crossed it out, she said. She crossed out our names.\n\nTorres said she was later working at the club on occasions when Trump visited. At times, Secret Service agents who accompanied him were Hispanic, Torres said, and the kitchen staffers would chat with them in Spanish.\n\nTorres said she left her job in Bedminster in 2017 because she felt uncomfortable as a woman in a mostly male kitchen. She said she was also stressed out by the intensity of working during Trump visits, when she would arrive at 8 a.m. but often not leave until late at night. She also said she did not like Trump's comments about immigrants.\n\nHer experience with Trump personally, she added, was not unpleasant. At one point, she recalled, he shook her hand and told her she was doing a good job, before giving her a $50 tip.
Regular readers of The Fact Checker know we often warn about campaign attacks highlighting certain votes or comments that are so old they often lack context. Overall, Sanders offers a misleading portrayal. So here's a guide to these statements.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1983, Biden pushed to raise the Social Security retirement age.\n\nSanders cites a newspaper clip from Jan. 11, 1983, that says, Biden suggested a gradual increase in the retirement age would help improve the Social Security system. This was not a controversial position at the time. Two months after these comments, large bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate agreed to the Social Security amendments of 1983, which included raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing payroll taxes to improve the solvency of the program.\n\nThe broad outlines of the plan was recommended by the National Commission on Social Security Reform and is believed to have strengthened the long-term health of Social Security. Sanders, in 1999, praised the 1983 law an example of bipartisan cooperation.\n\nAD\n\nWe should remember that in 1982, Social Security was within a few months — a few months — of not being able to pay out all benefits owed to Americans, Sanders said. And then people came together and said of course we want to save Social Security. They worked together, and they did.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1984, Joe Biden first pushed to freeze funding for Social Security — which would end up cutting Social Security benefits.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, bipartisan alarm grew over soaring federal budget deficits under President Ronald Reagan. Biden, along with two Republican senators and another Democrat (Max Baucus of Montana), proposed a simple solution — a one-year freeze on all spending, including defense spending and social programs such as Social Security.\n\nAD\n\nBiden pitched it as the last best chance to keep deficits from undermining the economic recovery and dropping the country into another recession. He also said it would avoid having to make other significant changes in Medicare and significant changes in Social Security generally.\n\nThe plan was rejected 33 to 65, though more Democrats than Republicans voted for it.\n\nAD\n\nWhatever one may make of the proposal, it was not aimed at Social Security specifically but was part of an effort to reduce the budget deficit. The Washington Post reported the dramatic simplicity of the plan was its fatal flaw as conservatives rebelled at the deep cuts it would have made in Reagan's military buildup, liberals balked at the constraints it would have put on major domestic benefit programs such as Social Security and many moderates shuddered at both results.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1995, I was on the House floor fighting the GOP's efforts to cut Social Security. Five days later, Joe Biden gave a speech in the Senate bragging about his work with the GOP to try to freeze funding for Social Security.\n\nFast forward 10 years to another budget fight. Republicans had taken control of the House and Senate and were pressing for passage of a balanced-budget amendment. Biden did make a floor speech on Jan. 31, 1995, which referenced his 1984 effort to freeze all spending.\n\nAD\n\nWhen I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.\n\nAD\n\nAgain, Sanders frames this as an effort only about Social Security, but it was much broader — aimed at every part of government, including defense.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Joe Biden was criticized by seniors' groups for supporting balanced budget amendments that would cut Social Security.\n\nSanders here cites a newspaper clip that says an array of liberal-leaning groups — not just senior groups — were angry at Biden for supporting an amendment to the constitution mandating a balanced budget. The fear was that such an amendment would force reductions in domestic spending.\n\nAD\n\nBiden was one of 10 Democrats in the Senate who supported the amendment; 35 Democrats were opposed. But the amendment failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority for passage.\n\nAD\n\nThe amendment itself does not mention Social Security. Biden tried to pass an amendment exempting Social Security, but he did not get the necessary votes. Social Security at the time was running huge surpluses, helping to mask the full extent of the budget deficit.\n\nFor the next 20 years or so, revenues from the Social Security Trust Fund will make it look like we have balanced the budget when in fact we have not, and after that the huge outlays from the trust fund will force drastic reductions in the rest of federal spending, or drastic reductions in Social Security, Biden said in his floor speech.\n\nIn 1996, Joe Biden floated the idea of reducing Social Security benefits through an early version of chained CPI.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere, Sanders cites a newspaper clip of Biden in a debate with a Republican challenger. The solvency of Social Security was considered an urgent issue at the time, given the pending retirement of the baby boom generation, and Republicans promoted ideas such as allowing Americans to divert Social Security moneys into private investment accounts. Biden's challenger supported that idea. In the debate, Biden countered that there were less dramatic ways to find savings in Social Security such as reducing the interest rate to calculate cost of living benefits or boosting the retirement age by a year.\n\nA Chained CPI — Chained Consumer Price Index — is a different way of calculating increases in the cost of living. It assumes people adjust buying patterns when prices changes, and it results in a slightly lower rate of inflation. So benefits for programs such as Social Security grow at a slower rate — what Sanders calls a cut.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Sanders saying in 1996 that the aging population made it clear that we will have to make incremental adjustments in Social Security taxes and benefits — as Congress has done in the past. The Sanders campaign has insisted adjustments did not mean reductions in benefits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2007, NBC reported that as president, Joe Biden's Social Security plans 'would include discussing options such as upping the retirement age.'\n\nSanders here cites a news story (actually by the Associated Press but on the NBC News website) from when Biden was running for president, titled Biden unveils plan to protect retirement savings. The article is mostly about his plan to bolster retirement savings but adds:\n\nTo protect Social Security, Biden said he would bring both parties to the table to keep the plan paying out. That would include discussing options such as upping the retirement age and raising the cap on income subject to the Social Security tax past the $97,500 it was in 2007. 'It ain't broke — it doesn't need privatization,' he said of Social Security. 'There's other ways to help savings.'\n\nAgain, you can see Biden's comments mostly are intended to rebut Republican hopes for private Social Security accounts. Raising the cap on the amount of income subject to Social Security tax — currently $137,700 — was a common proposal by Democrats at that time.\n\nIn 2007, Joe Biden appeared on Meet the Press to say that Social Security and Medicare cuts should be 'on the table.'\n\nAD\n\nBiden was challenged by host Tim Russert on the growing budget deficit, and he indicated a willingness to bargain if a lasting deal could be reached.\n\nRussert: Senator, we have a deficit. We have Social Security and Medicare looming. The number of people on Social Security and Medicare is now 40 million people. It's going to be 80 million in 15 years. Would you consider looking at those programs, age of eligibility … Biden: Absolutely. Russert: …cost of living, put it all on the table.\n\nBiden went on to cite the bipartisan agreement leading to the 1983 Social Security amendments: That's the kind of leadership that is needed. Social Security's not the hard one to solve. Medicare, that is the gorilla in the room, and you've got to put all of it on the table.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, when the soaring federal deficit again was a major issue, President Barack Obama and then House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) discussed a grand bargain that would have raised the retirement age and changed the formula for calculating Social Security benefits, in addition to reductions to Medicare and Medicaid, in exchange for higher taxes on the wealthy. No deal was ever reached.\n\nThough it's not in the Twitter thread, we are going to add one more example, sent to The Fact Checker by Sanders research director Tyson Brody, since it might appear in some future attack.\n\n1995: Biden offers to cut $89 billion from Medicare.\n\nDuring a Senate floor speech over the GOP plan for a balanced budget calling for reducing Medicare spending by $270 billion over seven years, Biden said, You guys want a balanced budget in 7 years, and you want CBO [Congressional Budget Office] numbers. I want a balanced budget, too, but I do not want to cut as much Medicare as you do. I do not want to cut as much as you do, and I do not want to give as big a tax break as you want.''\n\nBiden went on to say: So we can make a deal, make a deal. We will split the difference between the CBO figure of 2.4 and the OMB [Office of Management and Budget] figure of 2.6. Take 2.5 — that is $250 billion. And make another agreement. Agree I will go for a bigger cut in Medicare. I say we only need to do $89 billion. That is all we need — not $270 billion. I will split the difference with you on that.\n\nThis was not an unusual position for a Democrat at the time. A few months later, President Bill Clinton unveiled a budget plan that would have cut Medicare by $124 billion over seven years, a much bigger reduction than suggested by Biden.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSanders framed this as 40 years of working with Republicans to cut Social Security. But these statements came during periods when a growing budget deficit was a major concern in official Washington. Biden, like many mainstream politicians, thought action needed to be taken.\n\nIn some cases, Biden offered proposals intended to counter more extreme options offered by Republicans. At other times, Biden indicated a willingness to bargain with Republicans, though any deal resulting in spending reductions in entitlement programs was forever elusive. After 1983, the benefit cuts never happened.\n\nIn one case — 1983 — Sanders attacks Biden for supporting a deal that Sanders himself had praised. That's rich.\n\nAlso missing from this picture are the many votes Biden took to increase certain Social Security benefits or block GOP plans; the Biden campaign provides a list of nearly 50 votes from Biden's long Senate career.\n\nMeanwhile, both parties now appear to have abandoned any pretense about caring about budget deficits. Biden's campaign platform calls for raising Social Security payroll taxes on wealthier Americans and boosting benefits for people who have been receiving Social Security payments for at least 20 years.\n\nBiden certainly could be challenged on why he took these positions at the time, but the snippets cited by Sanders are missing important context.\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter
The economic challenges posed by the virus are unique in that they are already hitting supply and demand. The former refers to the inability of workers to go to work, because of quarantines either at their jobs or their kids' schools, along with disruptions to the global flow of goods to retailers and factories. The latter refers to reduced spending at restaurants, movie theaters, stores, etc. Consider, for example, the many trips, vacations and conferences already being canceled. Add to that the chance that millions of workers without paid leave could lose paychecks, and you begin to get a sense of the sudden shock to commerce.\n\nThe combined effect of decreased demand and disrupted supply can lead to a serious recession. While we can hope the effects of the epidemic will be short-lived and the economy will quickly bounce back, we cannot take this for granted. Therefore, policymakers must move quickly to prepare effective economic countermeasures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong our most prominent concerns are the millions of employees who may be told not to come to work but who lack paid leave. While more than 70 percent of private-sector workers have some degree of paid sick leave, for workers in the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale, that share falls to 47 percent. Based on their low, often nonexistent, savings, such workers have little to fall back on if they're not getting paid.\n\nThere are various ways to quickly provide the support these households need.\n\nUnemployment insurance is often the first line of defense in a downturn, and we should be sure that state systems are ready to respond quickly. Two important considerations: Some big state trust funds (New York, California and Texas) are running low, and state agencies need to know that employees who are available for work but locked out because of a quarantine are eligible for unemployment insurance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne fast way to administer help is for the government to send checks to low- and middle-income households, a measure that was last used in 2008, when the George W. Bush administration sent out about $100 billion in 2008 to about 70 million households, which got an average check of about $1,100 in today's dollars. Research found these checks to be particularly useful to low-income households.\n\nThis intervention must be structured to reach low-income households without federal income-tax liabilities. (To be clear, these households do pay other federal taxes, most notably payroll taxes.) This is a huge limitation of the federal tax cuts under consideration by the Trump administration.\n\nSomething we really don't want is for sick workers who don't have paid leave to go to work, a known problem well before the coronavirus. Providing a generous tax break to employers (e.g. $800 per worker) to grant at least seven sick days a year to workers not covered would be a substantial incentive. In the same vein, we may also want to encourage employers to allow telecommuting, where possible. A modest credit for allowing telecommuting (e.g. $400) could increase the use of this option. An advantage of both these credits is that any changes are likely to be permanent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt various times in the recent past, we've quickly put more money into workers' paychecks by temporarily lowering their FICA (payroll) tax. This, too, requires legislation, a key part of which is to ensure that the Social Security Trust Fund is repaid through general revenue, as occurred the last time we tapped this source of quick relief.\n\nAll of the above are countercyclical fiscal measures: government spending to offset the shock. Monetary policy is also germane in this context, and the Federal Reserve has already signaled a willingness to cut the benchmark interest rate it controls to cheapen credit. There is, however, a good chance that rate cuts will be of limited help. First, credit is already cheap. But more important, if people are afraid of getting sick in public places, they won't take trips or go out to eat no matter how low interest rates fall. Nor will rate cuts reopen workplaces, factories and schools that are closed because of the virus.\n\nTurning to other ways in which the virus threatens family incomes, we need to be sure that people don't avoid testing and treatment because of insurance and surprise billing concerns. The Affordable Care Act covers government-recommended vaccines, but that option is many months away. The broader public interest makes this a critical moment for the government to pick up the tab for coronavirus-related treatment. Congress should act quickly to require that insurers cover testing and treatment for the coronavirus in the same way they are required to cover various forms of preventive care at no charge to patients.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe can also improve on the process of developing a vaccine. As Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar testified recently, we don't know whether a vaccine will be affordable because the holder of the patent will be able to charge whatever it wants.\n\nThis is unacceptable. It's fine and necessary for the government to provide resources to private companies to speed up development and testing of the vaccine, but there need to be two conditions. First, all the findings have to be made public as quickly as is practical. We want researchers worldwide to be able to benefit from any new findings to get to an effective vaccine as quickly as possible. The model here is the Bermuda Principles for the Human Genome Project, where results were posted nightly.\n\nSecond, any patents resulting from this work will be in the public domain. This means a successful vaccine will be available as a cheap generic from day one. The companies don't need to be compensated for their research because they've already been paid.

AD\n\nAD\n\nThe first doctorate in education was awarded in 1921 by Harvard. The first doctor of philosophy degree in the field of education was awarded in 1893 by Teachers College of Columbia, and has since been offered by hundreds of universities. As with any degree that stresses a research background, most schools required a dissertation and qualifying exams.\n\nBottom line: A holder of an EdD degree is as entitled to the title doctor as a veterinarian, and certainly as much as a lawyer and much more than a chiropractor.\n\nDavid E. Silber, Bethesda\n\nThe writer holds a doctoral degree.\n\nThe Dec. 29 Style article How op-eds sparked outrage all year long raised some interesting questions. Should the goal of an op-ed be inducing outrage? Are only national op-eds of importance? What happens to our democracy if we rely only on a few media sources — no matter how good — for news and commentary?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe article put a lot of emphasis on op-eds that caused controversy over the past year, rather than op-eds that advanced public policy debates and helped to develop an informed consensus. The real story is that op-eds, when done right, make us think and help us understand — they build consensus on policy concerns and contribute to a public debate.\n\nAnd it's not just about the elite 'legacy' publications defined as two newspapers in New York and one in D.C. Having spent more than 30 years offering thought-provoking op-eds to newspapers around the country, I can attest that there are thousands of outlets with thriving op-ed pages that are trusted and needed. They help readers understand what's going on in the nation, in their state capitals and in their local communities, whether it's redistricting, budget priorities or environmental concerns.\n\nWhen much of the action is grass-roots and outside the Beltway, we need the ideas and analysis that commentary pieces in the regional and local newspapers provide to help us better understand what's going on around the nation and in local communities and to find solutions. Politicians, even when they're in Washington, rely on their local papers to keep on top of their constituents' concerns. Providing a platform for reasoned exchanges of ideas at the national, regional and local levels helps build consensus on policy concerns — and bring us together.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe op-ed pages, as incubators of ideas, are an irreplaceable forum in our democracy that we need now more than ever.\n\nDenice Zeck, Washington\n\nThe writer is executive director of American Forum.\n\n●\n\nAn edifice to an edifying educator\n\nI am a great fan of Catherine Rampell's columns and loved her Dec. 25 op-ed celebrating her sixth-grade teacher, Priceless lessons from my sixth-grade English teacher. Like Rampell, I am the beneficiary of many excellent teachers who changed my life enormously. I am also the husband and father of teachers. I particularly enjoyed Rampell's phrase about her teacher instructing her about the masonry of language. Lovely piece.\n\nAD\n\nMarc Chafetz, Washington\n\nRepaying a teacher for such gifts is impossible, recalled Catherine Rampell in her Dec. 25 op-ed, Priceless lessons from my sixth-grade English teacher. She used her space to reflect on the influence of Mr. Greco, an educator she credited with any success [she's] had as a writer.\n\nAD\n\nAs a former middle school English teacher, I often wonder about my students and the memories we carved out together. I wonder about the youngster whose profound and self-conscious stuttering made his ability to participate an impossibility for fear of exposure. I remember how writing poetry liberated him by providing the perfect platform for sharing his debilitating struggle with his classmates and providing them with a lesson in humanity and sensitivity.\n\nAD\n\nRampell's words serve as a reminder that, though an educator such as Jill Biden, a woman with a doctorate, and Greco, a man with a passion for teaching, may not be able to minister to a heart attack victim on a flight from New York to Los Angeles, they provide the resources for those who can and do. No one makes it through life without teachers, many of whom save just as many if not more lives than the doctor on the plane. Thanks for reminding us.\n\nCarole Tauber, Rockville\n\nAD\n\n●\n\nSo funny we forgot to laugh\n\nI love Dave Barry, he's funny, and God knows we all need a laugh at the end of a year like 2020. With that said, he had no fewer than five jokes in his Year in Review 2020 column [Washington Post Magazine, Dec. 27] making fun of President-elect Joe Biden's age (he can't remember things, he's out of touch, can't think clearly and so on).\n\nAD\n\n1. New campaign slogan: Somewhat Alert at Times.\n\n2. Biden's campaign message will go viral as soon as Joe decides what it is.\n\n3. The campaign focuses on finding a running mate who has a name that Joe can remember.\n\n4. Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris's criticisms: Joe has forgotten all about that. Literally.\n\n5. At the presidential debate, Biden inspires his supporters by appearing, most of the time, to be fully aware that he is participating in a debate.\n\nAD\n\nThe Post would not have tolerated homophobic or transphobic jokes in this (or any other) column, nor insensitive and stereotypic jokes at the expense of women, Black people or people with disabilities. Therefore, I am at a loss why The Post still considers such blatant ageism as falling within its editorial standards.\n\nAD\n\nRiki Wilchins, Miami Beach\n\nIt appears that Dave Barry's Year in Review 2020 was what we all thought: no laughing matter.\n\nAvis Fleming, Alexandria\n\n●\n\nWho's that lady?\n\nI can't be the only one who was intrigued — downright curious, to be honest — by the solitary, seemingly contemplative woman pictured at the Lincoln Memorial at dawn on Dec. 27, the day President Trump signed the $900 billion relief package [Treasury aims to begin sending relief money this week, news, Dec. 29]. Who is she? What was she doing there? Had she been there all night, perhaps a sentinel of some kind?\n\nAD\n\nSteve Horwitz, Odenton\n\n●\n\nGeorgism isn't socialism\n\nIn his Dec. 31 Style article, Throwaway lines in the literary life? Not really., Michael Dirda described Progress and Poverty as Henry George's masterpiece of socialist thought. To the contrary, George rejected socialism, and his masterful analysis of economic problems, a bestseller in the 1880s and still applicable today, includes an analysis of why governmental direction and interference were not the answer to continued poverty and unemployment amid material progress.\n\nAD\n\nNeither a socialist nor a lackey of the robber barons, George favored liberty and free enterprise, but he opposed fortunes built upon special privilege, and, in particular, he advocated a single tax on the value of land and the abolition of other taxes. This would enable people to keep what they earned but not enjoy riches from the possession of land that they had done nothing to create.\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps Dirda has forgotten what he learned in the correspondence course in fundamental economics he took when he was 14. Such a lover of literature as he might wish to try reading Progress and Poverty as an adult; it is a literary masterpiece of elegant prose and lucid reasoning.\n\nNicholas D. Rosen, Philadelphia\n\nThe writer is president of the Center for the Study of Economics.\n\n●\n\nThe long and short of 'shrift'\n\nThe Dec. 30 editorial A bad stimulus idea said of the recently passed coronavirus relief bill, In short, the measure short-shrifted the neediest and showered billions on people who suffered little or no lasting hardship from the pandemic. I take no issue with the argument, but the writers probably meant the bill shortchanged the neediest, as in gave too little money to.\n\nShrift, from the verb to shrive, is confession of one's sins to a priest and presumably forgiveness. This was a rite so important to some Christian believers that it was sometimes done by a priest on the battlefield, with less than proper time or ceremony, for a dying soldier to expiate his sins before meeting his maker. This was known as short shrift, an expression that has come to mean to make a rush job of something. Victims of various plagues in history also got short shrift, without priests to hear their final confessions, and, sadly, many of the more than 350,000 Americans who have died of the coronavirus were also deprived of the comfort of last rites or family in their last hours because of the dangerous contagion of this disease.\n\nS.R. Hankinson, Stoddard, N.H.\n\n●\n\nA failure to see — and show\n\nWe all know that a picture is worth a thousand words. So why neglect to include a photograph of the late Susan Moore, whose video alleged racist treatment as she was dying of the coronavirus with the Dec. 27 op-ed by Aletha Maybank, Camara Phyllis Jones, Uché Blackstock and Joia Crear Perry, Say her name: Dr. Susan Moore. Online, the piece included a photograph that featured a White woman as its primary subject.\n\nThe lack of a photograph with the op-ed ironically underscored the very problem that the piece complained about: the failure to see Black women, to hear Black women and to listen to Black women, particularly when they are suffering.\n\nStacy Beck, Washington\n\n●\n\nCalming fears of a nuclear Pearl Harbor\n\nThe Dec. 27 obituary for George Blake, British spy divulged secrets to Soviets, did a good job capturing the remarkable life of one of the Cold War's most dangerous spies. However, the article mistakenly reported that the famed Berlin tunnel — the 1950s CIA and MI6 operation tapping Red Army communications in East Berlin that was betrayed by Blake — produced no worthwhile intelligence and that the Soviets used the phone lines for . . . disinformation. In fact, the consensus now among intelligence historians is that the information captured by the tunnel was valuable and that the KGB likely did not plant false information on the tapped lines. The sheer volume of intercepted phone calls and teletype messages — some 90,000 over 11 months — speaks to the improbability of a disinformation campaign.\n\nAs Blake told me when I interviewed him in 2015 for my book about the Berlin tunnel, slipping disinformation into an enormous stream of genuine communications would have been very easily spotted. Blake was one of only a handful of American and British intelligence officers who knew about the tunnel, and he would almost certainly have been exposed as a spy had the communications been doctored. Despite learning of the tunnel before it was even dug, the KGB opted to protect Blake and not warn Red Army commanders.\n\nRather than an intelligence fiasco, the tunnel provided the West with a wealth of information about Soviet military capabilities and intentions. At a time before U-2 planes and spy satellites were operating and there was high anxiety about a Soviet surprise attack, the tunnel intelligence calmed President Dwight D. Eisenhower's fears of a nuclear Pearl Harbor.\n\nSteve Vogel, Barnesville\n\nThe writer is a former Post reporter and the author of Betrayal in Berlin.\n\n●\n\nA flagrant foul\n\nAgain and again, The Post's coverage of women's sports is disproportionately — and discriminatingly — less than that of men's sports.\n\nOn Jan. 1, the University of Maryland's men's basketball team received 50 inches of column space — starting on the section front — and a photograph, even though the team lost an unmemorable game (84-73, against Michigan) that it was expected to lose.\n\nIn contrast, the women's basketball team received 12 inches of column space — starting on Page 5 — without a photograph, even though it won an outstanding game (96-82, against Penn State) in which Ashley Owusu scored a career-high 34 points. The highest-scoring men's player netted 19 points.\n\nThis follows a pattern of demeaning women's sports — yes, throughout the industry, but The Post should take the lead in reversing that pattern.\n\nConstance L. Belfiore, University Park\n\n●\n\nThe topography of memory\n\nI began my 50-year full- and part-time career with the U.S. Geological Survey in 1965, spending the first few years as a member of the compilation staff for the National Atlas of the United States, and I am proud to be listed on the atlas's acknowledgments page. So I greatly enjoyed the Dec. 27 Outlook essay by Ted Widmer, 765 maps that drew us together, even after a half-century has passed. I do not believe that I ever thought of the book as singing a love song to America; however, with hindsight, it may be an apt description.\n\nI emailed the article to friends and colleagues and would have liked to notify those who worked on it with me, but to do so after 50 years would necessitate there being email in heaven, as I am one of the few survivors. Actually, I would prefer there not be Internet in the great beyond, as I want peace and tranquility when I pass on. Thanks for this review, which brought a smile to this aged cartographer at the end of a troubled 2020.\n\nJohn Wittmann, Lanham\n\n●\n\nTear down this misconception\n\nGillian Brockell's Jan. 4 Retropolis article Controversial Lincoln statue is removed in Boston, but remains in D.C. misrepresented Frederick Douglass's comments on the Emancipation Memorial. According to Brockell, Douglass suggested that the statue depicting Abraham Lincoln and an African American freedman be replaced or added to. In fact, Douglass never suggested that the statue be removed or replaced.\n\nHistorians Jonathan White and Scott Sandage, who recently rediscovered a letter discussing the memorial written by Douglass, accurately characterized Douglass's real proposal, which was not to remove the memorial . . . nor to replace it but to supplement it with other works of art that would tell a more complete story.\n\nBret Boyce, Washington\n\n●\n\nShining in the darkness\n\nNow that we have closed the door on 2020, I thank The Post for being a bright spot in a terrible year. From Eli Saslow's heartbreaking Voices From the Pandemic to Michelle Singletary's eye-opening series on systemic racism to Robin Givhan's insightful commentary, it was outstanding journalism across the board. I also appreciated the addition of Kate Cohen's voice to the op-ed page.\n\nAlthough reading the news made me want to cry more often than not this year, The Post did an excellent job presenting the stories that needed to be shared.\n\nJane Rooney, Oakton
According to records on the committee's website, the last time the appropriations panel was without someone from the Old Dominion was 1915, when Woodrow Wilson was president and a quart of milk cost 9 cents.\n\nVirginia appropriators from the more recent past used their clout to arrange funding for Metro, bridge and highway improvements, defense projects, anti-gang initiatives, and even the Iraq Study Group.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the retirements of senior members such as Republicans Bob Goodlatte and Frank Wolf and Democrat Jim Moran and the state's shifting demographics made room for new faces in the delegation.\n\nThat's the trade-off, said Steve Stombres, who was chief of staff to Eric Cantor during Cantor's tenure as House majority leader and is now a consultant.\n\nWith turnover comes fresh energy and new perspective and people who are very connected with their constituents and that's the positive side, he said, but the down side is you lose seniority and the ability of members to look out for the needs of the commonwealth.\n\nAside from Appropriations, Virginia's established members in the Democratic majority will move up the ranks on high-profile committees.\n\nAD\n\n●Rep. Robert C. Bobby Scott, the longest-serving member of the delegation from either party, is chairman of the Education Committee.\n\nAD\n\n●Rep. Gerald E. Connolly expects to be named chairman of a subcommittee within the Oversight Committee, which will interview President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, next month.\n\n●Rep. Don Beyer will be seated on the Ways and Means Committee, ending Virginia's more than 20-year drought. The panel sets tax policy and will play a role in any infrastructure bill that materializes.\n\n●Rep. Donald A. McEachin, who is interested in environmental justice, will sit on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nCommittee assignments for the five freshmen have not yet been determined.\n\nAD\n\nOf the Democrats, Rep. Jennifer Wexton of Loudoun County has said she would like to serve on the Transportation or Science committees. Her predecessor, Republican Barbara Comstock, served on both.\n\nRep. Elaine Luria, a former naval commander, is shooting for Armed Services or Veterans' Affairs committees, and Rep. Abigail Spanberger tried for the Agriculture or Intelligence committees.\n\nAD\n\nRepublican freshman Rep. Ben Cline wants Transportation or Agriculture while Rep. Denver Riggleman said his top pick is Financial Services.\n\nThe horse-trading and cajoling to land a committee assignment starts right after the election, aides said.\n\nMembers write letters and try to persuade leadership and members of a steering and policy committee and people close to them using political considerations, relationships, historical precedent, district geography and whatever else they can think of.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2017, with the GOP in charge of the House, Scott W. Taylor, a former Navy SEAL elected from Virginia Beach, did the near-impossible, winning a seat on the Appropriations Committee as a Republican freshman after a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, personal letters and a two-page flier extolling his virtues.\n\nAD\n\nHe argued that his district, with proximity to eight major military installations, including the largest naval base in the world, relied heavily on federal appropriations.\n\nTaylor got his wish, but lost to Luria in November.\n\nThis year, Democrats considered Virginia part of the Mid-Atlantic region with the District, Delaware, New Jersey and Maryland, which meant Wexton had to compete with more seasoned members from states with more Democratic members.\n\nAD\n\nIn the end, the three-term Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) was nominated for the Appropriations slot.\n\nDo you think somebody from New Jersey is going to represent the interests of Virginia? said Wolf, a former congressman who represented northern Virginia for more than three decades and sat on Appropriations for most of that time.\n\nHe used the committee to fund the Baker-Hamilton Commission to study the war in Iraq and secure money to combat the transnational gang MS-13, among other priorities.\n\nAD\n\nOne of advantages of Appropriations is I can pick up the paper in the morning, go in and do something about it, he said. As a subcommittee chairman, he said, you can get the cabinet secretary on the phone and say, 'We got to move on this.' \n\nAD\n\nDespite their different party affiliations, Wolf worked closely with Moran, who also served on Appropriations during the course of his 23 years representing Northern Virginia in Congress.\n\nMoran, who left Congress in 2014, ticked off a partial list of projects funded through now-banned earmarks through Appropriations: the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, the Springfield traffic interchange, planning for rapid transit connecting Arlington and Alexandria, Four Mile Run, and extension of Metro to Dulles.\n\nBut losing the seat on the committee doesn't spell disaster.
But this time, the prop revolvers were loaded with live bullets, and half the audience thought the drama was real. Hawley's decision to challenge the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory transformed the process into a farce, in which Cruz and other Republican senators promised to outdo one another's displays of loyalty to President Trump — until a mob of Trump supporters invaded the Capitol. Their gambit was too jaundiced even for Mitch McConnell (whose biographer dubbed him The Cynic); the majority leader exhorted senators to respect the people's choice and not rely on others to do the right thing.\n\nMcConnell was right. The two main protagonists knew they were playacting. Hawley and Cruz graduated from top universities and law schools and clerkships. They know what the Constitution says and how elections work. Even before Wednesday, they understood that their maneuvers wouldn't actually overturn the 2020 results, so there would be no real consequences. (As a senior Republican said of the president's election fraud fantasies in November, What is the downside for humoring him?) Supposedly, the institutions of American democracy would hold, and they'd get to put on a show to further their presidential ambitions by encouraging a popular delusion on the right.\n\nThe problem is that these institutions — even the Constitution — are shaped by what politicians like Hawley and Cruz say and do, and whether people believe them. If everyone thinks the rules work one way, then they do. But if people's beliefs change, the rules change, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocracy is built upon the notion that politicians who lose elections will admit defeat and move on. By challenging this idea — however insincerely — Hawley and Cruz are helping unravel the core political bargains of American politics. Senators with presidential ambitions cannot treat fundamental beliefs about democracy as something they can put on and take off like a costume, returning to real life when the curtain drops. If they act as though they don't hold a core democratic belief, they may convince the audience to stop believing, too. Wednesday's invasion of Capitol Hill shows what happens when people are told that the election has been stolen from them and that there is a chance to take it back.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Republican senators have paid the price for a cynical bargain. Many of them are institutionalists who at first denounced Trump during the 2016 primary race, but endorsed him after he won the nomination and swore he'd grow into the presidency. Asked to justify his fealty, McConnell has pointed to the federal judges and three Supreme Court justices Republicans seated under Trump, as well as tax cuts. But Senate Republicans continued to defend Trump even as he repeatedly sabotaged his own party. There was the pointless 2018-2019 shutdown over Trump's border wall (the longest shutdown in history) and the president's recent threat to veto the coronavirus spending bill, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, just before the Georgia runoff elections that would decide which party controlled the Senate. There was the Ukraine scandal, which forced the Senate to spend time debating Trump's use of foreign policy for personal gain, even if the GOP did use its majority to acquit him at his impeachment trial. And there was Trump's tight embrace of Saudi Arabia after its leader had Jamal Khashoggi killed, a policy that so outraged Republican senators that they rebuked him for it.\n\nIt's not just American politicians whose artificial dramas can have unexpected consequences. Take British Prime Minister David Cameron. He wanted Britain to remain part of the European Union but worried that the electoral threat from the UK Independence Party might rip open a long-standing divide in his Conservative Party over E.U. membership.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCameron thought he'd found a solution: to promise a referendum that would allow the people to vote on leaving Europe. He figured it was only a pretend promise, and domestic and international institutions would save him from having to deliver. And even if the referendum went ahead, British voters would never choose the costly path of unwinding the country's deep ties to the E.U. Everyone who really counted knew that would be stupid, even if they sometimes pretended otherwise. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for instance, began his career making up stories about how the E.U. wanted to do ridiculous things like ban prawn cocktail crisps (a disgusting but popular British delicacy) but also happily described himself as a fan of the E.U.\n\nOf course, the other actors in Cameron's drama didn't stick to his script. Britons voted for Brexit by a narrow majority, transforming the United Kingdom into a fundamentally different country and threatening the union of its four nations.\n\nHawley, Cruz and Trump, too, are pursuing short-term political gain at the risk of long-term chaos. Their political theater leaves something — a big something — to chance. They justify their actions as a response to the demands of their constituents. But those actions set precedents and change beliefs about what politicians can and cannot legitimately do when they don't like election results. What will happen when other politicians decide they can make up the rules as they go along? Already, the Republican majority in Pennsylvania's Senate removed the lieutenant governor from presiding on Tuesday, because they didn't want to seat a Democratic senator who had won his election. While they justified this as a response to a unique set of circumstances, they too are setting precedents that others will follow.\n\nAs commentators have said, Republicans deserve the blame for what is happening to America's institutions. They may suffer some of the fallout, too. If Republicans stop recognizing results that they don't like, there is nothing to prevent Democrats from doing the same, tit-for-tat. Seven Republicans in the House of Representatives have warned that efforts to overturn the 2020 vote might erode the advantage that the electoral college gives to their party. GOP candidates need the college, since they have won the popular vote only once in the past 32 years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps the authors of Wednesday's revolt already regret their role in goading the mob. Now that the Democrats have taken the Senate, they are likely to press for federal election reform, a proposition that's anathema to the right. As political scientist Sam Rosenfeld describes it, some Republicans understand that they benefit more in the long term from legal anti-democratic institutions than from dubiously legal anti-democratic actions, which are more set-piece theatrical statements than carefully planned strategies.\n\nThe challenge for people who want to protect democracy is twofold. First, they need to prevent repeat performances of this most recent theater. Drama is an inevitable part of democratic politics. Politicians will always seek to highlight some problem they care about in ways that grab the public's attention. Naked ambition of the sort Hawley and Cruz displayed is also an essential part of politics and can be productive when it is yoked to real political needs. It becomes a problem when ambition leads politicians to blur the boundaries between dramatic fiction and essential political facts, undermining the shared beliefs that hold democracy together.\n\nWidespread delusion can have bitter consequences, as we saw Wednesday, when amateur dramatics led a misinformed audience to storm the stage. Cameron's mistakes meant that the country he led dropped out of Europe and is at greater risk of breaking apart. Cruz and Hawley's not only helped provoke a mob but could also make American democracy unworkable, as everyone starts challenging every result they don't like. Politicians can't rely on political institutions to save the country from the consequences of their playacting, because the institutions aren't outside the politicians, and the politicians aren't outside the institutions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, the republic's guardians should recognize that the fight to secure democracy isn't over just because the mob has been evicted from the Capitol. The processes that allow democracy to work (vote counting, redistricting, early voting, identification procedures and voter registration) seem very boring to the public in the years between major elections. But we can go back to enjoying the political performances — and shrugging when the players ham it up — only if everyone knows it's a play, and the machinery behind the curtain is strong.
AD\n\nCan we talk about the children's book? Harris said, picking up a copy of Superheroes Are Everywhere, which she published alongside her memoir this week. Mama didn't raise no fool.\n\nAD\n\nBut seriously: Barring some wild, unexpected development, Harris is expected to enter the 2020 presidential primary, with most speculation putting her in the race by the end of January. If and when she does, it would fulfill a promise that many politicians and operatives saw in Harris years ago.\n\nUnlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who had to be drafted into her 2012 run for Senate, and unlike John Delaney, who jump-started a presidential campaign with no speculation or buzz, Harris has been seen as a potential president for most of her time in public life. As early as 2010, when she was a slight underdog in the race for California attorney general, Harris was described as a female Obama.\n\nAD\n\nHarris is not the only candidate expected to announce soon after years of White House speculation. Julián Castro is likely to make it official Saturday, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is heading back to South Carolina this month. Both have been talked up as potential presidents since they were moving up the ladder in municipal politics at the start of this century.\n\nAD\n\nEach of those candidates comes with different strengths and weaknesses; each, like Harris, has been looked at as the future leader of a new Democratic coalition, as opposed to a candidate such as Joe Biden, who allies say could win back voters the party has lost. One way to read Harris's memoir, The Truths We Hold, is as a pitch to a Democratic base that has shifted since she wrote her first book, on her criminal justice record and agenda.\n\nHarris's book and its accompanying tour present a politician who was counted out in every election until 2016, when she won her Senate race in a rout. There is no setback that she doesn't overcome, from a failed attempt to pass the bar (she passed it the second time) to an apparent defeat in her 2010 attorney general run (late-counted ballots gave her the win). Like Barack Obama, and like a younger cohort of first-generation American politicians, she describes a family of smart strivers who struggled so that she could succeed — and learn valuable lessons.\n\nAD\n\nI have too many memories of my brilliant mother being treated as though she were dumb because of her accent, Harris writes of her India-born mother, Shyamala, who died of cancer in 2009. Memories of her being followed around a department store with suspicion, because surely a brown-skinned woman like her couldn't afford the dress or blouse she had chosen.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2003, Harris defeated an incumbent to become San Francisco district attorney. She spent seven years in that role, making her first national headlines for refusing to pursue the death penalty. In 2004, that led to a clash with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who spoke at the funeral of a police officer and called it the special circumstance called for by the death penalty law — adding that had she known of Harris's position, she never would have endorsed her.\n\nBut while this was a defining political moment for Harris, Feinstein appears in The Truths We Hold only once, in a fond memory Harris has of driving across the bridge from my home in Oakland to celebrate when Feinstein and Barbara Boxer became California's first female senators. The debates over the death penalty, which nearly cost her the 2010 race, come up only when Harris recalls how one strategist (never named) said a woman who is a minority who is anti-death penalty who is DA of wacky San Francisco could not win statewide office.\n\nAD\n\nTo be fair, Harris has written a book (Smart on Crime) about her criminal justice record and agenda. The part of that she focuses the most on in The Truths We Hold is her Back on Track program, an innovation of the San Francisco's DA office that allowed first-time nonviolent drug offenders to get job training in lieu of jail time. The book's focus when addressing her six years as attorney general is a showdown with banks over what would become a $25 billion foreclosure settlement. The story of her phone call to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, is destined to be retold in Iowa and New Hampshire: I took off my earrings (the Oakland in me) and picked up the receiver.\n\nAD\n\nBut fully half of The Truths We Hold covers Harris's time in the Senate, just two years in which Democrats won one epochal battle over health care (at GWU, Harris thanked the late, great John McCain), and sloughed through many more defeats. Harris stands foursquare behind Christine Blasey Ford and the protesters who filled the Senate during the hearings on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh: Their voices, like Dr. Ford's, will have lasting reach.\n\nShe reprints transcripts of hearings at which she grilled John Kelly, initially a nominee to run the Department of Homeland Security, positioning the Trump administration's immigration policy as its defining debacle. She pitches ideas such as mental-health career training similar to Teach for America or the Peace Corps, and calls for the DEA to go after pharmaceutical manufacturers while the war on drugs is wound down.\n\nAD\n\nThe effect of all that is to present Harris as a perfect fit for the Democrats of 2020, one who was early and right about much of what the party's base cares about, and who was in the mix opposing Trump on everything that mattered. The book and the tour, which has been dominated by friendly, encouraging interviews, offer less clarity about how Harris can navigate two incredibly different electoral constituencies.\n\nAD\n\nHarris started her political career as a newsmaking opponent of capital punishment and is now accused by the left, pejoratively, of being a cop. That was never an issue in her California races; it will be an issue for plenty of Democratic voters in 2019. A senator whose smart-on-crime brand enabled her rise out of Bay Area politics is angling for the nomination to challenge President Trump, a politician who comes alive when attacking her community's support for undocumented immigrants, gun control and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nHer party's left, which has accused her of being cautious and resisting criminal justice reform ever since she moved out of the DA's office, does not get much detail about why she picked some fights and avoided others. The president's party, which is itching to run a 2010-style campaign against Harris as an embodiment of sanctuary cities and #MeToo politics, comes away with more material.\n\nAD\n\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) apologized on Jan. 10 to women who alleged they were sexually harassed or mistreated by male members of his 2016 campaign staff. (Reuters)\n\nBernie Agonistes. For two weeks, as he considers whether to run for president again, Bernie Sanders has gotten questions about female former staffers who say they were harassed during his 2016 campaign. Sanders, who put out a statement reflecting previous stories about the staff issues, went further today. In between the rollout of a prescription drug bill and an appearance with furloughed federal workers, Sanders walked up to Senate microphones and delivered a three-minute response to the news of a $30,000 settlement between his former Iowa campaign manager and two staffers.\n\nAD\n\nWhen we talk about ending sexism, and ending all forms of discrimination, those beliefs cannot just be words, Sanders said. They must be based in day-to-day reality and the work that we do. And that was clearly not the case in the 2016 campaign. The allegations that I have heard speak to unacceptable behavior that must not be tolerated in any campaign or in any workplace.\n\nSanders, who said he hadn't known about the settlement, had previously said he was unaware of the other harassment allegations. Today's statement was informed by the response Sanders gave at the end of a recent CNN interview, in which he reiterated that he condemned harassment and added that he was a little bit busy running around the country and never heard of the allegations at the time.\n\nAD\n\nSanders, who resents what he sees as the tabloid approach of much political coverage, was pilloried for the busy quote; the senator, who tends to ignore shouted questions in the halls of the Senate, decided to handle the new story on its own, with a mea culpa, no spin and a small aside about how he had instituted strong anti-harassment policies during his 2018 Senate campaign.\n\nAD\n\nThere is no good time to handle problems like these, but this is a particularly important month for Sanders. On Saturday, hundreds of house parties will be organized by supporters who want him to run for president again. By the end of January, at least three co-sponsors of Sanders's major legislation — Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker — are expected to be running. Sanders's supporters, in general, have praised his commitment to running a more diverse and sensitive campaign, if he runs again.\n\nHe should run, and he should make sure he has a diverse campaign staff that has one of the strongest harassment policies of any campaign, said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who has repeatedly encouraged Sanders to seek the White House. He should run because every 50 years or so, someone has the opportunity to fundamentally reimagine the possibilities of our political conversation.\n\nAD\n\nBut the way this unfolded revealed that Bernieworld, which consists of everything from the senator's staff to outside groups such as Our Revolution, is not being careful enough to protect the senator from controversy. The fuse of the harassment story was lit when Arturo Carmona, a former Sanders staffer and congressional candidate, posted photos of his trip to the Sanders Institute Gathering in Vermont last month. Masha Mendieta, who in 2017 had torpedoed Carmona's own campaign by alleging that he'd sexually harassed female staffers, posted an essay on Medium asking how Carmona could have possibly remained in the senator's orbit.\n\nAD\n\nMany of you asked me what Bernie had to say, assuming him or someone from his team obviously would have reached out to me after the story broke, Mendieta wrote. No, he did not and they did not. It was crickets.\n\nWHAT I'M WATCHING\n\nWho wants to be a billionaire? Tom Steyer is not running for president, focusing his time and money — at least $40 million of it — on the ongoing effort to impeach the president.\n\nSteyer, who got wealthy (and remains wealthy) running a hedge fund, was not the only billionaire looking at a 2020 run. But the Democratic Party, which has elected some independently wealthy candidates to governor's mansions (Illinois's J.B. Pritzker) and Congress (California's Gil Cisneros) very recently, is increasingly cold to the idea of a wealthy candidate barreling into 2020 and spending his own money to elbow aside any challengers.\n\nAfter her first stop in Iowa last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said every Democratic candidate ought to link arms and say, 'We're going to do this with grass-roots funding.'  To Warren, that also meant that independently wealthy candidates should not write their own campaign checks.\n\nWe ought to be building a movement, and the way we do that is with lots of involvement from lots of people, Warren said. Not having billionaires buy these campaigns, whether we're talking about super PACs, or self-funding.\n\nRep. John Delaney (Md.), the first Democrat to enter the presidential race, has an estimated net worth over $200 million, and spent millions to win a seat in Congress in 2012. But he has run his campaign so far with mixture of personal funds and donations.\n\nI have a budget for the campaign we're going to run between Iowa and New Hampshire, and my personal funds will make up for any shortfalls, Delaney said in an interview as he headed to weekend events in Michigan and Iowa. It may end up being about 50-50. Raising money creates a connection to the campaign; what gets you out of bed is the fact that people have invested in you.\n\nOther candidates have been bolder about dipping into their own finances. Former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg has hinted that he could spend up to $100 million on a campaign, similar to the spending in his mayoral elections. Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, is worth an estimated $2.7 billion and has not ruled out spending his own money; Richard Vague, an obscure businessman who recently visited with South Carolina Democrats, has not commented on the topic.\n\nMany Democrats bristle at the idea of wealthy candidates buying their way into politics, at any level. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who defeated wealthy Total Wine founder David Trone to win his seat in Congress, said he found voters receptive to the idea that candidates should earn their way into politics.\n\nWhat I used to say when I was running, my very first line at all the debates, was: Public office is something you earn, not something you buy, Raskin said.\n\nTrone went on to win the 2018 election to replace Delaney in another Maryland district; he and all House Democrats will vote soon on the For the People Act, a package of campaign finance and ethics changes that would, among other things, create a robust public campaign finance system. Republicans have said they'd block the legislation in the Senate.\n\nI think this bill will change the dialogue in 2020, said Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.). We'll see candidates, much more quickly after declaring, release their tax returns. I think they'll take a lot more questions about this on the campaign trail, and I think a lot more voters will be asking, 'What's your position on this?' \n\nTURNOUT WATCH\n\nIn the last edition of The Trailer, you learned that the special election to replace Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.), a former state senator from Virginia, could say something about how votes were moving in the suburbs. On Tuesday night, Democrat Jennifer Boysko won Wexton's old 33rd Senate District by the biggest landslide since it was created — a 39.7-point landslide over moderate Republican Joe May.\n\nIt'd be easy to overdetermine a meaning from this. Just 21,142 ballots were cast, not counting write-in votes, which meant turnout dipped slightly from the 2014 election that first put Wexton in the Senate. But until Tuesday, the record Democratic margin in the district was Wexton's 13.4-point win in 2015, a mediocre year for her party in the state. The collapse of Virginia's Republican Party has sped up since then.\n\nThe good news for Republicans is that few parts of the country are as inhospitable to a Trump-era GOP during a shutdown as Northern Virginia. The bad news for them: It's hard to take the party seriously when it says Sen. Mark Warner will face a serious challenge in 2020.\n\nAD WATCH\n\nDefending Democracy, a group of Republicans working to recruit a challenger to the president, is going on the air in New Hampshire to urge the GOP against altering rules that would stop that effort.\n\n2020\n\nJay Inslee. The governor of Washington will make his first visit to New Hampshire since suggesting that he might seek the presidency, making climate change speeches at Saint Anselm College and Dartmouth on Jan. 22.\n\nElizabeth Warren. She will be the keynote speaker at the Feb. 22 McIntyre-Shaheen dinner in New Hampshire.\n\nBeto O'Rourke. He is still talking about a road trip where he will personally get Americans' views on their country's politics; he also published an Instagram story of himself at the dentist.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand. Per the AP, she is considering basing a presidential campaign in Upstate New York, where her political career began.\n\nTulsi Gabbard. The House member got on the wrong side of Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Mazie Hirono from her state of Hawaii for agreeing with a conservative attack on them — that they engaged in religious bigotry by questioning a judicial nominee about membership in the Catholic organization Knights of Columbus.\n\nRichard Ojeda. He said he's resigning from the West Virginia state Senate to focus on a presidential run. Ojeda's resignation will allow Democrat-turned-Republican Gov. Jim Justice to appoint a replacement, though the seat will be on the ballot again in 2020.\n\nREADING LIST\n\nWhile the Trump reelection campaign is on air and online with ads, multiple Democratic candidates are buying digital spots, blasting out fundraising letters and Periscoping some takes about the shutdown that are building their lists and brands.\n\nJoe Biden is the Hillary Clinton of 2020, by Matthew Yglesias\n\nThe takes on why the former vice president would be a disastrous candidate are coming fast and furious, especially from writers who saw Clinton as a strong candidate in the early stages of last cycle.\n\nMission not quite accomplished, by Brendan James\n\n\n\nThe Oscar buzz for Vice is waxing and waning, but this explains why there's an audience for it — frustration with the rehabilitation of the Bush administration's reputation.\n\nCOUNTDOWN
This is a non-judicial foreclosure, says Anu Kmt, the attorney for the 72-year-old restaurant and its owner. Since the foreclosure did not go through the courts, Hutchins had to file a complaint to seek to halt the proceedings and prove the lender had no right to declare a default on the mortgage.\n\nMost small businesses don't have the legal muscle to fight back. This isn't free. You have to go to court to oppose it. It's very costly, Kmt says. This is like a legal hit and run. They ran us off the road, and we have to chase the ambulance back down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court spells out the allegations against ATS One Holdings Corp., its affiliated companies and Ari Jay Cohen and Peter Aytug, the principals behind the companies. Hutchins alleges that, starting in summer 2015, ATS began returning the restaurant's monthly mortgage checks as undeliverable, even after Hutchins and his attorney inquired about the lender's apparent (and unannounced) change of address. The lender allegedly didn't provide Florida Avenue Grill with a new mailing address.\n\nInstead, in January of last year, ATS used the alleged nonpayment of the mortgages as a pretext for declaring a default and very aggressively threatening . . .foreclosure, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHutchins alleges that he offered to give ATS a check for $23,555.30, the total amount of the apparently missing monthly payments, but ATS refused the money and threatened legal measures in an attempt to get Plaintiffs to agree to pay off the mortgages early. At that point, according to the complaint, Hutchins started sending a certified check each month to a new ATS address.\n\nAll those uncashed checks were enclosed in a Dec. 12 letter sent to Hutchins' attorney, according to the complaint. The letter informed Hutchins that his partial payments had been rejected, the lawsuit alleges, and that ATS was initiating a foreclosure proceeding against the restaurant at 1100 Florida Ave. NW. The trustee's auction of the property is scheduled for Jan. 18 unless a D.C. Superior Court judge agrees to the temporary restraining order on Thursday.\n\nIn an interview, Hutchins says that ATS claims he still owes $139,000, plus about $39,000 in fees, on two 2011 notes totaling $250,000. The Florida Avenue Grill property was valued in 2016 at $727,280, according to the D.C. Office of Tax and Revenue. This year, the property's value is expected to rise to $789,830.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's a money grab, Kmt says about ATS's motivations.\n\nAlan S. Macdonald, attorney representing ATS and its owners for the case, declined to comment on the lawsuit, which he had just received.\n\nThis whole incident has impacted the grill in the sense that it has been embroiled in a firestorm of controversy, says Hutchins. The fact is, if I hadn't filed the lawsuit, most people would just kind of think the grill doesn't pay its mortgage and look askance at me. . . I paid them every month, and that's not good enough.\n\nAccording to Hutchins's lawsuit, ATS (and its predecessor, Northern Funding) are real-estate lending subsidiaries of Northern Leasing Systems Inc., a company that the New York attorney general sued last year, alleging it engages fraudulent and deceptive practices that trap small business owners across the country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe New York lawsuit involves allegations of leasing of credit card equipment with terms that are onerous and totally one-sided in favor of Northern Leasing, according to a press release from New York attorney general Eric T. Schneiderman. When a small business tries to cancel the contract or stop paying, Northern Leasing will send threatening letters and commence collection actions in New York Civil Court, the release alleges. The attorney general's office claims Northern Leasing and its related companies filed more than 30,000 collection actions between 2010 and 2015 and obtained more than 19,000 default judgments, often because the businesses weren't aware of the action.\n\nThe attorney general's lawsuit is still pending. Defense attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case because, among other arguments, they say the statute of limitations has passed on the allegedly fraudulent actions. More than that, the lawsuit has no merit, says Arnold N. Bressler, a senior partner with the New York-based Moses & Singer, the outside counsel that represents Northern Leasing. We feel, as a matter of law, that the case should be dismissed, Bressler says.\n\nHutchins alleges in the lawsuit that in 2011 he agreed to a $200,000 deficiency note and a $50,000 promissory note, even though Hutchins in an interview says ATS never loaned him a single dollar of those funds. The restaurant owner alleges he was forced to agree to the notes or ATS would foreclose on Florida Avenue Grill and several units of the Lacey, the neighboring condominium project that Hutchins developed with loans from ATS.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey did the same foreclosure move again and basically made me agree to this mortgage, Hutchins says. No money was advanced for this mortgage. . . I didn't have the legal muscle at the time to fight them properly, so I had to assent to the mortgage or else they were going to foreclose on the grill. This is the kind of typical bullying tactics that they've used on me in the past.
Montgomery County residents socked with a hefty property tax hike last year would get a reprieve from further increases this year under the operating budget proposed Tuesday by County Executive Isiah Leggett (D).\n\nThe $5.4 billion spending plan for fiscal 2018, which begins July 1, holds the line on taxes while increasing spending on schools, affordable housing, libraries and code inspections in apartment buildings.\n\nLast year, Leggett's budget included an 8.7 percent boost in the average residential tax bill — the largest since 2008 — citing the needs of the fast-growing school system and revenue losses triggered when the Supreme Court ruled that Maryland's income-tax system was unconstitutional. He later trimmed the proposed increase to about 6 percent, but the County Council, which has the final say on budget matters, added new spending and ultimately approved a boost of nearly 9 percent.\n\nThe boost in taxes added to a brewing anti-incumbent sentiment among county voters, who approved a term-limits ballot measure in November.\n\nLeggett, whose third and final term ends in 2018, said last year's big increase should rule out any hikes over the next two years.\n\nMy view is that such a significant tax increase in one year means we should not ask the taxpayers to again pay at a greater rate to fund the FY 18 and FY 19 budgets, he said Tuesday in his budget transmittal letter to Council President Roger Berliner (D-Potomac-Bethesda).\n\nThe proposed budget holds property taxes essentially flat. The median bill for a $400,000 home would increase by about $20, from $4,106 to $4,126, due entirely to increased property values. With home assessments growing, Leggett's budget reduces the property tax rate by 2.5 cents per $100 of assessed value, from $1.025 to $1.00.\n\nThe proposed 2018 budget includes a moderate amount of new spending compared with last year's plan. Leggett urged restraint in light of economic challenges and uncertainties at the federal and state levels.\n\nPresident Trump's budget, which will be released Thursday, is expected to include historic shrinkage in the federal workforce that could hit hard in Montgomery, where more than 45,000 federal workers reside.\n\nThe county will also feel the continuing effects of the Supreme Court's decision in the Wynne case. The court ruled that a state law denying residents a full credit for taxes paid on income earned outside Maryland constituted illegal double taxation and ordered refunds issued to residents who had filed claims.\n\nThe ruling means that the county will receive about $30 million less in state income tax revenue each year. It must also pay $27 million a year in refunds between 2019 and 2023.\n\nThe uncertainties we are facing at the federal and state levels are a necessary backdrop to your consideration of the FY 18 Operating Budget, Leggett said in his letter to Berliner.\n\nMontgomery Public Schools continue to claim about half of county spending. The 159,000-student system would receive $2.3 billion under Leggett's proposal, about $25 million over state-mandated funding levels. That is significantly less than last year's increase, which was nearly $90 million more than the state minimum. Montgomery College would receive $2 million over state requirements, bringing its annual operating budget to $309 million.\n\nLeggett's plan increases spending on affordable housing by $53 million and expands county library hours. It also provides an additional $1.6 million to fund improvements in landlord-tenant relations, required by new legislation. The money would also underwrite a more robust code-inspection program.\n\nThe budget includes an additional $4 million for the new publicly funded campaign-finance system that will debut in 2018. Leggett said in an interview Monday that he views the legislation creating the system as poorly drafted and included the money grudgingly.He said his main concern is that there is uncertainty over how much the system, which had already been slated for $6 million in funding, will actually cost.\n\nThe council will review Leggett's proposal and pass a final budget in May.
The Iowa caucuses remain 13 months away, but a pent-up demand for change in the White House is tangible among Democrats eager for the 2020 campaign to start in earnest. The throngs of voters bombarding events in Iowa are testament to something fearful for Republicans: The huge tide of Democratic voters who powered the party's 2018 gains have not lost interest as attention turns to the 2020 presidential race.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI've never been to a rally, but I wanted to for a long time, said Dan Elliott, as he waited in the ornate Orpheum Theatre lobby in Sioux City for Warren to speak Saturday morning. I'm surprised by the energy here. The lines are longer than people expected.\n\nIowans cited a slew of reasons for their eagerness to begin the lengthy nomination process to settle on a leader to go up against President Trump. There were the tax cuts that one voter called a waste of time and money; the trade war with China depressing demand for exports and hurting farmers; the hostility toward immigrants, a labor pool heavily used on Iowa farms; the rolling back of environmental regulations that impact Iowa's rivers; a foreign policy approach changing the country's status in the world; and the general chaos and lack of civility in the White House.\n\nIt is never too soon to try to get rid of Donald Trump, said Shannon Kennedy, a 48-year-old Iowan who stood in line to take a selfie in front of a barn-door-size American flag at the Orpheum Theatre. There is an urgency to get things back on track. Our country is a laughingstock right now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's not just Warren drawing interest in what amounts to the widest-open caucus competition since 2004.\n\nBooker was greeted by enthusiastic crowds when he made his first trip to Iowa in early October for the Democratic Party gala. His visit included standing-room-only turnout at an event advertised as a discussion on agricultural issues and hosted in the Boone County Democratic offices.\n\nAs Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) gave a speech in Ankeny during her pre-election Iowa tour, she was greeted by a shout: Run for president! When she spoke in Iowa City and Des Moines, she filled rooms holding about 500 people.\n\nThey're paying attention because they don't think this guy can be reelected, said Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), who has already visited all 99 counties in his presidential bid. And the takeaway I hear from a lot of Democrats is that 2016 wasn't a good primary. It was about people going into their camps early. This year, it's the opposite; Democrats are focused on how we beat this guy in 2020, and they come into the primary process with an open mind.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHelping to channel some of this Democratic enthusiasm are organizations like Siouxland Progressive Women, one of thousands of groups that have cropped up on the left since the 2016 election.\n\nWe're so ready, said Susan Leonard, 64, a co-founder of the group. Her 200-member organization campaigned for J.D. Scholten, the Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). Now they're turning to 2020.\n\nWe've got invitations out to several presidential candidates already, Leonard said. It's a big group, and we want to hear their ideas.\n\nThere are plenty of candidates and potential candidates coming to Iowa to meet with Democratic activists. A day after Warren departs Sunday, Julián Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary and San Antonio mayor, is planning stops in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City. Delaney, who was the first Democrat in the race, will open campaign offices here when he returns to Iowa for events Friday and Saturday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTom Steyer, the billionaire who has been campaigning to impeach Trump as he ponders his own presidential bid, is returning soon for an event about education reform. He said in an interview that Trump's actions in the past few weeks had added to what was already highly charged enthusiasm. He specified the government shutdown and the departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\nWe added 5,000 people to our list this morning; we added 10,000 people to our list yesterday, Steyer said. Just look at the turnout on November 6: It broke records, and we think the people on our list turned out something between 75 and 80 percent. And subsequent to that, they literally can't get [an agreement] to keep the government open, and the most respected member of his Cabinet resigned!\n\nProgress Iowa drew about 150 people to its 2014 meeting that featured Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Last month's attendance doubled even though the roster included lesser-known potential candidates such as Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.), Sen. Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe've seen massive jumps, said Matt Sinovic, the group's executive director. Online donations are also up, he said.\n\nThis jolt of Iowa energy for Democrats began in early 2017, as Trump took office and Republicans assumed control of both houses of the legislature and retained the governor's mansion here, he said.\n\nNow that we have the chance to take on President Trump directly, now that he's on the ballot, you're going to see that continue to grow, Sinovic said.\n\nRepublicans have noticed the enthusiasm.\n\nThe Democrats are in a constant hissy about President Trump. It is sustained year around, said David Kochel, a GOP strategist who oversaw Iowa campaigns for Mitt Romney in 2012 and Jeb Bush in 2016. He predicted that Democrats will see a big caucus turn out in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nThey've been hungry for this presidential campaign to start in a real way, Kochel said. That's what you'll see with attendance and turnout early this year. They are champing at the bit to get started.\n\nAD\n\nFor Warren, a Friday night event in Council Bluffs meant for 300 people drew an extra 200. I'm sorry that there's not enough room to get inside, but I'm glad you're all here, she said. She would repeat that apology Saturday when several dozen couldn't squeeze into a panel discussion at a Storm Lake community center.\n\nThe crowds coming out are eager to engage. In Sioux City, when Warren told the audience there that she couldn't do anything about Trump's insults, Glenda Verhoeven, a 63-year-old farmer, shouted, Yes, you can!\n\nAD\n\nVerhoeven, who did not caucus for any Democrat in 2016, said that she considered the senator a strong challenger to Trump because the president seemed obsessed with her.\n\nAny time he starts calling people names, they're the people who bother him, Verhoeven said. She already knows the enemy, and he knows her.\n\nVerhoeven, whose farm and investments have been hurt by the administration's trade war, said Trump's actions make her more interested in the election.
Regarding the March 11 Real Estate article Surprise! Your credit score may soon jump up by 10 points.:\n\nBy ceasing the collection and reporting of substantial amounts of civil judgment and tax lien information, the three major national credit bureaus will be providing a significantly less valuable product at lower cost (and risk) to themselves while keeping the price of their product unchanged. And this was achieved under the cover of a legal settlement with 31 state attorneys general.\n\nLocal jurisdictions will be rewarded for shoddy record-keeping by enabling more of their highly problematic borrowers and renters to enter the general lending and rental pools — borrowers and renters who are 5½ times more likely to default than those without tax lien or civil judgment problems. In response, lenders will have to increase mortgage interest rates they charge to all borrowers and landlords will have to increase rental rates they charge to renters to offset the increased risk they have been required to bear.\n\nThe losers in all this are the ordinary, non-problem borrowers and renters. Can this be what the voters sought when they elected their attorneys general?\n\nVictor Cholewicki, Washington
The standoff — which has heavily affected national parks and other operations and threatens to halt payments as varied as food stamps and tax refunds — has made Trump's unrealized border wall the linchpin of his presidency as he seeks to make good on a signature campaign promise.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere's what you missed at President Trump's Jan. 4 news conference on the 14th day of the partial government shutdown. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\n\nAdministration officials have acknowledged that they were not prepared for the potential consequences of an extended shutdown and Trump's decision to demand wall funding. Democrats, meanwhile, are standing firm on offering no taxpayer money for the project, which Trump had long asserted would be funded by Mexico.\n\nPence was deputized by Trump to oversee Saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), according to two Trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. That meant few specifics were actually discussed Saturday, as Democratic staffers repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.\n\nBut the administration — represented by Pence, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner — refused, according to multiple officials.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot much headway made today, Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!\n\nBefore the meeting began Saturday morning, Trump took a combative tone in several Twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in Republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.\n\nGreat support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border, Trump tweeted. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!\n\nAD\n\nA number of Republicans, including Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is up for reelection in 2020, have said in recent days that the government should be reopened and that a shutdown is not the right answer, worrying GOP leaders about the depth of support for Trump's position.\n\nAD\n\nTrump spent much of Saturday on the phone with allies, talking through his positioning on the shutdown and hearing their reviews of his Friday news conference in the Rose Garden, according to a person close to him. Two people regularly on his call list — Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) — have encouraged Trump to hold fast and refuse to agree to reopen the government unless wall funding is secured, the person said.\n\nI've never seen the president as resolved on any issue as he is on this, Meadows said Saturday. But he is open to new ideas about how to end the impasse.\n\nAD\n\nTrump told reporters Friday that he wants to reopen government but is prepared to maintain the shutdown for weeks or even years. He also told congressional leaders at the White House on Friday that he preferred the term strike over shutdown, people briefed on the meeting said.\n\nIn conversations with top aides on Friday and Saturday, House Democratic leaders said Trump and GOP leaders seem eager to be seen as making progress even if the talks remained stalled, allowing Republican lawmakers back home over the weekend to reassure nervous constituents, according to two Democratic officials briefed on those discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAD\n\nThere is the reality of what the White House is doing, which is very little, and the image they're trying to send, which is, 'Look at us, we're busy, and the vice president is rolling up his sleeves,'  one Democratic official said. They're worried about defections.\n\nAD\n\nDuring Saturday's meeting, Democratic staffers asked the White House to lay out in formal detail the administration's funding request for the border — including its specific security requests, what the money would be used for, and what in the Homeland Security budget the administration would cut to make the numbers work, people familiar with the meeting said.\n\nDemocrats emphasized that it's important for us to have an updated budget request from the White House because they have been all over the map, said another official briefed on the discussion. The White House plans to provide those figures before the group meets again Sunday afternoon.\n\nAD\n\nSome centrist Republicans on Saturday urged Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government, reflecting growing unease in their ranks about the prolonged shutdown and the political cost the GOP might pay.\n\nAD\n\nWith Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it's going to have to be a compromise solution, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a moderate and former FBI agent who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, said in an interview. It's our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government, and we need to have these battles on immigration and other issues on their own turf, separately.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement Saturday that the House will begin passing separate bills to reopen the government in the coming week, starting with the funding bill that covers the Treasury Department so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.\n\nAD\n\nThe senseless uncertainty and chaos of the Trump Shutdown must end, now, Pelosi said.\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney said in an interview to air Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press that Trump would take a concrete wall off the table in negotiations with Democratic leaders if that would help end the shutdown.\n\nIf he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction, Mulvaney said.\n\nBut Trump is annoyed by news reports about the negotiations that make it seem that he is backing away from his demands and wants to avoid stories about new numbers for wall funding being discussed, Trump aides said. The president instead encouraged Pence and senior aides to focus on the $5.6 billion for border security that was the focal point of legislation passed last month by House Republicans, the aides said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump exasperated members of both parties with his comments Friday, but Trump spent that evening boasting to friends that he was in a strong negotiating position because he was able to capture attention and make a flurry of points that he feels his core voters appreciate, White House officials said.\n\nOn Saturday evening, Trump tweeted that he would travel to Camp David on Sunday for meetings on Border Security and many other topics with aides attending a White House staff retreat. He then followed up with a tweet of his Game of Thrones-style poster saying, The Wall is Coming.\n\nMulvaney is spearheading the Camp David gathering as a way of connecting with his new deputies and colleagues, according to officials.\n\nThe president is asking advisers about further ways to battle for wall funding in the coming days, whether it is meeting with family members of people killed by undocumented immigrants, huddling with sheriffs or visiting the border, the officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAs Saturday's meeting unfolded, Trump was eyeing his own options for trying to force the Democrats' hand, including declaring a national emergency to begin wall construction without congressional approval, a possible course he mentioned at his Friday news conference.\n\nAccording to two confidants of Trump's, who have spoken to him in recent days but were not authorized to speak publicly, Trump is looking at how such a move would play out and has told his aides that such a drastic turn could rattle the Democrats and compel them to offer him wall funding. The legality of such a move is unclear, however, and Trump would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges in the courts.\n\nStill, there are signs within the White House that more-comprehensive deals are at least being discussed, more likely for after the shutdown concludes and the government reopens.\n\nKushner, the president's son-in-law, continues to tell his allies that he thinks there could eventually be a deal for border wall funding in exchange for immigration protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, according to two people who were briefed on those discussions. Another person familiar with the discussions emphasized, however, that Kushner was not pushing for a deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, at this time.\n\nChatter about an agreement involving protections for young immigrant beneficiaries of the DACA program have risen a bit in recent days, although the administration has rejected previous wall-for-DACA deals and Democratic leadership is in no mood for one now.
All of which is to say that the Federal Reserve is in a fairly awkward spot right now. How is that? Well, all of the backward-looking economic data says that we're nowhere near a recession — not when we've added an average of 254,000 jobs a month in the past three months, compared with the 100,000 or so we'd need to keep the unemployment rate from going up — while most of the forward-looking financial indicators say that one might not be that far away. In other words, for every bit of good news about today, such as the continued growth in manufacturing employment, there's a bit of bad news about the outlook for tomorrow, such as the big drop in manufacturing production. Which is why the Fed is justified in thinking that it'll need to raise rates a few times this year to keep inflation in check at the same time that markets are, maybe not equally justified, but still on firm ground in thinking that it's more likely that the Fed will end up cutting them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo what should the Fed do then? Well, in this case, the easy answer is the correct one. It should wait. That's because we don't know how much of today's growth will go away tomorrow once the stimulative effect of Trump's tax cuts fades away. Or how much of the slowdown in the rest of the world will put a speed limit on our own economy. Or whether higher wages will continue to suck more people into the workforce, as they did last month, or are instead a sign that companies are starting to run out of workers.\n\nThe good news, then, is that — as Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome H. Powell took pains to emphasize on Friday —this is exactly what they intend to do. If things do indeed get bumpy over the next few months, the Fed is perfectly willing to put its rate-hiking plans on hold, and even stop its bond holdings from shrinking any further. Which are real possibilities. See, while it's easy to make fun of the stock market for, as the old saying goes, predicting nine out of the last five recessions, it's important to understand that part of the reason it has so many false positives is that it often prompts policymakers to act before things get worse. So both we and the Fed should take it seriously, especially when the much less erratic bond market is telling the same story. Indeed, the fact that long-term interest rates are very close to being lower than short-term interest rates is its way of saying that it thinks the Fed is going to have start cutting rates soon — which it would do only to fight a recession.\n\nAnd that brings us to the most important point of all: What makes a warning a warning is that it happens before things get bad. So yes, the economy is in very good shape right now, but so was it in 2006, the last time long-term rate fell below short-term ones. That didn't keep the economic storm clouds away 12 to 18 months later — that's usually how long it takes for a recession to hit after the yield curve inverts like that — and it won't this time either if we aren't careful.\n\nIt doesn't have to be that way, though. There's nothing inevitable about recessions. Australia hasn't had one since 1991, and we don't have to have one in 2020, as markets seem to think we will, if we make the right choices.
House Democrats have named lowering drug one of their priorities, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) promising last week to lower health costs and prescription drug prices. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the newly minted GOP chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has vowed to crack down on the shenanigans played by major drugmakers to limit lower-priced alternative medicines.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are signals the industry's influence is waning, after it recently failed in its bid to reverse steeper payments for drugs in Medicare's so-called doughnut hole, the coverage gap for seniors. And overlaying all of this are surprisingly aggressive efforts by the Trump administration to lower prescription drug costs in the Medicare program, some of which were outlined in its drug pricing blueprint.\n\nI'm very optimistic that the long overdue effort to rein in the price gouging from PhRMA is underway, Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) who is seen as a leader on the issue, told me on Friday.\n\nMembers are eyeing at least two bills with bipartisan support: The Creates Act, which would prevent branded drugmakers from guarding their medications so other companies can't develop alternatives; and legislation to prohibit pay-for-delay deals in which drugmakers pay producers of generic medicines to delay introduction of cheaper versions of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese measures attempt to introduce more competition among drugmakers by leveling the playing field — an approach some in theTrump administration (including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb) favor even as they remain suspicious of approaches that smack of government price-fixing. As for Democrats, they'd like the government to play a much more robust role in the prescription drug pricing business, but many feel they shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\nI think it would be a shame … to waste an opportunity if President Trump is willing to work on this issue — or have his people work on this issue — to actually get something done, said former congressman Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California who served as chairman and then ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nEnding pay-for-delay tactics is a priority for Grassley, who has teamed up with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) on their Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act. The legislation, which would prohibit the deals for generics, would inject a healthy dose of Midwestern, common-sense medicine into Big Pharma, Grassley said in a November floor speech.\n\nGrassley has also signed on to the Creates Act, whose House and Senate versions are supported by a broad range of lawmakers — so broad, in fact, that they included both Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who nearly beat Cruz in the November midterms. The measure would allow generic companies to sue branded companies for failing to provide them with samples needed to create generic versions of their products (we explained the Creates Act more in this Health 202).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf course, the partial government shutdown now in its third week is consuming all the oxygen in the room right now. But advocates say they're still betting lawmakers will come together on an issue that troubles 80 percent of Americans.\n\nI am way more optimistic than we've ever been before, said Ellen Albritton, a senior policy analyst at Families USA. I think a lot of things are aligning in a way that they haven't aligned before.\n\nThe industry isn't appearing to back down, either. More than three dozen drugmakers began the new year by hiking their product prices an average of 6.3 percent, the Wall Street Journal's Jared S. Hopkins has reported, although he noted many of the hikes were relatively modest amid pressure on the issue.\n\nAD\n\nTrump tweeted this over the weekend, following the report:\n\nThe Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing launched a new website yesterday to help convince lawmakers to take on high drug prices. Members of Congress ran and won on the promise to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable and lower drug prices. Our goal with this new website is to provide lawmakers with the information they need to turn their campaign promises into substantive action, said Lauren Blair, CSRxP communications director.\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration has several drug pricing efforts in the works, mostly centered on tweaking the way the government pays for drugs in the Medicare program. But it's been bold enough to have won some respect — if begrudging — from some of the most liberal Democrats in Congress, including Welch.\n\nAD\n\nThere are promising signs out of the Trump administration, Welch said. I think there is a significant potential Trump is going to step up on prescription drug pricing.\n\nYet politics remain in play. House Democrats certainly aren't ignoring the 2020 election, which could of course hand them the White House and open the door wider for pushing priorities Republicans don't favor.\n\nConsequently, there's talk in the caucus of passing legislation allowing the federal government to directly negotiate lower prices with drugmakers in the Medicare Part D program — a pie-in-the-sky dream for liberals that is strongly opposed by conservatives. It would be mostly a messaging tactic for Democrats, as it would almost certainly die in the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, Democrats point to the huge support among their own members for the idea. Several Democrats have offered bills requiring Medicare price negotiations, but the most popular — offered by Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) — has 104 co-sponsors. Welch said he holds out hope Trump would sign such a measure (assuming Democrats could somehow get it through the Senate), given the support he expressed on the campaign trail.\n\nA spokesman for House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) also pointed to Medicare price negotiations, as well as the more likely efforts to lift barriers to generic drugs. He is hopeful that Democrats can work with the president in a bipartisan way, spokesman C.J. Young said.\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nAHH: This year, there will be more female CEOs than men named Michael giving corporate presentations at the year's biggest biotech conference, Stat News reports. Last year, the website had noted there were more Michaels presenting than women at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.\n\nThe tables have turned: At next week's confab, there will be 33 female CEOs presenting corporate updates, compared to 19 men named Michael, Rebecca Robbins writes. And yet women will still be massively outnumbered on one of biotech's biggest stages: Men represent 90 percent of the 553 executives who will give corporate presentations at JPM. That's down from 94 percent last year.\n\nOOF: Insurers have pocketed more than $9 billion in taxpayer funds by overestimating their annual costs for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, the Wall Street Journal's Joseph Walker and Christopher Weaver report. Mysterious Medicare payment rules, and the resulting payment discrepancies, are examples of how the secrecy of the $3.5 trillion U.S. health-care system promotes and obscures higher spending, the pair write in this investigation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere's how the system works: Insurers like CVS Health Corp., UnitedHealth Group and Humana submit estimates of how much providing Medicare's prescription drug benefit will cost them, and Medicare in turn uses that estimate to make payments to the insurers.\n\nAfter the year ends, Medicare compares the plans' bids to the actual spending. If the insurer overestimated its costs, it pockets a chunk of the extra money it received from Medicare—sometimes all of it—and this can often translate into more profit for the insurer, in addition to the profit built into the approved bid, Joseph and Christopher write. If the extra money is greater than 5% of the insurer's original bid, it has to pay some of it back to Medicare....A detailed analysis of the confidential industry data obtained by the Journal shows that 69% of Part D members from 2009 to 2013 were in plans that overestimated costs by at least 5% over that time.\n\nOUCH: The Food and Drug Administration says e-cigarette start-up Juul and Altria, the country's largest cigarette maker, are going back on their pledges to combat youth vaping, an issue that's become a critical focus for commissioner Gottlieb.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGottlieb plans to write letters to the companies to criticize them for publicly pledging to remove nicotine flavor pods from store shelves, while secretly negotiating a financial partnership that seems to do the opposite, the New York Times's Sheila Kaplan reports. The commissioner also wants the companies leaders to come to the agency to explain their plans.\n\nDespite making promises to help address youth vaping, Sheila writes the FDA is worried the December agreement Altria made to purchase 35 percent of Juul will expand the reach of the very pod-based products it said it would stop selling until the youth vaping problem was addressed.\n\nTRUMP TEMPERATURE\n\nThe partial government shutdown is dragging into its third week, and while no progress seems to have been made in negotiations, Trump administration officials have begun taking new steps to contain the fallout, our Post colleagues Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin, Damian Paletta and Nick Miroff report. Meanwhile, various federal agencies and health programs have been impacted by the stalemate:\n\nAD\n\n— For 38 million low-income Americans, the shutdown could mean severe food stamp reductions if it stretches on. The SNAP program is rare among federal initiatives because it requires annual funding from Congress, even though its existence is automatically renewed, our Post colleagues Damian Paletta and Erica Werner report. Congress has not allocated funding for SNAP beyond January, and the program's emergency reserves would not cover even two-thirds of February's payments, according to past disbursements. A disruption of the program impacts not only the families who receive food stamps but the retailers where that money is spent, our colleagues add. An Agriculture Department spokesman said the administration is looking at options amid the halt.\n\n— For the FDA, the shutdown means the agency hasn't been able to accept some new applications for drugs or medical devices. Those applications that require user fee payments could not be accepted because it can't accept new FY2019 user fees without an appropriations bill for FY2019, Commissioner Gottlieb explained in series of tweets last week. But the agency can accept new regulatory submissions that don't require a fee. Stat's Ike Swetlitz and Erin Mershon also reported last month the shutdown would not stop the agency from recalling harmful food and drugs but would slow the process for drug approvals as well as some administrative actions.\n\n— In Indian Country, the shutdown has meant critical funding hasn't arrived to keep health clinics running. Generations ago, tribes negotiated treaties with the United States government guaranteeing funds for services like health care and education in exchange for huge swaths of territory, the New York Times's Mitch Smith and Julie Turkewitz write. But that means a government shutdown can largely sideline a tribe's basic functions.\n\n— Not all agencies have halted work. While many federal scientists across the country have been affected by stalled funding and the inability to continue research, the New York Times's Alan Blinder points out the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health were entirely or mostly funded through other legislation.\n\nHEALTH ON THE HILL\n\n—One day after retaking the majority in the House, Democratic lawmakers took an initial step toward intervening in a case in which U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional.\n\nAs part of a rules package for the new Congress, the party voted to granted itself the authority to intervene in the lawsuit, and scheduled a vote for this week designed to force GOP lawmakers into a political corner: agree to defend a law many members have spent years reviling or appear to oppose popular ACA protections for millions of Americans with preexisting medical conditions that many have pledged to uphold, our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports.\n\nThe move came hours after California Attorney General Xavier Becerra led a coalition of 17 Democratic state AGs in filing an appeal to challenge the district court's ruling.\n\nIt's a move that could bring the health-care law all the way to the Supreme Court for a third time, Amy writes.\n\nThis shouldn't be a debate; the ACA has been the law for nearly a decade and is the backbone of our health-care system, Becerra said during a call with reporters last week. This case impacts nearly every American — workers covered by employers, families, women, children, young adults, and seniors — so we will lead the ACA's defense as long and far as it takes.\n\nColorado Attorney General-elect Phil Weiser called the decision mind boggling and said it goes against the role of government to protect people. I just can't begin to express the magnitude of what a threat that is to the rule of law.\n\n— For the first time, House Democrats are planning to hold hearings on Medicare for all, a step that comes as Pelosi has backed the process, as our Post colleague Dave Weigel reports.\n\nWorking toward a version of universal health care has been a Democratic goal for decades. But it seemed to pick up some momentum after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pushed for Medicare for all during his presidential campaign in 2016. The next year, House Democrats cosponsored H.R. 676, a Medicare for all bill.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the House sponsor of the legislation, called it a huge step forward to have Pelosi's support. We have to push on the inside while continuing to build support for this on the outside.\n\nWith Democrats locked out of power in the Senate and the White House, Jayapal said supporters of universal health care were proceeding 'one step at a time' and that getting the first real hearings on the bill — for years, it has been aspirational, and not even subject to a Congressional Budget Office score — would force a larger discussion, Dave writes.\n\n— House lawmakers are planning to introduce a bipartisan gun-control measure on Tuesday, an effort led by Pelosi, Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chairman Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), and Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.).\n\nThe proposal will call for universal background checks for firearm purchases and transfers, our colleague Karoun Demirjian reports.\n\nHouse Democrats promised to tackle the issue of gun control with their new majority. The new Democrat-controlled House will almost certainly be able to muster the votes to pass a gun-control measure that expands background checks, Karoun writes. The measure may even pull along some Republican support. … But it remains unclear whether such legislation could clear procedural hurdles in the Senate, which remains under Republican control. The closest that the Senate has come to passing gun-control legislation expanding background checks was in 2013, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, when 56 senators rallied behind a measure — four votes shy of what they needed to clear procedural hurdles.\n\nAGENCY ALERT\n\n— Politico's Dan Diamond spoke with Chris Meekins, who left HHS last week after helping oversee migrant family reunifications. Meekins called the family separation policy headed by the Department of Homeland Security an ill-fated policy that was devised by Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller. I think that it's unconscionable to do it in this way, Meekins said. Listen to the podcast here.\n\n— In the final snapshot released by CMS, the agency revealed enrollment on the federal health care exchange this season fell nearly 4 percent overall from last year's sign-up period. A total of 8.4 million people signed up or were automatically enrolled in health plans for 2019 on Healthcare.gov, compared with 8.7 million who were signed up during last year's open enrollment.\n\nThe final numbers don't include sign-up rates for states that have their own insurance exchange and many of those states have sign-up periods that extend into mid-January. CMS said it would release additional data, including information from those state-based exchanges, in March.\n\n— Mary Mayhew, the Trump administration's Medicaid director, resigned from her post last week after less than three months on the job. Mayhew, who was tapped in October to be the director of the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, will now run Florida's health-care agency, the Miami Herald's Elizabeth Koh reports. Before her stint in the Trump administration, Mayhew served for seven years as the health and human services commissioner under Maine's former Republican governor Paul LePage.\n\nMayhew, long a critic of expansion under the ACA, was praised by CMS administrator Seema Verma in a Friday statement. I am excited for Mary as she transitions to serve Governor-elect DeSantis and the people of Florida, Verma said. I appreciate her efforts at CMS and I look forward to continuing to work with her as she uses her many talents to help the state of Florida create a healthcare system that serves the needs of its citizens.\n\n— James Carroll was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy after leading the office in an acting capacity since February. The White House had gone without a permanent drug czar since nearly the beginning of the Trump administration.\n\n— ICYMI: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services finalized in late December its overhaul of Medicare's so-called Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) program — and the agency followed through on stricter rules that could expose these health savings cooperatives to losses sooner. The Health 202 detailed the proposed new rules here.\n\n— Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie, who has been the subject of multiple reports about his previous affiliation with Confederate groups, failed to disclose that affiliation to the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee during his confirmation process, CNN's Andrew Kaczynski reports.\n\nOur Post colleagues Lisa Rein and Paul Sonne have reported Wilkie built his career working alongside polarizing figures and was once a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a group that defends Confederate symbols. CNN's Andrew, Nathan McDermott and Chris Massie also reported Wilkie has given a speech to the group. Wilkie was required to disclose in a sworn statement submitted to the Senate committee his public statements, published materials and memberships he held in organizations over the past decade, Andrew writes. Wilkie, however, did not disclose any of his ties to Confederate groups.\n\nSTATE SCAN\n\n— In Maine, new Gov. Janet Mills issued an executive order to move forward with expanding Medicaid in the state, fulfilling a campaign promise to make doing so her first priority, the Associated Press's Marina Villenueve reports.\n\nThe Democrat called for expedited approval of benefits to 70,000 additional low-income residents in the state and called for the state's health agency to work with lawmakers to find a way to fund the expanded program. The plan still needs to be approved by federal regulators.\n\n— In California, the soon-to-be-sworn-in Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom is expected to introduce an ambitious leave policy that would give families six months of paid leave after a child is born, which would be the longest in the country.\n\nNewsom is set to propose the policy and include it in his budget after his swearing in on Monday, the New York Times's Claire Cain Miller and Jim Tankersley report. But what's missing in the Democrat's policy is a plan to fund it. It's the same challenge that has stymied the policy at the federal level, Claire and Jim write. Around 80 percent of Americans consistently say they support paid parental leave, and some Republican lawmakers have joined Democrats in embracing the idea. Yet federal lawmakers have declined to pass tax increases or corporate mandates to make it a reality.\n\nNewsom's plan comes as other state's are looking to move forward with state-based plans instead of waiting for the federal government. Massachusetts, Washington and New Jersey have new or recently expanded policies on the books, and Jim and Claire report Oregon, Colorado and Connecticut are poised to follow. Still, Newsom's proposal for California would be the most generous.\n\n— And here are a few more good reads from The Post and beyond:\n\nMEDICAL MISSIVES\n\nINDUSTRY RX\n\nREPRODUCTIVE WARS\n\nDAYBOOK\n\nToday\n\nThe 37th annual J.P.

(AP)\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with CBS News's 60 Minutes, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said there's no question President Trump is a racist:
House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford), left, confers with Del. S. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk) during the 2017 session of the Virginia House of Delegates. (Bob Brown/AP)\n\nSpeaker William J. Howell, a pragmatic Republican who has presided over Virginia's fractious House of Delegates for 15 sessions and spent the last four as a thorn in Gov. Terry McAuliffe's side, will not seek reelection in November.\n\nHowell, 73, announced his decision Monday in emotional remarks in the ornate House chamber, with his wife of 50 years, Cessie, and other family members looking on.\n\nI have really enjoyed serving in this esteemed body, Howell said. It has truly been the greatest professional honor of my life.\n\nEven before it was officially announced, Howell's plan to retire at the end of his term in January set off a competition between two delegates to replace him at the helm of the overwhelmingly GOP-majority chamber.\n\nHouse Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox (Colonial Heights) and Del. Terry G. Kilgore (Scott) worked quietly over the past week to line up support for their rival bids to replace Howell (Stafford), according to two Republicans familiar with their efforts. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal caucus matters.\n\nKilgore has since withdrawn. I just didn't think it was the right time for me, he said. Cox declined to comment, saying that this is the speaker's day.\n\nThe House GOP caucus is expected to name Cox its speaker-designee in a close-door meeting Wednesday.\n\nHouse members on both sides of the aisle praised Howell on the floor not only for his political leadership but also for a quick wit that could defuse tense situations and for a sense of personal friendship.\n\nI think after I called my parents, you're the first person I called after I adopted my kid, that's how much I think of you, said Del. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax), his voice breaking. You are proof, Mr. Speaker, that nice guys can finish first.\n\nHouse Minority Leader David Toscano (D-Charlottesville) praised Howell for standing up to his own party on an off-year redistricting scheme in 2013. Senate Republicans had tacked an entirely redrawn state Senate map onto a bill calling for minor technical adjustments to House districts. Howell ruled it out of order, a move that infuriated some Republicans.\n\n[From the archives: Spike of Virginia redistricting plans shows House speaker's pragmatic streak]\n\nYou are truly a historic figure in this chamber and in this Capitol, said Toscano, adding that the speaker is akin to a judge. The good judges are the ones who let you try your case. . . . You let us try our cases, and we thank you for that.\n\nHowell's relationship with McAuliffe (D) has been strained, despite their shared history as dealmakers and McAuliffe's efforts to woo the speaker over craft beer in the Executive Mansion.\n\nHowell has used his position — among the most powerful in state government — to help thwart many of the governor's biggest goals, including the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the appointment of a state Supreme Court justice and the blanket restoration of voting rights to more than 200,000 felons.\n\nWith a lawsuit filed last year to block the restoration of felons' voting rights, Howell became the first speaker in the history of the commonwealth to successfully challenge a governor's executive order in court.\n\n[Va. high court invalidates McAuliffe's order restoring felon voting rights]\n\nOn behalf of the people of Virginia, I want to thank Speaker Bill Howell for his outstanding service to Virginia, McAuliffe said in a statement. I have tremendous respect for the Speaker and the professional and dignified way he led the House throughout his tenure. I wish him the very best in his retirement.\n\nHowell is Virginia's second-longest-serving speaker, behind Democrat Edgar Blackburn Moore, who held the post from 1950 to 1968.\n\nDeemed the accidental speaker because he assumed the role in January 2003 after S. Vance Wilkins resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal, Howell instituted a number of reforms, including bringing some strictness and objectivity to rules governing what can be ruled in and out of order.\n\nA member of the House since 1988, Howell was one of four delegates to start a prayer group that still meets at 7 a.m. every Wednesday during the session. He has been a conservative on social issues such as abortion.\n\nBut he also sought to keep a lid on some hot-button bills after they consumed the 2012 legislative session. Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William), one of the chamber's most vocal conservatives, often complained that Howell had some of his bills quietly killed off in committees to avoid controversy. An example of that this year was Marshall's ill-fated measure to require transgender people to use the public bathroom that corresponds with the sex on their birth certificates.\n\n[Va. lawmaker presses fellow Republicans on transgender 'bathroom bill']\n\nHowell has primarily focused on promoting business-friendly policies. And he has been willing to cut deals to get things done — sometimes to the chagrin of more ideologically driven Republicans.\n\nAmong those deals were some involving McAuliffe's predecessors. Howell spoke out against Democrat Mark R. Warner's $1.6 billion tax hike but quietly instructed a few Republicans to skip a committee vote so that the bill would go the House floor. Despite his distaste for Democrat Tim Kaine's smoking ban, he struck a deal there as well. He signed on to the transportation plan of Republican Robert F. McDonnell, even after the legislation was amended into the largest tax hike in Virginia history.\n\nIt's really Bill Howell's greatest legacy, said Del. Mark Sickles (D-Fairfax), referring to the transportation funding measure. We'd still have smoking in restaurants for that matter.\n\nA wills and trusts lawyer who practices in a log cabin on the Rappahannock River, Howell assumed the speakership at a time when his party enjoyed a slim majority in the 100-seat chamber. Their numbers swelled as high as 68 during his tenure, which also saw the adoption of a 2011 redistricting map favorable to Republicans. Two lawsuits — one before the U.S. Supreme Court, the other before a state circuit court — challenged the constitutionality of the maps.\n\nPresiding over that growing majority became tricky with the rise of more conservative, tea-party-affiliated members, who looked askance at Howell's pragmatic streak.\n\nIn 2014, some conservative Republicans said they feared that Howell was secretly on board with McAuliffe's plan to expand Medicaid as they pushed for a budget amendment that they thought was needed to tie the governor's hands. The speaker had called the amendment unnecessary but eventually got on board. McAuliffe later acknowledged that the amendment blocked a loophole that he had intended to use to expand Medicaid unilaterally.
The report lays out objections to the Republican plan, including an argument that cutting trillions in taxes for rich Americans, as Republicans have proposed, would increase inequality in the United States. (A separate analysis last year, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, found that 99.6 percent of the savings under Ryan's plan would accrue to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe authors of the Oxfam report also dispute the claim of GOP proponents that their approach would limit multinational corporations' ability to conceal their profits from federal tax authorities. Yet the report's discussion of the plan's international repercussions points to a major issue that has often been ignored in the political debate over the GOP plan, which has mostly concentrated on how the proposal would affect Americans.\n\nSome experts say the plan would penalize foreign economies that sell products to the United States. Under the GOP plan for a border adjustment, U.S. firms would no longer be allowed to exempt the cost of their imports from taxation. On paper, this provision amounts to a new tax on imports, which would negatively affect workers around the world whose livelihoods depend on U.S. consumption.\n\nOn the other hand, many economists argue the plan would increase the price of the dollar in global exchange markets, in which case goods produced in foreign countries and sold in foreign currencies would become cheaper, making up for the tax.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf so, however, the border adjustment would put the squeeze on poor countries where corporations and governments have borrowed money in dollars rather than unreliable local currency. Those borrowers have to make payments on their loans in dollars, and those payments would be harder to make if dollars become more expensive in terms of their own currencies.\n\nGiven that a lot of developing countries hold debt denominated in the U.S. dollar, that would essentially increase their debt burden, said Robbie Silverman, a senior adviser at Oxfam. To make good on their debts, he added, foreign governments would have to spend more buying up dollars, leaving less money infrastructure, public health, education and other investments that can help poor countries prosper.\n\nForeign households, governments and businesses — excluding banks — owe a total of $10.5 trillion in loans denominated in dollars, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Of that total, emerging-market economies owe about $3.6 trillion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose figures dwarf the totals for other major global currencies. Debt denominated in euros totals just $2.8 trillion outside the euro area, and loans in yen amount to just $440 billion outside of Japan.\n\nA few countries are especially vulnerable. Among large developing countries, Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia all have outstanding debts in dollars equivalent to roughly a quarter of their gross domestic product, according to a report from Fitch, the ratings agency. Mexico and Russia are also at risk, with dollar-denominated debts worth about one sixth of GDP.\n\nThe pinch might be the sharpest in smaller countries where people rely on dollars for day-to-day banking and saving. For instance, Jamaica's government has issued debts in U.S. dollars worth nearly two-thirds of the island's GDP.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Azerbaijan, about 80 percent of deposits are in dollars, according to Fitch. If the dollar becomes more expensive, it could be more difficult for Azerbaijani banks to pay out those deposits.\n\nSome economists are skeptical that the dollar would become substantially more expensive under a border adjustment. Yet as William Cline of the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington noted, if the dollar does not increase, then foreign companies would be stuck paying the new tax on their sales to U.S. customers.
