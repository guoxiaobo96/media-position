{"original_sentence": "First rebate checks sent to taxpayers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government mailed out nearly 8 million tax rebate checks Friday, the first wave of about 92 million checks that will be sent out in the next 10 weeks. The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks.

The combination of this tax relief and lower interest rates should help get it moving again. Not everyone will get a rebate check. Those who did not file a return last year, those who had no taxable income and those who can be claimed as dependents on someone else's tax return will not qualify. The amount of some taxpayers' checks may be smaller, too, if they owe any back taxes, child support payments or federal loan payments. The government will deduct those debts from rebate checks before sending them. So how will you spend your rebate check, if you're getting one? About 47 percent of those questioned for a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll said they would pay bills with the money, 32 percent will save it, 17 percent will spend it and 2 percent will donate their check to charity.

{"original_sentence": "At Wal-Mart stores across the country, people can cash their checks on site or spend the amount in the store against the value of the check. Home Depot stores are offering customers credit, based on the expected amounts of their rebates, until their checks come in. Some analysts say that if people immediately spend their checks, it could stimulate the economy. This is not a one shot deal. This is a down payment on future tax cuts, and I think people would be more apt to spend more of it than they would if they were just handed a one-shot rebate check, said Gerald Cohen of Merrill-Lynch. Others disagree. The problem right now is we're likely to see mounting job losses, and that's likely to erode confidence and induce consumers to save and not to spend, said Anirvan Banerji of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. If you filed your 2000 income tax return late, your check will come after the end of September. And if you moved since you sent in that return, make sure you've filed an official change of address form with the U.S. Post Office.

The Wisconsin primary left the eventual outcome of the long spring campaign more enigmatic than ever, but some of the election results were startling: -- George McGovern, hitherto regarded as a one-issue antiwar champion of the liberal-left, exploited his own superb organization in the state, tapped deep wells of economic discontent and, by winning a 30% plurality, transformed himself at last into a major candidate. In Wisconsin his support was astonishingly broad, bracketing liberals, conservatives, blue- collar workers, farmers, suburbanites and the young. -- George Wallace, with the help of 35% of the G.O.P. voters who crossed over to vote Democratic, similarly appealed to a restive mood of the little man. Although he campaigned for only eight days in Wisconsin, Wallace came in second, with 22% of the vote. Adding the Wallace and McGovern totals, 52% of the voters cast ballots for anti-Establishment candidates. -- Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey, who had counted on his longtime popularity in neighboring Wisconsin to catapult him into the Democratic lead, came in third, with 21%.

The final results were complicated, of course, by the fact that 26% of the votes cast in the Democratic primary came from Republicans and Independents. The cross-overs cost Humphrey a second-place finish, since most of them went to Wallace. Yankelovich found, however, that most of the cross-overs came not as spoilers but as voters anxious to make their views known on the economy and other issues. Wisconsin served to prolong and compound the suspense of the race. It established the major Democratic theme -- a profound economic disgruntlement -- but not a party leader.

Even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist.

{"original_sentence": "At one point, they recall, Nix explained that the National Rifle Association's database of members would be a valuable way to target donors. Wilson typed an emoji with rolling eyes next to the statement because it was so obvious. He told people that he came away thinking, Red flag, red flag, red flag. In response to an extensive set of questions, Nix disputed this account of the meeting. He denied that Cambridge Analytica had obtained any data via Facebook—a source of controversy for the firm ever since The Guardian reported in 2015 that CA based its data on research spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission. Nix also claimed that it was the Cruz team that didn't have access to the RNC's Data Trust for much of the cycle and that all data used for the majority of the campaign was provided by Cambridge Analytica.

It is cumbersome and difficult for providers to quickly enter information about administered doses, said Dr. Kathleen E. Toomey, the commissioner of the state Department of Public Health. Some vaccine providers, particularly hospitals, also held back some of the state's limited supply, to ensure that booster shots would be available, Gov. Brian Kemp and officials from his administration said on Tuesday. They called that misguided. If this issue continues, the state will take possession of those doses and ensure that vaccinations continue, the governor said. If it takes me firing up my pickup truck and doing it myself, so be it. At first, Georgia also found a mismatch of vaccine supply and demand. Vaccines went to rural parts of the state where 60 to 70 percent of nursing home workers did not want them, Mr. Kemp said, leaving those areas flush with doses while demand crushed supply in urban areas.

The commission said that 144 new cases had been recorded on Thursday, the highest daily figure since a series of new outbreaks began at the end of last year. Of 1,001 total patients in China, the commission said, 26 were reported to be in serious condition.

The new outbreaks suggest that the virus is once again spreading widely despite the measures China has taken, including electronic monitoring and new lockdowns.

The vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer, both using genetic material called mRNA, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19 when administered as a two-shot regimen. But they have not been in use long enough to tell how long the immunity lasts, or whether additional booster shots will be needed. We anticipate that an additional dose could further boost the levels of neutralizing antibodies, should such a boost be required, and that this is expected to be an advantage of mRNA vaccines, Colleen Hussey, a Moderna spokeswoman, said in a statement. Neutralizing antibodies are made by the immune system in response to a virus or a vaccine and can block the virus from breaking into cells. The company's statement said the boosters were being offered to participants six to 12 months after their second shot.

Scott McIntyre for The New York Times When a more contagious coronavirus variant first surfaced in early December, some researchers initially suggested that unlike with previous versions of the virus, children might be just as susceptible to the new variant as adults. Recent research from Public Health England may put those fears to rest. Based on detailed contact-tracing of about 20,000 people infected with the new variant — including nearly 3,000 children under 10 — the report showed that young children were about half as likely as adults to transmit the variant to others. That was true of the previous iteration of the virus, as well. There was a lot of speculation at the beginning suggesting that children spread this variant more, said Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government. That's really not the case. But the variant does spread more easily among children, just as it does among adults.

Niklas Halle'N/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Britain said on Thursday that it would ban arrivals from Latin American countries and Portugal over fears of a coronavirus variant discovered in Brazil. In recent weeks, British authorities have already struggled to contain the spread of a different coronavirus variant discovered in Britain that is more contagious than its predecessors. At least two coronavirus variants are currently circulating in Brazil, and at least one has slipped its borders, traveling to Japan. Japanese authorities found one of those variants in four people traveling from Brazil earlier this week. The variant contains a mutation that has been linked with higher contagiousness, similar to the variant found in Britain and another in South Africa. Like the variant found in South Africa, the one exported from Brazil to Japan also carries a mutation that may weaken the efficacy of vaccines. This same mutation has also been identified in the other coronavirus variant recently discovered in Brazil. Experts have cautioned, however, that it would be very difficult for new variants of the coronavirus to evade vaccines entirely.

But hospitals and nursing homes, worried about their patients' health and scarred by many thousands of deaths in the past year, are desperate to have their employees vaccinated. These opposing forces have led to unusual measures: In addition to educating workers about the benefits of the vaccines, employers are dangling incentives like cash, extra time off and even Waffle House gift cards for those who get inoculated, while, in at least a few cases, threatening to fire those who refuse.

Retreat, about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre, has about 400 employees and about 940 inmates. Closing could occur in four months at an annual savings of $40 million, the administration said. Employees will be offered jobs at another state prison within 65 miles of Retreat, it said.

{"original_sentence": "Boise: State health care leaders are pressing federal officials to explain why Idaho was allotted far fewer doses of COVID-19 vaccine than most other states. Numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show Idaho has been distributed vaccine at a rate of 10,298 doses for every 100,000 residents, less per capita than any state but South Carolina. We've reached out to the new administration to lodge our concern, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said Tuesday. Officials with the Biden' administration told Jeppesen they weren't sure why Idaho's distribution was lower but would look into it, he said.

The Minnesota Department of Health has deputized large health systems to distribute the vaccine as part of a public-private partnership. Currently the state has prioritized inoculating people who provide in-person health care services or people living and working in congregate care settings. But at places like Mayo Clinic, HealthPartners and Allina Health, people who don't have patient contact or who can work from home are getting vaccinated, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The health systems have been far more lenient in vaccinating people than was intended, and that's concerning, Minnesota Department of Health infectious disease director Kris Ehresmann said. We felt like we were pretty clear in the guidance. In some cases, people like fitness instructors and construction workers are getting shots, whether they are at high risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19 or not.

Mike Parson plans to divert thousands of unused doses of COVID-19 vaccine from CVS and Walgreens pharmacies to other state-enrolled vaccinators to help the slower-than-expected vaccination process, his spokeswoman said Wednesday.

{"original_sentence": "Concord: Businesses that have been fined for violating emergency orders during the pandemic would get their money back under a GOP-sponsored bill that went before a House committee Wednesday. Rep. Andrew Prout, R-Hudson, told the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee that eight businesses have been fined a total of $10,000 so far. His legislation would require the state to reverse any findings that businesses violated the rules, refund any fines paid, and restore any suspended or revoked permits or licenses once the state of emergency has ended. I think a lot of people feel like this all came at them fast, they don't fully understand it, and even with the best intentions, they may get caught up in this, he said. Some lawmakers on the committee questioned whether businesses were given adequate warnings. But according to the attorney general's office, all had been repeatedly reminded of the rules before facing enforcement action. For example, a general store in Loudon was warned more than 10 times that workers must wear masks, but it refused to comply and posted a sign that read: Please refer to the Constitution of the United States!

{"original_sentence": "Raleigh: The state has overpaid tens of millions of dollars in jobless benefits since the COVID-19 pandemic began to people who don't actually qualify for them or have committed fraud, North Carolina's unemployment program director told legislators Tuesday. Pryor Gibson, who leads the Division of Employment Security, described how nearly $70 million had been overpaid during the first nine months of 2020. Nearly all of that total was distributed since the virus lockdowns sent claims rocketing to historic levels. The overpayments remain a small percentage of the $8 billion in federal and state unemployment benefits distributed in North Carolina during all of 2020.

To avoid that, the Republican governor has issued different declarations with incremental changes every two weeks or so. He issued the 22nd such order Friday.

{"original_sentence": "Madison: The state will become one of only 10 in the U.S. without statewide mask mandates if the Assembly votes as scheduled Thursday to overturn Gov. Tony Evers' order, but masks will still be required in some of its largest cities thanks to local ordinances. More than two dozen public health organizations, as well as state and local health officials, have urged the Republican-controlled Legislature to reconsider the vote. Wearing masks is one of the pillars of recommendations from health experts worldwide to slow the spread of the coronavirus, along with physically distancing and avoiding crowds. The move comes as Wisconsin lags in distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, health officials warn about the spread of contagious new variants, and total deaths due to COVID-19 near 6,000. This is no time to remove a mask mandate in our state, Wisconsin Department of Health Services Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said Tuesday. Vaccines alone won't stop the spread, she cautioned, noting the emergence of more contagious variants.

Wall Street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% Thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since Nov. 3, 2016, according to FactSet data. The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market.",
