Housing has historically been a harbinger of recession — most dramatically in the financial collapse of 2008, which was caused by a real estate bubble fueled by too-easy credit. This time may be different.
The struggling economy has left many local governments in financial peril as costs for services for new migrants remain high and existing unemployed migrants do not add to the already strained tax base.

It's only day one, and with the stroke of a pen, Biden has already taken steps to kill American energy projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline which is critical to energy producing states like Montana. This project will create thousands of jobs, generate tax revenue for local communities, promote North American energy security and independence, and it is the safest and most environmentally friendly way to transport oil. We must do all that we can to ensure construction moves forward.
[W]e are on the front end of a major business investment boom. And that boom is going to carry economic growth faster, it's going to create more jobs, it's going to create more wages, Kudlow told host John Catsimatidis.
Whether an indictment would guarantee impeachment, however, is another story. Nadler said, There are several things you have to look at. One, were there impeachable offenses committed, how many, etcetera. And secondly, how important were they? Do they rise to the gravity where you should undertake an impeachment?

A Chained CPI — Chained Consumer Price Index — is a different way of calculating increases in the cost of living. It assumes people adjust buying patterns when prices changes, and it results in a slightly lower rate of inflation. So benefits for programs such as Social Security grow at a slower rate — what Sanders calls a cut.

The result was an annual drubbing of DeVos by congressional committees in service of proposed cuts that were never going to happen anyway. That was never more painful than in 2019, when DeVos absorbed three days of hits over a proposal to cut funding for the Special Olympics that the White House had insisted upon, only to watch as Trump dramatically announced that he was restoring the funding.
We must not repeat the mistakes of 2008 and 2009, when Congress was too timid to confront the national crisis, he said, referring to the federal government's relief packages passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis that progressives derided as too small to fully restore the American economy.

The coronavirus vaccine rollout has been slow and insufficient. Is President Trump paying attention?
DeVos quickly proved herself an ally of for-profit colleges by withdrawing, delaying or announcing plans to revamp more than a half-dozen Obama-era measures that affected the industry, all within her first year. The secretary tapped former for-profit college executives to marshal higher-education policies that critics say gave predatory schools a pass.

As with so many scams, this scam exploits a kernel of truth, which is that the Census Bureau is looking for people to fill thousands of temporary positions, Weisman said. However, the scammers are using this as an opportunity to make you a victim of identity theft or steal your money.
NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 30: A tesla vehicle is displayed in a Manhattan dealership on January 30, 2020 in New York City.

One way would be to limit demand by restricting the advertising of highly processed food, especially to children, Patel writes.

CNN's Andrew, Nathan McDermott and Chris Massie also reported Wilkie has given a speech to the group. Wilkie was required to disclose in a sworn statement submitted to the Senate committee his public statements, published materials and memberships he held in organizations over the past decade, Andrew writes. Wilkie, however, did not disclose any of his ties to Confederate groups.

NATAPOFF: No, I'm not arguing to do away with the misdemeanor system. We need to be able to respond to low-level crimes, to low-level harms. It's not OK to take other people's stuff. It's not OK to engage in low-level violence. It's not OK to drive drunk. And so in many ways mirroring the mass incarceration debate, we need to dial it back.

For the next 20 years or so, revenues from the Social Security Trust Fund will make it look like we have balanced the budget when in fact we have not, and after that the huge outlays from the trust fund will force drastic reductions in the rest of federal spending, or drastic reductions in Social Security, Biden said in his floor speech.

Washington: Thousands gathered on Freedom Plaza on Saturday as part of the nationwide Women's March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration, though crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. The 2017 march drew close to 1 million people. Last year about 100,000 held a rally east of the White House. This year's protesters planned to march around the White House, but President Donald Trump wasn't there, as he was spending the weekend at his resort in Florida. Organizers faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize. Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that, Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter last week to Women's March organizers. Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.
Additionally, Senate Republicans such as Ted Cruz (TX) and Mike Lee (UT) also signaled their support in getting to the bottom of Robinhood's stock trading restrictions.
Getting a big refund -- more than a thousand dollars -- while carrying expensive debt can be a financial mistake. It's better to reduce your tax withholding, which increases your take-home pay, and use the larger cash flow to pay off your debt. Of course, your tax refund the following year will be smaller, but your debt will be smaller, too.

Earlier in the week, Dershowitz also argued that abuse of power could not be considered an impeachable offense: It is inconceivable that the framers would have intended so politically loaded and promiscuously deployed a term as abuse of power to be weaponized as a tool of impeachment.
And a wealth tax may not even be legal. The ability of the federal government to tax is tightly curtailed by the U.S. Constitution. Legally imposing the first income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment. Legal scholars are currently debating whether a wealth tax would need another amendment. The debate, Josh Barro writes, centers on whether a wealth tax would be a direct tax, which the Constitution makes really hard for the federal government to impose.

Augusta: A proposal in the Legislature would halt a form of discrimination against people who take medication to prevent HIV infection. Democratic Sen. Heather Sanborn of Portland said the state's insurance code should be amended to prevent denial of life insurance for people who take pre-exposure prophylaxis medication to prevent HIV. The prophylaxis is commonly called PrEP. The proposal received a public hearing before the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee on Jan. 8. It will be subject to committee votes before it can move on to the full Maine Legislature. Sanborn said the state's insurance code should reflect modern medical practices, instead of perpetuating discriminatory behavior.

The challenge for people who want to protect democracy is twofold. First, they need to prevent repeat performances of this most recent theater. Drama is an inevitable part of democratic politics. Politicians will always seek to highlight some problem they care about in ways that grab the public's attention. Naked ambition of the sort Hawley and Cruz displayed is also an essential part of politics and can be productive when it is yoked to real political needs. It becomes a problem when ambition leads politicians to blur the boundaries between dramatic fiction and essential political facts, undermining the shared beliefs that hold democracy together.
None of this should be surprising. The architects of the Affordable Care Act were trying to make sure everybody could get decent insurance, regardless of income, and they were willing to adjust financial assistance in order to make that possible. The Republicans who would replace the Affordable Care Act aren't trying to put insurance within everybody's reach. They are simply trying to offer a tax break that would available to people buying health insurance, and even then only under some circumstances.

And it's also made clear they want the White House meeting and ultimately if they want $400 million in U.S. aid, this is what they have to do. The only lament I hear from my colleagues is it wasn't successful, they got caught, they didn't get the political investigations and they still had to release the money. Now, they still haven't gotten the White House meeting but they had to release the money because the whistleblower blew the whistle -- the whistleblower the President wants to punish -- and because Congress announced it was doing investigations, and very soon thereafter, the President was forced to lift the hold on the aid.

The Senate parliamentarian ruled that a plan to gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 does not fit the complicated rules that govern budget bills in the Senate. House Democrats included the measure in a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill that is expected to be the first major legislative act for President Biden.
That leaves one more avenue for states to pursue — enacting benefit reforms. According to the table, if the funding gap were closed entirely by increases in worker contributions, that increase would have to be monumental — by at least 400% in each of the four states. Such an increase would not be acceptable to public unions, and further would not be legally permissible in many states because of constitutional protections for accrued pension benefits.
Howell's relationship with McAuliffe (D) has been strained, despite their shared history as dealmakers and McAuliffe's efforts to woo the speaker over craft beer in the Executive Mansion.
On his promise to build a wall along the southern border, for example, Trump neglected it entirely during the two years Republicans controlled both the House and Senate, then triggered a monthlong government shutdown to try to coerce Congress into giving him funds to construct it, and finally declared a national emergency that provided a justification for him to raid military construction budgets ― taking money that otherwise would have gone for such things as schools and on-base housing for service members and their families. Doing so allowed him to build 453 miles of new steel fencing along the 2,000-mile Mexican border, although only about 80 miles are in stretches where no previous barrier existed. (Trump had promised hundreds of times during his 2016 campaign that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, but in four years he never made that request even once, and Mexico never paid a dime.)

Williams received a wild card entry for her return at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, in March. As a result, she played No. 29 Kiki Bertans in the second round and sister Venus, who was seeded eighth, in the third round. Serena lost to Venus in straight sets. In her next event, the Miami Open, a meeting with fourth-seeded Elina Svitolina awaited Williams if she had defeated Naomi Osaka in the first round.
Colorado Attorney General-elect Phil Weiser called the decision mind boggling and said it goes against the role of government to protect people. I just can't begin to express the magnitude of what a threat that is to the rule of law.

Most economic indicators aren't pointing to a downturn on the near horizon. But with seemingly constant chaos in Washington, recent turmoil in the markets and an expansion that's about to be the longest on record, businesses are getting nervous.
More incremental and market-based approaches are achievable at much less expense, and with the potential to truly control costs, which is the main problem in the U.S. health care system. The Association of Mature American Citizens (AMAC) supports expansion of health savings accounts (HSAs) with their triple tax advantages, more transparency with prescription and medical procedure pricing, and eliminating the middle men when it comes to drug pricing.

Tsuga declined to comment on how far Tesla Model 3 production is behind its targeted delivery schedule.
It's not clear how much these programs would cost, but they could get expensive. Trump's would cut the tax liabilities of richer families in particular. Clinton's, meanwhile, would expand the Child Tax Credit and further subsidize child care, as the Washington Post has reported. The Huffington Post pointed to Sanders' universal child care plan — which, admittedly, is not quite the same as Clinton's — to provide a sense of scale. The bill for that plan came out at $35 billion per year, by one estimate.
Loweree said he doesn't buy into claims that Biden has a debt to Hispanics who helped him get elected. The issue here isn't who owes anyone anything, he said. Rather, it's about fulfilling a promise made during the Obama administration: 'Dreamers' who came out of the shadows and signed up for DACA were told they'd be protected and allowed to work, not deported.
Anyone who professes to care about the Constitution should recognize the danger of this argument. And if senators remain silent out of fealty or fear of a president from their party, they should not be allowed to forget it.

The partial government shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, entered its 22nd day early Saturday, making it the longest in history. The previous longest shutdown on record lasted from Dec. 5, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996, when Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Democratic President Bill Clinton faced off over taxes. On Friday, some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck since the shutdown began. The shutdown is the result of an impasse between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border. Negotiations stalled again this week after Trump abruptly left a White House meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. The president traveled to Texas Thursday to review the situation at the border.
Some of the vehicles on this list are luxury vehicles, with automakers often sacrificing fuel efficiency for performance and luxury. The GMC Savana 2500 2WD is not such a vehicle. The Savana is a work vehicle, offered as a passenger van and as a utility vehicle for hauling cargo. Although a version of the van has been sold for roughly two decades, the years of production have not yielded a more fuel-efficient cargo van. The Savana 2500 gets just 15 mpg on the highway and 10 mpg in the city.

President-Elect Trump Breaks With Long History Of Press Conferences
He has gotten some number of women ― dozens, who knows ― to sign nondisclosure agreements, both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace, Warren said. So, Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements, so we can hear their side of the story?

He takes on the show, he takes on the press, he takes on me. But I think it's absurd that he would be doing that in the direction of anybody - any kind of comedy programming that's parodying him or commenting on him, whether it was Jon Stewart in his day and so forth or Colbert now. I find it amazing that he's doing that. And then when you think about it's me that he's doing it with, I find that even more surreal.

Pence was deputized by Trump to oversee Saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), according to two Trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. That meant few specifics were actually discussed Saturday, as Democratic staffers repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.

You know, Trump is someone, to me, where the things I try to lock into and kind of hold onto just for that brief five minutes of the cold opening is that he's not having any fun. He doesn't shut up about how rich he is. He doesn't stop talking about how much money he has and how much privilege he has. And he just seems miserable. I mean, if he's an advertisement for wealth and privilege, then, good God, I think it's terrible.

Frankfort: Inmate populations and deteriorating prisons are sapping the state of money needed for priorities like education and health care, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says. Stepping up his push for criminal justice reform as the fiscally responsible thing to do, Beshear said Friday that the state needs to reduce incarceration rates, which in turn would create opportunities to consolidate prisons. Criminal-justice reform isn't just the right thing to do – and I believe it is – it's the moral thing to do, he told reporters at the Capitol. It is absolutely necessary to do for this budget and most especially for every budget after that. Beshear, who previously served as the state's attorney general, stressed that he wants to revamp the criminal-justice system in a way that doesn't compromise public safety.

Officials said they have not identified a probable source of exposure for the other two people, a man in his early 20s and a 69-year-old woman.

Tonight, we open a new door to the future. Mr. Reagan calls it tokenism. We call it America. Ever since I graduated from Elmore High, I've been a Democrat. I was attorney general of my state; then a U.S. senator. Then, an honest, caring man - Jimmy Carter - picked me as his running mate and in 1976 I was elected vice president. And in 1980, Ronald Reagan beat the pants off us. So tonight, I want to say something to those of you across our country who voted for Mr. Reagan - Republicans, Independents, and yes, some Democrats: I heard you. And our party heard you. After we lost we didn't tell the American people that they were wrong. Instead, we began asking you what our mistakes had been. And for four years, I listened to all of the people of our country. I traveled everywhere. It seemed like I had visited every acre of America. It wasn't easy. I remember late one night, as I headed from a speech in one city to a hotel a thousand miles away, someone said to me, Fritz, I saw you on TV. Are those bags under your eyes natural? And I said, No, I got them the old-fashioned way. I earned them. To the thousands of Americans who welcomed me into your homes and into your businesses, your churches and synagogues: I thank you. You confirmed my belief in our country's values. And you helped me learn and grow.

Harrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf defended the state's rollout of COVID-19 vaccines Tuesday, saying that it was left in the lurch by the Trump administration's overpromises and that a decentralized vaccine sign-up system should prove to be more efficient, as opposed to a centralized portal some states use. He also defended federal guidelines – adopted by his administration – that pushed smokers into the first phase of vaccination, calling it an objective assessment of who is most vulnerable, not a value judgment. Meanwhile, Philadelphia abruptly cut off a vaccine clinic operator amid concerns that it had sought to profiteer from the work. Officials said they ended their relationship Monday with the group Philly Fighting COVID, which had been chosen to run the city's largest vaccination site. Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said the city became concerned when the privacy policy on the group's website changed to allow sharing personal information for people signing up for vaccinations, and the group abruptly stopped its coronavirus testing operations. Farley said the organization assured the city that personal information had not been sold, but health department officials were working with the city's lawyers to determine next steps.
While it would seem, at least on the surface, that any investment in a nation such as North Korea — with an economy one-third the size of Ethiopia — would be uplifting, it will do nothing to help the average citizen, he says. Building such resorts, in the hope that they will attract international vacationers and adventure seekers — if sanctions are lifted — will only enrich a regime that has over 100,000 people in gulags on-par with Stalin or Hitler. Such a thought actually sickens my stomach.
The economic impact on the national level is significant as well. Across the U.S., the more than 1 million international students who studied in the U.S. last year generated over $35 billion for the U.S. economy. This represents a direct inflow of foreign capital to support U.S. universities and state and local economies. Looking at job creation, the numbers are equally compelling – international students were found to support over 400,000 jobs nationally. This equates to three U.S. jobs created or supported for every seven enrolled international students.

You lose flexibility from the federal student loan program. Homeowners who tap home equity to pay off student debt give up their rights to income-driven repayment options on their federal student loans, which cap federal student loan payments at roughly 10 percent of their income, said Rohit Chopra, senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America. Income-driven repayment is a critical safeguard during periods of unemployment or other income shocks that help avoid the consequences of default. Also, keep in mind that the federal college loan program has multiple repayment options.

All of the above are countercyclical fiscal measures: government spending to offset the shock. Monetary policy is also germane in this context, and the Federal Reserve has already signaled a willingness to cut the benchmark interest rate it controls to cheapen credit. There is, however, a good chance that rate cuts will be of limited help. First, credit is already cheap. But more important, if people are afraid of getting sick in public places, they won't take trips or go out to eat no matter how low interest rates fall. Nor will rate cuts reopen workplaces, factories and schools that are closed because of the virus.
The bill includes cash payments of as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per married couple. Individuals with an adjusted gross income of less than $75,000, and $150,000 for joint filers, would receive the full payment. People earning over that amount would see their payments reduced by $5 for each $100 in income over that amount. The benefit completely phases out for individuals earning over $99,000 and married couples making more than $198,000.
The lack of resources also means that public defenders lack the ability to investigate cases. So there are very few, if any, investigators and public defender offices available for misdemeanors, so if an individual is innocent or if there are witnesses or if there are facts about the encounter with the police or the crime that could be uncovered, that public defender office may simply be unable to unearth that information.
Instead, he cast himself as a champion of higher public school teacher pay and better school funding that would enable more hiring of teachers, counselors and mental health professionals. One way he suggested to address the issue is by reforming the tax code so young stockbrokers, who may benefit from the carried-interest loophole or the lower tax rate on capital gains, don't pay a lower tax rate than teachers.
According to a Google Consumer Survey conducted by TransUnion in 2013, 33% of Americans admitted to never checking their credit reports or credit scores. Ignorance is unfortunately not bliss in this instance, because it's quite possible for errors to appear on your credit report from one or more of the three major credit reporting bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax). Not checking your credit report annually could allow these errors to remain on your report without your knowledge, dragging down your credit score in the process.

That's because both candidates are trying to latch onto — and insist that they can alleviate — a pervasive feeling among Americans that they just can't get ahead, and that it's related to a fast-changing U.S. economy. The candidates, of course, diverge vastly on many issues, but they also have some surprising areas of agreement.
The World Bank's green bonds carried the exact same interest rate as did the Bank's other bonds. In other words, if investors wanted the Bank to invest in water pollution reduction projects, they could buy a green bond with, say, a 4% rate of interest. On the other hand, if they wanted to buy one of the Bank's other bonds that were financing, say, a coalmine, an urban highway or some other environmentally atrocious project, they could buy a regular World Bank bond that was also paying 4%. So, what is different about green bonds? Well, they assuage the conscience of sensitive investors. They make them feel good. They are Feel Good Bonds.

The video in question, circulated on Twitter by a top Sanders adviser, does not appear to be altered. But the short clip omits Biden's larger argument over how Ryan handled the 2017 tax cuts and subsequent budget debates. A separate Sanders' adviser included a transcript of Biden's remarks in the video clip in a separate campaign newsletter. He added other, more extended video, of Biden as a U.S. senator in 1995 and presidential candidate in 2007 explaining his support for a more austere federal budget, including putting Social Security and Medicare on the table.
Tech workers and their bosses realized they might not need all the perks and after-work schmooze events. But maybe they needed elbow room and a yard for the new puppy. A place to put the Peloton. A top public school, noted SFGATE.
INGRAHAM: Hold on, let's do a little economics. Why aren't we having inflation now then? Where's our inflation? If what you are saying is true, where are all the inflationary pressures on buying in the United States? They're not there. The answer is there is no inflationary tendency in this market right now.
The central issue is not economic. It's that these platforms enable users to get lower cost services by bypassing laws, zoning, regulatory, insurance, taxation and safety requirements. Such restrictions are there for good reason, notably those involving safety.

LIASSON: Yes, he did. The big question going in was, would Bernie Sanders end the night on a glide path to a plurality of delegates with an all-but-insurmountable lead?

Q: I am 64 and just retired. I haven't taken my Social Security yet. My husband will be 60 and plans on taking an early retirement next year. So, I am holding out on Social Security until then. We don't have huge savings. But my husband will get a pension, and he'll be able to collect on my Social Security until he takes his. He also has a 401(k) plan. Do we have to rollover his 401(k) plan once he retires? Or do we leave it there? If we have to roll it over, what's best to put it in? Savings, IRA? We don't think we should do any investing since it's all we have besides our home and cars.
The phase three proposal follows an initial $8.3 billion measure passed earlier this month to boost emergency funding, and the House legislation approved early Saturday providing paid sick leave and family leave to some workers forced to remain at home over the outbreak. This phase two bill passed in the House has a potential price tag of $104.9 billion over ten years, per the Joint Committee on Taxation.
Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who had to rebuild the Justice Department after controversies during the George W.

One former White House official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that in Trump's first year, after failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the White House focused on passing the tax cut bill. They got it through while he had both houses of Congress, the former official said.

When we first visited the front lines a few weeks ago right beside local soldiers launching a barrage of mortars, we found some of the two thousand American troops who had been at the forefront of this fight. Their Kurdish allies have suffered grave losses, more than eight thousand fighters. They now worry the end of ISIS as a territorial force will hasten the withdrawal of U.S. troops they desperately rely on for advice, artillery, and especially air power.

The federal gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon and has remained unchanged since 1993. For the most part, revenues from gasoline sales are reinvested in transportation infrastructure. According to Green, however, States do not receive enough money from the federal government for transportation, and have enacted state fuel taxes as a means to supplement their funding needs. Almost all state gas tax rates match or exceed the federal tax rate, and in some cases double it.

With Democrats locked out of power in the Senate and the White House, Jayapal said supporters of universal health care were proceeding 'one step at a time' and that getting the first real hearings on the bill — for years, it has been aspirational, and not even subject to a Congressional Budget Office score — would force a larger discussion, Dave writes.

The new strain of the virus presents us all with a huge challenge — and whilst the vaccine is being rolled out, we have needed to tighten restrictions further, Sunak said in a statement.

GAYLE KING: I think he is hoping he can ride it out. He is not going to step down. He is not going-- I even asked, Under what circumstances would you step down? And he couldn't even give-- he did not want to give an answer to that question because that is not how he is thinking, that is not what he wants, and that's not what he believes that he should step down.
Officials from Toyota and Mazda declined to comment late Tuesday afternoon.
In a statement, the White House said President Biden, who proposed the $15 minimum wage as part of his American Recue Plan, is disappointed but that he urges Congress to move quickly to pass the relief. It also said he will work with leaders in Congress to determine the best path forward.
It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons -- among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals -- to measure their investment 'risk' by their portfolio's ratio of bonds to stocks, Buffett wrote. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk.
The president made the comments on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Despite promises to reduce the federal budget deficit, it has ballooned under Mr. Trump's watch as a result of sweeping tax cuts and additional government spending.
Previous books about Trump have also prompted debates about sourcing and attribution. Like Michael Wolff's two efforts at exposés and Bob Woodward's Fear, this account relies on a mélange of on-the-record and off-the-record insiders with varying degrees of proximity to the president.
In November 2013, I found out that a handful of my New York condo neighbors were renting out their units through Airbnb. This was unacceptable and I wrote an article in a major New York newspaper that helped fan a movement.

With tax season officially starting on Friday, millions of Americans could be in for a shock: owing taxes on unemployment benefits they received in 2020. The federal government and most states consider jobless aid taxable income. But unlike a paycheck, taxes typically aren't automatically deducted from such benefits, with the IRS expecting its cut.

After careful thought and consideration, I have decided to support the Senate tax reform bill. I believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle class families, McCain said in a statement Thursday.

Federal tax liens can show up on your credit report for a mind-numbing 15 years, meaning they could wind up wreaking havoc on your ability to open new credit accounts for more than a decade to come.

Here in the U.S., the negative response to the commission's Apple ruling went beyond the Treasury Department. Republicans and Democrats in Congress condemned it, calling the decision a money grab.

In the first two years of President Barack Obama's first term, we watched as a unified Congress controlled by Democrats rammed through ObamaCare and other liberal pieces of legislation, confirmed radical nominees to critical executive branch positions and promulgated progressive regulations that harmed our economy and our workers.
Earlier this month, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned the state could raise taxes to address a historic budget crunch without additional federal aid. An estimated 70,000 net residents left New York City from the start of the pandemic in March until last December, costing an estimated $34 billion in lost income, according to a study from analytics firm Unacast.
We — like Ms. Bowser — have never questioned the desirability of giving families the time off they need to care for newborns or tend to ailing parents. But the District's plan that is set to be enacted into law, barring interference from Congress, is expensive and ill-designed and, in the opinion of the city's chief financial officer, presents multiple risk factors. Not only do most of the benefits go to Maryland and Virginia residents, many of whom already get employer-provided leave, but also it is unclear if a government that still struggles to provide some basic city services is capable of pulling off a program unprecedented in its complexity.
Trump will be flying Tuesday to Alamo, Texas, a city in the Rio Grande Valley near the U.S-Mexican border. The city is named after the San Antonio mission where a small group of Texan independence-fighters fended off Mexican forces during a 13-day siege. Most of them died but the mission became a symbol of resistance for Texans, who eventually defeated the Mexican army.
If there's one thing the IRS is big on, it's accuracy. So as you sit down to file your taxes, make sure you're dealing with hard numbers. Guessing at data or deductions is a great way to raise your audit risk, and it doesn't matter if you're reasonably close — the IRS wants those numbers exact. This means that if you did freelance work last year but are missing that 1099 form that summarizes your income, don't just throw out a number you think is correct. Get on the phone with that client, insist on a copy of that tax form, and get that figure just right.

We added 5,000 people to our list this morning; we added 10,000 people to our list yesterday, Steyer said.

Former House Ways and Mean Committee chair Kevin Brady, R-Tex.. has circulated a draft of a bill that would make technical and clerical corrections to the tax-law changes, including one designed to make the excise tax applicable to all public colleges and universities.

Trump's 15 percent plan may have an unintended consequence, however; he would apply that rate to pass-through business income, which is taxed at a top rate of 39.6 percent. That benefits the owners of certain types of businesses, allowing them to drastically cut their tax bills, and could encourage people to avoid taxes by changing how they report their earnings.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The Wall Street Journal editorial board put it this way. It says Democrats believe they must sacrifice Mister Northam to preserve the sword they have made of racial politics for routine use against Republicans.

Loar notes a city-commissioned study shows the Titans' stadium needs nearly $300 million in capital improvements.

Las Vegas: Animal rescuers have confirmed one of three hat-wearing pigeons that gained popularity on social media has died. Lofty Hopes Pigeon Rescue employees say fumes from glue used to affix the hats could have poisoned Bille the Pidge. Lofty Hopes Pigeon Rescue tweeted Sunday that the female bird was weak and had lost toes to a condition where its toes are isolated by a string and fall off. Officials say the three pigeons were first discovered in December wearing miniature red cowboy hats in Las Vegas. Rescue employees say the hats were glued on. Employees say pigeons have fragile respiratory systems, and a veterinarian had to trim feathers to remove the hats. It wasn't certain if the bird's death was connected to the hat. It is still unknown who put the hats on the birds. Billie is survived by two other former cowboy pigeons – Cluck Norris and Coolamity Jane.

This is crony capitalism … business partnering with government to increase its profits [by cutting Americans' wages] while dumping the costs on taxpayers, responded Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies.

The operative word here is consider. Maxing out your 401(k) contribution isn't for everybody. Your salary might not be high enough. Or you might have another opportunity to invest money outside your 401(k) to make even higher returns. Maybe so, but if you do not contribute to a retirement account, will you really make other investments, or will you simply spend the money on a larger house, a better car or more toys?
The billions in U.S. taxpayer funding is also allocated to stabilize Libya, which includes increased border security for the country. The military of Egypt will continue to receive about $1.3 billion in taxpayer money that can likewise be used for border security efforts.
This perception undermined support for spending on children. And it went along with a widespread belief that aid to poor families was creating a culture of dependency, which in turn was the culprit behind social collapse in America's inner cities. Partly in response, aid to families, such as it was, increasingly came with work requirements, or took the form of things like the earned-income tax credit, which is linked to earnings.

Local jurisdictions will be rewarded for shoddy record-keeping by enabling more of their highly problematic borrowers and renters to enter the general lending and rental pools — borrowers and renters who are 5½ times more likely to default than those without tax lien or civil judgment problems. In response, lenders will have to increase mortgage interest rates they charge to all borrowers and landlords will have to increase rental rates they charge to renters to offset the increased risk they have been required to bear.

Little Rock: A state commission has approved nearly $9 million in funding to repair levees damaged by record flooding last year. The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved the $8.8 million in grant funding Thursday for 14 groups overseeing levees along the Arkansas River that were damaged last year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The largest grants were for $1.6 million for the Riverdale area in Little Rock and $1.5 million for a levee district in Dardanelle. Last year, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created a task force to study how to improve the state's aging levee system. The group presented its final report earlier this month and recommended increased oversight, consolidation of some levee districts, and state grants to fund improvements. Last year's springtime flooding along the Arkansas River occurred because of heavy rainfall in Kansas and Oklahoma.
It's not as if their aging stars about to depart anytime, either, resulting in a bloated future payroll. Cabrera is signed for $240 million through 2023.

Owosso: A whopping $43,170 in forgotten cash was discovered inside a footstool donated to a resale shop. Howard Kirby bought the piece and other furniture for $70 after Christmas. He was stunned Sunday when his daughter-in-law unzipped the cushion and shouted. After the shock wore off, he began the extraordinary step of returning the money to the former owners. I do what I can to be as much like Christ as I can, and this is the moral thing to do, said Kirby, 54. This is going to help them. I'm so happy for them. The footstool was part of a living room set donated to a Habitat For Humanity store by Kim Fauth-Newberry and her husband. The furniture had belonged to her grandfather, Phillip Fauth, who died in July. Fauth-Newberry said Fauth was a frugal man who always paid in cash, even $9,000 for a new roof. The newly discovered money was separated with paper clips and topped with handwritten notes.

Chicago: The state is updating its birth certificate system to affirm the gender identities of transgender parents, after a transmasculine person asked to be officially recognized as a father who gave birth to their daughter. Myles and Precious Brady-Davis of Chicago learned after their daughter, Zayn, arrived in December that the Illinois Department of Public Health automatically names the parent who gives birth as Mother/Co-Parent on a birth certificate. Myles Brady-Davis is transmasculine, which describes a person who was born female but is typically masculine in gender expression. Transmasculine people do not always identify as male. Myles, who uses they/them pronouns, carried and gave birth to Zayn and wants to be listed as her father, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Precious Brady-Davis is a transgender woman and the baby's mother.

While global businesses have become accustomed to finding new markets and identifying ways to hedge risk, they are less adept at fundamentally altering their business models. Some U.S. businesses are already canceling plans to build foreign production facilities abroad. Some foreign businesses are already purchasing insurance in the event their U.S. investment proposals are not approved in the coming months. There is great unease about what the trade and investment regime will turn out to be 6 or 12 months from now, and with good reason. The paradigm shift that voters in the U.S., UK, the Philippines and elsewhere have ushered in is about to start sending shock waves around the world.

Charleston: Rescue dogs could soon become the state's official state dog under a proposal approved Tuesday in the Senate. The resolution, sponsored by state Sens. Ryan Weld and Stephen Baldwin, says it seeks to bring attention to dogs living in the more than 500 animal shelters in West Virginia. Just because a dog is at a shelter doesn't mean that there's something wrong with the dog, said Weld, a Republican. That dog needs a second chance and is looking for a new friend, just like you might be. The proposal now moves to the House of Delegates. West Virginia already has a bunch of official state flora and fauna. The black bear is the state animal, the sugar maple is the state tree, the cardinal is the state bird, and the rhododendron is the state flower.
REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. I-- I-- I heard that and-- and Senator Shelby is a, you know, a very seasoned negotiator and-- and-- and certainly when you look at-- at his conversations, you can draw some optimism from it. But I can tell you based on my conversations with conferees and a number of rank and file, there are distinct differences. And-- and here's-- here's what I'm concerned about. Border patrol came in to brief the conference. They gave their top three priorities and the conferees have said zero money for those top three priorities. How can you be serious about securing our border if the very people that are experts on securing it say these are our top three priorities, we need money. And yet they're saying zero dollars for that. I-- I don't understand that.

In response to those accusations and concerns about the spread of the virus on Capitol Hill, the House earlier this week approved a fine system for members who refuse to adhere to a mask mandate on the floor. It was unclear whether Mr. Espaillat took shelter in the secure room. But on Wednesday, he was among the lawmakers who spoke on the House floor — while wearing a mask — before voting to impeach President Trump for the second time. Mr. Espaillat noted that the colleagues who had tested positive in recent days collectively occupy a range of gender, ages, races and ethnicities. Covid-19 does not discriminate, he said. It is incumbent on each of us to prioritize social distancing from one another — even if that poses a temporary inconvenience — and wear a face mask. There is no singular panacea and we must adjust our daily habits and practices for our own health and safety as well as the health and safety of those around us and throughout our communities.

Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two injections, separated by three or four weeks, and they aren't believed to fully kick in until about a week or two after a person receives the second shot. Capitol Hill has long struggled to control the spread of the pandemic within its marble walls, a haphazard effort exacerbated last week as hundreds of maskless Trump supporters stormed the building and forced lawmakers to shelter in confined secure locations across the Capitol complex. Lawmakers, aides and reporters who took shelter in two separate rooms on both sides of the Capitol have been warned about possible exposure to the coronavirus. Though cases have continued to emerge since the 117th Congress was sworn in nearly two weeks ago, House Democrats have blamed a group of their Republican colleagues who refused to wear masks during the attack while waiting in a secure location for law enforcement to regain control of the building. Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat of New Jersey, Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, and Brad Schneider, Democrat of Illinois, have all tested positive in the aftermath of the attack and cited the Republican refusal to wear masks during the siege. Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, is in isolation after her husband, who was with her in the room, tested positive, and in a statement said the diagnoses were a consequence of my callous Republican colleagues who refused to wear masks.

The Moderna vaccine was ultimately given an emergency green light from the Food and Drug Administration as a two-dose vaccine of 100 micrograms of mRNA each. Trial volunteers who got lower doses might especially benefit from a third shot, said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. In its statement, Moderna said that boosters might also be studied in people who took part in its later, Phase 3 study of 30,000 participants, if accumulating antibody persistence data indicate that this is warranted. Company officials said at a conference this week that they thought protection should last at least a year, according to a report by CNBC. But Moderna's chief executive, Stephane Bancel, also noted in an interview with CNBC that the vaccine might have to be adjusted in the future to immunize people against new coronavirus variants or strains, much like flu vaccines are regularly revamped.

Second, you should look at the actual numbers. Many homeowners do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to see whether renting out the home would cover the direct carrying costs of owning it.

It is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don't vote. They don't believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don't think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair – and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice.
Other obligations are dodged. Airbnb hosts commercialize their units and, as such, should pay higher mortgage rates, condo fees, and property taxes.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well as I said before, I'd have to think about it. You know, it's hard to say no to a kid when they've got a passion for something. And I've got daughters. They don't have a passion for football. It is a great sport. I am a huge fan. But there is no doubt that some of the concerns that we've learned about when it comes to concussions have to give parents pause. And you know, as I said before, I feel differently about the NFL. These are grown men. They-- they're well compensated. They know the risks that are involved. But as we start thinking about, you know, the pipeline. Pop Warner. High school. College. I want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make the sport safer and-- and that means that the game's probably gonna evolve a little bit.
The IRS is giving all Texas residents and businesses an additional two months to file their federal income taxes, citing the deadly winter storm that left millions without power and water. Texans will now have until June 15 to file their 2020 returns, instead of the regular deadline of April 15, the tax agency said on Monday.
They also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country. As most people know, in the 1990s and later, the financial interests spent billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force through Congress the deregulation of Wall Street, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the weakening of consumer protection laws in states.

Consistency is also key, says Karl Frank, a certified financial planner and president of A&I Financial Services in Englewood, Colorado. If your tax situation is the same as it was last year and you're not taking many deductions, then software may be a great tool, he says.
My understanding is changes are being made as we speak, Sarah Jane Glynn, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. Whether that leads to substantive revisions in the bill or minor technical fixes remains to be seen, she added.

Trump likewise in his speech touted infrastructure spending, though he didn't get into detail. However, he has explained those details elsewhere: he has seemed close to Clinton on the idea that something like an infrastructure bank would be the way to fund those projects, as the Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos wrote earlier this year, with Americans buying infrastructure bonds.

My colleagues have tried to make the argument here today and we've heard it before that the president was just interested in fighting corruption. That's our goal, fighting corruption in Ukraine, this terribly corrupt country. The problem of course with that is there is no evidence of the president trying to fight corruption. The evidence all points in the other direction. The evidence points the direction of the president inviting Ukraine to engage in the corrupt act of investigating a U.S. political opponent.

We'll start with Alec Baldwin, who's memorable roles include a ruthless salesman in the film version of Glengarry Glen Ross and the network executive on NBC's 30 Rock. He won an Emmy for his portrayal on Saturday Night Live of Donald Trump last year and is nominated again for it this year.

Others sound a similar note. Patel argues that many farmers still need the safety net of crop insurance subsidies. He argues that subsidies are vital for indebted farmers who need to pay off creditors.
The Trump initiative would allow states to choose between receiving a block grant ― a flat dollar amount per year ― that increases slightly faster than medical price inflation or a per-capita cap based on the number of current Medicaid enrollees that rises at the same rate as medical inflation. The per-capita cap option is less problematic than the block grants and offers states more financial leeway, but both would result in benefit and enrollment cuts, Holahan said.
Fox News has learned that the House Budget Committee will prepare a budget vehicle on Feb. 1. The measure would likely go to the House floor on Feb. 3. This vehicle is the essential first step.

ELVING: When George Washington became our first president, we took a little time to establish the dollar as the currency for all states, but that got done over a Christmas session. For generations thereafter, Congress remained technically in session over Christmas, not out of disrespect, but just in case urgent business might require it. And the prospect of needing a Christmas session helped make the preceding weeks and months more productive. Deadlines, of course, are made to be stretched, and sometimes things got out of hand. Take the first Christmas of Lyndon Johnson's presidency in 1963.
Many of us have bills that creep up just once a year, like that annual heating maintenance fee or warehouse club renewal. If your budget doesn't already allow for these, look at your records from the past few years and identify the different one-off expenses you encountered. Then add those numbers up, divide the total by 12, and factor that amount into your budget each month.
Fox News is told it will still take a couple of weeks to get the next coronavirus bill together, and that will likely hit the first week of March. But it could go earlier if the measure is ready.

You did not vote to assault the poor, the sick, and the disabled. And you did not vote to pay fifty bucks for a fifty-cent light bulb. Four years ago, many of you voted for Mr. Reagan because he promised you'd be better off. And today, the rich are better off. But working Americans are worse off, and the middle class is standing on a trap door. Lincoln once said that ours is to be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. What we have today is a government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. And we're going to make a change in November. Look at the record. Reagan Record First, there was Mr. Reagan's tax program. What happened was, he gave each of his rich friends enough tax relief to buy a Rolls Royce - and then he asked your family to pay for the hub caps. Then they looked the other way at the rip-offs, soaring utility bills, phone bills, medical bills. Then they crimped our future. They let us be routed in international competition, and now the help-wanted ads are full of listings for executives, and for dishwashers - but not much in between. Then they socked it to workers. They encouraged executives to vote themselves huge bonuses - while using King Kong tactics to make workers take Hong Kong wages. Mr. Reagan believes that the genius of America is in the boardrooms and exclusive country clubs.
I remember him telling me once, when we were meeting about the Buffalo Bills, he said to me, 'Look at these guys. Do you see how much fun they're having?'  said Michael Caputo, who helped Trump with his bid for the Bills and later was an adviser to his presidential campaign. I know it's not all fun and games. But I think after the presidency and the flames of politics he's walked through, he might be looking for a little more fun.

Salem: The state's changing climate and ocean conditions are already harming its native fish and wildlife, officials from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife say. That's making it difficult for ODFW to meet its statutory mandate to manage the resources in its care. In response, the department is developing a Climate and Ocean Change Policy that will help shape where its limited resources are spent. On Friday, the public and the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission had their first chance to hear about the proposal. Our climate and ocean are changing in ways that are not favorable for fish and wildlife, said Shaun Clements, ODFW senior policy analyst. We've been working on trying to address these impacts. For example, Oregon may have to abandon spending in some areas where species are unlikely to survive, in order to focus on those where they will, said Davia Palmeri, the department's conservation policy coordinator.

What's interesting is when you listen to people on Capitol Hill, including Republicans in Senate leadership, they are really only talking about two of the president's four pillars. In other words, they want border security and wall funding in exchange for some kind of a path to legalization or citizenship for the DREAMers. They think a smaller, more narrow deal is more doable. So most Republicans also think that Donald Trump will sign whatever Congress sends him on immigration. Otherwise, he has to start deporting the DREAMers. Either way, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised that he would put a bill on the floor this week with an open process. That means amendments, votes, old fashioned legislating - something we haven't seen in a very long time in Washington.

Already, no president-elect (dating to at least Jimmy Carter) has waited longer to hold a press conference.

His campaign sent out daily press releases counting the days since her last press conference, headlined, Hiding Hillary Watch — and, at one point, Trump even tweeted about it:

He said that, by definition, teachers are not worth much because they aren't paid much. His beliefs were well-known at the firm, according to Magerman. But since Robert was so averse to publicity, his ideology wasn't seen as a cause for concern. None of us ever thought he would get his views out, because he only talked to his cats, Magerman told me. Robert's middle daughter Rebekah shares similar political beliefs, but she is also very articulate and, therefore, able to act as her father's mouthpiece. (Neither Rebekah nor Robert responded to detailed lists of questions for this article.) Under Rebekah's leadership, the family foundation poured some $70 million into conservative causes between 2009 and 2014. [1] 1. According to The Washington Post, the family donated $35 million to conservative think tanks and at least to $36.5 million to individual GOP races. The first candidate they threw their financial weight behind was Arthur Robinson, a chemist from Oregon who was running for Congress. He was best known in his district for co-founding an organization that is collecting thousands of vials of urine as part of an effort it says will revolutionize the evaluation of personal chemistry. Robinson didn't win, but he got closer than expected, and the Mercers got a taste of what their money could do.

Iowans cited a slew of reasons for their eagerness to begin the lengthy nomination process to settle on a leader to go up against President Trump. There were the tax cuts that one voter called a waste of time and money; the trade war with China depressing demand for exports and hurting farmers; the hostility toward immigrants, a labor pool heavily used on Iowa farms; the rolling back of environmental regulations that impact Iowa's rivers; a foreign policy approach changing the country's status in the world; and the general chaos and lack of civility in the White House.

Tax refunds can be tricky, too. First of all, in an ideal world, you shouldn't be getting a significant refund in the first place, because that's just loaning the government money for free. But even if you've snagged a sizable refund over the past few years, it can be tough to figure out where it came from unless you're really in tune with your finances. It could be, for example, that you were eligible for certain tax credits or deductions in the past that no longer apply. That's why banking on a bonus or tax refund can really hurt you. If you count on money that never comes your way, you'll risk overspending and taking on debt.

As Biden notes in his conversation with the voter on Saturday, his Social Security plan would increase benefits and extend the program's solvency by lifting the cap on taxable income for Social Security purposes. The benefit increases he proposes include the creation of a minimum benefit at 125% of the federal poverty level, tackling poverty in late old age through a benefit bump-up for people collecting benefits for 20 years or more, and a change allowing surviving spouses to keep a larger share of benefits.

The reason? Congress is cracking down on tax-return-related fraud. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act mandated the IRS delay issuing tax refunds for returns claiming the EITC or the Additional Child Tax Credit until Feb. 15. The move is designed to give the IRS more time to detect fraud and prevent refunds from being issued to ID thieves who file fake tax returns using such credits.

Newhalem: The National Park Service is investigating the desecration of an archaeological site in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, and the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe is hoping to bring those responsible to justice. The Skagit Valley Herald reports evidence of digging was found over the summer at the Newhalem Rock Shelter camp used by the ancestors of the Upper Skagit tribe. We were shocked and dismayed that someone would do something like this at a cultural site, the tribe's Natural Resources Director Scott Schuyler said. Some of these places are thousands of years old, and the fact that someone would want to come in and purposely destroy, damage or steal, it's just unbelievable. The tribe is working with the Park Service on the investigation and offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to those responsible.
Nashville: The state Senate started the 2020 legislative session passing its first bill of the year: a controversial measure that protects religious adoption agencies if they choose to discriminate against same-sex couples. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Paul Rose, R-Covington, declares that no licensed adoption agency would be required to participate in a child placement if doing so would violate the agency's written religious or moral convictions or policies. It also prohibits the state from denying an agency's license or grant application for public funds because of the group's refusal to place a child with a family based on religious objections. The adoption agency would also be protected from lawsuits for such a refusal. The Senate passed the bill 20-6, with five Republican members declining to vote on the measure, including Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge. The House passed the bill in April, and it now heads to Gov. Bill Lee for his signature.

If Mr. Biden cannot reach a deal with Senate Republicans, this package could still pass under reconciliation, a process sometimes used for spending measures. Under this approach, the bill would require only a simple majority to pass and would not be subject to being blocked by a filibuster. Most Senate bills require 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. This option would be used pass the Biden team's framework with only Democratic votes. Once the Georgia Senate election results are certified, there will be a 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would break any ties. With Harris as the 51st vote, Democrats will control the Senate.

It doesn't seem likely that these kinds of claims will substantively change the ultimate sentence for him.

JAMELLE BOUIE: --past versus a kind of suspicion based on this country's history with racism--
Hartford: The Democratic speaker of the state House says lawmakers should consider whether to ban Native American athletic nicknames and symbols at public high schools after one school restored its Redmen mascot just months after dropping it. I'd like to see a bill introduced to have a public hearing and have the discussion, Joe Aresimowicz told the Hartford Courant. The school board in Killingly voted in June to drop the high school's Redmen nickname and then replaced it with Red Hawks in October. The board, with an infusion of new Republican members, restored Redmen last month. Aresimowicz called the mascot highly offensive. Across the state, 19 public high schools use Native American-themed nicknames or imagery. Opponents of such names say they are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. The defenders of Native mascots and symbols say they are signs of respect.

In most divorce cases, especially in California which is a community property state, couples are instructed to divide their shared assets down the middle (in monetary terms) and, as part of that settlement, they're allowed to keep what they own personally, such as clothing and jewelry. In your state, you take out of the marriage what you brought into it, but this grows more complicated when a home has appreciated during a marriage and/or when marital assets were used to pay the mortgage (even though, in this case, your husband never actually worked). I'm not against your giving a little money to your parents if they need it for a specific reason, but not to hide it before your divorce is over. If you do have to split those savings, $10,000 is a small price to pay for your freedom. (Interestingly, I told a similar thing to a fellow earlier this week, who learned a $10,000 lesson.) One more consideration: You may need that $10,000 in savings for legal fees.

— For the FDA, the shutdown means the agency hasn't been able to accept some new applications for drugs or medical devices.

But the agency can accept new regulatory submissions that don't require a fee.

Hardwick: The COVID-19 vaccination program for residents 75 or older began Wednesday at a number of locations across the state. Registration opened Monday for people in the age group, and by Wednesday morning more than 29,000 people had signed up. A clinic held in the gymnasium at Hazen Union High School in Hardwick gave its first inoculation about 9 a.m. With three vaccination stations, officials hoped to vaccinate 150 people the first day, said Valerie Valcour, the public health nurse running the clinic. We are working through some of the little kinks, but I think it's working smoothly overall, she said. An estimated 49,000 people in Vermont are over 75.

Houston: A federal judge on Tuesday expressed frustration over what she saw as a lack of progress in efforts to try to relieve overcrowding at Texas' largest county jail, where some inmates have described the facility as a metal can of contagion amid worries about a potential COVID-19 outbreak. Concerns about the Harris County Jail were raised this month by Sheriff Ed Gonzalez after its population ballooned to more than 9,000 inmates, leaving little room to quarantine prisoners who test positive for the virus or to separate new inmates when they first arrive. The jail population had only dropped to about 8,800 inmates as of Tuesday, with most awaiting trial. U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal, presiding over a lawsuit that accuses the county's felony bail system of keeping poor defendants locked up only because they can't afford to pay a bond, had asked the sheriff's office, prosecutors, public defenders and state court judges to see if some inmates facing low level, nonviolent felony charges and who were being held on bonds of $10,000 or less could be eligible for bond reductions. But the Harris County District Attorney's Office said it would only agree to bond reductions in 60 of 1,500 identified cases.

My goal in these hearings is two things, one is to get an answer to Colonel Vindman's question. And the second, coming out of this, is for us, as a Congress, to return to the Ukraine policy that Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy both support. It's not investigations, it's the restoration of democracy in Ukraine and the resistance of Russian aggression. I yield back.
In other words, this is the bus that will hold contents of the next COVID package -- and allow it to bypass filibusters.
►Public schools that have another type of federal tax-exempt status are currently subject to the excise tax, but the new guidance also says these schools may voluntarily relinquish that status, although doing so might still leave them subject to the excise tax. Alabama, Michigan, UCLA and at least a dozen other public schools in Power Five conferences are in this group, according to documents posted on the schools' websites. Alabama football coach Nick Saban's $8.3 million in basic compensation, plus $875,000 in bonuses, for this season means the school faces more than $1.7 million in excise tax for him alone.

The overall message from Wisconsin is of a contrary mood, an impatience with more traditional candidates and a deep undercurrent of economic dismay. Most specifically, Wisconsin signaled a massive discontent with taxes and inflation -- the pocketbook issues that McGovern and Wallace hit the hardest. In a study of TIME, the attitude research firm of Daniel Yankelovich Inc. found that four of the five top issues that influenced Wisconsin voters were economic. The sixth was the Vietnam War, and McGovern made that into an economic issue as well, emphasizing its continuing costs. According to the survey, 82% of those interviewed said that the Administration's wage and price policies are not working. Fifty-two percent called for overall tax reform, with 41% complaining about high prices and 36% about high unemployment. McGovern and Humphrey both hammered away on the issue of tax reform, of giving the little taxpayer and the working man a fairer break. They shared the rewards: well over half of McGovern's voters and almost two-thirds of Wallace's assailed tax loopholes. The issue cut across both party and ideological grounds, attracting liberals as well as conservatives, Republicans as well as Democrats. The Yankelovich pollsters found a surprising degree of second-choice support for McGovern among the Wallace voters -- support rooted in McGovern's broad anti-Establishment campaign. It was not that Wisconsin voters were running to ideological extremes at the expense of centrist candidates, but rather that both McGovern and Wallace seem to have located an authentic area of concern that the other candidates failed to articulate.
One trick for collecting personal information through the mail is sending postcards with a QR code and asking recipients to scan the code with their smartphones in order to access the census survey on a webpage, according to Rachel Willson, investigative coordinator in client relations for The Smith Investigation Agency.

Americans are dying in greater numbers this year, and not just because of the virus. A casket sat in an empty room at a funeral home in Los Angeles on Sunday. Credit... Alex Welsh for The New York Times Deaths from all causes rose sharply during the second quarter of 2020 as the pandemic took hold in the United States, reaching levels last seen 75 years ago, according to provisional figures released on Thursday by the National Center for Health Statistics. Over all, the unadjusted death rate for all Americans rose to 1,033.7 per 100,000 in the second quarter of 2020, up from 850.8 per 100,000 Americans during the second quarter of 2019. The last time the death rate exceeded that figure was in 1945, the year World War II ended, when there were 1,058 deaths for every 100,000 Americans. Rates had steadily declined since then, said Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch of the center. The overall death rate attributed specifically to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was 136.2 deaths per 100,000 Americans during the three months of April, May and June of 2020. But deaths from several other leading causes, including diabetes, stroke, heart disease and hypertension, also increased. Since March, at least 400,000 more Americans have died than would have in a normal year. Deaths related to cancer, which have been declining for some time, continued to drop. The new figures also highlight the unique threat that Covid-19 poses to men.

American arts institutions ought not to give up their independence for crumbs. For now, especially as the pandemic subsides, the more urgent task is to encourage a richer cultural offering at the local level.

Minneapolis: The state's voters on Friday became some of the first in the country to cast ballots in the presidential primaries as early voting began for the Super Tuesday contest. Eligible Minnesota voters can now vote at county courthouses across the state and early voting stations in some cities, and they can also request absentee ballots for the March 3 primary. But the votes won't be counted until primary night. Fifteen candidates are on the Democratic ballot, even though some already have dropped out of the race. The GOP ballot lists only President Donald Trump, though write-in votes are allowed. It's Minnesota's first presidential primary since 1992 after years of using precinct caucuses to kick off the process of selecting national convention delegates. Voters must request either a Democratic or Republican ballot, and their names will be shared with the state's major parties.

Nashville: Gov. Bill Lee will introduce legislation this year that would amend a law requiring the state to honor Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Lee's office confirmed Friday that the Republican, who has previously expressed his displeasure over the honor, was working on the bill. The office did not provide further details. According to the law in question, Tennessee governors must sign six proclamations throughout the year designating as days of special observance Robert E. Lee Day (Jan. 19), Abraham Lincoln Day (Feb. 12), Andrew Jackson Day (March 15), Confederate Decoration Day (June 3), Nathan Bedford Forrest Day (July 13) and Veterans Day (Nov. 11). Lee received national backlash in July when signed the Nathan Bedford Forrest proclamation and declined to answer questions about whether he thought the law should change. Lee later clarified that he didn't like signing the proclamation and would prefer to see the law changed.

At one point, they recall, Nix explained that the National Rifle Association's database of members would be a valuable way to target donors. Wilson typed an emoji with rolling eyes next to the statement because it was so obvious. He told people that he came away thinking, Red flag, red flag, red flag. In response to an extensive set of questions, Nix disputed this account of the meeting. He denied that Cambridge Analytica had obtained any data via Facebook—a source of controversy for the firm ever since The Guardian reported in 2015 that CA based its data on research spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission. Nix also claimed that it was the Cruz team that didn't have access to the RNC's Data Trust for much of the cycle and that all data used for the majority of the campaign was provided by Cambridge Analytica. However, Mike Shields, then the RNC's chief of staff and Data Trust's senior adviser, told me the Cruz campaign was in fact the second to sign an agreement with Data Trust, in 2014. Meanwhile, the red flags kept coming. Wilson found the data scientists that CA sent to Houston to be highly efficient at the day-to-day work of his research operation. But according to Cruz staffers, when he began to test CA's specialized models, he found that they were notably off, with, for example, some male voters miscategorized as women.

It was hot - but the heat was passion, and not anger. It was a roller coaster - but it made me a better candidate, and it will make me a stronger president of the United States. I do not envy the drowsy harmony of the Republican Party. They squelch debate; we welcome it. They deny differences; we bridge them. The are uniform; we are united. They are a portrait of privilege; we are a mirror of America.

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act barred workers from deducting unreimbursed work expenses — anything from news subscriptions to business travel to union dues — from their income. Jegede suggests that anyone who spent money on their work-from-home set up ask if their employer can reimburse the cost. The business can deduct it, but the employee can't, she noted.
Participants in Moderna's early clinical trials are being offered a booster shot. A nurse administering the Moderna vaccine in New York. Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times People who received two shots of the Moderna Covid vaccine in its earliest, Phase 1 clinical trial are being offered a third shot, a so-called booster, as part of a continuing study to determine whether repeated vaccinations are needed, and whether they are safe and effective, the company said on Thursday. The vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer, both using genetic material called mRNA, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19 when administered as a two-shot regimen. But they have not been in use long enough to tell how long the immunity lasts, or whether additional booster shots will be needed. We anticipate that an additional dose could further boost the levels of neutralizing antibodies, should such a boost be required, and that this is expected to be an advantage of mRNA vaccines, Colleen Hussey, a Moderna spokeswoman, said in a statement. Neutralizing antibodies are made by the immune system in response to a virus or a vaccine and can block the virus from breaking into cells. The company's statement said the boosters were being offered to participants six to 12 months after their second shot. Volunteers in early trials received different doses of the vaccine, as part of the company's attempts to calibrate the most effective amount of active ingredient to use.

Recent research supports this thesis. For example, a working paper published last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research reports that increases in the enrollment of foreign students generate substantial gains in university tuition revenues, which partially offset the loss in appropriations [from state funding cuts]. The report concludes that in the absence of the pool of foreign students, many universities would have faced larger cuts to expenditures and potentially greater increases in in-state tuition charges.

And the thing I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it's good for the party. I frankly think it's good for the country. Let's look at the bold ideas. And I'm eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend the status quo, then do it. If there's not merit, let's explore new ideas.

While it's one thing to list $5,000 in charitable contributions with a $60,000 income, if you claim a $15,000 deduction, it's apt to look suspicious. Of course, if you're looking at an exceptionally high deduction that's perfectly legitimate, by all means, claim it — just be sure to have meticulous documentation to back it up, because chances are, the IRS will ask for it.

But there is no federal system that people can use to get easy access to their immunization records online and establish their vaccination status for work or travel. A few airlines, including United Airlines and JetBlue, are trying Common Pass, a health passport app from the Commons Project. The app enables passengers to retrieve their virus test results from their health providers and then gives them a confirmation code that allows them to board certain international flights. The vaccination credentialing system would work similarly. The U.S. vaccination program has been stymied by logistical hurdles as states scramble to set up new systems for booking appointments. Demand is high, but the rollout has been progressing far more slowly than hoped, marred by crashing servers, busy signals and confusion. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday that about 11.1 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, far short of the goal federal officials set to give at least 20 million people their first shots before the end of 2020. At least 541,000 people in the United States have been fully vaccinated as of Jan. 12, according to a New York Times survey of all 50 states.

San Diego: A troop of gorillas at San Diego Zoo Safari Park appears to be recovering from the coronavirus – including a 49-year-old silverback who received antibody therapy – in what is believed to be the first known cases among such primates. The western lowland gorillas were infected with a variant that has been circulating in California and is believed to be more contagious than other strains, the safari park said Monday in a statement. Some gorillas showed symptoms including mild coughing, congestion and intermittent lethargy. The silverback named Winston had pneumonia, likely caused by the virus, as well as heart disease. He has been more active since being put on antibiotics and heart medication, as well as receiving an antibody treatment – a therapy to block the virus from infecting cells, San Diego Zoo Safari Park said in a statement. We're not seeing any of that lethargy. No coughing, no runny noses anymore, the park's executive director Lisa Peterson told the San Diego Union-Tribune, adding that the animals' fecal matter is no longer testing positive for the virus. It feels to us like we've turned the corner.

Boise: State health care leaders are pressing federal officials to explain why Idaho was allotted far fewer doses of COVID-19 vaccine than most other states. Numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show Idaho has been distributed vaccine at a rate of 10,298 doses for every 100,000 residents, less per capita than any state but South Carolina. We've reached out to the new administration to lodge our concern, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said Tuesday. Officials with the Biden' administration told Jeppesen they weren't sure why Idaho's distribution was lower but would look into it, he said. Demand for the limited doses has been high and is expected to increase dramatically Feb. 1, when Idaho residents 65 and older will become eligible. It's been impossible for public health officials to adequately track whether the priority group guidelines have been followed correctly or whether some traditionally disadvantaged populations have been offered the vaccine at equitable rates. The legislation that created Idaho's voluntary immunization tracking system doesn't allow the state to collect some demographic information, including race or ethnicity and profession.
The Internal Revenue Service will start accepting tax returns from individual taxpayers on Monday, kicking off the filing season when more than 150 million returns are expected to be processed. If this year resembles last, most taxpayers who receive refunds will get back about $2,800 on average. You'll have until April 15 to submit your returns for 2019 and pay any taxes you owe, with automatic extensions to Oct. 15 available. The IRS is touting the benefits of filing returns electronically, including automatic flagging of some common errors and reminders to supply missing information.
Raleigh: The state has overpaid tens of millions of dollars in jobless benefits since the COVID-19 pandemic began to people who don't actually qualify for them or have committed fraud, North Carolina's unemployment program director told legislators Tuesday. Pryor Gibson, who leads the Division of Employment Security, described how nearly $70 million had been overpaid during the first nine months of 2020. Nearly all of that total was distributed since the virus lockdowns sent claims rocketing to historic levels. The overpayments remain a small percentage of the $8 billion in federal and state unemployment benefits distributed in North Carolina during all of 2020. That compares to $160 million in benefits paid overall in 2019, when the state unemployment rate fell below 4%. In 2019, the division reported nearly $7 million in overpayments. Overpayments can happen due to fraud or unintentional mistakes that lead a person to receive benefits to which they aren't entitled, Gibson said. The division reported that $9 million in benefits since March 31 have been paid out due to identity theft.

For example, homeowners with $100,000 in equity in their home (after paying off all debt, taxes, fees, etc.), should factor in an additional cost of $3,000 to $5,000 per year, depending on what the expected return on capital might be.

Jasper: Police are looking for a man who disguised himself as Batman while stealing musical instruments from churches. A burglary happened Dec. 11 at King's Way Church in Irondale, AL.com reports. The caped crook stole a keyboard and a guitar, according to Irondale Detective Sgt. Michael Mangina. The suspect came back to the same church Jan. 6 and stole two more guitars. Both times the impostor used a rock to enter the church, Mangina said. On Jan. 9, two churches in Jasper and one in unincorporated Walker County were also burglarized, Jasper police wrote on Facebook. Musical instruments and electronics were also stolen. Anyone with information can call Irondale police, Jasper police or the Walker County Sheriff's Office. We have to take this bad guy off the streets, Mangina said. Stealing from a church is not the way to get to heaven.

Trump's failure to codify his preferred policies through legislation, relying instead on a black Sharpie marker to scrawl his signature onto executive actions and then show them off for the cameras, left them vulnerable to Biden's signature on countermanding orders. And so far, the new president has signed dozens of them ― albeit with a ballpoint pen and less flourish, but every bit as effective ― wiping out much of Trump's legacy in a matter of days.

As the tax code currently stands, the richest individuals pay almost 40 percent on individual income (or less after deductions). Businesses pay a separate rate, which Trump wishes to set at 15 percent. Most importantly, the proposal outlined by the Trump Administration has this latter rate being applied to all businesses, including pass-through organizations like S corporations that distribute a salary to employee-owners and count the rest as profits. Under the current law, personal income and business income is taxed roughly the same, but if Trump succeeds, many folks may aim to establish mini-corporations for themselves to get their taxes down to 15 percent.

In 1990 I published an article entitled Why Political Risk Insurance Will Grow in the 1990s. At that time, the former Soviet Union had recently disintegrated, the Gulf War was about to commence, and there was general uncertainty about where the world was headed. I predicted at that time that political risk insurance (PRI) would grow dramatically because of enhanced demand. Indeed, it did. The PRI industry stands at a similar precipice today. With the looming possibility of trade wars, a deterioration in investment climates, and ever tightening lending standards, there is every reason to believe that, as much as the industry has grown - and that growth has been dramatic over the past 25 years - it also stands to grow dramatically in the coming 5-10 years.

Seattle: Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday touted big improvements in distributing COVID-19 vaccines, but he also urged residents to remain vigilant as new, more contagious variants of the coronavirus spread in the state. Inslee said more than 36,000 doses were administered in Washington on Sunday and 39,000 on Monday – a big jump from about 16,000 a week earlier and on the way toward the state's goal of 45,000 a day. The number of vaccines actually administered could be even higher, given lags in reporting, but as of Monday more than 500,000 doses had been administered statewide, with four mass vaccination sites due to open this week. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the federal government is boosting vaccine supplies to the states by 16% over the next three weeks, giving states more certainty about upcoming deliveries than the one-week notice the Trump administration had been providing. The shipments will also contain specially designed syringes to squeeze an additional dose out of vials of Pfizer vaccines. Still, problems persist, including that due to shortages many of the people now eligible for the vaccine, including everyone over 65, have had trouble finding appointments.

In other words, the lousy education that Los Angeles public schools provides actually costs taxpayers more than sending students to most private schools.

Nashville: The state government at one point expected to get as many as 400,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses from the Trump administration's supposed reserve, which would've been a windfall for a state with untapped distribution capacity and limited supply, Tennessee's top health official confirmed. Instead, state leaders were stunned earlier this month when it was revealed the federal reserve was empty. Tennessee got no surge of doses from the release of the reserve and, separately, is still waiting for increased vaccine supplies that federal officials promised would start this week, said Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey. We had calculated internally, just internal calculations, that we could get up to 400,000 – like this big (influx) of 400,000 doses, she said. And it turns out, nah, that didn't happen.Tennessee's vaccine shortage is some of the latest fallout from the chaotic end of the Trump administration. Then-Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, in one of his final news interviews in the job, told NBC News on Jan. 15 that the stockpile was empty because the Trump administration already released those doses to states.

Adolescents and teenagers between ages 10 and 19 were more likely than younger children to spread the variant, but not as likely as adults.

The variant is not necessarily affecting children particularly, but we know that it's adding on more transmissibility to all age groups, Dr. Cevik said. We need to find ways to return these kids back to school as soon as possible; we need to use this time period to prepare. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain had promised last year to do all he could to keep schools open. But he changed course in the face of soaring infections and buckling hospital systems, and ordered schools and colleges to move to remote learning. Other European countries put a premium on opening schools in September and have worked to keep them open, though the variant already has forced some to close. In the United States, the mutant virus has been spotted only in a handful of states but is expected to spread swiftly, becoming the predominant source of infections by March. If community prevalence rises to unmanageable levels — a likely proposition, given the surge in most states — even elementary schools may be forced to close. But that should be a last resort, after closures of indoor restaurants, bars, bowling alleys and malls, several experts said.
In revoking this permit, the Biden Administration has chosen to listen to the voices of fringe activists instead of union members and the American consumer on Day 1.

The slowest states to roll out vaccines are in the South. A training session for coronavirus testers in West Virginia. Credit... Kristian Thacker for The New York Times Several states in the American South have been the slowest in the country to roll out Covid-19 vaccines. Georgia has faced a raft of logistical and bureaucratic snags. In South Carolina, the governor gave reluctant health care workers until Friday to get their shots or risk losing their priority status. And Alabama has the distinction of administering the fewest vaccines per capita in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This was a herculean effort, said Dr. Karen Landers, the assistant state health officer for the Alabama Department of Health. It has been a challenge. And, of course, it's disappointing that we're not where we need to be. Alabama has stuck to vaccinating health care workers and nursing home residents and staff and will not officially start vaccinating people 75 and older until Monday, though some counties have started earlier. South Carolina officials, too, have acknowledged disappointment. We are frustrated, Gov. Henry McMaster said last week, giving health care workers 10 days to get their vaccine appointments. And we are determined to eliminate the bottlenecks that are slowing this down. West Virginia, by contrast, has fared much better, administering the most vaccines per capita out of any state in the country.
I am a great fan of Catherine Rampell's columns and loved her Dec. 25 op-ed celebrating her sixth-grade teacher, Priceless lessons from my sixth-grade English teacher.

The confusion is hardly limited to California. In New York City, a million residents who are over 65 became eligible to be vaccinated this week, but the reality of actually getting a shot has proved maddening, with buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems and a lack outreach. California, with its decentralized public health system, is a microcosm of the many problems plaguing the national vaccination effort. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti defended the decision to limit vaccinations for now to health workers, despite the state's new directive. This is really about expectations, he said Thursday. Politically, it'd be easy to say, open it up to 65-plus. But he said that would mean that a senior citizen on the city's wealthier west side, living in a large house, could easily take a spot from an essential worker who's younger and living in a crowded home, with no room to isolate. And so when health care workers in Los Angeles arrive at a vaccination site, like the one the city is set to open at Dodger Stadium on Friday, they'll have to present either an employee badge with a photo or another form of documentation of their work. California relies on county health departments like the one in Los Angeles to administer vaccines, and Dr. David Lubarsky, the chief executive of UC Davis Health, said the counties were up against the same problem they faced when trying to ramp up coronavirus testing: too little manpower.
The report also claims $450 billion in consumer benefits over the next 10 years based on broader availability of less costly insurance options, reduced taxpayer spending on subsidies, and the cancelled fines. But it acknowledges that premiums will go up for some middle- and upper-income consumers.
We can also improve on the process of developing a vaccine. As Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar testified recently, we don't know whether a vaccine will be affordable because the holder of the patent will be able to charge whatever it wants.

They might be able to save money through refinancing. Though, generally, if they have a high interest rate, they might be able to get a lower interest rate if their credit score has improved a lot since they borrowed the money. If they don't qualify for a lower rate on a private consolidation loan, they're unlikely to qualify for a home loan with a lower rate.
The clemency proposition is not new. In late 2016, before Trump was inaugurated, Garcia and others feared the new president would launch draconian deportations of undocumented immigrants – especially those brought to the United States as children, called Dreamers based on never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act.

The recently enacted U.S. tax law restricts federal deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) to $10,000 — including local property and sales taxes as well as local income taxes.

Here, Sanders cites a newspaper clip of Biden in a debate with a Republican challenger. The solvency of Social Security was considered an urgent issue at the time, given the pending retirement of the baby boom generation, and Republicans promoted ideas such as allowing Americans to divert Social Security moneys into private investment accounts. Biden's challenger supported that idea. In the debate, Biden countered that there were less dramatic ways to find savings in Social Security such as reducing the interest rate to calculate cost of living benefits or boosting the retirement age by a year.

As even casual visitors to Washington D.C. can attest, there are no multi-thousand acre tracts of active farmland or forests in the Nation's Capital. These features perform an invaluable environmental function in that they absorb rainwater and prevent it from gushing into - and polluting - lakes and streams. And so, rainwater, especially its virulent form, called stormwater, is a major nightmare for the District. So much so that the District, specifically its water/wastewater utility, called DC Water, has been working through a 25+ year solutioning process with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over what to do with the billions of gallons of stormwater that the District must deal with whenever there is a major rainstorm.

Middle-class exodus: From 2007 to 2016, California lost a net million residents — some 2.5% of its population (which still grows due to births and immigration).

With homeowners and small business owners — the Republican base — leaving, Democrats and their policies become entrenched, though the state may lose a congressional seat after the Census.
California just made it easier for people to get vaccinated. For many, it feels harder than ever. Credit... Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times Gov. Gavin Newsom's announcement on Wednesday seemed sweeping: California would open up eligibility for a coronavirus vaccine to anyone 65 or older, effectively abandoning a rollout plan that was meant to ensure that the most vulnerable would be first in line. A day later, residents of the vast and varied state were trying to navigate what many described as vaccination chaos. Some counties shifted gears immediately, among them Orange County, which said anyone 65 or older could book an appointment at the vaccination site it opened this week at Disneyland. But the scheduling website was quickly overwhelmed, making finding a shot seem like trying to score Taylor Swift concert tickets. Neighboring Los Angeles County, however, stuck with its strict priority rules, and said that vaccines there would continue to be available only to health care workers. The dueling approaches illustrate the tension across the country between two competing imperatives: getting as many doses as possible out quickly, and getting those who are at the most risk protected first. As of Thursday, about 11.1 million people in the U.S. had received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a figure that is far short of the 20 million the Trump administration had hoped to reach by Dec. 31. Most have received only the first of the two necessary doses so far.

(Clockwise, starting top right) Jeff Roe, Ted Cruz, Alexander Nix All modern political campaigns have to balance their need for exorbitant sums of money with the obsessions of the people who want to give them that money. Roe, the straight-talking manager of the Cruz operation, has observed that running a campaign is like trying to solve a Rubik's cube of complicated personalities and uncomfortable dependencies. He has also told people that he is careful not to get too close to the donors who make his campaigns possible, because they can be so easily annoyed by the most trivial of things—his laugh, for instance, or the way he eats a bread roll. In the case of the Cruz campaign, the donor obsession in question was Cambridge Analytica. And it wasn't long before Roe and his team suspected that Nix had promised them a more impressive product than he could deliver. On March 4, 2015, Cruz, Roe, Wilson and others gathered in the Hyatt in Washington D.C. for an all-day meeting with Nix and a group of CA senior executives. Wilson took notes on his computer. According to multiple members of the Cruz team, Wilson was dismayed to learn that CA's models weren't fully ready for his focus groups the following week. As far as the team could tell, the only data CA possessed that the campaign didn't already have appeared to be culled from Facebook. In addition, they recalled, CA hadn't set itself up with Data Trust, the Republican National Committee's repository of voter information.

Realism before next fall should also lead to some stock-taking among Democrats.

As Columbia professor (and avowed liberal) Mark Lilla once wrote, Democrats became obsessed with the national media and the presidency rather than the daily task of winning over people at the local level.

There are signals the industry's influence is waning, after it recently failed in its bid to reverse steeper payments for drugs in Medicare's so-called doughnut hole, the coverage gap for seniors. And overlaying all of this are surprisingly aggressive efforts by the Trump administration to lower prescription drug costs in the Medicare program, some of which were outlined in its drug pricing blueprint.

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Randy Rainbow. He writes and performs song parodies about President Trump and his administration. Rainbow uses the melodies of show tunes and pop hits and writes original lyrics. His YouTube videos were just nominated for an Emmy for outstanding short-form variety series.
Little of this description is accurate. Obama's $800 billion bill was equivalent to about 5.5% of U.S. economic output in 2008; New Deal spending amounted to around 70% of the economy the year before Franklin D. Roosevelt took office. There is no doubt the Great Recession would have been worse without Obama's bill, but it was not transformational legislation.

There are strict rules for utilizing the budget reconciliation process, such as the Byrd rule, which requires that all provisions in the bill be budget-related, and must not increase the federal deficit after a 10-year budget window. Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled that the minimum wage hike did not fit the parameters for budget reconciliation.
Eligibility for the full stimulus payment last year included an income of $75,000 or less for a single person and $150,000 or less for a married couple; people who earned above those amounts may have qualified for a reduced payment. If you fell within the income brackets but didn't get a payment, you'll want to claim it on your tax return. If you earned too much to qualify based on 2019 but your 2020 income was lower, filing your tax return will allow you to get a payment based on your 2020 income. And if you had a child last year, you'll qualify for a back payment of $500 or $600 (or potentially both) if you haven't already received the dependent payment.
Don't rush to pay anyone. You don't want to think you're clearing up a financial mess only to find out that you handed over your hard earned cash to a crook.
Normally, a taxpayer's income in the prior year will determine if they can claim the EITC. But the credit typically applies only to money earned from work. Unemployment benefits, though they are subject to federal income tax, don't count as earned benefits for the purposes of the EITC or CTC.

One problem is that investors in popular exchange traded funds (ETFs) and index funds haven't really researched the underlying stocks they hold. So they may lack the conviction to stick with them when the going gets rough. That could compound the selling.
D'SOUZA: I think it is just sheer cognitive dissonance, because these are people who have been bombarded with anti-Trump propaganda. And so then when they see Trump at the State of the Union recite this litany of great things one after the other -- a strong economy, an economy that is disproportionately benefiting the working class and African-Americans and other minorities, it's almost as if, how can that be? And so a certain kind of dissonance I think creeps in which you are forced to deny the facts in order to support the hypothesis that you have been force-fed over many, many years.

We are following a number of breaking stories this morning.
JENNINGS: Yeah. I think Senator Romney, Senator-elect Romney is doing what he said he would do during the campaign. I recall back in the summer, he wrote in The Salt Lake Tribune that he was going to speak out when the president does things that he doesn't like. He said he was not going to speak out on every tweet, but that if the president is acting in a way he doesn't approve of, he won't hesitate to speak out. I think he's also doing what a lot of Republicans do, which is separate policy from behavior and style. And that is not something that is unique to Mitt Romney. A lot of Republican voters did that when they voted for Donald Trump in 2016. So Mitt Romney has a six-year term, and he represents a state that won't mind if he tackles the president every now and again. And I expect he'll keep doing that.
A lot of people haven't lived through a recession before, Broumand says. And this is the dangerous part. It's been such a long time, people might not be able to recognize the signs.

New York: The city's policing of subway fare beaters is drawing scrutiny from the state's attorney general for possible racial bias. Letitia James announced Monday that her office is investigating the New York Police Department's fare-enforcement practices after the department released new data showing black and Hispanic people account for the vast majority of its fare-related summonses and arrests. James' office sent a letter to the police commissioner Monday seeking additional data, such as the number of officers assigned to each subway station each day – figures she said could shed light on whether officers are targeting communities of color. James, a Democrat, promised to take legal action if her office finds evidence of discrimination. NYPD spokeswoman Devora Kaye said officers patrol day and night to keep 6 million daily riders safe and enforce the law fairly and equally without consideration of race or ethnicity.

Pierre: Gov. Kristi Noem was the sixth-most-unpopular governor in the country in the final months of 2019, according to the Morning Consult's latest polling. Forty-five percent of South Dakotans surveyed disapproved of the job Noem was doing as governor, and 43% approved, while 12% said they didn't know, according to the 2019 fourth-quarter governors poll released Thursday by Morning Consult, a research services company. The poll had a 3% margin of error. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Thune was among the top 10 most popular senators in the Morning Consult's 2019 fourth-quarter poll. Thune had an approval rating of 52%, and U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds had an approval rating of 50%, with a 3% margin of error, according to Morning Consult. Both of their Morning Consult approval ratings have remained in the low- to mid-50s range throughout 2019.
COSTELLO: Sure. And in fairness, I saw a poll today that - where those numbers may have gone down a little bit, but your point is a good one, and that is notwithstanding just how absolutely horrible and how much of a stain last week was on the history of our country and the president's role in it. And I think that it's one thing to speak about tax cuts and regulatory reform and speak to the ideological pillars that the party has been known for. It's another thing when the rhetoric and sort of, frankly, you know, the offensiveness of things that he would say from time to time points in such a manner that it leads to violence.

Savannah: An endangered newborn right whale spotted with grievous injuries to its head off the state's coast is unlikely to survive, though scientists may try to inject the calf with antibiotics using a syringe fired from an air gun if they can safely get close enough, government experts said Monday. Foggy weather along the coast was delaying efforts to relocate the wounded baby whale and its mother by plane. The calf was first seen from the air last Wednesday, and a boat crew got close enough Friday near St. Simons Island for scientists to conclude its injuries were worse than initially feared. Scientists estimate 400 or fewer North Atlantic right whales still exist. Dr. Teri Rowles, a veterinarian for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said the wounds were likely caused by the propeller of a boat.

Indianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb has declared Jan. 27 Eva Education Day in honor of the late Eva Kor, the Holocaust survivor who dedicated much of her life to educating the world about the experiments of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. Jan. 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where Kor and her twin sister, Miriam, were subjected to Mengele's experiments. The Terre Haute woman's experience was chronicled in a documentary titled Eva: A-7063. That film is part of an Eva Educational Toolkit that has been distributed to every middle school and high school in Indiana. Kor died July 4, 2019, while conducting her annual group tour of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland.

The flag is etched with the victims' names from the June crash in Randolph. A presentation by the Ride for Fallen 7 Foundation is scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the state Incident Planning and Operations Center, where the flag will be displayed. The building houses agencies from the safety and transportation departments. An estimated 3,000 motorcycles, with 4,500 riders from around the country, took part in the Ride for the Fallen 7 in July.

As noted above, student loans relative to private mortgage rates, can often be a better deal. Federal Stafford Loans for undergraduate students have a low fixed rate, currently 3.76 percent, noted Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Cappex, a college decision site. They are unlikely to qualify for a lower rate on a mortgage. You lose federal loan breaks if you can't pay. The federal loan program has a surprising number of generous provisions if you're sick, disabled or can't pay back your loan.  Federal student loans offer significant benefits that aren't standard with mortgages, such as death and disability discharges, economic hardship deferments, forbearances, income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness options, said Kantrowitz.

Monica Nelson, a retired nurse from Newburyport, told The Boston Globe she spent two hours trying to get her 75-year-old husband a slot with no luck. She called the rollout a disaster. Syracuse University student Ghael Fobes, on the other hand, logged on just after midnight and was able to make appointments for his grandparents. State health officials urged patience, warning that it may take several weeks to get an appointment and that as more vaccine supply arrives, additional appointments will become available. Once vaccinations are completed for residents 75 and older, those who are older than 65, and those with two chronic illnesses or medical conditions will be eligible.

Contribute to a health savings account. If you have a health insurance plan with a high deductible, you can open an HSA. These accounts allow pretax contributions, which grow tax deferred. And withdrawals used to pay qualifying medical expenses are tax-free. The 2018 HSA contribution limit is $3,450 for individuals and $6.900 for families (those 55 and older can contribute an additional $1,000).

That way it nets out to zero taxable income on their return, Smith said. I am hopeful this will work. He also plans to attach a disclosure to the return explaining the situation.
A quick reminder of the difference between tax credits and tax deductions: Credit reduces the amount you owe in taxes dollar-for-dollar, making them generally more valuable than deductions. A deduction reduces the amount of your income on which you have to pay taxes, so its value to you will depend on what tax bracket you fall into.
BIANCULLI: Alec Baldwin speaking to Terry Gross in 2017. He's nominated this year for a guest actor Emmy Award for his portrayal of President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live. After a break, we'll hear from another of this year's Emmy nominees, Brian Tyree Henry nominated for two Emmys.

The subcommittee vote doesn't necessarily mean that the tampon tax bill is dead. The legislators voted to give it a negative rating when it advances to the full committee, while SB 1610 received a positive rating. So in theory, the full 11-member committee could decide to buck the subcommittee members.
I don't care about Mr. Yenni's sexual preference (male or female). It makes absolutely no difference to me. However, the fact that Mr. Yenni did this with a minor, regardless of the age of consent in LA (17 y.o.a.), is very disturbing to me and many others. The fact that Mr. Yenni met his victim at an alumni function held by Mr. Yenni's Alma Mater, which is the same school the victim attended at the time (Jesuit High School), is very disturbing to me and many others. Many people believe Mr. Yenni used his power and influence to gain access to the 17 year old boy in question, and that he has used his power and influence to attempt to gain access to other minors. I am being told by members of Mr. Yenni's own family that there is much more to this story than simply sending inappropriate texts to a young man, as Mr. Yenni put it in his recent apology video.

Wilson: Wilson County plans to add four new historical markers this year to commemorate African American heroes, including a 1946 effort to organize tobacco workers. Called Operation Dixie, the unionization effort was led by black women demanding better working conditions in the tobacco industry. The state unveiled a historical marker in Rocky Mount in 2011. The local chapter of the Tobacco Workers International Union formed in Wilson in 1946. Other markers to be unveiled in Wilson this year will honor the Wilson Normal and Industrial Institute, Dr. Frank S. Hargrave, and Charles H. Darden, the Wilson Times reports. The marker for Hargrave describes him as the founder of Mercy Hospital, which treated African Americans in an era when even hospitals were segregated by race. In 1914, he was elected president of the National Medical Association, which was the African American equivalent of the American Medical Association.

A federal judge in New York, who presided over the two lead lawsuits about the question, has ordered the administration to stop plans to include it on forms for the head count. But the administration – which is facing five other citizenship question lawsuits — wants the Supreme Court to let the question stay.

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children, the Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Senior Nutrition Program will receive supplemental funding to assist Americans affected by the virus. The package also provides funding for state waivers to pay for meals for children who normally receive them at school. Emergency family and sick leave: Employees of companies with fewer than 500 employees and government staffers may take up to 12 weeks of protected family and medical leave, including two weeks at full pay, with any additional weeks taken with no less than two-thirds of the employee's usual pay, to either quarantine or seek preventative care. Small and mid-sized businesses would receive tax credits to pay for medical and family leave of up to 100% of the wages they pay out. Employers with fewer than 500 employees are required to provide two weeks of sick leave at full pay for employees who are seeking treatment for the virus. Self-employed individuals would also receive tax credits to receive paid leave. Workers would be eligible for paid sick leave if they have a child whose school or childcare facility is closed due to the coronavirus. These employees are required to receive not less than two-thirds of their regular pay.
Communist regimes that lack a rigid caste system rarely let locals partake in tourist activities meant for foreigners. In Cuba, for example – arguably gifted with the most lucrative tourist sites in all of the communist world – local Cubans are forced to do business in a worthless parallel currency, the Cuban peso, that is not accepted in tourist areas. Tourists use the Cuban convertible peso, which is worth the equivalent of an American dollar.
Congressional Democrats opted to use the procedural maneuver known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, allowing it to be approved by only a simple majority in the Senate. Most legislation requires 60 votes in the Senate to advance, so the budget reconciliation process allows Democrats — who hold a 50-seat majority — to pass the bill without any Republican votes.
But, after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, which significantly loosened restrictions on political spending, Rebekah decided it was time to save America from becoming like socialist Europe, as she has put it to several people. She started attending Koch events and donating to the Goldwater Institute, a right-wing think tank based in Arizona. The family's political advocacy accelerated rapidly. It was in 2012 that she really attracted attention in GOP circles when, not long after Mitt Romney lost the presidential race, she stood up before a crowd of Romney supporters at the University Club of New York and delivered a scathing but detailed diatribe about his inadequate data and canvassing operation. Who is that woman? people in attendance asked. With SCL, Rebekah finally had the chance to prove she could do better. The company's American branch was renamed Cambridge Analytica, to emphasize the pedigree of its behavioral scientists. And Rebekah started flying Alexander Nix, the firm's Old Etonian CEO, around the country to introduce him to her contacts. Nix, 41, is not a data scientist (his background is in financial services), but he is a showy salesman. Dressed in impeccably tailored suits, he is in his element on stage making presentations at large conferences. He can, however, come across as arrogant. (I love the fact that you're telling your story, but I'm the one giving the interview, he told me in a conversation.) Alexander Nix at Cambridge Analytica's New York office.

Hawley, Cruz and Trump, too, are pursuing short-term political gain at the risk of long-term chaos. Their political theater leaves something — a big something — to chance. They justify their actions as a response to the demands of their constituents. But those actions set precedents and change beliefs about what politicians can and cannot legitimately do when they don't like election results. What will happen when other politicians decide they can make up the rules as they go along? Already, the Republican majority in Pennsylvania's Senate removed the lieutenant governor from presiding on Tuesday, because they didn't want to seat a Democratic senator who had won his election. While they justified this as a response to a unique set of circumstances, they too are setting precedents that others will follow.

: We love you. But you're voting for McGovern, replied Humphrey. Said the woman: Yes, but we love Hubert Humphrey. George Wallace planned only a minimal campaign in Wisconsin, where busing was not an issue, and he had virtually no organization. But when he sensed the crowd's mood at his first rally in Milwaukee on March 23, Wallace abruptly changed his schedule. Suddenly all his earlier explanations about our inability to rent halls because of basketball games became academic. Wallace sought his little man with eleven rallies in eight days and a flurry of local television interviews. He repeatedly brought up busing as a philosophical issue. He complained that the other candidates were horning in on his populist issues: I dig the bone up and throw it out there, and the big dogs grab it. I'm just a little dog from Alabama. McGovern's television commercials confirmed the Wallace complaint. If you want lower property taxes, you want George McGovern, said one. It's as simple as that. But McGovern emphasized direct campaigning. In oblique reference to Lindsay's stylish and futile TV campaigns in Florida and Wisconsin, one McGovern press release claimed: The day of the media candidate is over. People have stopped watching television commercials and started listening to details. Top-Heavy. Despite his efforts to sharpen his stand on issues, Muskie failed to come across clearly on any topic. His organization, top-heavy with endorsements and contributors, never took root on the local levels where primaries are won. He failed to define a constituency.
The IRS last year extended the tax deadline for all U.S. taxpayers due to the coronavirus pandemic, although this year it plans to keep its regular April 15 deadline for 2020 tax returns. With about 29 million residents, Texans represent almost 9% of the U.S. population, which means about 1 in 10 taxpayers will get an extension on their taxes this year.
If a president did something that he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment, Dershowitz said on Wednesday.
The IRS likely would have given these taxpayers hardship status and classified their debts as currently uncollectible if the tax agency had handled the accounts itself, Olson wrote. Instead, the tax agency assigned the cases to private debt-collection firms that don't conduct financial analyses before contacting the taxpayers for repayments, the report said.

If it's just pure tax cuts and no revenue-raising provisions, we don't predict that any tax cut will pay for itself. There's just no federal tax that's bad enough to raise sufficient revenue by eliminating it, explained Alan Cole, an economist with the conservative Tax Foundation. It means you're punting on the question of how the revenue will eventually be raised to pay for this.

Significantly, the survey found that voters still saw Centrist Humphrey as the Democrat with the best chance to be nominated and, if nominated, to beat Nixon. According to the TIME/Yankelovich survey, McGovern trailed both Wallace and Humphrey among blue-collar workers and union members, but he still got 25% of their votes. More than any other, McGovern came through as someone you can trust. Improbably, he won the Fourth Congressional District, on the blue-collar and ethnic south side of Milwaukee, with the largest concentration of Poles in the state. Muskie, who had emphasized his Polish ancestry, finished fourth. Cross-Overs. Wallace and McGovern worked the same vein of economic distress, but the McGovern vote was moderate-liberal, according to the survey, while the Wallace vote was essentially moderate- conservative. McGovern fared well with young voters (47%); Wallace did poorly. The final results were complicated, of course, by the fact that 26% of the votes cast in the Democratic primary came from Republicans and Independents. The cross-overs cost Humphrey a second-place finish, since most of them went to Wallace. Yankelovich found, however, that most of the cross-overs came not as spoilers but as voters anxious to make their views known on the economy and other issues. Wisconsin served to prolong and compound the suspense of the race. It established the major Democratic theme -- a profound economic disgruntlement -- but not a party leader. It's kind of a scramble now, Humphrey said last week. Coming out of Wisconsin, Muskie still led in committed delegate votes, with 96 1/2.

In fact, many economists have been puzzled that average annual wage growth has been stuck at about 2.5% the past couple of years despite the low jobless rate. But Williams said it wasn't until last year that the economy strengthened and unemployment fell below a normal 4.7%, increasing the competition for workers.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Watson said investigators had not been able to trace all of the stolen money but said the operation was among the largest tax refund fraud schemes the IRS has ever uncovered.

And America condemns their repression of dissidents and Jews; their suppression of Solidarity; their invasion of Afghanistan; their meddling around the world. But the truth is that between us, we have the capacity to destroy the planet. Every president since the bomb went off understood that and talked with the Soviets and negotiated arms control. Why has this administration failed? Why haven't they tried? Why can't they understand the cry of Americans and human beings for sense and sanity in control of these God awful weapons? Why, why? Why can't we meet in summit conferences with the Soviet Union at least once a year? Why can't we reach agreements to save this earth? The truth is, we can. President Kennedy was right when he said: We must never negotiate out of fear. But we must never fear to negotiate. For the sake of civilization we must negotiate a mutual, verifiable nuclear freeze before those weapons destroy us all.

Phoenix: In a move intended to accelerate a lagging COVID-19 vaccine rollout, Gov. Doug Ducey on Tuesday issued new rules, including giving the state authority to take unused doses back from providers and reallocate them. Dr. Cara Christ, Arizona Department of Health Services director, said that in addition to limiting factors in terms of the federal supply, said some providers may not be using all their vaccine doses. It's going to require certain providers that have 40% or more of their doses being reported as unused, they are going to have to submit a plan to the department that tells us how they are going to significantly increase and use that vaccine within the next seven days, Christ said of the new reporting requirements. If we don't agree they've got a great plan, we can take doses back at the state level. Health providers in Arizona are either not reporting that they are administering the COVID-19 vaccine or simply not administering it at the rate state officials want to see, Christ said. The new requirements will give the state authority to take back unused doses from providers who don't have adequate plans to use them, she said.

Yet there is something unsettling about the evolution of this genre. Is it purely a matter of Trump's excesses or has he occasioned a sea change in journalism as well?

You may receive false census documents meant to coax personal information from you, as Cooper did. Similarly, you could receive forms that are designed to look like official census mail, but are intended to confuse you and lead to inaccurate census counts. For example, Republicans were caught last month sending out mailers titled 2020 Congressional District Census, in envelopes labeled Do not destroy, official document, which mirrored the look of the official census form. However, these forms were not related to the census at all.

The new federal restrictions on SALT deductions ring the death knell for this strategy of raising state taxes to meet unfunded benefit obligations. For instance, middle-class residents of these four states are already paying effective tax rates of 9% to 12% — from local income, property and sales taxes. Since Congress has now limited SALT deductions to $10,000, residents of high-tax states are likely to push hard on their elected officials to lower local income and property taxes.
Concluding that it was definitely worth a shot, DC Water, the District, the US Department of Justice and the EPA agreed to amend their consent order. The agreement was that DC Water would build about 300 acres of green infrastructure. Before jumping into a massive 300+/- acre project that might cost hundreds of millions of dollars, DC Water decided to experiment with 25 acres first to see what the green infrastructure would actually cost and, second, how much water flow it would actually reduce. So, they picked out 25 acres and installed flow meters to see what the pre-project runoff was.

Bank lobbyists have argued that the responsibilities of financial services would overwhelm public institutions like the Postal Service and that banks can carry out the duties more efficiently themselves.

The United Nations-designated International Holocaust Remembrance Day is Monday. The Jan. 27 date coincides with the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in 1945. This year marks the 75th anniversary. A memorial ceremony will be held in the U.N. General Assembly Hall that will include Holocaust survivors giving their testimony and a musical contribution by Itzhak Perlman. Last week, dozens of world leaders – including Vice President Mike Pence, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Britain's Prince Charles – visited Jerusalem to attend the World Holocaust Forum, the largest gathering focused on commemorating the Holocaust and combating anti-Semitism. For historians, the forum's main message was one of education amid signs of ignorance and indifference to the Holocaust.
Last week, the union representing the men's national team players spoke out in support of the women, saying the USSF has been working very hard to sell a false narrative to the public and even to members of Congress.

Second, any patents resulting from this work will be in the public domain. This means a successful vaccine will be available as a cheap generic from day one. The companies don't need to be compensated for their research because they've already been paid.
It has to do with the American desire for a larger squid, explains Diane Pleschner-Steele, executive director of the California Wetfish Producers Association. A lot of squid that is shipped overseas stays overseas because they prefer it. They eat it over there. Our consumers typically prefer a larger squid, and so there's just a ton of squid imported into this country that comes in at a far lower price.
We need a banking system that is part of the productive economy – making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments, making huge profits and assured that, if their schemes fail, the taxpayers will be there to bail them out.
At the same time, Trump said to the deplorables: Sorry, I guess we didn't have time to get to the wall…
The credit phases out for single parents who make over $200,000 or couples who make over $400,000. The 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act increased the size of the credit for many families and the amount that is refundable. Such changes were pushed by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

Either way, that presents problems, given that many employers are already taking an income hit from the virus, Glynn said. For one, the bill would not take effect for two weeks after being signed into law. For small businesses, that means they'd have to start covering workers as soon as early April — but they wouldn't see any relief until July, when filing quarterly taxes.

Texas' athletics revenues and expenses were both in excess of $200 million in fiscal 2017, according to school's most recently available NCAA financial report – but the $1.4 million in tax that would have been connected to Herman's and Smart's pay is more than what Texas spent to field a men's tennis team that year.

Forget about keeping up with the Joneses. This time of year you want your house to be as crummy as possible. Why? Because it's property tax assessment time, which means it's also assessment appeal time. And if you can successfully argue that your house isn't worth as much as the government says it is, you can save a bundle of money on your property taxes.
BAIER: Yes, Happy New Year to you.
Companies, moreover, are run by humans, subject to normal human failings. Mr. Trump's suspension may have been motivated by a sincere desire to resist efforts to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power, as Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, put it. But other politicians might be suspended because their policies are bad for corporate profits or contrary to the owners' political ideologies.

George Washington would have thought that argument absurd. In his Farewell Address in 1796, he said: Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be useful must be impartial.
Buffett in the past has repeatedly called on Congress to raise taxes on the wealthy, saying people like him should be paying more. He refrained from revisiting that call in his yearly update.
Mnuchin also said that the government should pick up the costs for small and medium businesses whose workers have to self-quarantin or care for quarantined family members.
A subsidiary of Targa Resources (TRGP), an oil and natural gas pipeline company, successfully priced a high-yield offering on Thursday.

The Breitbart contributor Peter Schweizer followed Clinton Cash, a book that helped spread the Uranium One conspiracy, with Secret Empires, which targeted Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden.

The investors, Mr. Schweizer wrote, might appear at first glance to be innocuous cultural organizations — but they are not. Both are funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government. It may not seem like much, but as the birtherism conspiracy shows, scandals have been rooted in less.

It's much tougher for Donald Trump and his-- and-- and that segment of kind of the Republican ideological arm, whereas if you're talking not about a woman's right to choose but if you're talking about something that most Americans find extremely reprehensible. If you can redefine what it means to support abortion rights, you can redefine how you feel about Democratic candidates. And I think going to our other conversation, you know, the Trump base is demonstrably different than-- than the Democratic Party's base, which is why there is asymmetrical and there's two different standards for how you talk about racial issues or gender issues or-- or, you know, sort of anything in the spectrum that we have been talking about this morning.

The lush natural landscapes of North Korea – from Wonsan's beaches to the Pyongyang skyline to the terrific glory of Mount Paektu, an active volcano – lend themselves to inviting travel, particularly from China and other neighboring countries. Yet many remain skeptical that any investment enriching the Kim regime will help reduce the abject poverty the average North Korean suffers, and concerns abound that Pyongyang could use the money to strengthen its ironclad grip on religion, freedom of expression and any political dissent.

Omaha: Officials in the Omaha area are allocating $10 million of unspent federal coronavirus relief aid for rent, food aid and mental health services. Douglas County Board member Mike Boyle said many people continue to be evicted from their homes despite a federal moratorium. And he described Tuesday's decision to give $2 million in rent and mortgage assistance to the Metro Area Continuum of Care for the Homeless to distribute as a rare opportunity to help people who are really hurting. County officials have said many people who needed help with rent weren't able to meet federal coronavirus relief requirements, the Omaha World-Herald reports. They aren't going to have to jump through all the hoops that are put together by the feds, Boyle said. Another $6 million will be earmarked for mental health, although the details haven't been finalized. Board Chair Mary Ann Borgeson said it may go to such things as training for 911 operators and dispatchers, or a program to send mental health professionals to crisis calls to 911. The board also unanimously approved allowing $2 million to the the Food Bank for the Heartland.

Biden, according to The New York Times, plans to keep FBI Director Chris Wray unless he's fired by Trump before the president leaves office. Wray, a Republican who once said he'd quit before breaking the law for the president, has upset Trump with his descriptions of the loosely organized anti-fascist movement known as antifa, his description of the limited impact of voter fraud, his discussion of Russian election interference, and his refusal to provide Trump's campaign with a last-minute boost by violating DOJ standards and publicly announcing some sort of politically advantageous investigation. Wray has defended the bureau from Trump's attacks, but he's been quiet post-election as Trump has made broad, sweeping claims about mass voter fraud, which law enforcement officials say could inspire attacks by right-wing extremists convinced that the election was illegitimate.

Puerto Ricans chose the latter. They turned to investment banks to come in and put the bond deals together.

Casper: A company has settled a federal lawsuit by a former employee who claimed she was pressured to take Scientology courses as a condition of her employment. Julie A. Rohrbacher filed the lawsuit in 2018 against Teton Therapy, which operates physical and occupational therapy offices in four Wyoming locations. Rohrbacher claimed that owner Jeff McMenamy declined to promote her and then forced her to resign in 2013 after she refused to enroll in Church of Scientology courses. She sued under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits religious harassment and discrimination at work. The suit was settled Jan. 2, and Chief U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl dismissed the case, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Scientology is a church founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in the early 1950s. The church has about 10 million members worldwide.

Norwich: The city planned to mark the birthdate of the nation's most famous traitor, Benedict Arnold, by turning off the Christmas lights at City Hall on Tuesday. Regan Miner, the executive director of the Norwich Historical Society, said the event serves as a tongue-in-cheek way to mark the 279th anniversary of Arnold's birth. Danye Rugh was to deliver a lecture after the lights were turned out, accompanied by period-themed cocktails and food. The son of Norwich was born in 1741 and fought for the Continental Army before wounding his leg in the Battle of Saratoga. The region handles Arnold's legacy in different ways. In New London, Arnold's body is burned in effigy, and a replica of his leg is placed in a coffin and sent to Norwich.

Tax avoidance by some of the richest and biggest corporations, which are using various loopholes to move their headquarters to various off-shore locations in order not to pay taxes, should be banned and declared illegal. Over the last decades, billions of dollars supposed to be paid on account of taxes, were successfully moved out of the country and pocketed by directors of such corporations. The theory that such untaxed money is used to start new enterprises and create jobs for Americans proved to be totally flawed. Rich are not starting new businesses that create more jobs. Instead, by-and-large, they end up hoarding their tax-avoided funds in their offshore accounts ... or ... buying out small start-ups to stifle the entrepreneurship that might compete with their hegemony. Morally and justly speaking, this money is tax payers' money that should be returned to the public purse for the benefit of the country.

If you are earning $75,000 a year as an individual or $150,000 a year as a couple, you qualify. After that there is a sliding scale, which bottoms out at $99,000 for an individual or $198,000 as a couple.

A top W.H.O. official in Europe urges tighter measures to stave off new coronavirus variants. Nursing home residents in Reims, France, received the Covid-19 vaccine last week. Credit... Andrea Mantovani for The New York Times Europe has reached a tipping point as it grapples with the spread of new coronavirus variants, the World Health Organization's top official in the region said on Thursday, calling for tighter public health controls to slow their transmission. The new variants have been identified in 25 of the European region's 53 nations, Hans Kluge, the W.H.O. 's regional director, told a virtual news conference. We were prepared for challenging times in 2021, and it has been just that, he said. The region had 26 million confirmed coronavirus infections last year and more than 580,000 related deaths, he said, and in the past week alone recorded 1.8 million new cases. He said that the health authorities could not yet assess the full extent of a surge in infections resulting from increased social gatherings and relaxed precautions over the year-end holidays, because testing and reporting also dropped. But he said that the availability of vaccines offered hope for the months ahead. 2021 will be another year with the virus, but it will be more manageable and more predictable, Mr. Kluge said. As the year began, over 280 million people in Europe were living under national lockdowns, and several countries are set to add new measures in the hope of reducing new infections and easing the pressure on strained health facilities.

It's essentially a deposit that the court can require of an individual to make sure that they come back to court.

Pool photo by Jacquelyn Martin Representative Adriano Espaillat, Democrat of New York, announced on Thursday he had tested positive for the coronavirus, as concerns continue to mount on Capitol Hill that efforts to corral lawmakers into secure locations during last week's siege by Trump supporters may have led to a super-spreader event. Mr. Espaillat, 66, who received his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine last week, said he was not experiencing any symptoms and that he was isolating at home. In a statement, he said he understood that it took time for the vaccine to be fully effective and that he had continued to take all necessary precautions. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that people who test positive for the virus should isolate for at least 10 days after their symptoms start. The two vaccines cleared for emergency use in the United States, made by Pfizer and Moderna, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19. But neither vaccine is perfect, and researchers remain unsure of how well the shots curb the ability of the virus to silently infect people.

Wolf's rhetoric around addressing climate change is at odds with his desire to expand Pennsylvania's petrochemical industry. During his reelection campaign last year, Wolf linked the need for renewable energy to his support for the massive ethane cracker Shell is building outside Pittsburgh. Once it's online, the plant will be among the largest air pollution sources in the state.
About 61 million Americans have some kind of disability, which the Americans With Disabilities Act defines as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. But even as inclusion becomes a marketing buzzword and major brands such as Nike roll out disability-friendly products, unemployment among groups with disabilities is more than double that of the general population. Less than 20 percent of people with disabilities held a job in 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has been like this for decades.
And Muslims have fought ISIS more than anyone else. This includes Kurdish Sunnis and Arab Sunnis and Shiites, who are on the front lines and often allied with U.S. advisers in the battle against ISIS, as well as Turkmen Muslims. Some of the most horrific videos from ISIS have shown the killing of Sunni Muslims who have fought the group, like a Jordanian pilot and Turkish troops shown burned alive.

Justice Kennedy, however, had a blunt assessment. The assumption of many of these questions is that our prior decision is incorrect but that that doesn't make any difference, and I'm suggesting it does.

Justice Gorsuch - why should this court favor a particular business model that relies not on brick and mortar but mail order?
There is not a ban on hiring noncitizens, the Census Bureau's public information office emphasized in a written statement from June.

In a recent interview, Williams, who Trump is considering as vice chairman of the Fed's board, said he's comfortable with Fed policymakers' median forecast of three quarter-point rate hikes in 2018. But he believes there's a greater chance of faster growth and inflation prompting four rate increases than of slower gains forcing a pullback to two bumps.

Back in 2009, many if not most mainstream economists believed that excessive government budget deficits were a bigger threat to society than weak growth or prolonged unemployment. Going too big wouldn't just risk overheating ― it raised the prospect of a second financial crisis that could bring down the dollar and even American political hegemony.

1. The question from CNN somewhat overstates the problem. Social Security won't run out of money in 20 years. What will happen — somewhere around 2035 — is the program will exhaust its Trust Fund, which Social Security uses to help supplement money from payroll taxes. Even after the trust fund is gone, payroll taxes paid by workers will continue to flow into the system, and those funds will be sufficient to cover about three-quarters of all retirement benefits. In other words, if nothing is done, future retirees could still expect to collect 75 cents for every dollar of Social Security they're owed. (Social Security has a separate program that pays disability benefits, and it faces a more urgent cash crunch. If money from the retirement program is diverted to back fill the disability program, the trust fund will be exhausted a few years earlier.)

One of the most powerful platforms Donald Trump ran on was his opposition to China. He understood what people in regular America thought about China, what they had seen China doing to regular Americans' jobs over the past three decades that politicians in both parties had ignored for decades. And Donald Trump is the first one to call them on it. And we have seen in his first term he is willing to confront them on it. And that right there speaks --
To compete with Tesla, G.M. will promote its electric cars and adopt a new logo. General Motors is introducing a new logo, replacing one that it had for nearly 50 years. Credit... via General Motors General Motors wants to shake up its image. The automaker said on Friday that it would start a marketing campaign next week to highlight a new corporate logo and the battery technology it had developed for use in at least 30 electric vehicles it intended to introduce over the next five years. The 113-year old company wants to reposition itself as a forward-looking producer of high-tech electric vehicles and to shed its reputation for being plodding and unexciting. Company officials believe its image has hampered their efforts to compete with Tesla, the maker of luxury electric cars. Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, are widely admired in the business and automotive world. The company's reputation for innovation has helped build a following of customers, fans and investors. The stock market values Tesla at more the $800 billion, more than many large automakers combined. G.M. makes far more vehicles and is substantially more profitable but has a market value of around $60 billion. G.M. will use the tagline, Everyone in, and some of the company's ads will feature the author Malcolm Gladwell.

Jemez Springs: A national preserve in northern New Mexico that is sometimes referred to as the Yellowstone of the Southwest has added another piece of property to its land holdings that contains sulfuric acid hot springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud pots. The National Park Service announced last week that it recently completed the purchase of a 40-acre parcel known as Sulphur Springs within the Valles Caldera National Preserve. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the Western United States, officials said. The acidic pools and streams in the area also are home to a range of extremophile algae and bacteria. Acquiring Sulphur Springs was critical to protecting the breadth of geothermal features within the preserve, officials said. The $500,000 purchase was made through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and nonprofit groups.

In this example, if you were to contribute 5% of your salary, or $3,750 a year, to your 401(k) account, your employer would also contribute $3,750 a year. Contributions are typically made every pay period. The bottom line is: Each of your contributions would earn an immediate 100% return — a doubling of your initial investment. You will need to check to see how long it takes for the employer's contribution to be vested. This means you may lose recent matching contributions if you change employers. For some companies, after an initial vesting period, all employer matching contributions are immediately vested.

In almost all cases, pricing strategies should begin with a Gross Profit Margin Target (GPMT) strategy. Companies typically know the gross profit margin they need to pay back their expenses and generate positive net income and cash flow. Once your company knows the cost of sales (cost of goods and services sold) of a particular product and the Gross Profit Margin Target it wants, it can easily employ a GPMT strategy. Gross Profit Margin is defined by the formula (P-C)/P, where P=Price and C=Cost of Sales. Anybody can put this formula into a spreadsheet program, and as costs change, recalculate the price that will produce the targeted Gross Profit Margin. Most companies know the GPMT they want. If you don't, there are some common guidelines you can follow.

And you can reduce your risk by purchasing multiple annuity contracts across several companies.

Fixing DACA was part of the president's four-pillars strategy way back earlier in 2018. It's something he has endorsed before. That would give pause, I think, to this Democratic strategy of letting this thing run out for a very long time. A lot of these new members of Congress ran on a fix for DACA.

Truthfully, there's little way to know how billions of dollars in daily bitcoin transactions are financed, because cryptocurrencies are largely bought and sold on unregulated markets. But it seems evident, at least to me, that a small portion of the bitcoin market thrives on other people's money, and lenders may be left holding the bag on bitcoin's plunge.
Neither a socialist nor a lackey of the robber barons, George favored liberty and free enterprise, but he opposed fortunes built upon special privilege, and, in particular, he advocated a single tax on the value of land and the abolition of other taxes. This would enable people to keep what they earned but not enjoy riches from the possession of land that they had done nothing to create.
Many of my clients lived in dangerous neighborhoods. They were surrounded by dangerous situations. They often felt caught between a rock and a hard place. So I represented individuals, for example, who were charged with misdemeanor gun possession who knew that if they were caught they would be punished. And yet, they felt the pressure from their neighbors - from the people in their neighborhoods that if they did not carry a gun or at the very least were not perceived to be carrying a weapon, that they would be in danger, that they would be seen as a target. It was a heartbreaking calculus that they had to go through.
Although Tesla's $2.98 billion third quarter revenue slightly beat Wall Street analysts' estimates, the company lost $671 million, or $2.92 per share. That was twice the-$336 million loss in the prior quarter, and set an all-time cash burn high of $16 million per day.

Their numbers swelled as high as 68 during his tenure, which also saw the adoption of a 2011 redistricting map favorable to Republicans. Two lawsuits — one before the U.S. Supreme Court, the other before a state circuit court — challenged the constitutionality of the maps.
There are so many women that have never heard of terms like period poverty or menstrual equity, yet once they do, it's as though a veil is lifted and they become allies, spokespeople, advocates in the fight to end it, she said. When we discuss it, we open the door to eradicating the shame and stigma associated with periods and period poverty, which will lead to a more menstrual equitable society.

PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, I don't. And the reason has become because women, as a practical matter, are now in combat. They may not get treated as if they're in combat. But when they're in theater in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, they are vulnerable. They are wounded. And they've been killed. And they have carried out their jobs with extraordinary patriotism and distinction.

The department has been taken off a road that I think it's basically been on since the Nixon administration, where there's been that separation of the Justice Department from the White House, Holder told HuffPost ahead of the election. You really need to look at the department as a whole.

The department has got to be restored to what it was and what it must always be and clearly not what it is now.

But a key driver of Type 2 diabetes in Mexico — and globally — is still a person's diet.

Washington, D.C., one of the blackest cities in America, has been experiencing an economic renaissance for nearly two decades — but that renaissance is considered nothing more than gentrification by longtime residents. According to the D.C. Chamber of Commerce's State of the Business Report, whiter and richer families are increasingly displacing low- and middle-income families. As affluent families move in, higher rents push out black residents, and black businesses leave with them.

SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The Fed was hoping to inject some confidence in the economy and the stock market after the worst week on Wall Street since the financial crisis. This was the first time the Fed had cut rates outside of an ordinarily scheduled meeting. And they cut by half a point, not a quarter point as they usually do. They don't have a whole lot of monetary ammunition here, so they wanted to act quickly and dramatically even though Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that this action on its own would not shield the economy from coronavirus damage.

It's true that 99 percent of the 12,587 refugees from Syria admitted in 2016 to the U.S. were Muslim and less than 1 percent were Christian. That would outpace Muslims' population in Syria, which is 93 percent. But that's based on 2010 numbers. With the civil war going on and the millions who have been displaced, it's nearly impossible to tell exactly what the most current percentages are.
Republican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) haven't gone that far, at least not yet. The draft legislation that leaked last week still had refundable credits, and looked a lot like the plan that Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price had proposed when he was in Congress last year. The Better Way proposal, a set of reform principles that Ryan released over the summer, also had refundable credits. President Donald Trump also endorsed tax credits during his speech to Congress on Tuesday night, although he didn't specify what kind.

Youth Activists Are Heard In Biden's White House, But They Want To See More Action
It showed the entire blow-up of the country coming, Caddell told me. A whole new paradigm developing. No Republican had yet emerged as a front-runner in the 2016 primary, but the Hanleys believed Ted Cruz could take Caddell's insights and ride them all the way to the White House. They saw Cruz as a unicorn: a dedicated fiscal and social conservative who had broken with his party repeatedly. They were dismissive of Trump. He doesn't understand politics or geopolitics or anything about the running of the government, Alice Hanley told me recently. Rebekah Mercer saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology. Robert Mercer and Cruz had met before during a conference in February 2014, when Lee Hanley had invited them to the five-diamond Breakers resort in Palm Beach for a grilling session. Robert was impressed by Cruz's intellect, according to a person at the meeting, but worried that the 43-year-old senator was too young and might struggle to capture voters' imaginations. Still, Robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various Hanley homes. Apparently, Cruz can hold his alcohol (his preference is cabernet), which is a prized attribute in the Hanleys' circle. As the Mercers weighed whether to get involved in a presidential race, their calculus was quite different from that of other megadonors, most of whom run massive corporate empires.

T.I.'s home computer was first introduced in 1979 for $1,150 and was an embarrassing failure. T.I. discovered in 1982 that it could sell large volumes by cutting the price and offering rebates. But the T.I. 99/4A, which was little different from the machine that was originally designed to sell for $1,150, was no match cost-wise for Commodore's VIC-20. As Commodore and T.I. started their downhill race, it was inevitable that prices would get so low that T.I. would start losing money while Commodore stayed profitable. T.I.

Even if you pay your bills in full each month, it's still possible (and I can speak firsthand on this) to hurt your credit score by going over the 30% credit utilization threshold. The good news is that the dip in your credit score is probably temporary if you're paying your bill in full and on time each month, or at least getting your net balance owed below 30% of your aggregate available credit. However, the timing of when a credit report is run could certainly have some bearing on whether your credit score takes a hit or not.

This has become a source of great concern to many global businesses, which are scrambling to stay ahead of the headlines. Some of the things that used to be taken for granted - such as that Europe will always be a source of stability and growth, or that China is an investment destination that must be included in an investment portfolio - simply are no longer the case. Europe's rolling recession -- complete with anemic growth and security concerns - will mean the continent will be a source of instability for many years to come. China's incessant bubble economy, declining long-term growth rates, and increasingly unfriendly policies toward foreign investors have given many companies pause for many years now.

In the Senate, she fought for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which helped return agriculture and manufacturing jobs to Georgia. She has fought against radical pro-abortion proposals. And her work on the Veterans Affairs Committee has helped ensure Georgia's veterans get the health care they deserve – and the training and education they need to succeed after their military service.

Rule, 30, founded the bar with seven others who combined their resources to create a space, named in honor of Maya Angelou's famed memoir, that is 100 percent owned, operated, staffed and financed specifically by black millennials. It joined the roughly 2.6 million black-owned businesses in the United States, according to the United States Census Bureau.
Rampell's words serve as a reminder that, though an educator such as Jill Biden, a woman with a doctorate, and Greco, a man with a passion for teaching, may not be able to minister to a heart attack victim on a flight from New York to Los Angeles, they provide the resources for those who can and do. No one makes it through life without teachers, many of whom save just as many if not more lives than the doctor on the plane. Thanks for reminding us.
Eventually, federal regulators investigated and found the bank should have had a system in place to prevent the practice. They fined UBS $34 million for the loan scheme and other problems. They also fined UBS and four other banks for putting clients at risk in the special funds. Eighteen hundred UBS customers have now sued.

After a Democratic primary that was rife with generational tensions, Biden has so far managed to hold together the Democratic coalition that elected him, including the young people who turned out for Biden in droves. Now, younger Americans are confronting the intersecting crises of the coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, a national reckoning on race and justice and the urgent climate crisis.

Children who are 17 or older won't qualify you for the full Child Tax Credit, but you can get up to $500 per person through a dependent care credit. You can claim an adult child or an aging parent, for instance — as long as that person meets the IRS' definition of a dependent.
However, it's unclear that the provision raising the minimum wage would have been included in the final bill even if MacDonough had ruled that it was possible to include a wage hike in the bill. At least two Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, had expressed concerns about raising the minimum wage. Without support from all 50 Democrats in the Senate, the bill's prospects would be doomed.
Washington: Georgetown University confirmed some first- and second-year medical students received the COVID-19 vaccine when they were not eligible, WUSA-TV reports. Higher-level medical students have been approved to get the vaccine because they are in hospitals working with patients, according to a Georgetown University spokesperson. Neither Georgetown University nor MedStar Health/MedStar Georgetown University Hospital reportedly authorized the vaccine for students who did not fit the criteria. We've taken the necessary steps to ensure this is avoided in the future. These actions run contrary to Georgetown's values as a Jesuit institution, teaching our students to be in service to others, a spokesperson for the school said. The School of Medicine takes violations of professionalism extremely seriously and will be taking appropriate action as outlined in its Code of Professionalism in the Student Handbook. Georgetown University said in a statement that it would not discuss individual students and how many got unauthorized vaccinations because of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
Air travel has been hampered by the shutdown. Aviation groups have warned of longer wait times and possible checkpoint closures at major airports and have raised concerns that passenger safety and security has been compromised. Miami International Airport is closing one of its terminals Saturday through Monday because many Transportation Security Administration officials are not reporting to work, and airport officials weren't confident they would have enough screeners on duty.
NATAPOFF: So misdemeanors are minor offenses. Every jurisdiction defines them differently. Typically, they're defined as any criminal offense for which you can do no more than one year incarceration as punishment. But misdemeanors come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Sometimes we call them petty offenses. Sometimes we call them violations or ordinance violations. In Texas, Gail Atwater's offense - her seatbelt offense - even though she couldn't go to jail for it, was a criminal offense. It was a criminal misdemeanor.

Knesset members have been calling for the government to compensate all victims of the fire in full, regardless of whether or not the losses were the result of arson. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon (Kulanu) announced that NIS 2,500 ($650) will be awarded to every person who is unable to return home due to damages.
Ossoff will clearly be focused more on the San Francisco values of Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., than on the issues that matter to Georgia. Ossoff raises far more money in California than in Georgia. It was no accident that he and Warnock had their first joint fundraiser in a restaurant in San Francisco.

The Senate also blocked President Barack Obama's gun control package in 2013, following the Sandy Hook shooting. Significant legislative action on gun control remains in the states.
Museveni in 2018 criticized social media platforms for promoting allegedly false information in Uganda, claiming young people spent too much time on messaging apps such as WhatsApp. Later that year, Uganda's government imposed a $0.05 tax on social media usage in the country. Since then, many Ugandans have accessed the internet via Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to side-step the tax.

The bill blocks Trump's rules which deny asylum to migrants who say they are afraid of gangs or domestic violence. It commits the DHS to end the detention of migrants who bring children to the border even though many migrants openly tell reporters that they bring children to trigger Obama's catch and release rules. The bill also cuts funding needed to keep migrants in detention until their legal claims are resolved, and it spends at least $75 million to encourage the catch-and-release of migrants.
The riot at the Capitol has also triggered departures outside the administration. The chief of the Capitol Police is resigning effective January 16. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House sergeant-at-arms, Paul Irving, was submitting his resignation, while Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger submitted his own resignation late Thursday, according to a statement by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
JORDAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sunday the Speaker of United States House of Representatives called the President of the United States an impostor. Speaker of the House called the President an impostor. The guy, 63 million people for, the guy who won an Electoral College landslide, the Speaker calls an impostor. That's what happened to our country, to this Congress. The Speaker statement says it all. The Democrats have never accepted the will of the American people. Democrats don't trust the American people. The American people who wanted to send someone to this town who was willing to shake it up a bit.

Former NYC Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who now runs a program for the homeless called WIN, called on the city to create a position that would be in charge of finding permanent housing options for the homeless.
SNELL: Not as far as we have seen. There are some people who enjoyed having their names out there or were, you know, were not discouraging that conversation --
NATAPOFF: So in some ways, those deals and deals like them - by which I mean deals cut by wealthy, powerful, well-represented individuals in a highly scrutinized, transparent environment - are the best version of snitching. White-collar crimes, political crimes like these, where the government has very few options to get information about conspiracies or wrongdoing by powerful, insulated individuals, it's - in my view, it's probably the best version of the informant deal.
RAINBOW: Well, just behaviorally and - so much so that my father, who's no longer with us - he actually died shortly after Trump's election - but his campaign was going on, you know, at the end of his life. And even he said that he couldn't watch Trump on TV because it reminded him so much of himself. So these conversations that the world is now having about Trump's behavior are conversations that were had within my family about my dad constantly. So I think that's kind of why I really have his number.
With Germany's second biggest party -- the Social Democrats -- heading for a spell in opposition, Merkel has only one real option: a three-way coalition between her conservative CDU-CSU bloc and two smaller parties -- the liberal FDP and the Greens.
Sharapova said returning from pregnancy requires an incredible effort that can tax a player physically and emotionally, while Halep said it's normal to give birth and good to protect the ranking when someone is giving birth.
Lawmakers said $317 million remains unused in the public funding account. The measure approved by the committee would funnel that money to deficit reduction and pediatric cancer research.
Does this mean the end of the type of green bonds discussed above? No. They will still be issued. There may be no financial implications to such bonds, but they do, after all, create good will. They do let investors know that the bond issuers are doing the right thing for the environment with the investors' money. As a matter of fact, DC Water is planning on issuing at least $100 million of green bonds in the near future. The proceeds of these bonds will go for stormwater reduction projects and other projects with direct environmental benefits, just like the World Bank bonds described above. And, soon DC Water will also issue a couple hundred million dollars of regular (non-green) bonds to pay for their other projects.
LIASSON: No, because it's not a winner-take-all system the way the Republicans have. There's a 15% threshold. You don't get any delegates unless you get over 15% of the popular vote. If no one else gets 15%, then you can take all the delegates or a huge amount of the delegates - a bigger percentage of the delegates than the percentage of the popular vote that you got. But if a lot of other candidates get over 15%, then the winner of the state ends up taking a smaller percentage of the delegates than the percentage they got of the popular vote. That's why it's very important to see the final delegate totals.
How can you expect people to make educated decisions about the right thing to do when they have absolutely no idea what the cost is? Levine said. It's crazy.

By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any public health clinic in America and hear the doctor say, We haven't seen a hungry child this year. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any store in America and pick up the best product, of the best quality, at the best price; and turn it over; and read, Made in the U.S.A. By the start of the next decade, I want to meet with the most successful business leaders anywhere in America, and see as many minorities and women in that room as I see here in this room tonight. By the start of the next decade, I want to point to the Supreme Court and say, Justice is in good hands. Before the start of the next decade, I want to go to my second Inaugural, and raise my right hand, and swear to preserve, protect, and defend a Constitution that includes the Equal Rights Amendment. My friends, America is a future each generation must enlarge; a door each generation must open; a promise each generation must keep. For the rest of my life, I want to talk to young people about their future. And whatever their race, whatever their religion, whatever their sex, I want to hear some of them say what I say - with joy and reverence - tonight: I want to be president of the United States. Thank you very much.
RAINBOW: Oh, God. They were real classics, real gems.
The real danger of the President's defense is clear when you consider the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime. This leaves impeachment as the only remedy to hold the President accountable for serious misconduct. The two-thirds threshold to convict and remove a president is already a high bar to meet -- even more so in an age of polarization. Dershowitz's argument would essentially take it off the table, and allow a president to do almost anything to ensure his re-election -- including asking a foreign power to intervene on his behalf.
Cummings called Cohen's statement too important not to hear, and he said that Americans listening to the hearing should judge for themselves whether they believe him.

Sanders here cites a newspaper clip that says an array of liberal-leaning groups — not just senior groups — were angry at Biden for supporting an amendment to the constitution mandating a balanced budget. The fear was that such an amendment would force reductions in domestic spending.
And for those of us who we'd like to see a big hit, and enjoy, you know, the rock-em sock-em you know, elements of the game, you know, we're probably going to be occasionally frustrated. I know defensive players in the NFL get frustrated now, because some of the changes in the rules. But I do think that we want to make sure that after people have played the game that they're going to be okay. And I'm glad to see that the NFL is starting to take this seriously. I understand that Commissioner Goodell has authorized 30 million dollars to the NIH to help study issues of how we can prevent concussions. But these are serious issues and especially for younger kids, as well as college players who don't make a big-- a big salary playing the sport. We want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep them safe.
And key Senate Republicans like Collins have concurred. She told reporters Monday she wanted a package that would focus solely on the pandemic rather than include a wish list of Democratic priorities like an increase to the minimum wage, though she said she would support debate over the minimum wage in a separate bill.
More than a dozen previous books by close observers and insider-survivors of the Trump administration have provided that testimony. Now come Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig of The Washington Post to make the closing argument with plenty of reporting of their own.
My view is that such a significant tax increase in one year means we should not ask the taxpayers to again pay at a greater rate to fund the FY 18 and FY 19 budgets, he said Tuesday in his budget transmittal letter to Council President Roger Berliner (D-Potomac-Bethesda).
He hired a lawyer who found out he was protected from the 60-percent rent hike by law, something Romano did not know at the time. And he said his rent, which was set to increase to $3,750, was restored to $2,350.

Trump's legal team is advancing exactly the opposite argument, to a sinister extent.
Some people wind up filing their taxes at the very last minute because they're forced to wait on key information or are at the mercy of their CPA friend who's supposed to be helping out. But in many cases, folks who end up sweating it out right around the deadline are those who simply procrastinate.
RAINBOW: We're all having brunch next Sunday.
Another big issue that these companies are likely to face is how they use repatriated cash if tax reforms are passed in Washington. Mr. Trump made job creation central to his campaign, but many chief executives want to use repatriated cash to do stock buybacks and make deals instead.
Making those changes would require the state of Utah to get approval for two federal waivers from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Proposition supporters point out that similar requests from other states have been denied.
The Post would not have tolerated homophobic or transphobic jokes in this (or any other) column, nor insensitive and stereotypic jokes at the expense of women, Black people or people with disabilities. Therefore, I am at a loss why The Post still considers such blatant ageism as falling within its editorial standards.
In 2019, GM expects to stop production at four American plants, including Detroit-Hamtramck and Warren Transmission in Michigan, Lordstown Assembly in Ohio, and Baltimore Operations in Maryland. This comes after GM laid off about 1,500 American workers in Lordstown in 2018, while their Mexico production remained unaffected.

In fact, only 7 percent of those surveyed supported abortion without any exceptions and funded by tax dollars, the Democratic Party platform and the often-asserted viewpoint of this generation whom I have found to be much more nuanced in their views. In working with college, university and high school groups on more than 1,220 campuses in all 50 states, I know that this generation is motivated to help women and their preborn children, viewing abortion as a human rights concern.

Legalizing recreational marijuana, for example, is expected to generate billions of dollars in economic activity and about $300 million in tax revenue in its first year, but legalization efforts have previously fallen apart following disputes over who should get licenses and how to spend the tax money. And marijuana tax dollars would not immediately solve the state's budget crisis; much of the money wouldn't materialize until years down the road.
St. Clair's absurd defense at least made an exception for impeachment. Now Trump's legal team is taking it a step further -- by saying that he is effectively immune from a court of impeachment.

Making America great again should not be about trade wars, blind nationalism, or creating short-term jobs in outdated industries. Neither should it be about starving police - the guardians of an inequitable order - of funds, or creating chaos on the streets.
Executives have tried to fill the gap through a cost-cutting program it calls FORCE, or Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere, which is meant to make its factories and distribution lines more efficient. Executives told analysts the company has saved about $450 million in the past year as part of that program, as part of a planned $1.5 billion cost-reduction over the next four years.
On Thursday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Special Report, Vice President Mike Pence stated of the Obamacare replacement bill, I think we're going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we're all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we've replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people's choices and giving states more flexibility, then that's where we're headed.

He argues the Warren plan is very different than any wealth tax that has existed anywhere in the world. Unlike in the European Union, it's impossible to freely move to another country or state to escape national taxes. Existing U.S. law also taxes citizens wherever they are, so even if they do sail to a tax haven in the Caribbean, they're still on the hook. On top of that, Warren's plan includes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of all a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to let the nomination move forward in the Senate in the final months of Obama's tenure.

Even Eric Holder who was referred for criminal contempt, the President bailed him out by claiming executive privilege only to later admit that those documents were never privileged documents but that's - that's forgotten by the so-called mainstream media and it's something that President Trump is not going to fail to say in real time because the American people need to hear it in real.

Nursing-home workers are refusing vaccines. Employers are offering incentives. Health workers preparing vaccinations in Rockaway, N.J. Credit... Sarah Blesener for The New York Times Anxious about taking a new vaccine and scarred by a history of being mistreated, many frontline workers at hospitals and nursing homes are balking at being inoculated against the coronavirus. But hospitals and nursing homes, worried about their patients' health and scarred by many thousands of deaths in the past year, are desperate to have their employees vaccinated. These opposing forces have led to unusual measures: In addition to educating workers about the benefits of the vaccines, employers are dangling incentives like cash, extra time off and even Waffle House gift cards for those who get inoculated, while, in at least a few cases, threatening to fire those who refuse. Officials at two large long-term care chains in the United States, Juniper Communities and Atria Senior Living, said they were requiring their workers, with limited exceptions, to be vaccinated if they want to keep their jobs. For us, this was not a tough decision, said Lynne Katzmann, Juniper's chief executive. Our goal is to do everything possible to protect our residents and our team members and their families. Critics say it is unethical to strong-arm low-paid workers into being vaccinated. This is a population of people who have been historically ignored, abused and mistreated, said Dr. Mike Wasserman, a geriatrician and former president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine.

Another benefit of appealing your assessment: When you successfully lower your property tax rate, it resets from that lower rate for years to come.

Pence said, [T]he legislation introduced this week in the House begins that process [of repealing and replacing Obamacare]. We're open and talking about ways we can improve that bill, but that combined with administrative action by the secretary of Health and Human Service,s and ultimately by, likely additional legislation, will get us to a point before we get to the spring this year where Obamacare will be gone, and it will be replaced with the kind of healthcare system that gives the American people more choices in their health insurance and gives states more freedom and more flexibility to provide Medicaid in the best way they see fit for our most vulnerable.

Yet while he isn't worried about a spike in inflation in the near term, he says gradual rate hikes would be the right thing to do to ward off such a scenario.

●See if the comparables are really comparable. The government's internal notes will also include comparable properties the assessor used to help determine the value of your house.

Next, identify three to six alternative comparables that are more favorable to you. You can find them free using such websites as Redfin, Trulia and Zillow.

Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has accused White House senior adviser and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner of a political hit job by engineering his ouster from Trump's transition team following the 2016 election.
She was booked, fingerprinted, spent a couple hours in the lockup and eventually pled guilty to and paid the fine for the seatbelt violation.

Almost everyone interviewed for this article, supporters and detractors alike, described her style as far more forceful than that of other powerful donors. Rebekah Mercer is rarely photographed. However, occasionally she can be found in the background of news photos, uncredited in the captions. Here she is arriving at Trump Tower on December 8, with Nick Ayers and Kellyanne Conway. DREW ANGERER/GETTY IMAGES But then the Mercers aren't typical donors in most senses beyond their extreme wealth. (The exact number of their billions is unknown.) Robert Mercer is a youthful-looking 70. As a boy growing up in New Mexico, he carried around a notebook filled with computer programs he had written. It's very unlikely that any of them actually worked, he has said. I didn't get to use a real computer until after high school. Robert went on to work for decades at IBM, where he had a reputation as a brilliant computer scientist. He made his vast fortune in his 50s, after his work on predicting financial markets led to his becoming co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world's most successful quantitative hedge funds. A longtime colleague, David Magerman, recalls that when Robert began working at Renaissance in 1993, he and his wife, Diana, were grounded, sweet people. (Magerman was suspended from Renaissance in February after making critical comments about Robert in The Wall Street Journal.) But money changed all that, he says. Diana started jetting off to Europe and flying to their yacht on weekends.
Shortly after the gas boom started, in 2009, the state House (then controlled by Democrats) passed a severance tax. It was defeated by Republicans in the Senate.
The Tigers have a beast of a lineup with all-world hitter Miguel Cabrera, Victor Martinez, J.D. Martinez and Upton. No team in baseball has a more imposing lineup.

This is both an opportunity and a challenge for the PRI industry, as well as those traders, investors and lenders who will utilize PRI to reduce their cost of capital and expand their business operations around the world. For the PRI industry, the challenge will be how to delicately balance a desire to underwrite more transactions with the need to impose even tighter underwriting standards. The temptation will be to incorporate a variety of long-term investment transactions and short-term credit transactions into underwriting portfolios, based on the many lessons learned as a result of previous claims. That temptation will be tempered, however, by the realization that history is no longer the teacher it once was. When paradigms shift, meaningfully predicting the future will become an even greater challenge.
GOODSTEIN: I love the fact that Donald Trump has imposed tens of billions of dollars of taxes, tariffs we'll call them, on American consumers. We know that. That is not disputable.

A history of partisan gerrymandering in Texas
Salt Lake City: About a third of the state's registered voters are at risk of not being able to participate in March's Super Tuesday presidential primary if they don't request ballots. State and county election officials have been sending letters and trying to get the message out before it's too late. This will be the first time Utah takes part in Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote, after lawmakers moved up the primary to make the state more relevant in the process. The state's nearly 510,000 independent voters can request a ballot for the Republican or Democratic primary, but the process is slightly different. The Republican primary is closed, so voters who want to cast a ballot must return the form to become GOP registered voters by Feb. 3. The Democratic primary is open, so independent voters can get a ballot without registering with the party. They have until Feb. 25 to request the ballot if they intend to remain unaffiliated but need to send it in by Feb. 3 if they want to become a registered Democrat.

Indeed, markets for U.S. government and corporate debt strained to handle a flood of sell orders. Investors sold 10-year Treasury securities to raise cash, sending prices down and yields up to 1.2 percent. The 10-year yield has more than doubled since March 9, when stocks and bonds began plunging in tandem. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.
The national debt is the sum of the federal government's past budget deficits, which result from the government spending more money than it raises through taxes in a given year. Economists have said that too much government borrowing could hurt the economy at some point or limit the government's ability to respond to a crisis, but the ever-widening deficits of the Trump years, which have pushed the national debt to historic levels, do not appear to have caused any problems ― or that much concern among Republicans.
The California Route 1 starts at $50,900 and the Premium at $53,100, but both qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit. Subtracting that brings the California Route 1 down to $43,400.

Mr. Short's tenure has been marked by ups and downs, reflecting the Trump administration's legislative record. The main legislative accomplishment so far has been the tax package that Republicans approved in December, although some inside the White House have argued that Mr. Cohn and his team deserved much of the credit. But the White House was unable to repeal the Affordable Care Act, has abandoned its push for an infrastructure spending package, and has been unable to find consensus within the Republican Party on an immigration overhaul.

Torres said she left her job in Bedminster in 2017 because she felt uncomfortable as a woman in a mostly male kitchen. She said she was also stressed out by the intensity of working during Trump visits, when she would arrive at 8 a.m. but often not leave until late at night. She also said she did not like Trump's comments about immigrants.

In Europe, the British parliament resoundingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal, raising the risk that her government collapses. The vote also deepens questions over whether the UK will crash out of the EU or decide to remain or further delay a decision. A messy divorce could spark market turmoil and fuel a recession in the UK, the world's fifth-biggest economy.

Charleston: A judge on Tuesday denied an attempt by teachers unions to halt the state's decision to reopen classrooms last week amid the pandemic. Kanawha County Judge Carrie Webster denied a temporary restraining order that sought to reverse the resumption of in-person learning in all 55 counties. The two largest unions wanted local school boards to decide reopening plans and allow more teachers to get fully vaccinated before going back to teach. The West Virginia Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia had filed two separate lawsuits that were later consolidated. While we're disappointed with the decision, the judge did make a point of saying educators are at greater risk during this pandemic, Dale Lee, president of the West Virginia Education Association, said in a statement. Decisions to teach in-person, remotely, hybrid and online should be a local decision, made by those who are the most impacted and who best understand how to best educate students safely. The unions had said it is unsafe to put teachers and workers back in classrooms as coronavirus cases still climb.
We need a pro-growth, progressive tax code that treats workers as job creators, as well, not just investors; that gets rid of un-protective loopholes like stepped-up basis; and it raises enough revenue to make sure that the Social Security and Medicare can stay, it still needs adjustments, but can stay; and pay for the things we all acknowledge will grow the country, he added.

It was not the evidence of his savvy that Trump presented in Iowa. Intending the development to feature the tallest building in the world, he had hoped to lure NBC to it.

There's no reason to think that the President should not be indicted.

Light says Trump's rhetoric about a hiring freeze and promises to drain the swamp seem to address concerns about thinning the ranks of government and making it more effective.

Something we really don't want is for sick workers who don't have paid leave to go to work, a known problem well before the coronavirus. Providing a generous tax break to employers (e.g. $800 per worker) to grant at least seven sick days a year to workers not covered would be a substantial incentive. In the same vein, we may also want to encourage employers to allow telecommuting, where possible. A modest credit for allowing telecommuting (e.g. $400) could increase the use of this option. An advantage of both these credits is that any changes are likely to be permanent.
Paul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code. What's the first thing he decided we had to go after? Biden continued, leaning into the microphone. Social Security and Medicare … That's the only way you can find room to pay for it.

Biden and Democrats could try to force through their oversized demands by using an arcane and rarely employed process known as budget reconciliation, in which a simple majority — and not the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster in the Senate — would be necessary. But every Democrat, including moderate Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, would have to be on board, and a straight party-line vote would undercut Biden's promise of unity.

Honolulu: Birthday plans for one of Hawaii's most esteemed houses have raised concerns over the proposed $53,000 cost while the state deals with significant economic problems stemming from the pandemic. Democratic Gov. David Ige proposed the commemoration of Washington Place, the longtime residence of Queen Liliuokalani and a dozen governors, Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Honolulu property, which became a museum and state reception venue nearly two decades ago, turns 175 years old this year. The $53,000 tab represents a tiny portion of Ige's proposed $15.4 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. But the cost has been questioned in the face of impending cuts to state jobs, programs and services. Hawaii faces projected $1.4 billion revenue shortfalls for each of the next four years. What kind of celebration is being planned during COVID, with the inability to gather, that would require that much (money), Democratic Rep. Lisa Marten, a member of the House Finance Committee, asked Ige chief of staff Linda Chu Takayama at a recent budget hearing. Takayama said details have not been finalized, but it's not a whole lot of money. Private donations are expected to match the state's contribution.
Milwaukee: Much of the west side of downtown and some areas east of the Milwaukee River will be inside a security zone during next summer's Democratic National Convention, officials announced Friday. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said every resident and business in the zone will have access to their property. The main inconvenience for residents will be travel times, officials said. It's still not known which part of downtown will be behind barriers or fences. Officials said they have outlined a broad security footprint, and the small, more restricted area should be announced later. The main convention venues include Fiserv Forum, UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, Miller High Life Theatre and the Wisconsin Center.

As Breitbart News previously reported, more than 2.7 million H-1B foreign workers have been approved to come to the U.S. to take American jobs between 2007 and 2017. During that same period, businesses tried to outsource almost 3.5 million American jobs to foreign workers instead of hiring Americans.
States could also deal with unfunded benefit obligations by making substantial cuts in non-retirement spending — between 13% and 24% of state revenues according to the table. But local voters will vociferously object to substantial cuts in public services in areas such as education, transportation, and police protection.

The youth who received the messages said Yenni, who was then the mayor of Kenner, first saw him at a function at his high school, a local Catholic institution. He said a mutual friend, who was 19 at the time, helped Yenni connect with him. … The friend, who allegedly helped connect the two, declined to be interviewed by WWL-TV. The youth said he and Yenni began to talk on the phone and text one another, and soon, the politician came to visit him at his job at a mall food court. They met in a bathroom, the youth said, and Yenni gave him some designer underwear. They kissed briefly. The texting continued, becoming more explicit over time. The youth provided WWL-TV what he says are copies of the text exchanges that were recovered after they were deleted, on the condition that the station not directly quote from them. Printouts of the messages appear to indicate they came from a cell phone account linked to Yenni in multiple online search engines. WWL-TV called the number in June and got the same outgoing voicemail message, featuring Yenni's voice, as could be heard on Yenni's official parish cell phone at the time. The phone listed on the printouts of the text messages is not billed to taxpayers. According to printouts of those texts, Yenni tells the teen he wants him naked. Days later, Yenni writes to ask the 17-year-old if he's worn the underwear Yenni bought him. Yenni says he wants to see him model it.

MARTIN: We've got NPR health correspondent Rob Stein with us to explain. Hi, Rob.
Feenstra was critical of Democrats with their new majority in the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been in the midst of negotiations with legislative leaders and Trump to end a partial government shutdown over immigration that's stretched into more than two weeks. Trump wants $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico. Democrats do not support that funding, in part by noting that Trump had promised Mexico would pay for such a structure.
Democrats were bracing for the measure to be removed from the bill, and the path to an increase is much more difficult in the Senate, where most legislation needs 60 votes to avoid a filibuster. Senate Republicans are almost uniformly opposed to the plan, and a stand-alone bill to increase the minimum wage, introduced by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has 37 co-sponsors, meaning a number of Democrats may not back the idea.

Atlanta: A member of the state House was removed from the chamber Tuesday for not abiding by the Legislature's coronavirus testing policy. Rep. David Clark, R-Buford, was asked to leave the chamber floor by House Speaker David Ralston. Clark refused to leave on his own and had to be escorted out by police. Members of the Legislature are supposed to undergo testing on Mondays and Thursdays. Ralston spokesman Kaleb McMichen said in a statement that the member in question had been advised numerous times about the requirements and had refused to be tested at any point during this session. The statement said he'll be able to return once he complies with the policy. Clark also had his office space in a building adjacent to the Capitol temporarily taken away. Clark, not wearing a face mask, told reporters he is abstaining from twice-a-week testing until it is available to everyone in the state, particularly teachers and first responders. Testing in Georgia is available to anyone who wants it and is widely accessible. You know, sometimes this job isn't all it's cracked up to be, Ralston said after having Clark removed. I don't know about you all, but I've been to too many funerals.

Further, the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed. Incredibly, the excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the Federal Reserve has grown from less than $2 billion in 2008 to $2.4 trillion today. That is absurd.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, however, has taken a different approach. Though he did take similar measures to Newsom early on in the pandemic, he allowed bars and restaurants to open by June. A few months later, he lifted more statewide restrictions on the economy and prohibited law enforcement from fining people who don't wear masks. CLICK HERE FOR MORE.
How the tax credit plays out will be critical, said Elizabeth Carpenter, a senior vice president at Avalere Health. The change in the tax credit amount may cause some individuals — especially at the lower end of the income scale — to have to pay more for premiums and make coverage unaffordable. From an insurance company's perspective, who continues to buy insurance is critical.

GRUBER: Well look, I think when the law passed we all thought the mandate was a very important part of the law. We have now basically been proven that it's important but not as important as we thought because look, we now have experience of the law without it, they removed the mandate. And we are seeing it weakens the law, it raises premiums, but the law still remains quite strong, albeit not as strong as it would have been.

Bloomberg should have expected these hits. His record with communities of color, his wealth, and his record with women have all come under intense scrutiny in the last week.

If they are unable to secure enough Republican support to break a filibuster, Democrats can skip that process if they use a procedure known as budget reconciliation, where they can pass legislation with a simple majority but are subject to certain rules that could make it more difficult to include some Democratic priorities like the $15 minimum wage increase.

I went to visit my friend, and her roommate said, my God, you should audition for the program just for the hell of it. And I did. And I got in, and they gave me a need-based scholarship for the whole year there. And the joke in my family is that I called my parents, and my mother was apoplectic. I mean, she was screaming on the phone. What is wrong with you? And I said, I'm going to leave GW to go to NYU to study acting. And I said, now, Mom and Dad - I said, when I go back to New York as a returning New Yorker, I'm eligible for all of this financial aid that I lost when I left town.

Bernie Agonistes. For two weeks, as he considers whether to run for president again, Bernie Sanders has gotten questions about female former staffers who say they were harassed during his 2016 campaign. Sanders, who put out a statement reflecting previous stories about the staff issues, went further today. In between the rollout of a prescription drug bill and an appearance with furloughed federal workers, Sanders walked up to Senate microphones and delivered a three-minute response to the news of a $30,000 settlement between his former Iowa campaign manager and two staffers.

The highest-paid U.S. coach in 2018, though, was someone long out of a job: Jurgen Klinsmann, the men's boss who was fired in fall 2016. Because he had a long-term contract, the federation had to make payments of $3.35 million in 2017 and $1.475 million in 2018, totaling more than $4.8 million, tax records show.
It would be a cruel irony if Obama were to turn his back on those here illegally – through no fault of their own – after he helped expose them to risk of deportation, he concluded.
It was early morning last September 20 when Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, leaving a trail of death and destruction. In the months that followed, we've heard a lot about how the storm crippled the island, leaving millions without power, food and water. Now, over the next two days, we're going to take a deeper look at where things went wrong before and after the storm. NPR and the PBS show FRONTLINE have spent the last seven months investigating, and today they reveal a disaster that began long before Maria, a decade of Wall Street dealing that made millions for banks while the island teetered on the edge of financial collapse.
That's a reference to Christie's prosecution of Kushner's father, Charles, while Christie was U.S. attorney for New Jersey in 2005. The elder Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering and served 14 months in federal prison. As part of the plea deal, Charles Kushner admitted recording a sexual encounter between his brother-in-law and a prostitute and sending the tape to his sister in retaliation for what he believed was their cooperation with prosecutors.

Jackson: Mississippi is unconquerable after a year dominated by the coronavirus pandemic and natural disasters including tornadoes that cut wide paths of destruction last Easter, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said in his State of the State speech Tuesday. Speaking on the south steps of the Capitol, Reeves renewed his call for eliminating the state's personal income tax and said he would sign a bill to increase teachers' pay. He called on legislators to make wise investments in workforce training. And he vowed that the state will vaccinate people against COVID-19 as quickly as possible. We need to crush this virus and get back to our way of life, Reeves said. The virus is still here, and it cannot be solved by ignoring it. We have to defeat it because Mississippians are done. We're done burying loved ones who were lost to this virus. We're done with overwhelmed hospitals. We're done with the fearful talk of lockdowns and shutdowns. We're ready for community again. Reeves served eight years as state treasurer and eight as lieutenant governor before becoming governor last January. His first year in the job was dominated by the pandemic, with the first virus cases found in Mississippi in March.
Built by luxury automaker Bugatti, the Veyron is one of the fastest cars in the world, capable of going from 0 to 60 mph in just 2.4 seconds and has a top speed of 254.04 mph. That is what a 16-cylinder, quad-turbocharged engine that generates 1,200-horsepower can achieve. Speed, however, does not typically translate into efficiency. The car gets just 10.4 mpg combined combined fuel economy. After marking its 10-year anniversary this year, production of the Veyron ceased, with a final production run of 450.

Harrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he will follow through on his plan to close another state prison, announced originally in August as a cost-cutting step amid a declining inmate population and rising prison costs. Wolf's administration carried out the required hearings on its plan, which was criticized by the corrections' officers union and state lawmakers whose districts surround Retreat state prison in northeastern Pennsylvania. Retreat, about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre, has about 400 employees and about 940 inmates. Closing could occur in four months at an annual savings of $40 million, the administration said. Employees will be offered jobs at another state prison within 65 miles of Retreat, it said. Retreat was particularly vulnerable to closing: Its original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania's 25 state prisons.

The agency wants the Hermes copper butterfly added to the list in recognition of the threats it faces in its home region of San Diego County, The San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The service filed its proposal Jan. 8, estimating it will take a year to finalize the listing and draw up critical habitat plans for the butterfly. A public comment period for the listing is expected to run through March 9. The Hermes copper lives only in Mexico's Baja California and California's San Diego County, which has a high concentration of endangered species, federal wildlife officials say. The butterfly is among a suite of local species suffering from urban sprawl and wildfires that have altered the landscape in recent decades, officials say.

The Democrats' border-opening legislation comes after the GOP Hill leadership — and the White House's Hill liaison team — failed last winter to enact a DHS funding bill for 2019. During the entire year of 2018, the Senate's GOP leadership did not publicly use any carrots or sticks to win Democratic acceptance to a border security plan acceptable to President Donald Trump, who must now pressure Hill legislators to pass much of the 2018 border security bill which was not passed in 2018.

Annapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan highlighted initiatives to fight violent crime in Baltimore, improve education statewide and protect the environment Tuesday in presenting his budget plan for the next fiscal year. Hogan, a Republican, referenced a violent weekend in the state's largest city in calling on lawmakers to support his crime-fighting proposals this session. On Saturday, 12 people were shot – five of them fatally – in Baltimore. It marked the third time in the past month that at least eight people were shot in a single day. The No. 1 concern of Marylanders by far is crime, Hogan said at a news conference. Citizens are demanding more accountability for the violent criminals for shooting and killing people in the streets of Baltimore. The city had 348 homicides last year, the fifth straight year with more than 300 slayings in the city. It was Baltimore's most violent year ever on a per capita basis.

I worry that focusing on the cause of the financial crisis and Wall Street's seemingly endless proclivity to create complex investments will obscure the larger issue.

They don't understand the inherent conflict of interest that comes with permitting stockbrokers to sell investment products that generate higher fees as long as those investments are deemed suitable. Stockbrokers are under no obligation to advise their clients that lower-fee investments, with higher expected returns, are available.

The table shows the current obligations ratio for each state — the percentage of its revenues currently devoted to paying down its unfunded pension and retiree health care obligations plus interest on its state bonds. The table then compares that ratio to each state's full accrual obligations ratio. This latter ratio was calculated based on two reasonable assumptions — first, that state should pay down their unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities over 30 years, and, second, that annual investment returns of states would average 6% over this period.

Senator Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Budget Committee and an outspoken advocate for raising the minimum wage, said Thursday that he would introduce an amendment to the package to take tax deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don't pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide small businesses with the incentives they need to raise wages.
As Democrats in Congress take the initial steps to pass President Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package using a process that won't require any Republican votes, the White House is working to rack up endorsements from state and local elected officials and business groups — a strategy that it argues is making the bill bipartisan.
The violence Trump incited last week, and the violence his anti-immigrant policies cause stem from the alarming mainstreaming of white nationalist ideology that our country must reckon with and fight to uproot, said Efrén Olivares, deputy legal director of the center's Immigrant Justice Project. The president's planned trip to the border will only further the harm and beget more violence.
There was, in fact, a whole series of mistakes made by political pros, journalists, Muskie strategists and Muskie himself. In the first place, he probably should never have been rated so far ahead. That status was based largely on the fact that national surveys showed him to be the Democrat with the best chance to defeat Nixon -- but those polls do not translate into strength in state primaries. Yet that impression of Muskie's popularity had never really been tested in voting booths nationwide. Muskie had looked cool and impressive as Hubert Humphrey's running mate in 1968, and he exuded much more of a presidential aura than did his G.O.P. counterpart, Spiro Agnew. Yet few voters select a President primarily by looking at the vice presidential candidates, and Muskie's appeal was not really an issue in that election. Muskie was now recognized by most Democratic voters all right, but how did they really feel about him? No one could be sure. Euphoric. Nevertheless, Muskie and his advisers almost euphorically accepted the pleasant notion that he was far ahead of the field -- and they designed a campaign based on that assumption. He would speak cautiously, even vaguely, if need be, on most issues, so as not to antagonize any large blocs of voters. Ignoring his rivals for the nomination, he would campaign against the President. The essence of that campaign would be to portray Nixon as an excitable, expedient politician whose statements were rarely credible.
For the first time in prime time since President Trump took office, all eyes are on the Oval Office.
On that front, however, unknowns remain. While Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that interest rates could remain at historic lows for the foreseeable future, the fate of Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package will rely on his ability to generate some Republican support. In a divided Washington, that will be no easy task.

China's immense workforce helps create a lot of wealth in the U.S. (e.g., Apple grew wildly by using China as its manufacturing backshop) but it tends to make low-skilled workers in the U.S. worse off — not just temporarily, but on a sustained basis. Economists also say that low-cost imports from China hold down prices for U.S. consumers.

If Rebekah Mercer was broke and wasn't a major donor in the Republican party, says a Cruz adviser, nobody would spend two seconds trying to know her… She's not fun. She's just like a series of amoeba cells. The two sides were also diverging ideologically. In the summer of 2015, according to two sources, Rebekah reprimanded Cruz for an April article he'd co-authored with House Speaker Paul Ryan in The Wall Street Journal in support of free trade. She and Bannon told Cruz that he should adopt the positions of Jeff Sessions, whose views on trade and immigration were more in line with the conservative base. By this time, Cruz and his team were becoming increasingly concerned about Bannon's relationship with Rebekah. Bannon (who declined to comment for this article) was now blatantly pro-Trump. Over the course of the primary, Breitbart would publish around 60 pieces disputing that Cruz was eligible to be president because he had been born in Canada. Cruz repeatedly called Rebekah to complain, but she insisted that she had to be fair and impartial. One of his advisers says, We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon. A person close to Bannon counters: There's absolutely no way anyone could manipulate Rebekah Mercer. After the first debate in South Carolina, Rebekah gave Cruz a dressing down on his performance, according to three sources. Given what was going on around him—and what he must have truly felt—he behaved like an absolute gentleman, says a person close to Cruz.
Republicans take a different view. They are willing to give people a tax break to defray health insurance costs, and some Republicans are even willing to extend assistance to lower-income people who don't make enough money to owe income taxes. But Republicans reject the idea of government guaranteeing coverage, and their proposals to replace Obamacare wouldn't even attempt to provide such a guarantee.

Since then, Trump's focus and agenda has turned to more populist priorities, such as a reduction in immigration numbers.

Listen To Trump On Personal Taxes 0:23
In markets where there is little or no competition, companies can employ a pricing strategy that optimizes profits. It is often called a What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB) price. This strategy sets the price based on the maximum price the market will pay for the product. On the one hand, the company wants to realize the highest profits possible in the shortest amount of time to help recoup high start-up costs, such R&D (research and development), production, and marketing costs. On the other, it may not want its profits to be so attractive as to entice cutthroat competition to enter the market within the time window it needs to build market share and establish a leadership position. This strategy typically works because those likely to buy a new product -- the Innovators and Early Adopters -- are not particularly price sensitive. If there is considerable uniqueness and desirability built into the product brand, your company can employ a WTMWB strategy. If not, you might consider other effective pricing strategies.

Before you switch, Ortega recommends looking at your bills holistically, consolidating accounts so you can see a full picture of where your money is going and coming from, and saving enough to cover fixed costs such as rent, mortgage, or car payments for three to six months. If you're taking money out of a 401(k), consider timing that action to when you are making less money and in a lower tax bracket, she said.
Republicans generally favor reducing government spending and enrollment in safety net programs. But kicking people off benefits is unpopular, so it's politically easier to push reforms that sound bureaucratic and benign. The new policy's block grants, for instance, are an administrative maneuver masking a clear goal: reduced spending and fewer people getting benefits. In the 1990s, the Republican Congress and Democratic President Bill Clinton converted cash welfare into block grants, resulting in significantly less aid being provided to low-income families.

They're paying attention because they don't think this guy can be reelected, said Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), who has already visited all 99 counties in his presidential bid.

This year, it's the opposite; Democrats are focused on how we beat this guy in 2020, and they come into the primary process with an open mind.

An administration official said Clinton decided yesterday morning to name Reno, after interviewing her Tuesday. The Florida native, 54, turned aside a question about how she felt about being appointed to a position that was seen as having been reserved for a woman, saying simply, I'm just delighted to be here and I'm going to try my level best. She said her efforts would include restoring civil rights enforcement as one of the top priorities of the department, seeking to protect America's children from abuse and violence and establishing diversion programs to give nonviolent offenders a new start while incarcerating dangerous and career criminals. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said he welcomed the nomination and would schedule a hearing as expeditiously as possible. But committee sources said they did not expect a hearing before next month. Reno, who once swore I would never be a prosecutor because I thought they were more interested in securing convictions than in seeking justice, has been the elected chief prosecutor in Dade County since 1978. She supervises a 900-person office that handles more than 120,000 cases annually. Reno's start in the job was marred by riots that broke out after the 1980 acquittal of four police officers in the beating death of black insurance agent Arthur McDuffie. She has also been criticized for losing several high-profile public corruption cases and for failing to bring charges in other local scandals.

As for my retirement-savings percentage, I have been telling myself that I need to up it to 7% (I'd love to get to 10%) but I have yet to actually do it.

And can we close some loopholes and deductions that, folks who are well-connected and have a lot of accountants and lawyers can take advantage of, so they end up paying lower rates than a bus driver or a cop. Can we close some of those loopholes? If you combine those things together, then we can not only reduce our deficit but we can continue to invest in things like education and research and development that are going to help us grow.
Niedermeyer added that disagreements between Tesla's designers and engineers resulted in numerous revisions to the scope of the contract and eventually led Tesla to drop the second line from its purchase order. The BIW vendor blamed Tesla's high level of turnover in key positions, which Breitbart News has highlighted in the past. Without the second BIW assembly line, Tesla can never produce 10,000 units per week.

It was Bloomberg's first Democratic debate. The former Republican New York City mayor made it on the debate stage after the Democratic Party changed the qualification rules to focus more on poll numbers instead of grassroots donations (Bloomberg is self-funding). From the get-go, the other Democrats on the stage made it clear Bloomberg wasn't getting a first-timer's free pass.

Helena: The Montana House Judiciary Committee held a hearing Wednesday on a bill that seeks to protect free speech on public university campuses in the state – even as university administrators say their campuses already protect free speech. Bill sponsor Rep. Mike Hopkins said current university policy allows some groups, including conservative organizations, to be silenced on campuses, and the measure would ensure students are exposed to a broad range of views even if they do not agree with them. I might make you angry; you might make me angry, said Hopkins, a Republican from Missoula, home to the University of Montana. But I'm not going to shut you up, and you're not going to shut me up. That sentiment was echoed by several university students who spoke in favor of the bill during the hearing. Some said they believed existing policies prevented them from voicing controversial viewpoints on their campuses. The current policies of University of Montana and other colleges around here put at risk that freedom and that right, that responsibility to develop ourselves intellectually and to grapple with things that we may not be comfortable with, said Ethan Holmes, who graduated from the University of Montana in 2019 with a degree in Russian and political science.
If too little is withheld, you could owe money after filing and possibly face a tax penalty if the balance is $1,000 or more, Guarino said. Generally, you can avoid paying the penalty in this case if you paid at least 90% of what you owe or at least as much as you owed during the previous tax year.

Yesterday was a test of three things - money, momentum and movement or organization. It turns out money didn't mean so much. Bloomberg spent a ton of it and didn't do very well. In terms of movement and organization, well, Bernie Sanders had that in spades. Joe Biden only had one field office in California...
Rebekah was incensed that Trump had a tougher immigration policy than Cruz did—she particularly liked Trump's idea for a total ban on Muslims. Subsequently, Cruz proposed a 180-day suspension on all H1-B visas. Meanwhile, even though the Cruz staffers generally got along well with their CA counterparts—they sometimes took the visitors country-western dancing —the firm remained a source of friction. In retrospect, Wilson told people, he believed that Nix resented the campaign for allocating work through a competitive bidding process, rather than favoring CA. Two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Wilson assigned a contract to a firm called Targeted Victory. CA then locked its data in the cloud so it couldn't be accessed by Roe's team. The data remained unavailable until, a Cruz campaign source said, it was pretty much too late to be useful. Cruz won the Iowa caucuses anyway. The Cruz operation became so fed up with Nix that they pushed back, hard, on CA's bill for its second six-month contract. Wilson was able to negotiate the fees down after, as Cruz staffers recalled, a CA representative accidentally emailed him a spreadsheet documenting the Houston team's salaries. (Nix said CA had intended to send the spreadsheet.) Still, the campaign wound up paying nearly $6 million to CA—which represented almost half of the money the Mercers had pledged to spend on Cruz's behalf. The acrimony lingered long after Cruz exited the race in May. When he decided not to endorse Trump at the GOP convention, the Mercers publicly rebuked him.
Looking at others in the industry, Kulp dropped his 12-month price target for Cinemark Holdings Inc. CNK, -0.17% to $36 from $46, maintaining an outperform rating. He said Cinemark's underleveraged balance sheet provides opportunities, with growth in Latin America likely to outperform the domestic market. Cinemark pulls about a quarter of its revenue from Latin America, according to data gathered by FactSet.

Given that a lot of developing countries hold debt denominated in the U.S. dollar, that would essentially increase their debt burden, said Robbie Silverman, a senior adviser at Oxfam. To make good on their debts, he added, foreign governments would have to spend more buying up dollars, leaving less money infrastructure, public health, education and other investments that can help poor countries prosper.

Owning your own vehicle can be a nice convenience, and in some places, it's truly a must. But if you live in or near a city with ample public transportation, you might consider getting rid of that automobile, relying more on buses, trains, or a bicycle, and pocketing the savings. AAA estimates that it costs $8,700 a year, or $725 a month, to own a vehicle. On the other hand, according to LendingTree, the most expensive public-transportation commute in the nation -- in our capital of Washington, D.C. -- costs $237 a month. Compared to $725, that's a $488 monthly savings.

Atlanta: The state is on track to have its new election system ready for the presidential primaries in March, lawyers for the state assured a judge Friday, but critics pushed for a more concrete backup plan in case things don't go as planned. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg tried throughout a conference call to strike a balance between the interests of the two sides while making it clear that she does not consider herself a guarantor for the state's election system rollout. Totenberg is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2017 by election integrity advocates and individual voters who alleged that the state's outdated touch-screen voting machines and election management system, in use since 2002, were not secure and were vulnerable to hacking. Critics argue that the new system has many of the same security vulnerabilities as the old system and that voters can't be sure the barcode read by the scanner accurately reflects their selections.
I want to play something that Elizabeth Warren had said going back to this Bloomberg issue where he does this mea culpa for standing up for stop and frisk, and makes comments about disproportionate crime. Then he walks them back, and he's just throwing money into this race, $150 million already spent, going to spend half-a-billion, I guess, on this race. This is what she said about Bloomberg. Watch.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you were surprised?
Though the industry employs a relatively small share of Americans, the emphasis on manufacturing — a strong sector that nevertheless has lost millions of jobs — may nevertheless resonate with the many Americans who hear that the economy is recovering, yet feel that they no longer have the opportunities for prosperity that they once had.

People walk by a closed restaurant in Rockefeller Center on the last Sunday before Christmas on December 20, 2020 in New York City. Rockefeller Center, where the annual Christmas tree is displayed among other holiday attractions, has far less crowds this year and numerous restrictions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

That's because Idaho residents have been able to claim the full federal personal exemption and standard deduction on their state returns. The new federal law nearly doubled the standard deduction — which may reduce a filer's state tax burden. But it's not enough to offset the loss of personal exemptions for low- and middle-income parents with several kids.

These facts have never changed, we learned these right away. Who worked with Vice President Biden , who wrote a memo the day after somebody talked to him about the call, awaited 18 days to file a complaint, 18 days to file a complaint. What did he do in those 18 days? We all know, ran off and talked with Chairman Schiff's staff. And then hired the legal team that I just talked about, one of those steps in the whole impeachment coup as his legal team has said.

For those of us exhausted both by Trump and by years of polarized infighting — and I am first among partisan sinners on that score — 2020 seems to hold out the promise of reconciliation.

Since then, Commodore has vertically integrated. When Commodore and T.I. faced off again in home computers, Commodore was the winner. Mistake number one for T.I., analysts and competitors say, was getting into a price war with a more agile, lower-cost producer.

Various people who have worked with the Mercers on campaigns told me they didn't pressure their candidates to adopt policies that would benefit the family's financial interests, such as favorable regulations for hedge funds. Instead, their mission was a systemic one. Steve Hantler, a friend of Rebekah's, says she was determined to disrupt the consultant class, which she saw as wasteful and self-serving. She wanted to disrupt the conservative movement, too. Rebekah saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a mechanism to promote a more hard-line ideology. According to Politico and other sources, she was frustrated at the time that no one was taking her seriously. As it happened, however, the family owned what seemed to be an ideal vehicle for achieving her goals. Around 2012, Robert Mercer reportedly invested $5 million in a British data science company named SCL Group. Most political campaigns run highly sophisticated micro-targeting efforts to locate voters. SCL promised much more, claiming to be able to manipulate voter behavior through something called psychographic modeling. This was precisely the kind of work Robert valued. There's no data like more data, he likes to say. Robert had made his money by accumulating piles of data on human behavior (markets might move in a certain direction when it rains in Paris, for instance), in order to make extremely precise and lucrative financial bets. Similarly, SCL claimed to be able to formulate complex psychological profiles of voters.
COSTELLO: Well, if you don't renounce, if you don't point out where he was wrong in very clear and explicit terms, you are destined to be a minority party, and people that were voters who would ordinarily support your legislative agenda or, even more broadly speaking, your governing philosophy are going to say, if you can't do the most basic and commonsense thing, then I can't support you.

Chinese imports did hurt a lot of U.S. workers, but most of that may now be in the rearview mirror. That's because so many factory workers already have been replaced, either by low-wage competitors in other countries, or by technology, just as farm laborers were replaced by tractors a century ago. Because of automation, U.S. manufacturers employ less than 9 percent of the U.S. workforce but generate more than 12 percent of GDP.
Revenue proposals: None of the Republicans suggested raising payroll taxes, but that's another way policymakers could help to close the funding gap. Payroll taxes for Social Security are currently 12.4 percent, split between employers and employees. Raising that rate to about 15 percent would close the funding gap entirely. (There's a separate, 2.9 percent payroll tax for Medicare.) Alternatively, policymakers could apply the payroll tax to more income. Wages and salaries above $117,000 a year are currently exempt from Social Security taxes. If that cap were eliminated, it would solve about 90 percent of the funding gap.
As the Christian Post reported in 2015:
After 7 years of post-recession slow growth, numerous quantitative easing (QE) stimuli, and a doubling of U.S. federal debt, the economy is barely limping on at a stall speed. According to industry experts such as Lacy Hunt, since the introduction of unconventional and untested monetary policy operations like QE, an impressive amount of empirical evidence has emerged that casts considerable doubt on their efficacy. Ex-voting member of the Federal Reserve, Richard Fisher went even further. He told a rare bit of truth-ness in a CNBC interview last year; What the Fed did, and I was part of it, was front-loaded an enormous market rally in order to create a wealth effect...and an uncomfortable digestion period is likely now. The wealth effect did not benefit an average American. In fact, America's middle-class lost nearly 30% of its wealth.

'The very health of our nation is at stake': Biden proposes a $1.9 trillion virus package. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. speaking in Delaware on Thursday. Credit... Kriston Jae Bethel for The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a $1.9 trillion rescue package to combat the economic downturn and the Covid-19 crisis, outlining the type of sweeping aid that Democrats have demanded for months and signaling the shift in the federal government's pandemic response as Mr. Biden prepares to take office. The package includes more than $400 billion to combat the pandemic directly, including money to accelerate vaccine deployment and to safely reopen most schools within 100 days. The very health of our nation is at stake, Mr. Biden said. We have to act and we have to act now. Mr. Biden detailed his so-called American Rescue Plan in an evening speech in Delaware, effectively kicking off his presidency. The Biden package, which would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing, flows from the idea that the virus and the recovery are intertwined. The $20 billion national vaccine program he announced envisions community vaccination centers around the country. Mr. Biden also called for a public health jobs program that would address his goals of bolstering the economy and the Covid-19 response while also rebuilding the nation's fragile public health infrastructure. The proposal would fund 100,000 public health workers to engage in vaccine outreach and contact tracing.

Little Rock: A judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit challenging the early closing time for bars and some restaurants that was temporarily imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The lawsuit argued Gov. Asa Hutchinson and state officials did not have authority to order bars and restaurants to close by 11 p.m. The Republican governor announced the order in November in response to a surge in coronavirus cases, and in December it was extended to Feb. 3. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen, who dismissed the suit, called the rational basis for the early closing time obvious given the number of people who have died from COVID-19 nationally and in the state. Public health and safety concerns is a rational basis for regulating how and when people gather to dine and drink alcoholic beverages in commercial establishments, he wrote. Hutchinson said he was glad Griffen dismissed the suit but said a decision had not yet been made on whether to extend the early closing time. An attorney for the group of Fayetteville bars and restaurants challenging the early time said they were discussing whether to appeal the decision.

The problem for the Republicans when they do this is if we start talking about a 10-point wave year, he says, all of those districts suddenly become competitive in a way that no one would have thought they would be competitive two years ago.
And so it's not the way that we think a judicial system is supposed to work. There's little room for law. There's little room for investigation. There's little room to have the adversarial conversation that we rely on to produce valid cases and valid convictions.

In 1980, the New York Times explained how Trump finessed the zoning board for the development of Trump Tower. After quoting a business partner of Trump's, who said that Trump knows how to get things done in New York, the paper explained: In part, that is a matter of politics. The only donor who gave more money than Trump to the campaign of the incumbent governor, it reported, was the governor's brother. While a deputy mayor also said that Trump could be very convincing when selling a project, a city council member told the Times that Trump runs with the same clique that continues to manipulate things behind the scenes in this city, including links to a Democratic Party machine in Brooklyn connected through his father.
As with any resolution, Anspach said it's critical to devise a plan to make it happen by defining actionable steps and putting them on a calendar, now.

As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote: Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully … Hillary Clinton's proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain the Street's excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can't be watered down – busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.

SCHIFF: That concludes the member questioning. Representative Nunes, you're recognized for any concluding remarks. NUNES: Well Act 1 of today's circus is over. For those of you who have been watching at home, the democrats are no closer to impeachment then where they were three years ago. In the process they've -- the Department of Justice, FBI, State Department, elements within the I.C., the ICIG have all suffered long-term damage. The democrats can continue to put -- to poison the American people with this nonsense. We sat here all morning without any evidence for impeachment which would be a very serious crime, high crime and misdemeanor as it says in the Constitution. No such thing.
Montgomery: Officials said Tuesday that the state will see a slight increase, about 16%, in COVID-19 vaccine doses coming in federal shipments, but the ongoing shortage remains the chief obstacle to getting more people inoculated. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the U.S. is boosting deliveries to hard-pressed states over the next three weeks to increase vaccinations. I'm pleased that Alabama will receive a slight increase in our vaccine supply. Any margin of increase is appreciated, but we have a long way to go to be able to provide them to any Alabamian who wants one, Gov. Kay Ivey said Tuesday. State Health Officer Scott Harris said Alabama will receive an additional 10,000 first doses in its upcoming delivery. The state had been receiving about 50,000 to 60,000 first doses each week but will see that jump to 70,000 in coming weeks, according to numbers supplied by Harris. That does not include second doses, and Harris said it is unclear if the increase will be sustained longer than three weeks. Ivey said the state will also have the flexibility to redistribute unused doses in the federal program to vaccinate nursing home residents.
Investors in the sector seem to be worried that the combination of Joe Biden's White House win and the likelihood of Democrats controlling both houses of Congress may lead to more regulations for big tech firms, higher corporate taxes and increased antitrust scrutiny.
But some provisions present potential business pitfalls. The bill would generally provide less financial support to lower-income people who currently sign up for insurance through the exchanges. That could create big problems for insurers if it deters people — especially healthy people — from buying coverage, as insurers depend on a mix of healthy and sick people to keep their plans profitable and premiums affordable.
John Kasich: If you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it. It will simply be less.

Indeed, the one notable exception was in 2018, when Trump's proposal to severely restrict immigration ― long a priority of top policy aide Stephen Miller ― was given a vote on the Senate floor and received just 41 yeas, the fewest of any of the plans under consideration that day.
Meanwhile, dozens of state and local officials are issuing sweeping orders to close school for millions of children and shut down bars and restaurants for all but takeout orders.

Eventually, I turned to the C.F.P.B. itself, filling out a simple form on its website. A few weeks later, I was notified that the bank had been deducting money from my account for years, and I was being refunded more than $11,000. Having financed my own maternity leave, I badly needed the money.

Nationwide, the bipartisan establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.
The solution to our complex business tax code is to follow Milton Friedman's lead and eliminate all tax subsidies and lower rates so the free market can work without the government picking winners and losers. That's a true conservative's position. Speaker Ryan's proposals, on the other hand, pick the rich as winners and the rest of us as losers. That's a plutocrat's proposal and should be identified as such. We need to remember that the real function of the government is to protect the public from those who would abuse the system to enhance their power.

China, after reporting a rare virus death, says its active caseload exceeds 1,000. A quarantine center under construction in Shijiazhuang, a city of 11 million people in northern China. Credit... Yang Shiyao/Xinhua, via Associated Press China's National Health Commission said on Friday that more than 1,000 people nationwide were being treated for Covid-19, a day after the country reported its first coronavirus death on the mainland since May. The commission said that 144 new cases had been recorded on Thursday, the highest daily figure since a series of new outbreaks began at the end of last year. Of 1,001 total patients in China, the commission said, 26 were reported to be in serious condition. While the toll remains far lower than in other countries, the surge is challenging the government's much-touted success in wresting the coronavirus under control. Hebei, the northern province surrounding Beijing that has been hardest hit in the latest surge, reported 90 more cases on Thursday. New outbreaks have also appeared in the central province of Shaanxi and in Guangxi, a southern province that borders Vietnam. The new outbreaks suggest that the virus is once again spreading widely despite the measures China has taken, including electronic monitoring and new lockdowns. More than 28 million people have been ordered to remain inside their homes — more than the number affected last January when the central government locked down Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first reported.

In short, the new federal restriction on SALT deductions will open up a new window on reforming state benefit plans with large unfunded liabilities. As voters absorb the financial implications of the new restriction, they will probably oppose tax increases and service cuts to deal with these liabilities. Instead, they will pressure elected officials to renegotiate benefit plans to the extent legally permissible.

DeVos has said she regrets not pushing the issue harder earlier in Trump's term, when Republicans controlled the House and the Senate. Her best chance was probably in a sweeping tax bill, signed in 2017, but the White House did not include school choice proposals even in its blueprint for the bill.

However, the most recent Pew polling shows anti-trade sentiments have now surged among Republicans (with 40 percent calling free trade a good thing vs. 52 percent seeing it as a bad thing). Those who support candidate Donald Trump are especially anti-trade (67 percent said it was a bad thing vs. 27 percent a good thing). Even though Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have said they oppose the TPP, most Democrats support trade (60 percent good thing vs. 30 percent bad thing).
These large increases in state revenues are not feasible, as illustrated by Illinois. To cope with its mammoth unfunded benefit obligations, Illinois has sharply raised tax rates on both individuals and businesses over the past few years. But higher tax rates in Illinois have backfired — driving local residents and firms to other states. In 2015, for example, Illinois lost $4.75 billion in adjusted gross income to other states, according to IRS data.

Strict safeguards should protect schools from the virus variant, experts say. Students boarding a school bus after school let out at Eneida M. Hartner Elementary School in Miami, Fla., on Monday, Nov. 30, 2020. Credit... Scott McIntyre for The New York Times When a more contagious coronavirus variant first surfaced in early December, some researchers initially suggested that unlike with previous versions of the virus, children might be just as susceptible to the new variant as adults. Recent research from Public Health England may put those fears to rest. Based on detailed contact-tracing of about 20,000 people infected with the new variant — including nearly 3,000 children under 10 — the report showed that young children were about half as likely as adults to transmit the variant to others. That was true of the previous iteration of the virus, as well. There was a lot of speculation at the beginning suggesting that children spread this variant more, said Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government. That's really not the case. But the variant does spread more easily among children, just as it does among adults. The report estimated that the new variant is about 30 percent to 50 percent more contagious than its predecessors — less than the 70 percent researchers had initially estimated, but high enough that the variant is expected to pummel the United States and other countries, as it did Britain.

That's according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office, which assessed the IRS' performance last year during the coronavirus pandemic and outlined some risks to the 2021 tax season. The reason for the surge in interest payments due to late refunds is tied to the coronavirus outbreak, which caused a backlog of paper tax returns and prompted the IRS to delay the tax filing season by three months.

Decency and doggedness -- traits that served him well when he first ran for Congress in 1956, traveling the dusty side roads for one-to-one meetings in farmhouses and general stores. Taken singly, the encounters were insignificant; taken together, they meant the margin of victory. Recalls Journalist Harl Andersen, who covered the campaign for the Associated Press: George only builds a stone at a time. After a while, though, it begins to show up. In 1962 he moved on to the Senate, winning a seat by only 597 votes. One of the earliest and most persistent antiwar Senators, McGovern began building a small but strong following with his co- sponsorship of the 1968 McGovern-Hatfield resolution calling for an end to the war. Though unsuccessful, the legislation occasioned a rare flash of fire from the quiet man. Every Senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. McGovern fumed. This chamber reeks of blood! When Robert Kennedy was assassinated, McGovern sought to keep Bobby's antiwar supporters together by entering the race in his stead less than three weeks before the 1968 convention. Though he polled only 146 1/2 of the 2,622 delegate votes, the effort gave McGovern the presidential bug. The candidate of 1972 has changed little; he is still the personable but plodding campaigner. McGovern's success is a combination of his persistence and a new, high-powered, appealingly unprofessional organization.

Joe Biden should be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security. The facts are very clear: Biden not only pushed to cut Social Security ― he is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement on Saturday evening. The vice president must stop dodging questions about his record, and start explaining why he has so aggressively pushed to slash one of the most significant and successful social programs in American history, which millions of Americans rely on for survival.

Columbia: A bill that would assure lawmakers have a chance to change or end a prolonged state of emergency from Gov. Henry McMaster passed the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic, now more than 10 months old, exposed some problems with South Carolina's emergency law, which had not been altered in almost 60 years except to add the words public health emergency in 2002. Under current law, McMaster can only issue an emergency declaration for 15 days before the General Assembly has to weigh in. To avoid that, the Republican governor has issued different declarations with incremental changes every two weeks or so. He issued the 22nd such order Friday. The bill would allow the General Assembly to weigh in within 30 days. They could end or continue a state of emergency with one vote of each chamber or alter it through a more lengthy process. If they don't meet, the emergency declaration would last as long as the governor wishes. The current emergency law was created in a time when people thought more of hurricanes and less about pandemics and modern governments that require continuity and quick reactions, whether it means shutdowns or rapid vaccine rollouts.

The U.K. bans travel from Latin America and Portugal, citing concern about a Brazilian variant. A TAP Air Portugal check-in desk at Heathrow Airport in London last month. Britain has banned travelers from Portugal and Latin America, citing concern about a new variant of the coronavirus. Credit... Niklas Halle'N/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Britain said on Thursday that it would ban arrivals from Latin American countries and Portugal over fears of a coronavirus variant discovered in Brazil. In recent weeks, British authorities have already struggled to contain the spread of a different coronavirus variant discovered in Britain that is more contagious than its predecessors. At least two coronavirus variants are currently circulating in Brazil, and at least one has slipped its borders, traveling to Japan. Japanese authorities found one of those variants in four people traveling from Brazil earlier this week. The variant contains a mutation that has been linked with higher contagiousness, similar to the variant found in Britain and another in South Africa. Like the variant found in South Africa, the one exported from Brazil to Japan also carries a mutation that may weaken the efficacy of vaccines. This same mutation has also been identified in the other coronavirus variant recently discovered in Brazil. Experts have cautioned, however, that it would be very difficult for new variants of the coronavirus to evade vaccines entirely. The British ban is set to come into effect on Friday at 4 a.m., the transportation secretary Grant Shapps said on Twitter.

To address the severe economic shock currently gripping the country, the Trump administration is working on an emergency stimulus proposal of at least $1 trillion that includes $50 billion in loans for the airline industry, which has been hit hard by the crisis.

According to The Washington Post, those might include hotels, casinos, cruise lines, and the oil and gas industry.

Trump's rejection of trade deals fits with one of his own broader campaign narratives: rejecting the establishment. Many Republicans — and, importantly, the Chamber of Commerce, which has given heavy financial support to Republican candidates — support free trade.

But ideology can't explain all of Warren's struggles with independents. Sanders, who is to her left, actually does better with independents than with registered Democrats in the Monmouth survey. That's partially because Sanders, who has long refused to officially join the Democratic Party, is seen as a less partisan figure. Warren, who rocketed to liberal fame in part because of her willingness to take on other Democrats, has downplayed her past criticisms in an attempt to become a consensus, unifying figure.
But the President is looking at the Mueller investigation coming to a conclusion perhaps sometime in the next few months. The President is looking at a situation where he's already done a tax cut into a full employment environment. So if there's a recession, let's say, what stimulative things can he approach Congress with at this point? It is going to be a tough sled for any chief of staff for any White House in this next Congress, I think.

A loan could also be delayed if a lender tries to verify a Social Security number. That's often required if something in an application doesn't match the information associated with a Social Security number in a credit report or other database, even if it's just a typo. If the lender tries to verify the number with the Social Security Administration, and no one at the agency answers the phone, that borrower could be out of luck.

Seattle: The Seattle Police Department's civilian watchdog has found that an officer's ruse in a 2018 hit-and-run case contributed to the driver's suicide. The Office of Police Accountability said that to get the suspect to turn himself in, the officer told one of the suspect's friends that the crash left a woman in critical condition and that she might not survive, The Seattle Times reports. In reality, it was a fender-bender with no injuries. The driver's friend told him what the officer had said, and the driver began to think he had possibly hit a pedestrian without knowing it. The friend reported that the driver had been addicted to heroin for two decades and became increasingly despondent over the possibility he killed someone. Soon thereafter, in June 2018, he died by suicide. The officer was suspended for six days without pay.

But this time, the prop revolvers were loaded with live bullets, and half the audience thought the drama was real. Hawley's decision to challenge the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory transformed the process into a farce, in which Cruz and other Republican senators promised to outdo one another's displays of loyalty to President Trump — until a mob of Trump supporters invaded the Capitol. Their gambit was too jaundiced even for Mitch McConnell (whose biographer dubbed him The Cynic); the majority leader exhorted senators to respect the people's choice and not rely on others to do the right thing.

Also important, Zucman argues, the higher threshold means only a small group will be affected. And smaller groups have a harder time fighting for exemptions, which hurt European efforts.

And that's fair — but it also means that Trump at no point was able to use those zoning-board skills to persuade even eight Democrats to join his view of an issue. At one point, a deal seemed to be in the works with the Democratic minority, trading wall money for the protection of immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

When we left off, she was describing how people accused of misdemeanors who don't have extra cash on hand face a backlogged justice system with public defenders who don't have adequate time or resources to properly defend their clients, so the clients are often encouraged to take a plea whether or not they're guilty.

The single most important idea to remember is that in such a large economy, well, it's complicated. Consider this example:
New Realism So, tonight we come to you with a new realism: Ready for the future, and recapturing the best in our tradition. We know that America must have a strong defense, and a sober view of the Soviets. We know that government must be as well-managed as it is well-meaning. We know that a healthy, growing private economy is the key to the future. We know that Harry Truman spoke the truth when he said: A President . . . has to be able to say yes and no, but mostly no. Look at our platform. There are no defense cuts that weaken our security; no business taxes that weaken our economy; no laundry lists that raid our Treasury. We are wiser, stronger, and focused on the future. If Mr. Reagan wants to re-run the 1980 campaign: Fine. Let them fight over the past. We're fighting for the American future - and that's why we're going to win this campaign. One last word to those who voted for Mr. Reagan. I know what you were saying. But I also know what you were not saying. You did not vote for a $200 billion deficit. You did not vote for an arms race. You did not vote to turn the heavens into a battleground. You did not vote to savage Social Security and Medicare. You did not vote to destroy family farming. You did not vote to trash the civil rights laws. You did not vote to poison the environment.

Greifner also likes Michaels Cos. MIK, -0.23% , a large arts-and-crafts retail chain. Unlike a lot of retailers, Michaels isn't beaten down by worries about competition from Amazon. But this makes sense, says Greifner, because customers like to see and touch crafts products before they buy them, to make sure they are right for the task at hand.

The top trade adviser said the previous administration wasted numerous opportunities to address this in the face of crises that underscored this dependence, such as during the H1N1, SARS and MERS crises.
At first the DMV started counting the pennies using automated coin counting machines, but the machines were jamming so they are now counting the pennies by hand, and have been doing so ever since, he said.
GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: And so again, I regret that our attorney general is in this position. But this is a decision that he's going to need to make.

Given how hard repealing Obamacare has been so far, there's little reason to assume it will get much easier. So for all intents and purposes those taxes will stand indefinitely. They include a high-income Medicare surtax on investment income and on wages over $200,000 ($250,000 if married).
RAINBOW: (Singing) He said - I guess that he was right.
Unemployment rate By Ella Koeze · Seasonally adjusted · Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics Hiring has slowed every month since June, and the economy lost more than nine million jobs in 2020 as a whole, the first calendar-year decline since 2010 and the worst on a percentage basis since the aftermath of World War II. Congress last month passed a $900 billion relief package that will provide temporary support to households and businesses and could give a boost to the broader economy. And in the longer run, the arrival of coronavirus vaccines should allow the return of activity that has been suppressed by the pandemic. But the vaccine and the aid came too late to prevent a sharp slowdown in growth. We did have a pullback in the economy, said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. If stimulus was passed earlier, maybe that could have been avoided.

Trump has already responded to the jibe, calling it disgraceful before turning to Twitter to attack Democrats. He wrote, They only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020, too much success!
In fact, the IRS was doing little more than focusing its attention exactly where the president of the United States told it to focus – on the groups the president himself identified as a threat to democracy.
So if he was the source, why not say so? Perhaps because Kelly spoke to the authors on background or for some other level of attribution.
And she brought a lawsuit. She asked the Supreme Court to hold that it's unreasonable for police officers to effectuate what we call full-fledged custodial arrest - that is, lock someone up, book them, take them to jail for a crime like hers, for which she could not have gone to jail. It was a fine-only traffic offense. And the Supreme Court ruled against her.
GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes. He is and I support that. And-- and if these accusations are determined to be true, I don't think he is going to have any other option but to resign.
INDIANOLA, Iowa (AP) — Joe Biden has called for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign to disown what he calls doctored video that some Sanders supporters say shows the former vice president endorsing Republican calls to cut Social Security and Medicare.

It's often helpful to reference these rights when talking with the IRS, says Glen Frost, a tax attorney in Columbia, Md. When talking with the IRS, Frost says he often points out that it's the taxpayer's right to be heard, for example.
According to what Engle says are Tesla's reported numbers, approximately 7,000 Model 3 vehicles are being kept in storage and without buyers. This amounts for approximately two weeks worth of vehicles at Tesla's current production rate. Combined with the $2,000 price slash across all of the company's vehicles in an attempt to offset the phase-out of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle owners, and a general drop in Model 3 sales, it's understandable why many investors believe that the coming year will show a lack of demand for Tesla's vehicles. Even as the company plans to expand their European sales, Goldman Sachs sees an imminent lull in demand.
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I had the honor of speaking to a group of veterans this past weekend. And what I said to them was that no words, no words are really adequate or sufficient to fully express our gratitude for their service to our nation.

Nearly one-third of people who received a stimulus check last summer used it to pay bills and, in a Twitter poll TWTR, +1.37% of 889,000 people, over 60% said a $600 payment would not be enough to get by on. It's half of what folks got last time. Another YouGov poll said bills were the No. 1 priority for stimulus-check spending. It's alarming to look at how many Americans used these funds to keep a roof over their head and pay for necessities, said the report by YouGov.
It marks the first US junk bond issuance since late November.
Republicans supported trillions in pandemic relief spending last year, but at a confirmation hearing for Biden's Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen, Republicans prodded the former chair of the Federal Reserve about how much spending is too much.

The closing questions and debates in this impeachment trial represent much more than a partisan fight over power. They represent a fundamental challenge to the rule of law and the separation of powers. If hyper-partisan polarization is enough to make senators forget their oaths and even their own power as a co-equal branch of government, they will be setting a dangerous precedent that takes aim at the heart of our democracy at a time when autocracies are on the rise around the world.

They know that the system is rigged when the average person is working longer hours for lower wages, while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.

All the Republican candidates say they want to leave Social Security as it is for people who are already retired, or soon will be. But Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have proposed changes for younger workers.

If the public understood that Senator Warren is, in truth, a free market conservative and Speaker Ryan is a plutocratic proponent and not a free market conservative, don't you think that it might have an impact? Its time to end he said she said reporting. Its time for the media to analyze the various tax proposals and reveal them for what they are. Fortunately, Tax Notes provides a forum for experts to do just that. The real question is whether the New York Times and the rest of the general media will translate that information we provide into terms that the public can understand so they have the information they need to make rational decisions.

Trump's tax plan is where he hews much more closely to other Republicans' ideas. In fact, he recently overhauled his initial tax plan (which has been removed from his website) in favor of a new plan with brackets that match those proposed by House Republicans, though Trump has said would also add in a zero bracket. His new plan would lower the top rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, and with that zero bracket would have only four brackets, down from the current seven.

Reform movements, championing school choice, public charters, merit pay, and other proven innovations, gained support in minority communities and even won in local school board elections — only to be crushed, repeatedly, by teachers-union-backed candidates at the state level. For California's children, a decade of underachievement in public schools could have lifelong effects.

Travel from Portugal to the U.K. will also be suspended given its strong travel links with Brazil, Mr. Shapps added, although truck drivers transporting essential goods from Portugal will be exempted. Britain has already banned flights from South Africa. Brazil banned flights from Britain on Christmas Day. British authorities have come under criticism from opposition lawmakers for delaying a travel ban from Latin America, but they have argued that implementing such measures takes time, and that travelers coming from these countries had to quarantine for 10 days upon arrival. United Kingdom Coronavirus Map and Case Count A detailed map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with charts and tables of the number of cases and deaths. What we need to ensure is that when we make these very, very important decisions that have a huge impact on people's personal lives, but also businesses, we have got to have a little bit of time, the Home Office junior minister Victoria Atkins said on Sky News. In the past week, Britain has faced some of its deadliest days since the beginning of the pandemic, and health authorities have warned that the country's health care system was on the brink of collapse. Authorities have warned that they may tighten nationwide lockdown measures if the public doesn't stay at home. Britain has reported nearly 85,000 deaths, the heaviest death toll in Europe.

The rust belt by contrast saw a net outflow of more than 400,000 residents with college degrees between 2007 and 2014. The customers are heading south too. From 1990 to 2015, population in the nine southern and gulf states grew 43 percent, to more than 76 million, and passed that of the rust belt states in the late 1990s.

The calculator cautions consumers that a detailed analysis of family finances could produce a considerably different result. It points them to the net price calculator to get more information. Levine said financial circumstances can be especially tricky for students from divorced families. But he noted that retirement savings are not included in the formula. The calculator only asks about retirement savings to ensure that families don't include that sort of funding when they seek aid estimates.

Montpelier: A bill has been proposed in the Legislature to decriminalize adult prostitution. The legislation is co-sponsored by four female legislators. Rep. Selene Colburn, a Burlington progressive, said she thinks decriminalizing sex work will improve safety and health of prostitutes, mynbc5.com reports. The underlying question is do we need to criminalize consensual sex between adults on any terms? she said. Sex trafficking, exploitation and solicitation of minors will remain a serious felony, she said. The bill is in the House Judiciary Committee.

But as Warren stumbles out of a third-place finish in Iowa and seeks the game-changing result in New Hampshire that she failed to get in the Midwest, her pitch has a problem: Many of the voters she needs to win over aren't Democrats at all. Public polling here has shown Warren running strong with registered Democrats but performing poorly with the independents who plan to cast ballots in the Democratic race and often play a crucial role in Granite State politics.

GROSS: In your book, you write that you were a federal public defender in Baltimore from 2000 to 2003. And one of the things you learned from the people you represented there was that there was a very messy calculation of punishment - trying to decide, like, whether to plead guilty or pay a fine or you know. Give us a sense of what that calculation of punishment is when you're facing a misdemeanor charge and you don't have much money.

REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: --it's more detention beds when-- when we look at-- at ICE versus detention-- detention beds and what they're talking about is those who come across the border illegally, cutting down on the number of beds which would actually force them being released into the United States and so it's-- it's more of an open border policy that some Democrats have supported in the past. And-- and I don't think that-- that's-- in fact I know that's not going to be supported by this administration.

To me, every American is entitled to certain inalienable rights. And if we are judging folks by things other than just them being a human being, then that's a problem. And I think the flip side for Republicans that gets Democrats in trouble is when we just focus on identity politics, which, to me, is very cancerous in our society. But we're not able to have that debate if we have people storming the Capitol with Confederate flags and saying and doing things on social media that are just outright hateful. It disgusts me. And you can't play to that. You have to outright reject it. And you have to say, I'm not interested in your support. I don't want your support. And if you can't say that clearly and quickly, then people are going to assume the worst.

Choteau: An ice jam that has caused flooding along a creek in central Montana had nearly submerged a town park and was rising into residents' basements and crawl spaces, leading the city to declare a state of emergency Friday. The ice jam came after subzero temperatures and was exacerbated by high ground water. It is likely to remain until warmer temperatures thaw the blocked culverts and stream beds. Water up to 6 inches deep was reported on some streets after ice traveling down Spring Creek was backed up, weather officials said. The ice jam came after temperatures dropped to 20 degrees below zero, officials said. Residents were encouraged to take shorter showers and reduce the amount of times toilets are flushed to avoid overwhelming the sewer system. Sewer main lines were completely filled, and crews sandbagged manholes in the area to avoid further surface water infiltration, city officials said.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American household spends $3,008 a year, or $250 a month, on restaurants and takeout. But because most food establishments charge a 300% markup on what they serve, spending that much each year means throwing away a good $2,000 all-in. If you were to cut that spending in half, you'd have an extra $1,000 a year to save, invest, or use to pay down debt.
Dover: Making mail-in voting permanent, mandating higher use of renewable energy and more than doubling education funding for disadvantaged students are among Democratic Gov. John Carney's plans for Delaware. Carney outlined those and other goals, including providing body cameras for every police officer in Delaware, in an online State of the State address Tuesday. He also pledged to continue working to ensure that as many Delawareans as possible receive the COVID-19 vaccine, even as restrictions he imposed on businesses and individuals remain in place. Over the course of my 30 years in public service, and even during the course of this administration, I have seen government tackle countless, serious and complicated challenges, Carney said while discussing the pandemic. Nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to the last ten months. Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus, civil unrest, racial tensions and a contentious election, Carney described the state of the state as resilient. It's determined. It's strong. And it's getting stronger, he said.
OOF: Insurers have pocketed more than $9 billion in taxpayer funds by overestimating their annual costs for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, the Wall Street Journal's Joseph Walker and Christopher Weaver report.

Garland would also return to a Justice Department radically different than the one he left. The Sept. 11 attacks was years away, the department's national security division had not yet been created and a proliferation of aggressive cyber and counterintelligence threats from foreign adversaries have made counties like China, Russia and North Korea top priorities for federal law enforcement.

HERMAN CAIN (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think it is an opening for president Trump to woo black voters because President Trump is trying to woo the United States of America. The results that this president has been able to achieve have helped all people. That is the difference. The Democrats and the liberals continue to think that there are specific things that they can say or do that's going to woo black voters. The only thing that black voters and brown voters have in common is that they are black and brown. They are not politically aligned. They are not ideologically aligned. They're no monolithic. So to try to put them in a homogeneous group as one group all the time is a mistake. And all you have to do is look at the reputable polls, and you will see that the support for President Trump from black people has grown and grown and grown.

Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce join a push for digital vaccination credentials. Tech companies are working to create a digital version of the Covid-19 vaccination cards that are used to track vaccination timelines. Credit... Tim Gruber for The New York Times Airlines, workplaces and sports stadiums may soon require people to show their coronavirus vaccination status on their smartphones before they can enter. A coalition of leading technology companies, health organizations and nonprofits — including Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, Cerner, Epic Systems and the Mayo Clinic — said on Thursday that they were developing technology standards to enable people to obtain and share their immunization records through health passport apps. For some period of time, most all of us are going to have to demonstrate either negative Covid-19 testing or an up-to-date vaccination status to go about the normal routines of our lives, said Dr. Brad Perkins, the chief medical officer at the Commons Project Foundation, a nonprofit in Geneva that is a member of the vaccine credential initiative. That will happen, Dr. Perkins added, whether it's getting on an airplane and going to a different country, whether it's going to work, to school, to the grocery store, to live concerts or sporting events. Vaccine passport apps could fill a significant need for airlines, employers and other businesses. In the United States, the federal government has developed paper cards that remind people who receive coronavirus vaccinations of their vaccine manufacturer, batch number and date of inoculation.

The feistiest debate of the 2020 presidential election cycle came three days before the Nevada caucuses, and it's understandable why. The first two contests of the primary race, in Iowa and New Hampshire, were a wash. And in two weeks, a third of all the delegates in the Democratic primary will be decided in one day, likely sealing the fate of most of the candidates in the race.

Dr. Lubarsky suggested that the state should hand more vaccine doses over to health care providers, who already have the ability to reach out to patients selectively, including harder-to-reach patients like those with lower incomes or who are undocumented. We know who's at risk, he said. Jonah Frohlich, a San Francisco-based health care consultant, said that a combination of factors had left county public health departments scrambling to cope with a deluge of monumental tasks. The same institutions that are trying to manage testing, contact tracing and supports for people, Mr. Frohlich said, are the same people who are managing the distribution of the vaccine. Worse, he said, they must work with often outdated and overwhelmed information systems, and organize it all on the fly. This is the kind of program and process that should take years to implement, he said. The counties are doing the best they can, Mr. Frohlich said, but there is a real human cost to delaying the rollout of the vaccine.

That is one reason why California has ended up with government debt that is at least $1.3 trillion and may actually be closer $2.3 trillion. The state's pension liability alone is $1 trillion. Plus California is still racking up new liabilities for pet projects like former Governor Jerry Brown's $100 billion high-speed train to nowhere. The new governor, Gavin Newsome, has promised to provide health care for illegal immigrants, which won't be cheap. And yet with the nation's highest top income tax rate, there are few feasible new sources of revenue.
If President Donald Trump loses in 2020 (and it is by no means certain that he will), his defeat will come at the hands of a coalition led by the Democratic Party that will be composed, in the main, of energized and angry Democrats. In swing states, they could get the support of a small but important cadre of independents and surburbanites who tended to vote Republican in the past, and an even smaller handful of disaffected former Republicans for whom tax cuts and judges were not enough to keep them in their party.

Believe it or not, Senator Elizabeth Warren is closer to Milton Friedman's description of a conservative than Speaker Paul Ryan. But you'd never know it because the mainstream media has tagged Warren as a Progressive and Ryan as a Conservative. Milton Friedman, the godfather of free market conservatism, believed the market worked best when the government didn't pick winners and losers. Even a cursory examination of most of Warren's proposals shows that she is proposing just that, to remove tax subsidies for those who can afford to hire lobbyists and attend expensive fund raisers. Ryan, on the other hand, has been proposing tax subsidies or tax cuts for the very rich in the hope that, once digested by them, some of the remains might benefit the rest of us. Ryan, in short, is a plutocrat enabler, not a conservative and the media has an obligation to inform the public about what he is really proposing.
Ford will idle a Kentucky factory as the auto industry grapples with a semiconductor shortage. A Ford Exposition SUV being assembled in Louisville, Kentucky. Credit... Nick Carey/Reuters Ford Motor said on Friday that it will idle a plant in Louisville, Ky., for one week beginning Monday because of a shortage of semiconductors that is causing disruptions in auto factories around the world. Ford's Louisville assembly plant operates two shifts a day, employs about 4,000 workers, and makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair sport-utility vehicles. The automaker said it would cancel a week of downtime scheduled for later in the year at the plant to leave its output unchanged for the year A second Ford plant in Louisville has not been affected by the semiconductor shortage. That plant makes the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Explorer S.U.V.s, and the company's F-series Super Duty pickup trucks. Volkswagen last month warned that the semiconductor shortage would likely cause production delays at its plants in China and elsewhere. Honda and Nissan have also been affected by the shortage, according to Nikkei, the Japanese news organization. General Motors said on Friday that it has not been affected by the shortage but is monitoring the matter closely. Semiconductors play an increasingly important role in cars, controlling engines, brakes, transmissions, driver displays and other systems. Earlier this year, when auto sales fell because of the coronavirus pandemic, semiconductor manufacturers shifted their production to chips used for consumer electronics, Volkswagen said last month.

The U.S. Supreme Court has opined that health care benefits of retirees may be legally modified at the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement – unless expressly guaranteed for life. So the scope of health care benefits and premium sharing by public retirees will become a subject of political negotiation between elected officials and public unions.

Azar acknowledges a top C.D.C. official was right in her February warning about mass disruption. Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, criticized China's handling of the pandemic at a Heritage Foundation forum on Thursday. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times The U.S. secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, excoriated China on Thursday for its bullying of international experts and scientists and acknowledged for the first time that a top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was correct when she warned in February that the novel coronavirus might cause a severe disruption to American lives. The official, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, was muzzled for nine months after issuing the Feb. 25 warning, which threw the stock market into a nosedive and infuriated President Trump, who was on his way back from India at the time. But she was merely repeating what she had learned from a White House Task Force meeting days earlier, Mr. Azar recalled. She got a little ahead of the briefing of the president and the official announcement, Mr. Azar said. But she and we were correct. Mr. Azar made his comments to the Heritage Foundation, during an online seminar that was billed as a talk about lessons learned from the pandemic. He spent much of it describing how China rebuffed offers of help from the United States — and thwarted American efforts to learn more about the virus that has now claimed more than 380,000 American lives.
They know that they probably won't get too many answers or too many participants, especially now in this environment, explains Wright, who has worked on outreach to the Haitian community in Brooklyn. Let's face it: There's a lot of undocumented people in the community. And that makes them suspicious to talk to anybody.
Yes. They have an endless supply of money. But we have something they don't have. And that is that when millions of working families stand together, demanding fundamental changes in our financial system, we have the power to bring about that change.
If Congress seems to have gotten more done in the last week than in the rest of the year, that may not be an accident. Christmas, or rather the possibility of missing Christmas, can be a powerful motivator on Capitol Hill.

Introducing steep taxes on short-term stock market trading and/or outright prohibition on high frequency trading would be a good start, but a serious way to combat inequality is progressive taxation of the super-rich income and their assets, both at home and abroad. Two or three percent increase would bring hundreds of billions of dollars into the public purse, the money that could be used to rebuild or improve municipal infrastructures, create quality jobs, help young Americans get an affordable education, and lower the national debt.

Like nearly every pragmatic elected official across the political spectrum, Governor Wolf recognizes the compelling environmental and economic benefits of clean-burning American natural gas, said Marcellus Shale Coalition president David Spigelmyer, in a statement. Natural gas remains a strong source of job creation, especially for our building trades and construction laborers, while boosting manufacturing, consumer savings and air quality.
To the authors' credit, the on-the-record elements are compelling on their own. These include attributed material from former strategist Steve Bannon, former transition chief (and former New Jersey governor) Chris Christie and some of Trump's Manhattan peers, Tom Barrack Jr. and Chris Ruddy.

Gottlieb plans to write letters to the companies to criticize them for publicly pledging to remove nicotine flavor pods from store shelves, while secretly negotiating a financial partnership that seems to do the opposite, the New York Times's Sheila Kaplan reports.

After initially saying it would require everyone to file a tax return, the IRS said it would use Social Security data to deliver the payments to people receiving Social Security retirement or disability insurance. But people who don't receive those particular benefits still have to file.
For example, in 1996, the Queens Library system in New York hired a professional collection agency to collect the daily late fines, as well as the missing materials that consumers didn't return. Having a library fine sent to collections could result in an almost laughably low fine, but it could have an impact on your credit report and/or credit score for years.

This intervention must be structured to reach low-income households without federal income-tax liabilities. (To be clear, these households do pay other federal taxes, most notably payroll taxes.) This is a huge limitation of the federal tax cuts under consideration by the Trump administration.

Crime: Though crime remains at historically low levels, the past decade saw periods of increased crime in many areas, thanks in part to ill-conceived prison reforms such as Proposition 47, which focused on reducing sentences and downgrading many crimes. Notorious crimes committed by illegal aliens — such as the killing of Kate Steinle in 2015 — became national symbols of the lack of immigration enforcement and a general decline in the rule of law.
Anticipating the policy agenda of the incoming Biden administration is a key focus for investors in the new year, Jason Pride, chief investment officer, private wealth at Glenmede wrote in a team strategy note Monday.

Williams also downplays fears that the economic stimulus from the tax overhaul will lead to an excessive run-up in wage growth and inflation, especially with the 4.1% unemployment rate already sparking worker shortages. He points to long-term factors that have suppressed consumer price increases, such as slower-growing health care costs due to reduced government spending on Medicare.

Trenton: The state is set to get a 30% increase in COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next three weeks, a top health official said Wednesday. New Jersey's allotment of vaccines from the federal government will rise from about 100,000 doses a week to 130,000 for three weeks, Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. The boosted figure comes after President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that his administration would increase how much states got by about 16%. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy praised the Biden administration for setting a three-week window instead of a one-week interval that was in effect under the previous White House. More vaccines are desperately needed as the state aims to ramp up administration of the shots, with about 643,000 given so far since mid-December, Murphy said. The larger amount is still well below the 470,000 doses New Jersey officials calculated would be needed to meet demand. The state saw 107 additional deaths from the virus overnight, putting the total toll at 19,091. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases fell over the past two weeks from 6,190 a day Jan. 12 to 5,146 on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University.

NATAPOFF: So fees are different than fines. A fine is a punishment. It's punishment for whatever offense you are guilty of. It's typically set by statute. The judge decides how severe your fine will be as punishment for your crime. But fees are not punishment. They are user charges, in effect, that the criminal system imposes on people who go through it for all kinds of functions. They're essentially money-raising mechanisms that, for decades now, have been growing and growing as municipalities, counties and states rely more and more heavily on the revenue stream from the misdemeanor system.
REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I-- I do expect the President and take some kind of executive action--a national emergency is certainly part of that.

At this point they're going to need to look at some type of funding measure to make sure that we don't have a lapse, whether that's a clean CR for a short-term basis or a-- a longer period going through the end of September. They need to make sure that they have something on the table and ready to be voted on in the Senate where we could pass it in the House without a lapse in funding.

No. It's a Democratic city, and all the Democratic local officials were there. They had rustled up their local audiences. There were like 25 speakers before Bloomberg got to the podium. So this was one of those coming together moments. And Bloomberg has got the money. Maybe there is a feeling that the cash ultimately will deliver the goods with Bloomberg. and I think ultimately Bloomberg may just be the beneficiary of Biden's rapid political hemorrhaging, which seems to be occurring on all fronts.
While this may be a bit of a stretch, and I'll admit it sounds almost comical, checking out books from the library and failing to return them on time could wind up negatively impacting your credit score.

Stephenville: Researchers at Tarleton State University's Southwest Regional Dairy Center are using devices similar to Fitbits to track the health habits of dairy cows, the Weatherford Democrat reports. The researchers say tracking a cow's eating, sleeping and movement helps them take better care of the animals, according to a press release from the Texas A&M University System. The devices track how long cows eat, how long they lay down and how many steps they take, while another wearable device monitors how much milk each cow gives. We have two Fitbits on every cow, Southwest Regional Dairy Center Director Barbara Jones says. The data can warn producers that a cow may be sick before the animal starts showing symptoms. The devices also free up time for the dairy producer, who can tend to other business instead of monitoring their herd visually, according to the press release.

The bills also would impose a mandatory 180-day jail sentence for shoplifting; forbid prosecutors from amending charges of illegally possessing a gun against a person convicted of a violent felony or attempting to commit a violent felony; and expand the violations that could land a child in a youth prison to include any act that would be a felony in adult court.
And I agree with your guest on one thing. Beat Trump, that is not a strategy.

(However, many U.S. businesses take advantage of tax breaks to pay far less than that 35 percent rate right now.)

And yet, nevertheless, many jurisdictions charge a fee - say, a $50 fee - to apply just to get a public defender assigned. And many people forgo a public defender because the fee is prohibitive.

The reason that the economy shrank a little bit, despite the fact that housing's recovering, manufacturing is gone strong, car sales are up. You know truth is that overall there were a lot of positive signs in the economy. The big problem was defense spending was cut 22 percent. It was the biggest drop in-- in 40 years. And it was very abrupt and it had to do with you know folks being worried about the possible impacts of the fiscal cliff and what goes on here in Washington and what I've said repeatedly is-- you know Washington cannot continually operate under a cloud of crisis. That freezes up consumers. It gets businesses worried. We can't afford these self-inflicted wounds.

Cruz's proposal: Ted Cruz suggests a different form of benefit cut, in which future retirees would receive smaller cost-of-living adjustments. Some argue that the current inflation measure used by Social Security overstates the price increases seniors face, although others insist cost of living adjustments should be bigger, not smaller. The cut that Cruz suggests would fix about 15 percent of the funding shortfall. Cruz also proposes letting workers divert a portion of their payroll taxes into private retirement accounts. This may or may not be a good idea. It was hotly debated during the George W. Bush administration. But using payroll taxes for any purpose other than Social Security would make the system's solvency problems worse, not better.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected last year that Medicaid spending would increase 6% annually between 2019 and 2027. By contrast, medical inflation has risen less than 3% in recent years, according to the brief.

And we've heard from police officers just how distorting these formal or informal quotas can be. They put pressure on officers to make arrests that they might not otherwise make, to issue summons and citations that otherwise might not be justified.

Columbus: An anonymous donor has given Kenyon College a $100 million donation, the largest in school history, for the construction of three new residence halls, the liberal arts college announced Tuesday. The central Ohio school of about 1,600 students, which requires all students to live on campus, said the donation allows it to continue a focus on a residential college experience despite the disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic. Kenyon is conducting both online and in-person classes this year, and it reduced the on-campus population to allow all students to live in single rooms. To receive this record-breaking gift during a pandemic that is still gripping our country and disrupting our academic year speaks volumes about the strength of Kenyon's future, school President Sean Decatur said in a statement. Decatur said the donation will also allow Kenyon, founded in 1824, to renew its efforts to grow the college endowment for scholarships and financial aid. Kenyon received a $75 million anonymous donation in 2017 allowing it to build a new library and academic quad on the campus of the school in Gambier, about 58 miles northeast of Columbus.

So there is a profoundly regressive quality to the way that the misdemeanor system deploys fines and fees and bail and monetary sanctions. And because the system is heavily funded by those fines and fees and monetary sanctions, the misdemeanor system turns out to be a kind of regressive tax policy. It's stripping the poor and the - and working people in the system of their wealth and their resources in order to fund itself.

An arts center inside the executive office of the president — led, why not, by a Dr. Fauci of culture — could be sharper and swifter than a full department. This team could help Treasury create cultural tax policy, advise the Education Department on music instruction, liaise with Congress on arts stimulus. Importantly, it could ensure that stimulus funds for states and municipalities, whose budgets have been pitted by shutdown-induced tax shortfalls, shore up and eventually strengthen local arts organizations. (Almost no one has been hurt more by Covid than our artists, said Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York this week, when he announced a public-private partnership supporting the state's arts organizations.)
It's also important to understand that gains are taxed differently depending on how long you held on to the investment.

Bloomington: Portions of two parks are getting a special designation because of a rare tree species. Areas in Brown County State Park and Yellowwood State Forest will be considered high conservation value forest areas in an effort to preserve the yellowwood tree population. The Forest Stewardship Council's certification is a way to ensure that 591 acres where the trees are growing are managed so they remain part of the landscape, says Mike Spalding, resource specialist with Monroe-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests. Civilian Conservation Corps workers in Brown County State Park first discovered the trees in 1933. Forester T.E. Shaw and Charles Deam, Indiana's first state forester, verified and documented the discovery. One theory was that the yellowwood trees were brought north by Kentucky settlers, but that was proven false when the trees were analyzed. The results showed the trees were genetically distinct and had been in the area for thousands of years.
At various times in the recent past, we've quickly put more money into workers' paychecks by temporarily lowering their FICA (payroll) tax.

So tonight I'd like to speak to the young people of America - and to their parents and to their grandparents. I'm Walter Mondale. You may have heard of me - but you may not really know me. I grew up in the farm towns of southern Minnesota. My dad was a preacher, and my mom was a music teacher. We never had a dime. But we were rich in the values that were important; and I've carried those values with me ever since. They taught me to work hard; to stand on my own; to play by the rules; to tell the truth; to obey the law; to care for others; to love our country; to cherish our faith. My story isn't unique. In the last few weeks, I've deepened my admiration for someone who shares those same values. Her immigrant father loved our country. Her widowed mother sacrificed for her family. And her own career is an American classic: Doing your work. Earning your way. Paying your dues. Rising on merit. My presidency will be about those values. My vice president will be Geraldine Ferraro.

But after her appointment to the position, she waged five successful campaigns for the job – a fact noted admiringly by Clinton yesterday -- and worked to cement good relations with the black and Hispanic communities in Miami. She pushed for a special court to handle drug cases, cracked down on parents who fail to pay child support and presided over the expansion of the county prosecutor's office into one of the largest in the country. Noting that Reno's phone number is listed – unusual for a prosecutor -- Clinton said, She has lived the kind of life in real contact with the toughest problems of this country that I think will serve her very well as the nation's chief law enforcement officer. Before becoming state attorney, Reno was a partner in a prestigious Miami firm that, she noted in a 1984 book on women lawyers, had first refused to hire her after she graduated from Harvard Law School in 1963 because she was a woman. Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Reno offered forthright answers that contrasted with Baird's reticence when Clinton nominated her to the position Dec. 24. She said she was personally opposed to the death penalty but probably asked for it as much as any prosecutor in the country and will advocate for it as the law of the land in particular situations.

The bill also would expand the Child Tax Credit and transform it from an annual break claimed on tax returns — and which typically shows up in people's annual refunds — into a monthly payment. Under the plan, the tax credit would rise from $2,000 to $3,600 for children up to 6 years old and to $3,000 for children up to age 17. The IRS would pay the tax credit in monthly installments. That means that a family with two children under 6 could receive monthly checks of $600 from the IRS, for example.

Mueller's team charged a group of Russian military intelligence officers in July with hacking into computers of the Democratic National Committee and nominee Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Tens of thousands of emails and other documents were released online under the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You have them, you say, in custody though.
The bill proposal comes a day after two members of Congress tested positive for COVID-19 and President Trump signed a second relief bill that provides paid sick leave, expanded unemployment assistance and resources for testing.
Musk tried to reassure shareholders that he is leading from the front lines to battle production hell delays. Tesla said the main problem holding up production of the Model 3s were production delays at Tesla's $5 billion Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada, where Panasonic four-battery cell modules are automatically inserted into an aluminum-wrapped battery case. Musk referred to his Instagram post last week where he is having a late-night campfire with a couple of managers on the Gigafactory's roof as a sign of his focus.
There's no ready explanation for the decline in television prices. Industry experts say a slowdown in housing may be playing a role, although the price drop has been so steep that the housing market's woes seem insufficient. Some, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have said it is possible foreign manufacturers are illegally dumping televisions on the U.S. market at cut-rate prices.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that Second Amendment supporters held a Monday morning rally in Capitol Square while Northam planned speak to gun control supporters mid-afternoon.
Now I have a 1099 that says it's for $4,880, said Karol Settergren, a retired high school counselor.
On Jan. 21, 1977, more than 570,000 American offenders were given pardons.
I said, you got trouble, my friends. Right here - you got trouble right here in America. Sure, I'm a liberal and a gay, I'm mighty proud to say. Well, I'm kind of scared to say it. I admit that when Trump threw his name in the race, I assumed he was joking. You know how he jokes about stuff with his cool swag and his orange face. And then he started showing up and winning in the polls, like, a lot. And I was like, oh bleep.
His life sentence was just one of 143 cases that received commutation during Mr. Trump's last weeks in the White House. Of the people who had their sentences commuted, at least 12 were serving lengthy time for non-violent drug-related crimes. Cooper detailed to Duncan what his final day of prison was like.n
But doctoring a video such that it could be considered a fake, generally refers to footage that is fabricated or tampered with, rather than a video excerpt that is simply lacking the full context.
Critics said she failed to protect students' civil rights. Speed is not the measure of whether justice is served, said Liz King, senior director of the education equity program at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Secretary DeVos's primary legacy is an agenda of discrimination and exclusion.
Manafort's attorneys submitted a poorly redacted filing in January revealing Manafort shared polling data with Kilimnik during the campaign. In their response to Mueller claiming Manafort breached his plea deal, Manafort's attorneys inadvertently revealed the special counsel alleges Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.
We don't have the votes, said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., after a closed-door meeting of Senate Republicans. And since we don't have the votes, we've made the decision to postpone the vote. Cassidy, along with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., put together the proposal they hoped could pass the Senate.
Look, let's get something straight here. It's easy. All the mayor has to do is say, You are released from the nondisclosure agreement, period, Biden said. You think the women, in fact, were ready to say I don't want anybody to know about what you did to me? That's not how it works. The way it works is they say, look, this is what you did to me, and the mayor comes along and his attorneys said, I will give you this amount of money if you promise you will never say anything. That's how it works.
The bulk of Trump's rally speech last Wednesday consisted of the fanatically detailed claims of a paranoid about the election being stolen. The media, of course, have barely covered this part of the speech, since they're determined to suppress all mentions of any oting-vay aud-fray.
Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the Phase 1 agreement was good news for the U.S. and the world economy. But, she said, there remains considerable uncertainly for businesses using China as a platform for products destined for the U.S. market, and we will continue to see the impact of this in slower investment and higher business costs.
Williams won the 2015 French Open and was the runner-up in 2016. Failing to be seeded this season will leave her hopes of a fourth French Open title in serious jeopardy.
Another person with close ties to the Trump administration, Hannah Salem, was the rally's operations manager for logistics and communications, according to the permit paperwork. In 2017, she took a hiatus from the consulting firm she founded and spent three years as senior White House press aide, executing the media strategy for President Trump's most high-profile events, according to her company bio and LinkedIn profile.
And it really - it was such an important case because it opens a gateway into the kinds of arrests and intrusions and jail stays that characterize this low-level world of misdemeanors and minor offenses. And so in many ways, the size and the harshness of the misdemeanor system trace back to Gail Atwater.
Democracy is built upon the notion that politicians who lose elections will admit defeat and move on. By challenging this idea — however insincerely — Hawley and Cruz are helping unravel the core political bargains of American politics. Senators with presidential ambitions cannot treat fundamental beliefs about democracy as something they can put on and take off like a costume, returning to real life when the curtain drops. If they act as though they don't hold a core democratic belief, they may convince the audience to stop believing, too. Wednesday's invasion of Capitol Hill shows what happens when people are told that the election has been stolen from them and that there is a chance to take it back.
The rest of the world is clearly tugging the US downward, said Browne.
RAINBOW: Well, it was hard. I mean, it was - it made things very uncomfortable in my home and - you know, which is why I was locked in my room, making videos with my Barbie dolls. It was not a pleasant experience. It was not a pleasant environment because it really just - he was the nucleus, and it just revolved around this man who was really sick.
Rolling back Obamacare would provide a nearly $1 trillion tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and businesses.
GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: And, you know, while we have made a lot of progress in-- in Virginia, slavery has ended, schools have been desegregated. We have ended the Jim Crow laws, easier access to voting. It is abundantly clear that we still have a lot of work to do and I-- I really think this week raised a level of awareness in the Commonwealth and in this country--
TAPPER: So without going through your entire history, we heard Ambassador Yovanovitch last week say, in real time, that she found President Trump's tweet intimidating. Republicans have said that mean tweets cannot be intimidating, it just mean tweets, who cares.
So that's why legal experts, even legal experts who were opposed to the Affordable Care Act in previous cases are saying this is just ridiculous.
Sure, sell-side analysts on Wall Street still write substantial research, which sometimes appears online. But you have to take it with a grain of salt. Under the same roof there's typically a division looking to do investment banking for the same companies that the analysts cover. Are the analysts really impartial?
We can actually deliver health care without taking it away from anyone, Buttigieg said. And we can build a movement without having legions of our supporters online and in person attacking Democratic figures and union leaders alike.
But first, the big news today was Bill Barr defending decision to scale back Roger Stone's outrageous sentencing recommendation. Earlier today, the Attorney General told ABC news this.
Choosing a health insurance plan for you and your family is a serious financial decision. Among other things, you must consider the health of you and your family, along with your available resources and ability to pay for medical care. If you're eligible for an HSA and can afford to pay for all or most of your increased out-of-pocket medical bills now, including meeting the higher deductible, then saving in an HSA for your retirement might make sense.
GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff. She's the author of the new book, Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. We're going to take a short break and then we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.
Democrats are moving left toward Medicare for all. Republicans have been unable to pass their plans, which are a version of, you know, market-based health care where states can choose what kind of plans they have. The two sides are far apart.
We have noticed the trend of bitcoin acting as a crisis currency, he said.

Senator, you'll be campaigning and we will be her covering it. Thank you
After months of calm for stocks, investors could now experience some rockiness in the coming weeks.
NATAPOFF: So many of the problems of the misdemeanor system flow from its sheer enormity. And there are things that we can do about that. Police could arrest fewer people. We could put less pressure on police officers to arrest and to issue summons when it's unnecessary. Prosecutors can decline more cases. When police officers arrest, prosecutors then have to decide whether that arrest is going to convert into a criminal case or whether it's going to be declined and remain merely an arrest.
A new study from the personal finance website Go Banking Rates, reveals that the average additional costs per year to buy a new car and operate it for three years can vary by as much as $2,406 a year, depending on the residence of the consumer.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mike Bloomberg can win this campaign. Donald Trump knows it. He's afraid.
Harrisburg: The state's second lady, Giselle Fetterman, will help lead a campaign to raise awareness of this year's census and encourage residents to respond, state officials said Monday. Fetterman, whose husband is Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, said she will tour the state, making stops in Philadelphia and in Centre, Erie, Allegheny, Lancaster and Luzerne counties over the next three months. Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order in 2018 to create a commission to help ensure a robust census count and signed legislation in October authorizing up to $4 million to buttress the count. Meanwhile, 94 nonprofit community organizations are working together to encourage their targeted communities to return census forms. Current census projections show Pennsylvania is growing more slowly than the rest of the country and is expected to lose a congressional seat in 2023.

REPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Well, I mean that's-- everybody's entitled to their opinion and that's-- that's persuasive. But remember he-- he won a vast majority of the black vote in his election. And we're not talking about approval numbers. We're talking about people who feel that the governor should step down immediately. So, it's a very different situation. The fact is, he's really lost the confidence of a lot of the people he's supposed to be leading.
Another area in which Clinton and Trump broadly agree: both want to ramp up infrastructure spending.
It comes as a surprise to no one that Democrat-controlled statehouses are less advantageous to the firearms industry, he said. We'll see more restrictive gun laws, but we might see improvement to right-to-carry laws in other states in the country.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns the Washington Post, is accusing AMI, which publishes The National Enquirer, for essentially trying to extort him with these incriminating photos. He personally said though that the Post's essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder, specifically of Khashoggi, was undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles. Did the Saudi government have anything to do with these leaks to AMI?
The Caged Bird, which opened its doors in July, is the newest bar that seeks to cater to black millennials in a city that was sued for discriminatory practices that promoted gentrification earlier this year.
Under the governor's proposal, developers who set aside 25 to 30 percent of a project's apartments for low- and moderate-income tenants, can get a full property tax exemption for 35 years, compared with less generous subsidies in either the 2015 legislation or the mayor's proposal.

Tallahassee: The Legislature set a lot of lofty goals for its annual 60-day session: passing a budget expected to top $90 billion; lowering the cost of health care; preventing blue-green algae; and boosting teacher pay. But also on the agenda entering the second week of session are measures banning iguana breeding, protecting nude sunbathers, making shelter animals the official state pet, banning sunscreen bans, and giving hunters a sales tax break on guns and ammo. The full Senate will take up a bill that would ban local governments from banning sunscreens, while a House committee takes up its version of the bill, in reaction to Key West banning the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate, which some researchers say can harm coral reefs.

If a fire destroys your house, imagine listing from memory every item you lost in order to make an insurance claim. That would be tough on a good day. After a disaster, it's a nightmare, says Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a consumer advocacy group.
Here's what to know about the situation.
According to two sources, one who strategized with the Mercers and another who worked closely with Trump, Rebekah insisted on a 30-minute face-to-face meeting with Trump, in which she informed him that his campaign was a disaster. (Her family had pledged $2 million to the effort about a month earlier, so she felt comfortable being frank.) Trump, who knew her slightly, was willing to listen. He had been disturbed by recent stories detailing disorganization in his campaign and alleging ties between Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and pro-Russia officials in Ukraine. Rebekah knew of this and arrived at her meeting with props, says the source who strategized with the Mercers: printouts of news articles about Manafort and Russia that she brandished as evidence that he had to go. And she also had a solution in mind: Trump should put Bannon in charge of the campaign and hire the pollster Kellyanne Conway. [3] 3. Conway had worked for the Mercers' super PAC. By the following morning, Rebekah was breakfasting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with the two people he trusts most, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to talk through the proposal in more detail. Within four days, Trump did exactly as Rebekah had advised. Manafort was out. Bannon was in charge. Trump also brought on David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, with whom the Mercers and Bannon had been close for years. Less than four months later, Mercer's handpicked team had pulled off one of the greatest upsets in American politics.
This is the best price on TurboTax you will see until the end of March. When April begins we expect prices to jump on TurboTax to take advantage of late filers. All the editions are on sale at the lowest prices we've seen so far. Not sure which one to get? Deluxe fits most tax situations such as owning a home or if you have 1099s. If you have income from rental properties or investment income, Premier is the choice for you. And if you own your own business, are a contractor or self employed then Home & Business is for you.
Tax filers in these situations must renew an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number as early as possible because they cannot file a tax return without one.

Part of the challenge of encouraging broader consumption of fruits and vegetables is the expense. The production costs of fresh fruits and vegetables is relatively high, independent of government support programs, Van Es says.
A move requires approval from at least 24 owners.
Boise: The state has the nation's sixth-highest growth rate for spending on corrections in the past 25 years, and with the governor proposing a 12.1% budget increase for the Department of Correction, the department's director says the state is at a critical juncture, the Idaho Press reports. Idaho increased spending on corrections by 207% between 1992 and 2018, according to a report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy in Boise. Idaho's expenditures outpace its spending during the same time period on education, which increased by 94% for public schools and 39% for higher education. At least some of that spending is the result of policy decisions the Legislature made in the past 40 years, according to the report. Idaho is one of only three states in the country where inmates are required by law to serve 100% of their fixed terms, the result of truth-in-sentencing legislation passed in the 1980s, according to the report.
Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating Cohen for possible bank and tax fraud, possible campaign law violations and perhaps other matters related to Trump's presidential campaign, a person familiar with the probe has said.
Trump has been on a campaign to get U.S. auto makers such as Ford Motor Co. F, -1.58% and General Motors Co. GM, -1.30% to shift manufacturing jobs from foreign plants back to the U.S. Several car makers have scrapped plans for new plants in locations such as Mexico, or said they would consider doing so in response to Trump's threat of high border tariffs.

So it's a hyper-aggressive subsidy for exports. Boeing can sell a $100 million airplane to Air France, make $20 million in profit, and yet book it as an $80 million tax loss. It's the biggest corporate giveaway I've ever heard of.
First, diversifying your portfolio across several different types of investments can help you avoid catastrophic losses if one of your holdings suffers a setback. Diversification can take many different forms, such as holding many different broad asset classes including stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments. It can also mean selecting several different options within a particular asset class, such as buying stocks in various sectors to offer more broad-based exposure.

Rep. John Delaney (Md.), the first Democrat to enter the presidential race, has an estimated net worth over $200 million, and spent millions to win a seat in Congress in 2012. But he has run his campaign so far with mixture of personal funds and donations.
Trump connected his manufacturing ideas with his plans for infrastructure and trade (for which, see above): he said that the goods used to produce this new infrastructure would be made in America, and he focused on foreign competitors (in particular China) whom he says have severely hurt American manufacturing. Tougher trade enforcement with China, he said, could reshore millions of jobs.
Aside from the kindness of individuals wanting to help fans, what we have seen is a brazen rip-off with pre-booked hotels canceled and made available again for twice the price.
Senator McConnell for that original stimulus deal.
Cameron thought he'd found a solution: to promise a referendum that would allow the people to vote on leaving Europe. He figured it was only a pretend promise, and domestic and international institutions would save him from having to deliver. And even if the referendum went ahead, British voters would never choose the costly path of unwinding the country's deep ties to the E.U. Everyone who really counted knew that would be stupid, even if they sometimes pretended otherwise. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for instance, began his career making up stories about how the E.U. wanted to do ridiculous things like ban prawn cocktail crisps (a disgusting but popular British delicacy) but also happily described himself as a fan of the E.U.
The Stone indictment contains seven counts: five charges of false statements, one count of witness tampering and one count of obstruction.
On Tuesday, Denise Cervantes, the Editor-in-Chief of the University Star, published an editorial note about Martinez's column. The column has received widespread criticism from readers, with many expressing that they find the author's ideas to be racist, she wrote. The University Star's opinion pages are a forum for students to express and debate ideas. While our publication does not endorse every opinion put forth by student columnists or guest contributors, as the editor I take responsibility for what is printed on our pages.

The voter-approved measure would extend coverage to 150,000 uninsured people in the state.
In addition to the Child Tax Credit, working parents can deduct some of the cost of child care. If you paid someone to care for your kids so that you could work or look for work, you likely qualify. The deduction limit is $3,000 for a single child, or $6,000 for two or more children.
RAINBOW: Well, there's just one troubling part about that timeline, and it's that...
First and foremost, a conviction is accompanied by punishment. It can be crushing fines and fees. They may be on supervision, on probation for long periods of time. They may be incarcerated. If they're not incarcerated upfront, they may be incarcerated if they violate their probation or fail to pay their fines and fees. And then that conviction will - is a permanent conviction that follows them for the rest of their lives.
As a result of profit declines three quarters in a row, Bloomberg claims that the US is slipping into a profit recession. Some believe this is a result of a slump in crude oil prices and a sharp rise of the dollar. Of course, it is easy to point to those or even a slowdown of the Chinese economy. Instead of looking at the glass is half empty, some argue that these might be good things. There are definitely trade-offs. To increase profits, too many businesses focus on cutting expenses. That's the easier thing to do, and is one way to greater profits if there is not a corresponding decline in quality. Unfortunately, too many expense cuts come with quality declines -- especially when inferior materials are substituted or labor cuts cause drops in customer service.
Then the pandemic arrived, and their jobs went remote. The pool closed within like 48 hours of us moving in, says Ray, 34. The gym closed. All of the amenities closed.

In addition to the nearly 200,000 American deaths caused directly by Covid-19 from Jan. 26 to Oct. 3, another roughly 100,000 so-called excess deaths from other causes were recorded, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported. The greatest rate of excess deaths was found among young adults and people of color. Calculations of the death toll from injuries — a category that includes suicide, homicide, drug overdoses and firearm deaths — were not included in the new data, as reporting on these deaths frequently lags. But a separate N.C.H.S. provisional report on drug overdose deaths during the 12-month period ending in June 2020 found an 18 percent increase over the previous year to 79,251 deaths, up from 67,821 deaths during the previous 12-month period ending in June 2019. In total, there have been more than 384,000 known virus-related deaths in the United States. As of Wednesday, the seven-day average was 3,346 deaths a day, according to a New York Times database.
Local elected officials see up close how the pandemic has ravaged their communities, said Cedric Richmond, a former Democratic congressman who is now one of Biden's top aides at the White House, in charge of the Office of Public Engagement.
House Minority Leader David Toscano (D-Charlottesville) praised Howell for standing up to his own party on an off-year redistricting scheme in 2013. Senate Republicans had tacked an entirely redrawn state Senate map onto a bill calling for minor technical adjustments to House districts. Howell ruled it out of order, a move that infuriated some Republicans.
TRUMP: I just don't think maybe either of us were ready.
Individuals with jobs will pay 6.2% of wage and salary income up to $128,700 into Social Security this year. And they will pay 1.45% of all their earned income for Medicare. Their employers will match those amounts, but economists say the employer payroll tax burden is ultimately borne by the worker, too, through lower wages.
Cohen's opening statement addressed directly his history of lying — yes, he said, he had lied many times in the past. But, he said, that was when he was in Trump's thrall, and those days are over.
Before the meeting began Saturday morning, Trump took a combative tone in several Twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in Republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.
That leaves impeachment. And the single article has already been drafted - impeachment for inciting violence against the government of the United States. And the Democrats seem resolved to press for it on Monday. They would have the votes in the House. But, of course, the Senate would have to follow suit. That seems unlikely before the scheduled transfer of power on January 20. But we could see a return to the issue after that when Trump is gone with the idea of barring him from federal office for life. That historically has been done in a few cases of federal judges who had been impeached and removed.
U.S. lost 140,000 jobs in December, the first decline since April. The already sputtering economic rebound went into reverse in December, as employers laid off workers amid rising coronavirus cases and waning government aid. U.S. employers cut 140,000 jobs in December, the Labor Department said Friday. It was the first net decline in payrolls since last spring's mass layoffs, and though the December loss was nowhere near that scale, it represented a discouraging reversal for the once-promising recovery. The U.S. economy still has about 10 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic began. Job growth reversed for the first time since April Cumulative change in all jobs since before the pandemic By Ella Koeze · Seasonally adjusted · Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics The December losses were heavily concentrated in leisure and hospitality businesses, which have been hit especially hard by the pandemic. The industry cut nearly half a million jobs in December, while sectors less exposed to the pandemic continued to add workers. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7 percent, down sharply from its high of nearly 15 percent in April but still close to double the 3.5 percent rate in the same month a year earlier. We're losing ground again, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. Most notably, this is still very much a low-wage recession, and the losses were where we first saw them when the pandemic hit.
Pressed by reporters, Trump brushed off suggestions that he had changed his tone. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic, Trump said.

A week after the rally, Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the first U.S. president ever to be impeached twice. But the political and legal fallout may stretch well beyond Trump, who will exit the White House on Wednesday before Democrat Joe Biden takes the oath of office. Trump had refused for nearly two months to accept his loss in the 2020 election to the former vice president.
In May, Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) introduced the Good Samaritan Menstrual Products Act, which would allow for more menstrual products to be donated to and distributed by nonprofit organizations during the pandemic.
If Iowa or California borrowed money and defaulted, you wouldn't expect people living in Iowa or California to lose their money, too. And what was more unusual, Puerto Rico imploded over municipal bonds. They're supposed to be the most boring, safe financial investments out there. You buy a Puerto Rican bond, Puerto Rico pays you back later with interest.
The pipeline proposals include granting the Public Utility Commission authority to regulate locations of intrastate lines. No state agency has that authority. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversees interstate pipeline siting, but the lack of authority within the state has fueled opposition to lines like Energy Transfer's cross-state Mariner East project. Mariner East 1, 2 and 2x carry or will carry natural gas liquids from western Pa. to an export terminal near Philadelphia.

Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package is welcome and robust, but like Obama's Recovery Act, it is not transformative lawmaking. It will enable the country to weather a difficult year, but it will not update the antiquated American economic infrastructure for the 21st century. Biden's payments to families will be welcome and its support for small business is urgently needed. The crises of inequality, climate change, and post-COVID-19 globalization will remain.

As the U.S. enters a period of unprecedented post-war political instability, many businesses are wondering how to plan for the near and medium-term future. Decision makers in business sometimes have short memories; a preoccupation with making profit will continue to cloud the judgement of some of them. Recent headlines have stated how optimistic some business leaders are about America's future, believing that the pro-business platform about to be implemented is a stairway to heaven. It may well be. A significant reduction in corporate tax rates combined with an orientation toward America First could indeed propel the U.S. economy to heights unseen in decades -- at least, in the short-term.

These, it said, would be used to tailor the most persuasive possible message, acting on that voter's personality traits, hopes or fears. The firm has worked on campaigns in Argentina, Kenya, Ghana, Indonesia and Thailand; the Pentagon has used it to conduct surveys in Iran and Afghanistan. Best of all, from the Mercers' perspective, SCL operated entirely outside the GOP apparatus. (A source close to Rebekah said she wanted a results-oriented consultant.)

Juneau: The University of Alaska Southeast and other schools in the state university system have proposed increasing tuition starting in the fall to combat a decrease in state funding. The 5% increase was brought about after significant cuts to the state's funding of the University of Alaska system, the Juneau Empire reports. The increase would generate up to $500,000 for the system and apply to resident undergraduate students, university chancellor Rick Caulfield said. Students taking 15 credit hours of courses a semester would pay about $400 more each year, university officials said. Only three students participated in a meeting scheduled for them to address university officials about the proposal, Caulfield said. Teacher education, marine biology and science programs, and mining and maritime-oriented vocational training are some of the university's most successful programs, university officials said.

Baltimore: The city will formally name a courthouse after the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings in the first half of 2020. Mayor Bernard C. Jack Young on Friday unveiled the renderings of the bronze plaques that will be affixed to the building's exterior. One includes an image and biography of the congressman, and the other reads Elijah E. Cummings Courthouse. The powerful Democratic congressman and civil rights champion died Oct. 17 at age 68 of complications from long-standing health issues. He had represented Maryland's 7th Congressional District, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore, since 1996. Cummings graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law and practiced in Baltimore. Elijah was a son of Baltimore. He was proud of Baltimore, his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, said during the unveiling ceremony. His career as a legal professional started in this courthouse.

Times of rising unemployment and shrinking incomes tend to lead to large increases in Medicaid enrollment as people find themselves with less or no earnings and become eligible for the program. That leads to higher Medicaid spending. And a nationwide outbreak of a highly contagious virus that can lead to tens of thousands of dollars in medical costs will drive spending even higher this time. During the recession that began at the end of the last decade, millions of Americans enrolled in Medicaid.
Most tax filers will want to avoid being under-withheld — meaning the number of allowances you used to take is now too high given the tax law changes.

Jail fees are particularly egregious and ironic for individuals who are being incarcerated precisely because they couldn't pay their fines and fees. Once they go to jail, in many jurisdictions, the jail will then charge them a fee for having been in the jail. There are fees for the use of health care in jails, so many people forgo health care. They forgo their medication because they can't afford the fee in the jail to get access to their medication. It's really this enormous underground wealth-stripping, regressive mechanism that is only just starting to come to light.

LIASSON: President Trump has laid out four pillars of the deal that he wants after he lifted the protection from deportation for these young people called DREAMers or DACA recipients. They were protected from deportation by President Obama. Trump lifted that protection. He gave Congress a deadline of March 5 before he says he'll start deporting those kids. What Trump wants is a path to citizenship for these kids. In exchange, he wants an end to the diversity lottery, an end to family reunification migration - he calls it chain migration. And, of course, he wants funding for the wall.
Conservative states are eager to loosen gun restrictions, said Spitzer of SUNY Cortland.
On October 14, 2010, President Obama called organizations with benign sounding names a problem for democracy; the next week he complained about individuals who hide behind those front groups, called such groups a threat to our democracy, and claimed such groups were engaged in unsupervised spending.
But Democrats are scoping out this district, because its political demographics have shifted over the past few elections. President Trump won it by 10 points in the 2016 election, which was was already a shift from 2012 and 2008 when Mitt Romney and John McCain won it by more.

Grangeville: The screen of a 65-year-old drive-in movie theater was destroyed by high winds, and the owner says he hopes to rebuild – if he can find someone who can do the specialized work. Chris Wagner, owner of Sunset Auto Vue drive-in theater in Grangeville, told The Lewiston Tribune the screen has only been damaged by winds twice since it was built in 1955. The first time, in 2007, he rebuilt with a modern design that was intended to withstand wind gusts up to 110 mph. But last week, high winds estimated by the National Weather Service at about 60 mph flattened the 32-by-72-foot outdoor screen, leaving behind a mass of twisted metal. I'll be making a call to the manufacturer, but he was 75 years old when he showed up the last time (in 2007) to do it, Wagner said. There are only a handful of drive-in theaters in the Gem State.

Friday, February 12, 1993; Page A01 President Clinton yesterday named veteran Miami prosecutor Janet Reno to be his attorney general, selecting a woman he described as a front-line crime fighter of unquestioned integrity to fill the vacancy that has plagued the first three weeks of his administration. Announcing his nomination in a Rose Garden ceremony, Clinton said his selection had been guided somewhat, but not entirely by the desire to name the first female attorney general. Clinton said the position was not set aside for a woman and that he seriously considered at least four men for the job. But he said that he thought it would be a good and an interesting thing to do to name a woman to the position and said that if he had it to do over again, I would have called Janet Reno on November the 5th. In December, Clinton nominated corporate lawyer Zoe E. Baird, who was forced to withdraw because she had violated immigration and tax laws in hiring illegal immigrants. He was poised to name federal judge Kimba M. Wood before she withdrew last week after the disclosure that she had also employed an illegal immigrant to care for her child. Reno, who is not married and has no children, said, I've never hired an illegal alien and I think I've paid all my Social Security taxes, adding with a smile, Certainly in the vetting process in the last week, we've covered everything.

LIASSON: Presidents' budgets are always political documents. They're not a piece of legislation, but they do express the president's priorities. And, of course, the cliche is to say that the president's budget is dead on arrival on Capitol Hill. This one is probably dead as a doornail. And the reason is that Republicans and Democrats just passed a massive, two-year spending bill, which raises the caps for domestic and defense spending. And the White House was mostly a bystander in those negotiations. So what the president says in his budget tomorrow will not affect spending very much. Congress probably won't be passing a 2019 budget resolution. The bottom line is, in this instance, Congress seems to be ignoring the president.

And that brings us to the most important point of all: What makes a warning a warning is that it happens before things get bad. So yes, the economy is in very good shape right now, but so was it in 2006, the last time long-term rate fell below short-term ones. That didn't keep the economic storm clouds away 12 to 18 months later — that's usually how long it takes for a recession to hit after the yield curve inverts like that — and it won't this time either if we aren't careful.
A recent Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) study notes that about 63 percent of noncitizen households in the U.S. use at least one form of taxpayer-funded welfare, while only about 35 percent of native-born American households are on welfare.

By contrast, voters were urged to trust Muskie, the man of integrity. That strategy might have been sound if the premises had been right. Muskie at his best is far more inspiring than Nixon, who does have credibility problems and is unpredictable. Nixon had sounded shrill and unfair as he tried to link Democrats with crime, drugs and antiwar violence during the 1970 congressional campaigns, while Muskie on that election eve effectively deplored such tactics and appealed for a return to reason. Perhaps the voters did long for a calmer, loftier leader. To further the bandwagon psychology, the Muskie strategists won endorsements from big names in the party: California Senator John Tunney, Ohio Governor John Gilligan, Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson III, Iowa Senator Harold Hughes, Pennsylvania Governor Milton Shapp. Each new name made the nomination seem that much more inevitable. This was organizing the party drive from the top down, rather than from the bottom up. Suddenly, the edifice began to crumble, and the entire strategy was shattered. Democratic voters showed that in primaries, at least, they were not all that concerned about finding a contrast with Nixon. They were not looking for a unifier and mollifier. They were in a balky, grumpy mood. They wanted specific answers to specific problems that plagued them. They were more interested in voting against the status quo, and men like George McGovern and George Wallace seemed to offer that chance to protest.

The Fed's time has passed. By admitting their own mistakes, it is becoming clear that the present day economy is dictating the Feds' policies and not the other way around. The Fed should be abolished and the monetary policies of America put into hands of elected politicians who must find a way to lessen inequality amongst its citizens.

Providence: The federal government is finally paying for baggage screening systems at the state's main airport that were upgraded after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said. The Democrat met Friday with officials from the Rhode Island Airport Corp. and the Transportation Security Administration at the T.F. Green Airport in Warwick to discuss air travel safety. Reed said millions were allocated nationally in a 2020 spending bill to reimburse airports for baggage screening systems and security improvements, of which $5.5 million will be directed to T.F. Green. The airport upgraded its baggage screening systems after the terrorist attacks, enhancing safety and saving the federal government millions in reduced labor and worker's compensation costs, but the airport corporation wasn't fully reimbursed, Reed said. The payment brings the total reimbursement so far to $18 million of $30 million owed, he said.

Lansing: Republicans in the state House on Wednesday proposed a $3.5 billion coronavirus recovery plan but threatened to withhold billions to K-12 schools unless Gov. Gretchen Whitmer cedes her administration's power to prohibit in-person instruction and sports to local health departments. The state health department in November ordered a temporary ban on face-to-face learning in high schools to help curb a surge in COVID-19 cases, lifting it later. A prohibition on youth contact sports remains. Some Michigan school districts haven't had in-person classes since March. That's hurting kids in ways we can't even imagine, and not just academically, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Thomas Albert, R-Lowell, said in a statement. By law, K-12 districts and charter schools decide whether to allow in-person classes. Although the Democratic governor has strongly urged schools to offer a face-to-face learning option by March 1, House Republicans want to entice public schools by offering up to $250 per student in funding if they commit to reopening by Feb. 15.

Hartford: The state's unionized prison guards expressed anger Wednesday over what they say is the lack of a plan to vaccinate them against COVID-19. Jody Barr, the executive director of AFSCME Council 4, said the union was told there would be a plan to vaccinate prison employees by early January, but they have yet to hear when they might get the vaccine or how it will be distributed to them. The department has not asked the correction officers how many of them are willing to take it, Barr said. And without knowing how many vaccines you are going to need, how can they have a plan to distribute it? Correction officers are among the essential workers in the state's 1b group, making them eligible for the vaccine. But the governor's office has said that, because it is receiving only about 46,000 doses a week for those getting a first shot of the two-dose regimen, it is limiting appointments for the time being to people over age 75. Appointments are expected to be expanded in about two weeks to those over 65. Only after those people are vaccinated will appointments be opened to those with preexisting medical conditions and essential workers.

MCEVERS: On NPR's MORNING EDITION on April 25, 1983 - yes, that was the 1983 version of the theme song - reporter Todd Shapira was covering the opening of a skyscraper in New York City.
At a six-story walk-up in Manhattan's East Village that was once home to the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, the Kushner Cos. filed an application to begin construction in late 2013 that, again, listed zero rent-regulated tenants. Tax records a few months later showed seven rent-regulated units.
HORSLEY: Well, it is odd because just a day earlier, the market had jumped 4 to 5% on the promise of just this kind of rate cut. So it's a little bit unusual. I spoke to the chief economist at LendingTree, Tendayi Kapfidze. And he just thinks the Fed missed the mark. This is not the kind of medicine the economy needs to deal with the coronavirus epidemic.

For presidential candidates under Secret Service protection, the agency seeks to check the backgrounds and criminal records of anyone who will be in proximity to the candidate at events. Agents from a local field office who are preparing for a candidate visit require the management of the venue hosting the visit — whether it is a hotel, a convention center or a golf club — to provide, several days before, the names of all employees who will prepare food, entertain or wait on the candidate.
Earlier in the afternoon, Mr. Trump addressed reporters, insisting, We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war.
And they were stopped by a police officer, Turek, who pulled them over and hollered at Gail Atwater that she would be arrested for the seatbelt violation for not having her children in the seatbelt restraints. Her children started to cry. Ms. Atwater asked if she could take her kids to the neighbor's house. Officer Turek said, no, they're going to come to jail with you. A neighbor happened to walk by and take care of the kids, but Gail Atwater went to jail.
New York (CNN Business) The blue wave that many expected in November appears to have crested two months later. Now, investors are trying to figure out how to best position their portfolios given the increased likelihood that Democrats will win control of the Senate following Tuesday's run-off elections in Georgia.
McGovern, gaining 54 in Wisconsin, had a total of 89 1/2, trailed by Wallace with 75 and Humphrey with 19. With the delegate-rich primaries in Pennsylvania (182), Massachusetts (102), New York (278) and California (271) still to come, all the candidates are still far from the 1,509 needed for nomination in Miami Beach. For the moment, Wisconsin seemed to have reduced it to a three-man contest among Muskie, Humphrey and McGovern. Although McGovern now ranks as a heavyweight contender, he must still establish that Wisconsin was not a fluke in which the candidate was secondary to the issues. McGovern displayed surprising strength among labor's rank and file in Wisconsin, but his comparative radicalism and long anti-war record have earned him the hostility of many labor leaders as well as Democratic professionals. If McGovern begins to seem a serious threat, many of the regulars might mount a counterattack in favor of Humphrey. Some Democrats fear that a McGovern candidacy might be the equivalent of Barry Goldwater's campaign in 1964 -- an ideological debacle -- and they are already poor-mouthing his victory on the grounds that his excellent Wisconsin organization and Republican cross-over votes distorted the natural outcome. Scenarios. These primaries, said McGovern last week, are going to go on from state to state, from battle to battle.
Democrats will have an opportunity to make changes to the bill in the coming days. Several lawmakers have said they hope to pass a final bill by the end of next week.
As the coronavirus promises to strain the nation's supply chains, top White House trade adviser Peter Navarro says he's delivering an executive action to President Trump intended to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and bring that manufacturing to the U.S.
But he was - it was tough. You know, he would come home and six kids and my mom - and I think everybody was just stressed out. And he'd be reading the capsule reviews in The Times' TV section. And my dad would say, wow, How Green Was My Valley. That's a good one. At 11:30, I'd say, can we watch How Green Was My Valley, Dad? I was 10 years old. He'd say, no, no, no. It's too late. He goes, well, let's just watch 10 minutes - 10 minutes, 15 minutes of How Green Was My Valley and you have to go to bed. I'd be like, sure, Dad, sure. It would work like a charm. TV comes on, How Green Was My Valley, my dad passes out on the couch. He falls asleep, and I watch all of How Green Was My Valley. I watched the whole thing. Some nights I actually got away with watching a piece of the next one that was on at, like, 1:15 in the morning.
These surprise tax bills would reduce tax refunds or possibly even require net tax payments for vulnerable households, which may force some to cut back on spending, analysts with the investment bank wrote in a report.

St. Louis: The president of a predominantly black police union says the city prosecutor's lawsuit is correct in pointing out racial concerns in St. Louis, including biases within the police department itself. Ethical Society of Police President Heather Taylor stopped short of endorsing Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's federal lawsuit accusing entrenched interests of impeding her efforts to reform racist practices, but Taylor questioned how anyone could ignore the department's long history of racial discrimination. She said in a statement that denying racial bias within the department is a slap in the face to minority and non-minority officers with whom we are proud to serve. She said the union has often cited racial disparities in discipline, promotions and job placement.
I think after I called my parents, you're the first person I called after I adopted my kid, that's how much I think of you, said Del. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax), his voice breaking. You are proof, Mr. Speaker, that nice guys can finish first.
That's the trade-off, said Steve Stombres, who was chief of staff to Eric Cantor during Cantor's tenure as House majority leader and is now a consultant.
Older New Yorkers are exasperated as they try to get vaccinated. Giving a vaccine shot to a nursing home resident in the Bronx. Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times Laura Engle, 78, lives alone in an apartment in Midtown Manhattan. She uses a walker and has a chronic lung disease. She is exactly the kind of person who most needs a coronavirus vaccine. Yet she has found it impossible to make an appointment and has become lost in the confusing system set up by the city and the state. Computer-literate, she navigated New York City's vaccine finder page on Monday, found the closest provider and sent an email with her name and phone number to set up an appointment. When no one called, she reached out to the urgent care's corporate office, which told her to wait. She wanted to register at the new Javits Center megasite, which she had heard about on the news, but couldn't figure out how. I'm willing to wait my turn, she said, frustrated, but I would like to have some feeling that I have a turn. Millions of older New Yorkers started the week with optimism that they would finally gain access to a vaccine after months of fearing they would fall victim to the coronavirus. But the reality of actually getting the shots has proved maddening.
Starting this year, the Hungarian government is set to offer free in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures for couples wanting children in order to boost the national birthrate to 2.1 children by 2030.
REPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: I don't really know how that happens. I mean, maybe the impeachment proceeding does that. I know the lieutenant governor has called for an FBI investigation.
Des Moines: State lawmakers are considering allowing dentists to administer the COVID-19 vaccine and flu shots. The proposal, House Study Bill 71, received its first hearing at a House subcommittee Tuesday but did not advance. Lawmakers said they wanted more time to consider the measure. If it became law, dentists would be required to complete four hours of training related to prescribing and administering vaccines. They would not be allowed to delegate vaccine administration to dental hygienists or dental assistants. Rep. John Forbes, D-Urbandale, who is a pharmacist, said his practice is getting overrun by calls from people who want the vaccine. Forbes did not sit on the subcommittee but urged his colleagues to push the proposal forward. But Dennis Tibben, a lobbyist for the Iowa Medical Association, which opposes the bill, said there are enough doctors and pharmacists to administer the COVID-19 vaccine without adding dentists as well. It's not necessarily the case that we don't have enough folks to administer the vaccine; it's that we don't have enough vaccine, he said.
A member of the House since 1988, Howell was one of four delegates to start a prayer group that still meets at 7 a.m. every Wednesday during the session. He has been a conservative on social issues such as abortion.

ISSA: Exactly, the double standard and by the way the double standard for Eric Holder. They clearly got away with this, you know Clapper and Comey and plenty of people have lied to Congress and have not been held accountable.
For example, what happens when Delta buys the plane Air France just bought in the example above? Because Air France is making the profit on the sale of the plane, and outside U.S. jurisdiction, there's nothing to discourage this. So Boeing will launder all its sales this way. And why shouldn't Delta just buy from Airbus, which is similarly outside U.S. jurisdiction? This tax only has leverage against imports done by American middlemen with profits to grab.

The most prominent takeaway is that there is not actually that much saving beyond the tax break in Health Savings Accounts. Money goes in and comes right back out, with only a fraction held over.
There were six presidential candidates on the debate stage in Nevada: former Vice President Joe Biden, billionaire media mogul Michael Bloomberg, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Each one still sees a path to the White House, but the clock is ticking.
McConnell spoke about the bill on the Senate floor on Thursday before the draft was released. He said the legislation would include billions of dollars in forgivable federal loans for small businesses.
As full-time employees, we tend to build our personal lives around holes and gaps that are left by our professional lives, said Kasriel. For freelancers, it's the opposite.
But the number you chose at the time may not be the right one for 2018. That's because the new tax law changed the underlying structure on which withholding allowances are based, particularly by eliminating the personal exemption and changing the eligibility for a now-expanded child tax credit.
That said, your husband and you should probably talk to a qualified, competent and knowledgeable expert (and/or crunch your numbers using any of the online Social Security claiming calculators) whether your plan to claim Social Security next year makes the most financial sense, whether it will produce the largest possible benefit to your household.
Florida state Rep. Omari Hardy, a Democrat whose district includes the MorseLife compound, said it's appalling that the wealthy were given exclusive access to the vaccine while older residents of his district and throughout Florida have been struggling to get shots. Phone systems for scheduling appointments have crashed and older residents of some counties where the vaccine has been distributed on a first-come, first-served basis have been forced to camp out overnight to get inoculated.
Yoder's provisions would have roughly doubled the inflow of H-2B seasonal laborers, so forcing down salaries for American seasonal workers and blue collar workers.

A boutique carmaker, Pagani has been selling hand-made cars for 14 years at a rate of less than 10 cars per year. The Italian automaker built the first of 100 Huayras in 2013, and even at around $1 million per vehicle, it sold all the cars. The Huayra, which can zip from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.0 seconds, has a top speed is 224 mph. The Coupe version sacrifices efficiency for speed as it gets an average 13.2 mpg.
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it -- it goes on and on. But it -- (LAUGHS) it -- it says some-- it says some nice things-- Charlie.
Besides paying more for health care, patients would undoubtedly receive inferior care. Extensive wait times seen in countries like Canada and the U.K. would now be the norm in the U.S. Current wait times in Canada are 47 weeks for neurosurgery, 38 weeks for orthopedic surgery, and 29 weeks for ophthalmology, to name just three.
Hence the need to stay alert. Among key points: Be skeptical about offers from unfamiliar companies, avoid clicking on attachments and be wary of unsolicited messages from tax authorities such as the IRS, which doesn't initiate contact this way.
In the original version of the bill, all workers who received paid sick time would be eligible for another 10 weeks of paid leave at two-thirds pay.
Chief Financial Officer Maria Henry said the company's gains from the tax overhaul would help offset the cost of the restructuring plan. The company had an effective tax rate of 28.6 percent in 2017, and the rate would drop to between 23 and 26 percent in 2018 as a result of congressional action, boosting year-over-year earnings growth by 6 percentage points, she told analysts during a conference call to discuss recent financial results.
During a brief speech to the gathered supporters, Castro discussed the first time he met Warren. As a member of a Senate committee with oversight of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Warren invited Castro to lunch in the Senate dining room. What Castro thought would be a casual get-to-know-you visit quickly turned serious and wonky.
Perhaps on a large scale, some of the sectors might need some temporary assistance, Kudlow said on Fox Business.
But the talk from Pelosi and Nadler about being open to the idea of indictment is a warning to the White House: The days of Congress defending the Trump administration at every turn have ended. And new political and legal problems for the President could just be beginning.
Adding to the urgency: New variants of COVID-19 are more transmissive and perhaps more lethal, so Biden's rescue package is the right idea at the right time. It just needs to be the right size.
Also, in 2018, American Express introduced a limited-time Rose Gold design for the Amex Gold, which was so popular that it was brought back again for a short while in 2019. Now, the issuer has announced that Rose Gold will be a permanent option for new card members going forward. That means you can choose between either the original Gold or Rose Gold design when you're approved for the card.
Even Esther George, a hawkish Fed official, said in a speech on Tuesday that it might be a good time to pause rate hikes. And George acknowledged it's unclear whether, or how much, the Fed's shrinking balance sheet is causing borrowing conditions to tighten.

CBS L.A. says the LAUSD covers 710 square miles and has 1,322 schools, although 216 are independent charter schools, most of which were being staffed with non-union teachers and were unaffected by the strike.
If he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction, Mulvaney said.

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Randy Rainbow. And he writes and records song parodies, usually taking Broadway melodies and setting his own satirical lyrics to them. Typically, the songs are about President Trump or politics. And he posts them on YouTube; they get a gazillion views. And in August, he's going to start touring again with his show of his songs.
No American companies have publicly expressed a desire to invest in North Korea, whether in infrastructure or projects like the Wonsan resort. Yet estimates suggest it will take at least $2 trillion to bring North Korea into the 21st century, and South Korea simply does not have that kind of investment money around. China may help – it is already offering classes in economics to North Korean officials – but a communist regime can only do so much to spur economic growth.
Any woman who isn't investing money in a 401(k) plan – or maybe only sets aside a tiny amount – needs to realize that the retirement game is stacked against her.
Trump administration officials have been very critical of the father in particular for, quote, choosing to cross illegally into the United States.

If Donald Trump gets his way on tax reform, Hollywood actors, directors, and writers stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries. Understanding why takes some appreciation of the fact that the entertainment industry isn't just five big corporations, but also thousands of smaller ones — almost all incredibly obscure even if their owners are quite famous.
Are you trying to say that I'm dumb? Or are you mocking me here, Pete? Klobuchar retorted.

It's an astounding story (although one that will likely send any dog lovers reading it into a panic attack); Gurganus proves to be a master of pacing, recounting the dog's struggle in exacting, finely observed detail. Remarkably, he tells the story with no dialogue; the narrator only sees the couple communicating in gestures — it's a technique that somehow manages to amp up the tension of the story while still making clear the love the couple have for each other and for their beloved pet.

An analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that, over a decade, repealing the health insurer tax would cost $145 billion; repealing the prescription drug tax would cost $25 billion; repealing the medical device tax would cost $20 billion; delaying the Cadillac tax would cost $49 billion.
If you pay, according to an FTC alert, they say you must pay the State Department for a certificate that proves the funds are not related to any terrorist activity and the money is cleared for you to receive. (Yes, really!)
Now the teachers' union is demanding still more money even as the number of students instructors have to teach declines. The district has lost 245,000 students over the past fifteen years. As education researcher Lisa Snell of the Reason Foundation noted, even as it was losing students, the number of total LAUSD employees grew by 5 percent over the last five years, primarily thanks to a nearly 16 percent increase in administrators. Snell also found that employee benefit costs increased 110 percent in just the last four years, and the school district's long-term debt liability jumped from $8 billion in 2007 to a whopping $25 billion in 2017.
In addition to the large stage, the rally on the Ellipse featured a sophisticated sound system and at least three Jumbotron-style screens projecting the president's image to the crowd.

Portland: Health officials in the tri-county Portland metro area said Tuesday that tens of thousands of front-line health care workers have not received the COVID-19 vaccine and that it will likely take weeks before most do. One solution is allocating more doses of the vaccine to the populated area, said Jessica Guernsey, the Multnomah County public health director. Guernsey said officials have spoken to the Oregon Health Authority about this option and have not received an outright denial. There really is no easy way to say this: Right now we are in a situation in the metro area where we have more people eligible for the vaccine than we actually have vaccine in the metro area, Guernsey said. This is an incredibly frustrating situation. Health leaders in Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties announced Tuesday that the online regional COVID-19 Phase 1A vaccination sign-up survey launched Jan. 12 is now closed because of the limited vaccine supply. Health officials said that while 60,000 eligible people applied for vaccines through the survey, only 11,000 were sent invitations to be vaccinated.

People think that adult dependents aren't having to pay their rent, aren't contributing to their own household income and well-being, said Sarah Audelo, the executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action.

Incredibly, some Democrats are so convinced that a Progressive Promised Land is now in sight that they have even taken to criticizing the legacy of President Barack Obama, the man who saved them from the wilderness. For all their talk of how hard it will be to beat Trump, they seem convinced that 2020 will vindicate the ideologues of 1968, avenge the losses of the 1980s and repudiate the GOP advances of the 2000s.

Other senators appear to be open to punishing corporations for not paying their workers sufficient wages.

GROSS: So in terms of lack of resources, among the things you're mentioning is the resource of time, that public defenders don't have enough time to represent all the clients that they're supposed to be representing, and judges don't have time to hear all the cases they're supposed to be hearing.

Procrastinators live among us, given that about 20 percent of taxpayers wait until the last two weeks of the tax season to file their returns. The majority of Americans tend to file early because of the anticipation of receiving their tax refund, said Lisa Greene-Lewis, CPA and tax expert at TurboTax. Others, however, may have complicated tax issues or late-arriving tax forms that delay their ability to file, while some might simply put it off because they are worried or confused about the process.
A Quinnipiac University poll this week found 37% of Republicans support Biden's $1.9 trillion package. But it has strong support from independents and overwhelming support from Democrats, meaning nearly 7 in 10 Americans support the proposal. Individual elements of the plan, particularly the $1,400 direct payments, enjoy strong support.
There is the reality of what the White House is doing, which is very little, and the image they're trying to send, which is, 'Look at us, we're busy, and the vice president is rolling up his sleeves,'  one Democratic official said. They're worried about defections.
Garcia expressed doubt that Biden would consider amnesty even if legislation fails. I don't think it's realistic that any president is going to say, 'We're going to pardon 600,000 Dreamers or 1.2 million Dreamers,' he said. And I don't believe Dreamers are guilty of any offense.

There have been lawsuits in New York from police officers that, when they are assigned to low-income communities of color, under pressure from these quotas, they feel forced to contribute to the racial disproportion of the criminal system - that in essence, because they've been assigned to communities of color, that they have to issue citations, that they have to engage in arrests, even when some other police action or some other intervention might be more appropriate.

With an ethics waiver, a federal official is free to act on matters that normally would trigger concerns about conflicts of interest or other ethical problems. Federal regulations say the waivers generally should be made public on request. The Obama administration routinely posted waivers online.

But a catastrophic epidemic is unlikely to dissuade Republicans who have been clamoring to substantially curtail Medicaid. The GOP's failed Obamacare replacement bill in 2017 included a similar block grants proposal and the party has been trying to impose one since the 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan backed a version of the policy.
The alternative argument is that the U.S. is about to lead the world into a wave of destructive economic nationalism that threatens to undermine the core of the post-war global trade and investment regime. In a zero-sum world where my gain must come at your loss, everyone stands to lose, of course. Imposing unilateral tariffs simply results in more of the same. Protectionism implies less competition, higher prices, rising inflation, and higher interest rates. Some of those foreign companies that previously couldn't wait to earn tax breaks by investing in the U.S. and hiring American workers are about to become a thing of the past.

Dover: The First State's roads are still some of the nation's most deadly. After some improvement a year ago, the state's number of traffic deaths grew from 111 in 2018 to 132 last year, a rise of about 19%, according to the Office of Highway Safety. The number of pedestrian deaths rose from 24 to 30, returning Delaware to among the nation's leaders. There's no silver bullet to solve this, says John McNeal, chairman of the state's Pedestrian Council. Education campaigns and some road improvement projects have been implemented since 2015, when Delaware ranked as the most deadly state for pedestrians. But officials acknowledge the efforts haven't been enough and say more needs to be done. Two weeks into 2020, at least three pedestrians have died in crashes.

You can buy an annuity in two forms: an immediate or deferred. Both forms protect you from outliving your retirement savings. An immediate annuity means that you pay a lump-sum amount of cash, usually at retirement, and immediately start receiving annuity payments. A deferred annuity means that you pay for it, often while working, long before you start receiving annuity payments. Due to recent legal changes, you'll soon be allowed to buy deferred annuities through 401(k) plans.

Steyer, who got wealthy (and remains wealthy) running a hedge fund, was not the only billionaire looking at a 2020 run. But the Democratic Party, which has elected some independently wealthy candidates to governor's mansions (Illinois's J.B.

My father was a very physically powerful, very tough guy when he was, especially when he was younger. He deteriorated very quickly in his 50s and died when he was 55 years old of cancer. But he never really got a chance to see me do what I do.

Widespread delusion can have bitter consequences, as we saw Wednesday, when amateur dramatics led a misinformed audience to storm the stage. Cameron's mistakes meant that the country he led dropped out of Europe and is at greater risk of breaking apart. Cruz and Hawley's not only helped provoke a mob but could also make American democracy unworkable, as everyone starts challenging every result they don't like. Politicians can't rely on political institutions to save the country from the consequences of their playacting, because the institutions aren't outside the politicians, and the politicians aren't outside the institutions.
However, Mulvaney's hopes of closing or even significantly shrinking the tax gap may be a stretch. The tax gap has remained relatively stable during the last decade, with the majority of the gap stemming from individual, rather than corporate, tax, shortages. The total tax gap was $450 billion in 2006, and the total tax compliance rate was 83 percent, according to the Government Accountability Office. The Obama administration made attempts to close the gap by stepping up enforcement, but probably only reduced it by $50 billion to $100 billion over a decade, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Apart from raising taxes, the 48-page omnibus bill currently before the Great and General Court seeks to expand a cannabis board to five members, prohibit localities from enforcing laws against the transportation or delivery of pot, maintain a database on people using medical marijuana, and seize weed from those, such as Charlie and Mark, not given the state's imprimatur to sell. The proposed law authorizes investigations and audits of the pot dispensaries. It imposes stringent testing on the product. And it directs the authorized marijuana dealers to abide by an affirmative action program in hiring.
When much of the action is grass-roots and outside the Beltway, we need the ideas and analysis that commentary pieces in the regional and local newspapers provide to help us better understand what's going on around the nation and in local communities and to find solutions.

Providing a platform for reasoned exchanges of ideas at the national, regional and local levels helps build consensus on policy concerns — and bring us together.

HARRY REID SWIPES AT OCASIO-CORTEZ TAX HIKE PROPOSAL, SAYING AMERICANS WON'T ACCEPT 'RADICAL CHANGE QUICKLY'
Today, by contrast, economists increasingly accept the idea that deficits are not inherently destabilizing, but a normal part of economic management. The price of going too big isn't a crash, but a little unwanted inflation ― something that can be reined in through Federal Reserve policymaking or some tax increases from Congress. These may be unpleasant when they come, but it will be much worse for people to lose jobs, incomes and homes in the meantime. When the costs of going too small are shattered families and broken faith in a shared national project, the choice is not difficult.
Reform of public pensions will be much more difficult. Although states may establish a different retirement system for their newly hired employees, this will take years to have much of a financial impact.

When, in 2014, Robert accepted an award from the Association for Computational Linguistics, he recalled, in a soft voice and with quiet humor, his consternation at being informed that he was expected to give an oration on some topic or another for an hour, which, by the way, is more than I typically talk in a month. Sebastian Mallaby's account of the hedge-fund elite, More Money Than God, describes him as an icy cold poker player who doesn't remember having a nightmare. He likes model trains, having once purchased a set for $2.7 million, and has acquired one of the country's largest collections of machine guns. For years, Robert has embraced a supercharged libertarianism with idiosyncratic variations. He is reportedly pro-death penalty, pro-life and pro-gold standard. He has contributed to an ad campaign opposing the construction of the ground zero mosque; Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, a group that is associated with fringe scientific claims; and Black Americans for a Better Future—a vehicle, the Intercept discovered, for an African-American political consultant who has accused Barack Obama of relentless pandering to homosexuals.

As many people know, after his football-playing days ended, Kemp served as a member of Congress for nine terms, representing western New York. He was often quoted as saying his football career served him well as preparation for his later and longer career in politics because, according to a version quoted by The Associated Press, by the time he got into office he had been booed, cheered, cut, sold, traded and hung in effigy.

Jackson: Republican Tate Reeves was inaugurated as governor Tuesday, pledging to provide economic opportunities for all people in the state and to defend a loving culture that underpins our quality of life. Reeves, 45, is the 65th governor of Mississippi. He succeeds Republican Phil Bryant, who served two terms. This will be an administration for all Mississippi, Reeves said during his inaugural speech. Reeves served two terms as lieutenant governor and two terms before that as the elected state treasurer. He took the oath as governor before family, friends, lawmakers and other officials in the House chamber of the state Capitol. A culture of love and kinship has knitted Mississippi families together, and tied them to each other, for ages, Reeves said. It is what makes us special in a fast-paced and transient world. I will defend that culture against the erosion that frays societies.

Santa Fe: An economic relief package is taking shape at the Legislature as a Senate panel endorsed a $600 rebate to low-income workers and a separate bill that would waive licensing fees on liquor stores. Residentswho earned up to $31,200 during 2020 would be eligible for the $600 payout or credit against tax liabilities under a bill that also provides a temporary tax break for restaurants as they endure restrictions on indoor dining. A panel of lawmakers unanimously advanced those proposals Tuesday. The concept of a rebate to low-income workers who labored through the pandemic at essential businesses was pioneered late last year by Republican lawmakers without approval. Democrats have embraced the approach under a bill from Sens. Peter Wirth of Santa Fe, Jacob Candelaria of Albuquerque and Siah Correa Hemphill of Silver City that also includes temporary tax breaks for restaurants and other food service businesses, from food trucks to craft breweries, for a four-month period starting March 1. The income tax rebate alone could distribute an estimated $95 million in credits and rebates. The bill received unified praise from business associations and a progressive-leaning advocacy group for solutions to childhood poverty.

The issue of corporate accountability remains fresh in many lawmakers' minds. In 2009, amid the Great Recession, the insurance company American International Group (AIG) handed out millions in bonuses after receiving a bailout from the federal government. The move prompted widespread criticism from both parties on Capitol Hill and further soured the public on the idea of taxpayer-funded bailouts, especially to Wall Street.

Rebekah Mercer was impressed by Nix's command of data and artistry on the polo field. JOSHUA BRIGHT/THE WASHINGTON POST/GETTY IMAGES According to Perkins and Caddell, Rebekah and Nix met with them a few times to discuss how CA could use the Smith Project. Rebekah was clearly impressed by Nix. In one meeting, according to Perkins, she gushed about his polo prowess and asked him to show off cellphone photos of himself on horseback. (Nix says he doesn't recall this meeting or others with the three. He also doesn't remember displaying such a picture and can think of no good reason why Bob or Pat would be interested in horses.) The political veterans were skeptical. I didn't understand what Nix was talking about, Perkins told me bluntly. Caddell says he was perplexed when Nix wouldn't show him the instruments CA used to predict voter behavior. He also thought the firm didn't grasp the seismic shift underway in American politics. And yet to his great surprise, Bannon vouched for CA, telling Caddell its scientists were geniuses. Caddell knew that Bannon was beholden to the Mercers—they were, after all, Breitbart's part-owners. According to The New York Times, however, Bannon was also vice president of CA's board. Even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist. After he learned of Bannon's involvement, Caddell stopped asking Bannon questions about CA. In the end, Bannon helped seal the deal between the Mercers and Cruz, with CA as the glue.

That might leave Muskie as a reconciliation candidate. Or is it possible, as some politicians have already begun to fantasize, that stalemated delegates from all factions of the party will send up a cry from the floor: Kennedy! Kennedy! Success at Last for George I believe the people of this country are tired of the old rhetoric, the unmet promise, the image makers and the practitioners of the expedient. The people are not centrist or liberal or conservative. Rather, they seek a way out of the wilderness. So said Senator McGovern as he officially hit the campaign trail 15 long months ago -- and all but disappeared into the political wilderness. As the earliest declared candidate for the presidential nomination in recent memory, he had a plan: challenge Edmund Muskie before he built up an insurmountable lead, go all out to make a credible showing in the New Hampshire primary, and then, gathering momentum, overtake the field in Wisconsin. Back then, his strategy seemed dreamy, if not downright doomed. Few political leaders took his candidacy seriously, dismissing him as a self-appointed conscience of the party or a stalking horse for Ted Kennedy. The Margin. The professional polls had clearly underestimated George Stanley McGovern, 49, child of the plains, minister's son, college-debate champion, World War II bomber pilot, former history professor, father of five and, according to Robert Kennedy, the most decent man in the Senate.

Power shortages: The state that leads the nation, and the world, in technological innovation cannot keep the lights on any longer — not since the Pacific Gas & Electric Company began shutting off the electricity last year during high winds to prevent wildfires and protect itself from liability. After focusing on green energy and letting nuclear plants go dark, the state government was unprepared for the basic task of making sure California had enough power.

HORSLEY: There is. For example, South Korea is asking for just money to help businesses that are adversely affected by the epidemic. President Trump has been talking about a payroll tax holiday, which was something that was done during the recession. But there's been little follow-up on that from the White House and almost no talk about it on Capitol Hill.
I know that $30 a month may not feel like a big deal to most people, but when you are living paycheck-to-paycheck that is a decent chunk of change to have to set aside each month, said Sydney, who asked to go by only her first name to protect her privacy.

Funds must come with strings attached to ensure that the money goes to maintain payroll, not to enrich shareholders or pay executive bonuses, Warren said in an op-ed this week. Giant corporations that receive substantial loans from taxpayers should be required to set aside one or more board seats for a representative elected by the company's workers. Violations should trigger criminal penalties and clawbacks.
In a 2016 opinion piece, Raul A. Reyes, an immigration attorney and member of USA TODAY's board of contributors, argued that by inviting young Dreamers to sign up for DACA, Democrats later exposed them to deportation under the Trump administration.
If you had a large business loss but no other income last year, you could potentially wind up owing no taxes. A taxpayer could even use a large loss from 2020 to offset income for prior years, potentially getting tax refunds for, say, 2019 or 2018, said Robert Caplan, a partner at Caplan & Wong CPAs in San Mateo, California.

For products that will be sold to consumers, most companies employ a Most Significant Digit (MSD) pricing strategy. Why? Studies and experience show that sales will be significantly higher if a product is priced at say $29.95 or $29.99 instead of $30. Most humans focus on the most significant digit - the 2 in this case. To them $29.95 or $29.99 seems a lot less than $30 even though it is only 1 to 5¢ less. Even expensive homes in Beverly Hills might sell for $7,995,000 rather than $8 million. There are exceptions. In upscale restaurants, it is usually a mistake to price an entrée at $31.95. Instead it will be priced at $32-. For some reason, people do not think the food is as good if MSD pricing is used in a high-end restaurant.

And Donald Trump is very good at sort of making-- of-- of sewing division and-- and-- and trolling this kind of stuff. And he gets, from-- from his perspective, pretty good results when he does.
Baton Rouge: A judge has refused to toss out six criminal complaints filed against a pastor charged with violating gathering capacity rules put in place during the early days of the pandemic. Nineteenth Judicial District Judge Eboni Johnson-Rose on Monday dismissed pastor Tony Spell's motion to have the case against him dropped, news outlets report. The judge's ruling sided with a special assistant to the district attorney who argued that when the charges were filed in the early days of the outbreak, New Orleans was a national coronavirus hot spot, and Louisiana was under a declared emergency, The Advocate reports. Prosecutors alleged Spell violated public gathering capacity limits Gov. John Bel Edwards put in place last spring by continuing to host worship services at his Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge with hundreds in attendance. He was accused six times in March of violating the orders. Spell said he did not attend his hearing Monday because he refused to wear a mask inside the courthouse. He and more than a dozen supporters and church members instead gathered across the street to protest the charges, with Spell later telling The Advocate the judge ruled against God by not voiding his offenses.

However, the most immediate question will be whether Cohen's taking of the oath to testify will be followed by the usual comedic two drums and a cymbal riff. After a long and documented history as a liar and felon, Cohen's taking of any oath deserves proper musical accompaniment.
RAINBOW: Yeah, absolutely. I have, and I've pushed myself to do so because I always considered song parody kind of cheap. And I've always been - part of me - a little embarrassed that I do it and that I'm, you know, kind of ripping off other people's work. But it's only now that I'm - that I've been doing it - and then I've gotten response from others, including the actual artists who originated the work, that I'm appreciating it as an art form. But I think that I've pushed myself because I think that if I'm not going to write the original music to go with the lyrics, I'd better step it up and bring something special and strong to the table.
What he believed in most was so-called supply-side economics, the tax-cutting philosophy that is most closely associated with conservative Republicans like Ronald Reagan. But what he also believed in was equal opportunity.
Even if you were to take an Uber back and forth to work every day in New York City, you'd spend just $705 a month on average, which might still be slightly cheaper than owning a vehicle. Plus, you wouldn't have to assume the risk of major breakdowns or worry about parking.
What is most maddening is that better alternatives exist, including some being developed by the business community that would target resources to the workers most in need without a vast new bureaucracy. They also have the advantage of being able to be implemented far sooner than the 2020 start envisioned under the council's bill.
Operators that have casino-hotels in other states likely have begun sending notices to some workers at those properties to draw them to Las Vegas temporarily, McCall said. It would be hard to hire short-term replacement workers locally because unemployment is low in Las Vegas.

Bernie Sanders's 24%, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 20% and former Vice President Joe Biden's 17%. But Warren earns the support of 21% of registered Democrats, trailing only Sanders. Her standing is hurt because just 5% of independents plan to back her. (Other polls in New Hampshire, including ones by Marist College, WBUR and Suffolk University, find similar gaps.)

Wednesday is the deadline for health insurers to finalize rates for the 2018 individual market open enrollment season, which starts Nov. 1. Yet there has been no resolution to the question of whether the federal government will continue to reimburse insurers for subsidies known as cost-sharing reductions. Those are payments insurers are required to provide to moderate-income enrollees to help them afford deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. The law says the federal government is supposed to make those payments, but a lawsuit has left that an open question, and the Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to stop making the payments.
Several investor-funded activists echoed Marek's call for cheap labor in the video.
In 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were too big to fail. Yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. Incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP. Enough is enough.

There's an urgency to moving it forward, and he certainly believes ...there needs to progress in the next couple of weeks, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.

What's more, the judge is likely to take into account that your husband never worked over this time, or paid the bills, and a good lawyer will make sure that's front and center in your divorce case should your husband's lawyer ask for alimony in lieu of you living in your house (sorry to bring that up). The upside: Alimony is tax-deductible for the payer and must be reported as income by the payee. Divide it all down the middle, start over and look to the future, says Randy Kessler, an Atlanta-based lawyer who wrote the book, Divorce: Protect Yourself, Your Kids, and Your Future. You should feel better that when the case is over, you will still have a job and can replenish so even if it is all divided, you will still be better off than him. It pays to have a good (and honest) divorce lawyer.
The report lays out objections to the Republican plan, including an argument that cutting trillions in taxes for rich Americans, as Republicans have proposed, would increase inequality in the United States. (A separate analysis last year, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, found that 99.6 percent of the savings under Ryan's plan would accrue to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers.)
But it's unclear how the Warren team plans to jumpstart her campaign into actually winning the nomination, particularly as Sanders continues to raise gargantuan sums ― his campaign announced Thursday morning he raised more than $25 million in January ― and seemingly consolidates his hold on the left-leaning voters they once battled over.

Reno: A pigeon wearing a tiny sombrero was discovered following sightings of its cowboy hat-wearing cousins in Las Vegas, a city manager says. Reno City Manager Sabra Newby tweeted about the bird Wednesday, saying it's quirky and fun but still inhumane, KOLO-TV reports. It is the first known sighting of hat-wearing birds in the region, Washoe County Regional Animal Services officials say. The sighting comes after a pigeon in Las Vegas with a miniature cowboy hat glued to its head died last week, animal officials say. People who see the bird are encouraged to call animal service dispatch officers, officials say. It is unclear who put the hat on the bird. Reno cares about our animals, Newby says. They need protection and don't need to become a punchline.
I think there's a listening ear that's coming from the administration and Democrats on the Hill, for that matter, said Ben Wessel, the executive director of NextGen America, a progressive group dedicated to mobilizing young people.

Other census job scams ask you for your bank account information in order to set up a direct deposit for your wages, only to use that information to steal directly from your bank account. Or you may be asked for your Social Security number for purposes of tax withholding.

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the federal government now spends tens of billions of dollars each year providing financial assistance to people who buy insurance through HealthCare.gov or one of the exchanges (like Covered California) that some states run on their own.

2. There are a number of ways to close the gap between the money Social Security expects to take in from payroll taxes (the sole source of revenue once the trust fund is exhausted) and what it's expected to pay out in retirement benefits. All of the fixes involve some combination of raising revenue and/or cutting benefits. If policy makers act now, the gap could be closed with relatively modest changes. The longer we wait, the larger the required changes will have to be. Some of the fixes proposed by the GOP candidates would help to narrow the gap, but none would close it altogether.

So, the way our laws would be administered Virginia would be completely different. This isn't about party politics as much it is about the kind of Virginia that we want.

Today, Medicaid is an entitlement program, like Medicare and Social Security, meaning that spending automatically rises to cover the costs incurred for medical care.

But states that adopt the Healthy Adult Opportunity program would give up that open-ended guarantee of federal funding.

Now, should you decide to use the strategy suggested above and spend down your husband's 401(k) and delay your Social Security benefits then you could consider a more cash-type position for your IRA if it will be exhausted in the next two to three years, says Clark. Keep in mind that your 401(k) should also have a money market or short duration bond choice so you don't have to transfer to an IRA to reduce volatility. Remember investing is not as much about age as it is purpose and need.

It is an open secret that the best political reward is a tax subsidy because it continues indefinitely, is hidden from the public, and never has to be justified once its on the books. That is why the plutocrats have made our tax code so complicated and irrational. As my old boss, Senator Proxmire once said the more complicated a tax provision is, the less justification there is likely to be for it. Everyone, who isn't benefiting from it, agrees that carried interest, for example, should be taxed as ordinary income. Just as everyone, who isn't benefiting from it, agrees it is irrational to encourage the export of jobs and profits by deferring taxes on so-called foreign income. But they remain as part of our tax code because those who benefit from them are willing to spend whatever it takes to defend them while the ordinary citizen, who may know about them, isn't organized enough to mount a campaign against them or those who support them.

Las Vegas: Health officials said second doses of COVID-19 vaccine will be offered at the Las Vegas Convention Center beginning next week. The Southern Nevada Health District said the appointment-only clinic will open Feb. 2 for people who received their first doses at a health district clinic and are eligible to receive their boosters. The district has started to notify people who are eligible, including those who received their first shots at Western High School, Cashman Center or the health district's main office in Las Vegas. People who were vaccinated at one of the locations and do not receive a notification can call the district to make appointments for the second doses. Residents who received their first doses at other locations will not be eligible. Health officials recommend that the second dose of vaccine be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. The interval for the Pfizer vaccine is 21 days, and for the Moderna vaccine it is 28 days. The two vaccines are not interchangeable.

O'Fallon: Republican Gov. Mike Parson plans to divert thousands of unused doses of COVID-19 vaccine from CVS and Walgreens pharmacies to other state-enrolled vaccinators to help the slower-than-expected vaccination process, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. Spokeswoman Kelli Jones said the administration has requested the return of 25,000 doses from CVS and Walgreens, which would then be rerouted to county health departments, medical hospitals and clinics, and hundreds of other state-approved vaccinators. The pharmacy chains were tasked with providing vaccinations at long-term care facilities under a Trump administration plan unveiled in December. Jones said Missouri's new plan won't affect shots for workers and residents at those facilities that have been ravaged by COVID-19. Our objective, though, is for those vaccines allocated in Missouri to be administered into people's arms, and we're kind of disappointed how that federal pharmacy program has gone, Jones said. According to data posted Wednesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Missouri ranks last among states for the share of residents who have received an initial vaccine dose.

At the heart of the case is an official named Stefan Priesner, an Austrian who headed the United Nations Development Program in Bangladesh from 2008 to 2012. When he left at the end of his tenure, Mr. Priesner sold his imported sport utility vehicle to a colleague.
The government's real grudge may be not with Mr. Priesner but with the United Nations and other international institutions. The program Mr. Priesner headed worked on electoral reform in Bangladesh, where Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina won the 2014 election essentially by default after major opposition groups boycotted the vote. The next general election is scheduled for next year, and will probably be closely scrutinized.
And the higher bond rates, coupled with the Fed setting its rates higher, can raise the cost of doing business, and the cost of living for households.

Methodology: To identify the cars with the worst gas mileage, 24/7 Wall St. used data on estimated combined city and highway miles per gallon from the EPA. We only reviewed 2015 and 2016 models and used data on the 2016 model when available. We further screened by eliminating any duplicate models, opting for the model and trim with the worst mpg. If multiple trim levels of the same model have the same fuel efficiency, we only looked at one model.

Several horses died due to bullet wounds, but other carcasses were too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests officials said in a statement Friday. The statement said the 15 carcasses were found in a ranger district headquartered in Heber-Overgaard, a rural community 109 miles northeast of Phoenix. According to the statement, evidence was limited because some of the carcasses had been exposed to extreme weather conditions over extended periods of time. Forest officials said law enforcement officials had taken steps to more quickly deploy equine experts and veterinarians to incident scenes to help collect evidence.

Part of the tax money would be used to reduce the tax on medical marijuana from 2% to 1%. The second ballot issue is a constitutional amendment that would restrict marijuana consumption, like alcohol, to people age 21 or older. The initiatives were delivered to the secretary of state and the Legislative Services Division on Monday, Montana Public Radio reports. The Attorney General must approve the language before the group can start gathering signatures in an effort to put the issues before voters in November 2020.

The deal came as teachers in Denver voted to go on strike as soon as next Monday. More than 5,000 educators would be affected. The main sticking point is increasing base pay and lessening teachers' reliance on one-time bonuses for having students with high test scores or working in a high-poverty school.
Colorado already has a similar law and charges a fee every time a background check is performed.

Bismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing. Burgum has said the policy change could help address North Dakota's workforce shortage and grow its economy, while removing the stigma for what are minor cases from years ago.

My opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to cut it out and end their destructive behavior. But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to cut it out.

Markets continue to climb, shaking off a grim jobs report. By: Ella Koeze · Data delayed at least 15 minutes · Source: FactSet Financial markets continued to rally on Friday, fueled by bets that a Democrat-led government in Washington would robust fiscal stimulus and despite fresh evidence that the United States economy is backsliding as the pandemic surges. The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent, climbing further into record territory and bringing its gains for the week to 1.8 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 was 0.7 percent higher, and the FTSE 100 in Britain rose slightly. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Japan closed with a gain of 2.4 percent, climbing to a level it last hit in 1990. Though Washington continues to focus on the pro-Trump mob that overran the Capitol building on Wednesday, the investing world is instead focused on the wave of spending that could come as Democrats assume leadership of the White House and both houses of Congress That enthusiasm also helped investors look past the Labor Department's report on December payrolls, which showed that U.S. employers cut 140,000 jobs last month, the first drop since last spring. The weak report bolsters the argument that more economic stimulus is needed. Stocks dipped Friday afternoon, but they recovered after President-elect Joseph R.

During last year's campaign, Mr. Biden had a phrase he invoked with almost musical regularity: the election, he always said, was a battle for the soul of America. As a piece of political rhetoric, it might have been just a platitude. How can I deny, though, that the near-sacking of the Capitol — in a week when, for the first time, the daily death toll from Covid-19 reached an unendurable 4,000 Americans — indicates that the United States has undergone, these last years, a kind of soul-death? And if you were treating a patient whose soul had curdled, what sort of medicine might you prescribe?

Wichita: A former Newman University professor who alleged the university discriminated against her because she was a woman should receive more than $800,000 in damages and be reinstated, a federal jury ruled Monday. The jury found in favor of Cindy Louthan, former assistant professor of elementary education at Newman, who sued the private Roman Catholic university in Wichita in 2018. Cindy Louthan alleged a supervisor was hostile toward women and harassed and discriminated against her because she is female. She also contended the university did not investigate her concerns and punished her when she complained about the supervisor, ending in her losing her job, The Wichita Eagle reports. Louthan was one of five former university employees who sued the school alleging unfair treatment or termination in recent years. The university has denied the allegations in each case.

This interest in tourism has reportedly seeped into recent talks with China and the United States. This month, the South Korean newspaper Dong-A Ilbo reported that Kim has repeatedly mentioned to Chinese officials his desire to see Beijing invest in creating a world-class resort in Wonsan, a beachside city several reports suggest could be turned into a special economic zone where foreign investment is permitted. The same newspaper reported that Kim Yong-chol, believed to be Kim's most trusted official, suggested to President Trump that he could help North Korea build a casino in Wonsan, should talks with Kim go well, predicting that a casino in that city could generate $50 million a year.

Turning to other ways in which the virus threatens family incomes, we need to be sure that people don't avoid testing and treatment because of insurance and surprise billing concerns. The Affordable Care Act covers government-recommended vaccines, but that option is many months away. The broader public interest makes this a critical moment for the government to pick up the tab for coronavirus-related treatment. Congress should act quickly to require that insurers cover testing and treatment for the coronavirus in the same way they are required to cover various forms of preventive care at no charge to patients.

New York: Federal authorities are turning to a new tactic in the escalating conflict over the city's so-called sanctuary policies, issuing four immigration subpoenas for information about inmates wanted for deportation. This is not a request – it's a demand, Henry Lucero, said a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. This is a last resort for us. Dangerous criminals are being released every single day in New York. Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration said Saturday that the city would review the subpoenas. New York City will not change the policies that have made us the safest big city in America, spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said in an email. The development came days after ICE sent similar subpoenas to Denver, a move that reflected the agency's mounting frustration with jurisdictions that do not honor deportation detainers or provide any details about defendants going in and out of local custody.

Certainly, it's the case that Christians were terrified of ISIS and fled. ISIS has desecrated churches and shrines.

It'd be easy to overdetermine a meaning from this. Just 21,142 ballots were cast, not counting write-in votes, which meant turnout dipped slightly from the 2014 election that first put Wexton in the Senate.

The collapse of Virginia's Republican Party has sped up since then.

At this point, however, we know that cultural explanations of social collapse were all wrong. The sociologist William Julius Wilson argued long ago that social dysfunction in big cities was caused, not by culture, but by the disappearance of good jobs.

At times over his first two years in office, Trump was unable to even navigate issues popular with the Republican base and that didn't require a 60-vote margin. He deferred to congressional leaders on the outlines of an overhaul to the Affordable Care Act, later disparaging a House-passed bill before it got to the Senate. When a reform effort came to the Senate under reconciliation rules that required only 50 votes, Trump could not persuade those easy-to-deal-with politicians to pass it, despite his party's majority.
All the Republicans in that photo you showed standing there on the steps with him a year ago today all looking so slap happy and ah, remember it's not just Trump, all of the Republicans, all of them, nobody has had the courage to stand up and say this is wrong, this is un-American, he said.
When you are pricing your products, what gives you control over the price is the uniqueness built into your positioning, or branding, strategy. If you have created a product image that is impossible, or very difficult, to copy, you can employ a WTMWB price that will give you a good GPM that enables you to achieve your desired GPMT. And, if you sell your product in a consumer market, it would be a good idea to also employ an MSD pricing strategy. For example, if you are a manufacturer that is targeting a GPM of 50% and your cost of sales is $15, you might consider selling the product for $29.99 - a penny less than the price of 2C. Best of luck.
Can a president really be this far removed from the reality base that the rest of official Washington takes for granted? Yes, say Rucker and Leonnig — and what is more, his free-form defiance of norms and restraints is the essence of Trump's governance — and of his enduring appeal to his adherents.

Consider the abortion rate of those judged less than perfect who face discrimination in the womb because of perceptions of their abilities.

Two of my four children have cystic fibrosis, and I can tell you that there is tremendous pressure put on mothers like me to abort, as though a life is only worth living when others decide that you will earn more in your lifetime than you cost.

One complication for your daughters if they are still in school is the effect these funds may have on their financial aid.

However, income from such accounts, including income from a conversion can count. Even distributions from an Inherited Roth IRA that are not taxable can be counted as income for student aid purposes. If they are receiving financial aid, they should consult with an adviser to assess all the tradeoffs. They may want to delay taking any funds from the inherited accounts or converting.

(From left to right) Patrick Caddell, Stephen Bannon, Lee and Alice Hanley On July Fourth weekend in 2014, members of the Mercer clan (Robert, Rebekah and her husband, Sylvain Mirochnikoff) went to visit some new friends. They traveled on Robert's 203-foot luxury superyacht, the Sea Owl, and anchored just off the WASP enclave of Fishers Island in New York's Long Island Sound. Their destination, a medieval-style granite castle called White Caps, towered over the shoreline. This was the summer home of Lee and Alice Hanley, Reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in Texas oil and gas but lived mostly between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. Like the Mercers, the Hanleys were convinced that the American political establishment was rotten to its foundations. Unlike the Mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider. It didn't matter whether the candidate came from the left or the right; voters just wanted somebody different. They had lost all faith in the ruling class—the government, the media, Wall Street.
We've got football and hockey and soccer. We're as big a city as St. Louis, we're as big a city as Milwaukee and a bunch of cities that have teams, so I don't see why we couldn't.
By ceasing the collection and reporting of substantial amounts of civil judgment and tax lien information, the three major national credit bureaus will be providing a significantly less valuable product at lower cost (and risk) to themselves while keeping the price of their product unchanged.

Most of the Republican schemes under consideration, including a working draft of House legislation that Politico obtained last week, envision the federal government continuing to provide assistance to people who buy coverage on their own. But the assistance would take a different form ― with a new formula for the tax credits, and no special assistance for out-of-pocket costs.
Before and during the pandemic, DeVos trained her focus on what conservatives call school choice policies, which allocate taxpayer money to families who choose alternatives to traditional public schools.

By doing this he can connect with two opposing camps and become a President for all Americans: on one side he has the social justice wing of the Democrats, and on the other the Rust Belt Trump supporters. Both groups — in the Black Lives Matter protests and the storming of the Capitol respectively — have shown their willingness to engage in civil disobedience, or worse.
All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside of the United States. Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes. In other words, we're reducing your taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent. — Donald Trump

HECK: Ambassador Sondland had told you that his request the Ukrainians had been coordinated with the chief of staff -- acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Did you report that to Mr. Eisenberg?
Consider this: The IRS reports that the error rate for paper returns is 21%, which means that one in five tax filers who go this route manages to muck something up. The error rate for electronic returns, on the other hand, is less than 1%. Remember, we're all human, and therefore subject to the occasional blunder. But if that slip-up results in an IRS audit, you'll be kicking yourself for not doing everything possible to lower your risk.
She has repeatedly declined to repeat her recession-era critiques of the Obama administration and has largely refrained from relitigating the fight that brought her into politics: her battles with Biden over his push for bankruptcy legislation she said would sell out consumers. In general, with the exception of her now-famous wine cave attack on Buttigieg, Warren has avoided going on the attack against the other candidates.

MARTIN: Sorry to interrupt you, Scott, but even as outgoing chief of staff John Kelly said in an exit interview, the administration gave up on the idea of an actual physical wall a long time ago, that it was always more about border security, technology. Maybe the president hasn't gotten the memo on that, but do you think that's ultimately where it's going to end up, anyway?
U.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas imposed the sentence on Harlan Money King Decoste, 27, who previously pleaded guilty to fraud, identity theft and other charges.

In ordinary times, PRI has proven to be an indispensable tool for many businesses that operate internationally in order to maintain growth and profitability. But this is no ordinary time; The winds of change are about to hit us like a hurricane.

Among our most prominent concerns are the millions of employees who may be told not to come to work but who lack paid leave. While more than 70 percent of private-sector workers have some degree of paid sick leave, for workers in the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale, that share falls to 47 percent. Based on their low, often nonexistent, savings, such workers have little to fall back on if they're not getting paid.
We have to expect fiscal policy to be looser than if Republicans had kept their majority, wrote Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a research note. That could mean higher inflation, he added, which could be why U.S. Treasury bonds also saw selling pressure on Wednesday.

But what does Ocasio-Cortez know about tax policy? A lot, said the headline of an opinion piece Saturday in The New York Times by Nobel economics laureate Paul Krugman.

As far as Europe goes, there is an ocean between the U.S. and Europe, and the U.S. already has very strict procedures in place for refugees, as NPR's Brian Naylor has reported.
The pandemic has hurt China's reputation, with many foreign governments still angry that Beijing did not do more to contain the crisis in its earliest stages. So Chinese propagandists are trying to use the W.H.O. inquiry to help shore up China's image and portray the country as a mature superpower. Complicating that effort could be new virus flare-ups in recent weeks that have prompted fresh lockdowns in China. In all, more than 22 million people have been ordered to remain inside their homes — double the number affected a year ago in Wuhan. On Thursday, China's National Health Commission reported a coronavirus death in the mainland for the first time since May. The major concern here is the origin of the outbreak has been so politicized, said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. That has really narrowed the space for the W.H.O. to have an independent, objective and scientific investigation.

If the 401(k) was funded with pretax contributions, any amount converted will be taxable to them but converting to Roth could be a good move because at 21 and 23, they are likely in a low tax bracket.

Bannon flitted in and out. Nix, as usual, did most of the talking. After Neugebauer and Roe visited SCL's London headquarters, the Cruz team agreed that CA could play a key role in their operation, running models and helping with research. However, it was made clear to Rebekah and Nix that the entire data analytics operation would be supervised by Chris Wilson, CEO of the research firm WPA. A source close to Cruz told me that Wilson's operation had played a crucial role when Cruz ran for the Senate with only 2 percent name recognition in Texas and defeated a far better-known opponent. Why, then, was CA necessary at all? No one ever said directly that the quid pro quo for hiring CA was that the Mercers would support Cruz, says someone close to Roe. Nevertheless, after CA was engaged, Neugebauer took a private jet to the Bahamas to meet Robert Mercer on the Sea Owl. When Neugebauer asked him to donate to Cruz's bid, Robert was matter-of-fact. The family would start with $11 million.

Despite Mr. Trump's frequent promises to reduce the trade deficit, many economists believe that his trade policies will be largely powerless to reverse the trend. That's because the overall trade deficit is governed by macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. So while changes in trade policy can shift imports and exports from one country to another, for example, reducing the American trade deficit with China while increasing its trade deficit with Thailand, they are unlikely to reduce the American trade deficit overall.
The energy sector accounts for about 15% of the US high-yield market, making the junk bond market particularly sensitive to sharp swings in oil prices. The 2014-2016 oil crash sparked dozens of oil bankruptcies.

I believe that the greatness can be found in the men and women who built our nation; do its work; and defend our freedom. Truth About The Future If this administration has a plan for a better future, they're keeping it a secret. Here is the truth about the future: We are living on borrowed money and borrowed time. These deficits hike interest rates, clobber exports, stunt investment, kill jobs, undermine growth, cheat our kids, and shrink our future. Whoever is inaugurated in January, the American people will have to pay Mr. Reagan's bills. The budget will be squeezed. Taxes will go up. And anyone who says they won't is not telling the truth to the American people. I mean business. By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two-thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did. There's another difference. When he raises taxes, it won't be done fairly. He will sock it to average-income families again, and leave his rich friends alone. And I won't stand for it. And neither will you and neither will the American people. To the corporations and freeloaders who play the loopholes or pay no taxes, my message is: Your free ride is over. To the Congress, my message is: We must cut spending and pay as we go.

Congress included the $600 payments in a sweeping pandemic aid bill passed just before Christmas.

After initially running for a North Carolina congressional seat as a Democrat in 1992, Jones was first elected to Congress in 1994 during the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich. Although he was a reliable Republican vote for most of his nearly 24-year tenure, Jones gained notoriety for sometimes breaking with his party. Most recently, he did not support the 2017 GOP bill to overhaul the nation's tax system — one of President Trump's few legislative achievements with a Republican-controlled Congress.

Polls generally have reflected bipartisan support for trade over many years. In 2000, Gallup found that most respondents said increasing trade with China would help. And such support held up until the recession, when, as a December 2008 poll showed, Americans became more skeptical about trade.
Political risk exists everywhere, as does uncertainty about how, when, or whether it will manifest itself in ways detrimental to international traders, investors, and lenders. For decades, conventional wisdom dictated that developing and emerging countries were the greatest sources of such risk, due to the absence of meaningful and enforceable laws, the prevalence of corruption, lack of financial resources, and security concerns. That of course remains the case, but as has been proven as a result of the Great Recession, the global war on terror, corruption scandals and growing income disparity, developed countries contribute every bit as much as those 'other' countries to the rising risks associated with cross-border transactions.

Fear is on the rise. Wall Street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% Thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since Nov. 3, 2016, according to FactSet data. The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market.

For example, riders will have more access to jobs, services and schools near the University of Illinois at Chicago, where there are also several hospitals. The changes take effect in April and will last one year. Chicago Transit Authority staff will determine whether to make the changes permanent. The changes will cost about $550,000 and be funded with CTA operating funds, according to officials.

Biden's nominee may also have to figure out how to combat a rise in right-wing domestic terrorism cases, some of which have been directly inspired by the outgoing president's rhetoric against his political enemies and Muslims.

Accused of being either unthinking or unstable, Trump at the time denied being either. He was, he said, a very stable genius. Whether the president meant that with a touch of self-deprecating humor or not, it functions here as the epitome of self-delusion.

The Chevrolet Express is mechanically identical to the GMC Savana — GM sells the same car under different names.

Salt Lake City: Membership growth in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has slowed to its lowest level in decades. The church added just 4,900 members in the state in between October 2018 and September 2019, according to statistics it provided to The Salt Lake Tribune. Utah's total population grew by 53,000 people over the same period, according to estimates. The church grew by fewer than 10,000 people in a year only one other time since 1989, the first year the newspaper had access to membership data. That was in 2018, when membership rose by just over 9,000 people. By comparison, the faith widely known as the Mormon church added more than 40,000 new members in 2013, which was the high mark of the last decade. In Salt Lake County, the state's largest, the number of Latter-day Saints fell by 6,710 even as the county's total population grew by 10,000 people.

Greenville: Mayor Knox White says he's found a way to commit up to $5million toward buying land for affordable housing at County Square, although he says he's still working on the details. The mayor says the $5 million would be in addition to $2 million Greenville County had previously pledged toward affordable housing in the neighborhood that includes County Square. It's the latest step in a project that has been in the works for three years: the $1 billion public-private redevelopment of county-owned land along University Ridge. Negotiations have intensified since since last summer among city and county leaders, downtown residents and RocaPoint over how best to hash out a plan everyone can live with. It is the biggest project Greenville has ever seen, promising thousands of jobs, millions in tax revenues, and a 37-acre expansion of the downtown business district.

Kind of like the 6-year-old boy who pulls the hair of the girl he likes.

JONAH GOLDBERG: Well, I-- I just think all of this is baked in with President Trump. The President Trump you see allegedly mocking the Trail of Tears is the same President who mocked parents of gold star families. Everyone has made up their mind about the guy, and that's-- there's a reason why he's never made it out of the forties in approval rating and his real-- his support is about thirty-five percent of the electorate, which gets us to the fact that this-- there's-- if you just look at the math of the electoral college and his approval rating, there is almost literally no way Donald Trump can affirmatively win in 2020. But the Democrats can certainly lose. And if you look at the way these fights are shaping up, if you look at the way the Democrats this last week walked into Donald Trump's thing at the State of the Union about how we're never going to be a socialist country by unveiling in not great fashion the green new deal, it does seem like the Democrats are in danger of spiraling off to exactly the place where the White House wants them to be.

Biden took office at noon last Wednesday and did not arrive at the White House until nearly 4 p.m. Yet within two hours, he had signed 17 executive actions, including orders reentering the United States into the Paris agreement to combat climate change, ending the national emergency that Trump had declared to let him raid money for his border wall from the military construction budget, suspending Trump's ban on travel from a group of majority-Muslim nations, revoking Trump's order blocking the counting of undocumented immigrants in the 2020 census, and reinstating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that halts deportation of many immigrants who came into the country illegally as young children.
Perhaps the authors of Wednesday's revolt already regret their role in goading the mob. Now that the Democrats have taken the Senate, they are likely to press for federal election reform, a proposition that's anathema to the right. As political scientist Sam Rosenfeld describes it, some Republicans understand that they benefit more in the long term from legal anti-democratic institutions than from dubiously legal anti-democratic actions, which are more set-piece theatrical statements than carefully planned strategies.
ELVING: A few years later, conflicts between Obama and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives led to the so-called fiscal cliff. It was 2012.

To identify the states with the highest and lowest gas taxes, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state and average local gas taxes from the American Petroleum Institute (API). Average gas prices as of January 29, 2016 for each state came from AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report. The number of operating oil refineries in each state came from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). We also reviewed average annual vehicle miles travelled in each state from the Federal Highway Administration (FHA). The number of licensed drivers in each state also came from the FHA. All data are as of the most recent period available.

Trump's child care plan focuses on allowing families to deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes. That was immediately panned this week as largely benefiting richer Americans — higher earners pay higher tax rates, and many lower-and-middle-income households don't pay any federal income tax. Trump's campaign added that they would also have a plan for those lower-income households, allowing them to exclude child care expenses from half their payroll taxes.

In Switzerland, where the number of new Covid-19 infections has fallen in recent days, the authorities announced new restrictions that take effect next week because of the threat posed by the highly transmissible variants. Restrictions on businesses and social life in the country had been limited, and ski resorts have been allowed to remain open in a bid to minimize the impact on the economy. Switzerland is also keeping its schools open. But starting Monday, all shops selling nonessential goods will have to close, the limit on private gatherings has been cut to five people from 10, and the required closing of bars, restaurants, cultural centers and sports facilities has been extended until the end of February.

That will be answered in the week ahead, and that will have a profound effect on what the Congress does and what happens to Donald Trump in the future.

NATAPOFF: So many of the reasons that people are incarcerated in the misdemeanor system have nothing to do with their wrongdoing. When individuals are locked up because they can't pay a fine or a fee, it's not because they're scofflaws. It's because they're poor. When individuals are arrested for loitering or trespassing because the police are under pressure to clear a corner or make a quota, it's not because they're scofflaws. It's not because they're dangerous.
It creates a clear but controversial road map to navigating these highly charged investigations, including mandating a judicial-like process in which the accused has the right to a live hearing and to cross-examine accusers. Supporters say it provided much-needed due-process protections. Opponents argued it would allow assailants and schools to escape responsibility and discourage victims from coming forward.

I'd say, I'm going to be home at 10:30. And I'm tense the whole time. I mean, like, I'm waiting for the bomb to drop. He'd lean in and press his finger into my shoulder.

Mulvaney notified Shaub in a letter last week that the data call appears to raise legal questions regarding the scope of OGE's authorities.

There's been a full court press to roll back Dershowitz's comments. Don't buy it. It appears he said what he meant. Trump's legal team seems to recognize he went too far and could scare off swing votes. That's because the ideas he articulated are worth being alarmed about. If the Republican senators roll over for Dershowitz's argument, they won't get a do-over when similar circumstances emerge under a Democratic president. This will set a precedent for virtually unlimited executive power.
Now that Cohen has accused President Trump of involvement in criminal conduct, the American people deserve to hear Cohen's claims in greater detail.
TOTENBERG: Not really. I suppose you could note that in this case, he's agreeing with not just the court's liberals but with conservative icon Scalia. But he did write separately to say that the Constitution looks unkindly on any law so vague that reasonable people cannot understand it. Still, this is just one vote in one case from a justice who otherwise has a very consistently conservative record. So at least as of now, you really can't draw any conclusion.
Executives cited declining fertility rates in the United States and South Korea as factors that have contributed to a decline in diaper sales, long considered one of Kimberly-Clark's bedrock lines of business.

Tallahassee: In his State of the State address Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis called for teacher raises, the eradication of Burmese pythons in the Everglades, and a new law to force girls to get their parents' permission before getting an abortion. DeSantis said keeping taxes low, improving education and protecting the environment will help Florida continue to grow. The speech marked the opening of the Legislature's annual 60-day session. He spoke in the House chamber, where lawmakers desks' were covered in flowers. Members of the Supreme Court and the state's three Cabinet members also attended the address. While touting a boost in adoption, DeSantis told lawmakers he wants them to pass a bill that would require girls under the age of 18 get their parents' permission to get an abortion. The state already requires girls' parents be notified if they have an abortion.

Burlington: State transportation officials said they are hopeful upgrades to the rail line between Rutland and Burlington can be ready sometime next year, which will make it possible to resume Amtrak rail service between the cities. Officials have been working for years to upgrade the 75 miles of rail and complete a number of other projects, such as station improvements and rail crossings. One of the major projects on the route, a new rail tunnel through downtown Middlebury, is slated for completion next year. Rutland Mayor David Allaire, who serves on the Governor's Rail Advisory Council, said he was hopeful the line will be done by the end of next year, the Rutland Herald reports. Once the improvements are completed, officials plan to have Amtrak's Ethan Allen Express, which now travels between New York City and Rutland, continue to Burlington.
The loss of that kind of voice, though, will have consequences for Beijing, Mitter said. Many countries, particularly in the West, already view China and its businesses as existential threats worthy of heavy sanctions and scrutiny — tensions that stem from fears that Chinese corporations all operate at the behest of the Communist Party. Stifling criticism from those tech leaders at home could make exerting influence abroad even harder.
Researchers at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation looked exclusively at the premium tax credits and how they'd affect different groups of people. The results were predictably complex, with lots of variation from person to person, but the general pattern was clear. Lower income and older people and those who live in high-premium communities tend to get less help, Larry Levitt, senior vice president at Kaiser, told the Huffington Post. Those who are higher income and younger and live in low-premium areas tend to do better.

The new tax credit would gradually peter out for people who make more than $75,000 a year or $150,000 for a couple, but it ignores the fact that care costs more in different geographical regions or that someone who makes $20,000 a year might be more strained in trying to buy an insurance plan with the same amount of financial help as someone who makes $74,000. The graph below shows how a flat tax credit would do little to defray the monthly cost of insurance in markets where health insurance is more expensive.

In terms of the Trump timeline, this book wraps up around the time the Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 election is being debated. Although special counsel Robert Mueller concludes the Russians did interfere in 2016 in hopes of helping Trump, his report does not find a criminal conspiracy involving the Trump campaign itself. But Mueller also provided a list of occasions when Trump's actions could be seen as interfering with the investigation, adding that he could neither indict a sitting president nor say these actions were not indictable.

MAYOR MURIEL E. BOWSER (D) took painstaking care in pointing out to the D.C. Council her grave concerns with legislation establishing an extravagant paid family leave program for people who work in the District. One of the largest tax increases in recent city history, she wrote the council, would be imposed to establish one of the largest government agencies, which would mostly benefit non-D.C. residents, while people who live in the city but work outside it or for the federal government would get nothing. Pretty convincing arguments to veto the bill — but instead Ms. Bowser took the easy way out, at least for her, and decided to let the bill become law without her signature.

The presence of undocumented workers at one of the president's signature golf clubs stands in sharp juxtaposition to his staunch rhetoric against illegal immigration. Since launching his White House bid, Trump has vowed to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out undocumented migrants, accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the country. His demand for more than $5 billion to build the wall has led to the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.
The vast majority of town halls will put up council tax and hike charges as 80% fear for their financial survival, according to a new survey. An astounding 95% of English authority bosses plan a council tax hike while 93% said they will increase charges to make ends meet, the LGiU think tank discovered. The greatest immediate pressure on budgets came in children's services (32% of councils) followed by adult social care (28%), and housing and homelessness (19%), the report found. Adult social care was the greatest long-term pressure (38%), the survey said. Lord Porter, Local Government Association Chairman, said councils had been warning a cliff-edge was looming for council at the end of the decade. Some councils continue to be pushed perilously close to the financial edge, Porter said. Many will have to make tough decisions about which services have to be scaled back or stopped altogether to plug funding gaps. Extra council tax raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face. This means many councils face having to ask residents to pay more council tax while offering fewer services as a result.

Funding to directly fight the virus is a no-brainer. Biden is seeking $400 billion for this to correct massive shortfalls left by the previous administration: money to boost production of vaccines and protective equipment, open vaccination centers, hire health workers and, once and for all, expand testing and lab facilities. There's also $170 billion to help safely reopen K-12 schools and institutions of higher learning.

Decades before the current rise in worldwide globalism, the United States Congress passed an Internal Revenue Service rule requiring all salaries above $1 million to be deemed as performance-based, forcing corporate tax deductions to kick in. Instead of slashing corporate pay, the law led to a rise in salaries. Companies, advised by high-priced consultants, began giving out stock options tied to performance-based goals that paved the way to the wide pay gap in today's global workforce, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

It came as Labour announced the party will help councils bring services back in house, set up new energy companies and develop local economies using a team of experts. Speaking in Preston Thursday, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell will unveil the new 'Community Wealth Building Unit'. Preston City Council is reported to have returned almost £200m to the local economy and supported more than 1,600 jobs by using the town's anchor institutions and council contracts to and develop cooperatives. Tory austerity has blighted our communities and forced councils to cut and privatise many public services that we all rely on, he will say. The next Labour government will end austerity and properly fund local authorities, instead of cutting back and passing the buck like the Conservatives are doing. But we cannot afford to wait until we are in power nationally. Tory peer Lord Porter said local authorities face a funding gap of more than £5bn by 2020, but children's services was the area most in need of urgent attention. He said: The LGA has warned about the urgent need to address the £2bn funding gap facing children's services. A child is being referred to council children's services every 49 seconds on a daily basis and councils started more than 500 child protection investigations every day last year - up from 200 a decade ago. This unprecedented surge in demand shows no sign of abating.

The issue is that other lawyers at Mueller's former law firm represent presidential daughter Ivanka Trump; her husband, Jared Kushner; and onetime Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Mueller never worked for those clients, but under ethics law he still could require a waiver for his new job.

Since a rule change in 2015, the Congressional Budget Office has gauged the cost of various proposals using two distinct methods: traditional scoring and dynamic scoring. The traditional scoring method looks only at the text of legislation to determine its impact on the deficit -- specifically, the money a bill proposes to spend, and the methods the bill proposes to pay for it. The dynamic scoring method, by contrast, adds to that calculation an estimate of the bill's impact on the broader economy.

And consider the experience of certain races and abortion. For example, African-American columnist Jason Riley at the Wall Street Journal has observed that more African-American babies are aborted than born alive in New York City, a tragedy that demands consideration, there and elsewhere as African-American women have the highest abortion rate of any other demographic. Looking at perceptions of black genocide through abortion, award-winning filmmaker Yoruba Richen in her PBS documentary Anti-abortion Crusaders: Inside the African-American Abortion Battle noted that for anti-abortion activists in the black community [t]he centerpiece of their message [is] 'The most dangerous place for an African-American child is in the womb.'

Washington — Congress and the White House moved quickly to craft the parameters of a massive stimulus bill to prop up the economy in response to the coronavirus crisis on Tuesday. Senate Republicans took the lead on a package that could cost upwards of $1 trillion.
As commentators have said, Republicans deserve the blame for what is happening to America's institutions. They may suffer some of the fallout, too. If Republicans stop recognizing results that they don't like, there is nothing to prevent Democrats from doing the same, tit-for-tat. Seven Republicans in the House of Representatives have warned that efforts to overturn the 2020 vote might erode the advantage that the electoral college gives to their party. GOP candidates need the college, since they have won the popular vote only once in the past 32 years.
It began giving shots to people 80 and older a week ago and to people 70 and older on Wednesday. Teachers 50 and older are also getting vaccinated. In Alabama and Georgia, state officials say they have administered more vaccines than the numbers indicate. Officials in Georgia said part of the problem is the state's 20-year-old database. It is cumbersome and difficult for providers to quickly enter information about administered doses, said Dr. Kathleen E. Toomey, the commissioner of the state Department of Public Health. Some vaccine providers, particularly hospitals, also held back some of the state's limited supply, to ensure that booster shots would be available, Gov. Brian Kemp and officials from his administration said on Tuesday. They called that misguided. If this issue continues, the state will take possession of those doses and ensure that vaccinations continue, the governor said. If it takes me firing up my pickup truck and doing it myself, so be it. At first, Georgia also found a mismatch of vaccine supply and demand. Vaccines went to rural parts of the state where 60 to 70 percent of nursing home workers did not want them, Mr. Kemp said, leaving those areas flush with doses while demand crushed supply in urban areas. The governor said vaccinating all of Georgia's nursing home residents should be completed by the end of the month. But he also acknowledged that the state still has a long way to go. Many local health departments are being inundated with calls, Mr. Kemp said.
Due out Friday, the report from the Council of Economic Advisers says Obama-era subsidies that help low- and middle-income customers pay their premiums will keep HealthCare.gov afloat even if some healthy people drop out or seek other coverage because of Trump's changes.

Research found these checks to be particularly useful to low-income households.

Social media is another place online where census scams can pop up.

Indianapolis: Crowd size limits will be relaxed starting next week following recent improvements in the statewide COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates, the governor announced Wednesday. The new rules will allow gatherings at up to 25% capacity at venues in counties with the two highest-risk levels of coronavirus spread on the state's four-level rating system, Gov. Eric Holcomb said. The new rules starting Monday will replace the current 25-person crowd limit for the highest-risk counties that's been in place since mid-November. Holcomb said he was trying to balance lives and livelihoods with the relaxed restrictions. All 92 counties remain at the highest restriction categories under two-week trends of the state Department of Health's weekly tracking map. But that number could drop in coming weeks, as Wednesday's updated map labels five of Indiana's 92 counties in the most dangerous red category, down from 34 counties last week and 73 two weeks ago. State health officials said they still aren't expanding COVID-19 vaccine availability to those younger than 70 because of limited dose availability. They expect to extend vaccine eligibility to those ages 65-69 in the coming weeks.
Sanders, who said he hadn't known about the settlement, had previously said he was unaware of the other harassment allegations.

Trump's proposal: Donald Trump argues against any cut in benefits or increase in taxes, instead relying on faster economic growth to close the Social Security funding gap. Kathleen Romig of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says faster growth would help with this and many other challenges. But she warns it's not a magic bullet. Forecasters have tried to predict Social Security's fate under many different economic scenarios, and there's no realistic growth level that would close the funding gap on its own. Faster growth cuts both ways, increasing revenue from payroll taxes but also increasing benefits, which are tied to wages.

Market outlook: Wright thinks the S&P 500 could advance 8% to 10% in 2018, as long as the Federal Reserve doesn't hike interest rates and proceed with quantitative tightening too quickly.
If the Singapore summit results in the U.S. government allowing private American investors to profit there, Behn says, the nation's largest corporations may profit even if placed at risk of suffering what his family did in Cuba. I can see American companies going there … but it's at their own risk. The larger companies, I'm sure they can take a risk, a chance and they'll profit most from it.
A pro-Trump nonprofit group called Women for America First hosted the Save America Rally on Jan. 6 at the Ellipse, an oval-shaped, federally owned patch of land near the White House. But an attachment to the National Park Service public gathering permit granted to the group lists more than half a dozen people in staff positions for the event who just weeks earlier had been paid thousands of dollars by Trump's 2020 reelection campaign. Other staff scheduled to be on site during the demonstration have close ties to the White House.
We place an import levy on cheap sugar from abroad, says Paarlberg. We use it like a quota system to keep cheap sugar from the Caribbean or Australia or South Africa out of our market. And without the global, free market competition, that raises the price inside the U.S. market ... for all sweeteners, including high fructose corn syrup, he says. Also, a significant amount of corn grown in the U.S. is used to make ethanol, so this demand also keeps the price of corn up.

But the tax credits in the Republican bills are different from the Affordable Care Act's. Instead of adjusting the value to account for premiums and income, as the law does today, the Republican plans envision tax credits whose value would vary based only on age. In the leaked bill, for instance, 25-year-olds would get $2,000 a year, while 55-year-olds would get $3,500. It wouldn't matter how much these people make, or what insurance costs in their communities.

He later trimmed the proposed increase to about 6 percent, but the County Council, which has the final say on budget matters, added new spending and ultimately approved a boost of nearly 9 percent.

Yet most of this squid is frozen and exported overseas to China to be processed and distributed to over 42 countries across the globe. It's an export market that, according to 2011 figures, is valued at $107 million. Only 1.4 percent of it, on average, makes it back to the U.S. In 2015, that figure was 0.46 percent.

-- Edmund Muskie, limping into fourth place with only 10% of the vote, was the real loser. Once regarded as the front runner, Muskie's defeats in Florida and Wisconsin have deflated his trust and confidence campaign. In an almost breathtaking descent, Muskie in a matter of weeks has become merely another contender. At least one candidate did not survive Wisconsin at all. New York Mayor John Lindsay, with a dismal 7% showing on top of his 7% in Florida, declared himself out of the race. A Muskie aide who had earlier called Lindsay the wild card in this campaign remarked last week: He turned out to be a deuce. Washington Senator Henry Jackson, who won 8% in Wisconsin, remained the darkest of horses, suffering from a massive problem of nonrecognition; on primary day last week, his workers were still distributing a leaflet headlined WHO IS SENATOR JACKSON? On the Republican ballot, Richard Nixon was opposed by Ohio's conservative Congressman John Ashbrook, who got 1% of the vote. California's liberal Republican Congressman Paul McCloskey, who had already withdrawn from the race, also got 1%. The President scored 97%.

Now, Trump is fighting the city for a $50 million tax abatement for his tower, saying this Kasbah for sheiks and movie stars will provide a public benefit because it's a mixed-use building with boutiques and office space.

Minneapolis: Some hospital systems are flouting state and federal guidance on the hierarchy for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, according to health officials. The Minnesota Department of Health has deputized large health systems to distribute the vaccine as part of a public-private partnership. Currently the state has prioritized inoculating people who provide in-person health care services or people living and working in congregate care settings. But at places like Mayo Clinic, HealthPartners and Allina Health, people who don't have patient contact or who can work from home are getting vaccinated, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The health systems have been far more lenient in vaccinating people than was intended, and that's concerning, Minnesota Department of Health infectious disease director Kris Ehresmann said. We felt like we were pretty clear in the guidance. In some cases, people like fitness instructors and construction workers are getting shots, whether they are at high risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19 or not. The situation raises questions about distribution, access and equity with a limited supply of doses.

One area of stark disagreement between congressional Republicans and President Biden is relief for state and local governments. Republicans continue to argue it would reward states and cities that mismanaged their budgets. The White House has framed this part of the package as being about help for first responders. Richmond says cities that rely on the hospitality industry have been especially hard-hit, losing significant tax revenue.

Moreover Muskie hurt his own image as the judicious, controlled candidate by sobbing in the snows of New Hampshire, ironically at the very time that Nixon in Peking was acting as the healer of international passions. This outburst was partly the result of Muskie's emotional and physical fatigue. Trying to be all things to all people, and torn by his commitments to so many primary campaigns, he lost his sense of direction, creating doubts about his ability to stand up under pressure. Fed Up. Muskie's overconfident staff had also erred badly in ignoring grass-roots organizational work. In a primary, voters have to be coaxed to go to the polls and persuaded to select a particular name out of a crowded field. In New Hampshire, the Muskie camp had to send out-of-state organizers in at the last minute to get out a favorable vote. Muskie now concedes that entering the Florida primary was a mistake; once Wallace had entered, he should have known it was hopeless and avoided that first big blow to his front-running status. He relied heavily for support in Florida upon its Democratic state legislators -- but they were tied down by their duties in Tallahassee and were of little help. Muskie came out of his Florida defeat in a new fighting mood. He tackled specific issues, such as taxes and the economy, and began berating his competitors. Yet the turnabout gave Muskie the impression of a man lashing out in desperation, seeking a new image. Muskie's dilemma is painfully difficult.

Colorado Springs: Out of dozens of requests for sentence reductions from inmates with health concerns amid the pandemic, federal judges in Colorado approved just three in the final four months of 2020. Judges have the power to apply legal criteria differently when weighing requests for so-called compassionate release, Colorado Politics reports. Federal inmates can petition courts directly if there are extraordinary and compelling reasons to leave prison, which could include elevated threat to life from COVID-19. In 24 opinions published from September through December in response to compassionate release requests, judges in the U.S. District Court in Colorado found the health condition of inmates or the level of virus transmission in prisons was not severe. The judges commonly denied requests to those who were not 65 or older, who had not served 75% of their sentence, or whose family circumstances did not merit release. In two opinions denying compassionate release, Senior Judge Marcia S. Krieger found that inmates may be safer from COVID-19 in prison than outside of it.

Corpus Christi: Demolition of the last of the city's three Columbus ship replicas began Thursday morning despite efforts to raise funds for repairs. The demolition of the La Nina comes after the Columbus Sailing Association was unable to raise enough money to support the reconstruction of a new bottom and main deck. The ship is one of three Columbus ship replicas that first sailed to Corpus Christi in 1992 as part of Spain's 500th anniversary of the Voyage to the New World celebration. La Pinta and La Santa Maria were too costly to repair. The association created a GoFundMe campaign in 2017 to raise $100,000 to fix the damaged La Nina. The fundraiser has raised $4,335.

They say permitting sports betting is good for everyone in the industry. Besides, they say, people come to Las Vegas for more than that.

At Wal-Mart stores across the country, people can cash their checks on site or spend the amount in the store against the value of the check. Home Depot stores are offering customers credit, based on the expected amounts of their rebates, until their checks come in. Some analysts say that if people immediately spend their checks, it could stimulate the economy. This is not a one shot deal. This is a down payment on future tax cuts, and I think people would be more apt to spend more of it than they would if they were just handed a one-shot rebate check, said Gerald Cohen of Merrill-Lynch. Others disagree. The problem right now is we're likely to see mounting job losses, and that's likely to erode confidence and induce consumers to save and not to spend, said Anirvan Banerji of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. If you filed your 2000 income tax return late, your check will come after the end of September. And if you moved since you sent in that return, make sure you've filed an official change of address form with the U.S. Post Office. The government says the checks will not be counted as taxable income for the 2001 federal tax returns, but residents of some states may have to pay slightly higher state taxes because of the rebates. One of the states -- Iowa -- has already moved to trim the extra taxes. The others affected are Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Oregon.

A W.H.O. team is in China to investigate the virus. It's already meeting obstacles. Experts from the World Health Organization at the airport in Wuhan, China, on Thursday. Credit... Ng Han Guan/Associated Press More than a year after a new coronavirus first emerged in China, a team of experts from the World Health Organization arrived on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan to begin hunting for its source. But in a sign of Beijing's continuing efforts to control the investigation, the team of scientists and W.H.O. employees almost immediately ran into obstacles. Two scientists were unable to enter China at the last minute and remained in Singapore because they had tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, the W.H.O. said on Twitter. The Chinese authorities required the remaining 13 experts to undergo two weeks of quarantine in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in late 2019. The investigation, which aims to gain an understanding into how the virus jumped to humans from animals, is a critical step so that another pandemic can be avoided. But getting answers is likely to be difficult. Here's what to know about the investigation. China set up hurdles and pushed for control. Apparently worried about drawing renewed attention to the country's early mistakes in handling the pandemic, Chinese officials have used a variety of tactics over the past year to hinder the W.H.O. investigation. After resisting demands from other countries that it allow independent investigators onto its soil to study the origin of the pathogen, China let two W.H.O.

And so for public defenders - and it's worth noting that every official - every legal official in the misdemeanor system is faced with this crushing case load. Public defenders, prosecutors and judges are all under pressure to move cases along.

BRODY: Persecuted Christians, we've talked about this, the refugees overseas. The refugee program, or the refugee changes you're looking to make. As it relates to persecuted Christians, do you see them as kind of a priority here? TRUMP: Yes. BRODY: You do? TRUMP: They've been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.

The lack of resources means also that in many ways, the law itself is put aside. Misdemeanor cases can be legally very complicated. They may involve unconstitutional searches and seizures. They may involve unconstitutional statutes. They may involve complicated factual issues. But without the time and resources to engage those questions, there's very little litigation. Motions are not filed. Issues are not aired both because public defenders lack the resources but also because there's enormous pressure on them from prosecutors and judges not to litigate.

The combined effect of decreased demand and disrupted supply can lead to a serious recession. While we can hope the effects of the epidemic will be short-lived and the economy will quickly bounce back, we cannot take this for granted. Therefore, policymakers must move quickly to prepare effective economic countermeasures.
At the same time, Wall Street is on high alert for signs of a recession. A downturn would cause trouble for some companies that reside in the junk bond market.
Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of LGiU, said: Councils are on the edge. They are for the most part holding services together (though a significant minority are not). But they can only do this this by raising council tax, increasing charging and draining their reserves. The system is unsustainable and needs far more fundamental reform than is presently on offer. It's simply not acceptable that we don't know how local government will work post 2020. Councils are calling for assurances around funding for the next three years and for a fundamental redesign of the finance system. At present government is offering neither. That has to change. Andrew Gwynne, Labour's Shadow Communities Secretary, added: These findings show that after almost eight years of cuts, councils are facing unprecedented pressures to balance their books. When faced with choices; of where to cut, and where to invest - the government has failed to show that they understood the real life, human challenges facing this country. There's now a widespread consensus, across the political divide, that how we fund local public services desperately needs reform, but the Government does not appear to be listening to the sector.

— For 38 million low-income Americans, the shutdown could mean severe food stamp reductions if it stretches on. The SNAP program is rare among federal initiatives because it requires annual funding from Congress, even though its existence is automatically renewed, our Post colleagues Damian Paletta and Erica Werner report. Congress has not allocated funding for SNAP beyond January, and the program's emergency reserves would not cover even two-thirds of February's payments, according to past disbursements. A disruption of the program impacts not only the families who receive food stamps but the retailers where that money is spent, our colleagues add. An Agriculture Department spokesman said the administration is looking at options amid the halt.

The formula for calculating these tax credits is important. It varies based on income, so that you'll get a bigger tax credit if you make less money. The value also varies depending on how much insurance costs in your area ― in particular, the price of the second-cheapest silver plan, which the law treats as a benchmark. (Silver plans, which are less generous than typical employer plans, cover roughly 70 percent of the typical person's medical expenses.)

President Donald Trump's legal team presents the second day of its defense on Monday in the Senate impeachment trial after the Democratic House managers laid out their case last week charging the president with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. While the Democrats used almost all of the 24 hours allotted to them, Trump's lawyers went for short and sweet when they kicked off their defense Saturday taking only two hours to outline their case for exonerating the president. Trump's lawyers attacked House Democrats' credibility and accused them of omitting exculpatory evidence. They portrayed Trump as innocent of all charges and warned the senator-jurors against removing him from office – saying that would be an abuse of power and imploring them to let American voters determine Trump's fate in November.
Trump's 2017 memorandum had revived the policy under President George W. Bush, which prohibited the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from giving money to foreign NGOs that performed or promoted abortion, with exceptions for rape, incest, or when needed to save a life.

All calmness on the outside -- serene -- but when crisis strikes, it's into the phone booth. He has other useful traits as well. Accused at a University of Wisconsin rally of being a warmonger for voting for passage of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, McGovern did not turn peevish as Muskie has done in the face of similar baiting. Instead, McGovern asked that those who believed the charge raise their hands; when less than six hands shot up, McGovern moved on to other matters. He has successfully overcome his image as a one-issue peace candidate by promoting his stands on income distribution, tax, reform and decreased defense spending. McGovern projects simplicity, honesty and candor. He remains confident despite the many Democratic leaders who still dismiss his candidacy. Meanwhile, stone by stone, George moves on. What Happened to Muskie? In just one month, Maine's Ed Muskie slipped from the position of the serene front runner to that of an embattled man on the verge of being knocked completely out of the race for his party's nomination for President. Before the plunge, much of the press (including TIME) and many politicians saw him as almost a certain first-ballot winner at the Democratic Convention in July. Now he could easily turn out to be what President Nixon derisively termed him after the 1970 Congressional elections: the George Romney of the Democratic Party. What went wrong? No single reason, or incident, can be cited to explain Muskie's decline.
Trump hinted that he would be prioritizing Christians before the order was released on Friday. Here's the transcript of Trump's exchange with the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody:

But both groups ultimately want the same thing: the return of the American Dream and the restoration of true capitalism, rather than the elitism that has become entrenched in the US. If Biden really wants to heal and unify America, he must restore it to what it used to be: A nation of innovators, who are all given a fair shot. An economy built not on trickle-down but bubble-up.
Mercedes-Benz has been building the G550 for 36 years, and chances are the vehicle will celebrate its 40th year anniversary before the automaker decides to move on. For 2016, the SUV got a peppier and more fuel efficient engine. Despite the improvement, it is among the least fuel efficient vehicles on the market, getting an average 13.4 mpg. The G550 weighs 5,724 pounds, and the 4-liter, 416-horsepower engine can push that weight from 0 to 62 mph in 5.9 seconds.
Precisely how many taxpayer dollars wind up in Trump's pocket from these stays cannot be determined. The White House, despite numerous queries from HuffPost over a period of months, refuses to disclose how many executive branch employees stay with Trump when he visits his own properties and how much it is costing taxpayers. And how much of that revenue winds up as profit flowing to Trump also is not known because Trump reneged on a campaign promise ― and decades of precedent ― by refusing to disclose his tax returns.
IRS' overall 2020 performance was significantly impacted by its reliance on manual processes such as for paper returns, and its limited ability to process returns remotely while processing centers were closed, the GAO report said. As a result, as of December 2020, IRS had a significant backlog of unprocessed returns and taxpayer correspondence.

Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team, he added. His team is now the USA.
Even so, the idea of a lasting post-Trump coalition is probably too optimistic. There will be no magical consensus on abortion or guns or immigration on Nov. 4. But we can save the constitutional mechanisms that allow us to keep fighting over such things while preserving our commitment to an open democracy. Given how low we have fallen under Trump, that would itself be an achievement.

But there will be plenty of opportunities a lot of other places for people like us to, in a sense, run their book for them, only because of what we have done, only because the way that we do business, only because of what we do and how we handle it, he says. We will get opportunities. I think the opportunity will outweigh drastically the little part that we lose people coming to the South Point.
There's just no way, Greff said. It is all based on speculation, conjecture and possibilities.
The report looks at three big changes under Mr. Trump that affect former President Barack Obama's health care law. They are congressional repeal of the law's unpopular fines on people who go uninsured, association health plans for small businesses that can be marketed across state lines, and low-cost short-term health insurance that doesn't have to cover pre-existing conditions or basic benefits like prescription drugs.
Leggett, whose third and final term ends in 2018, said last year's big increase should rule out any hikes over the next two years.
ELVING: We are not likely to see the 25th Amendment, Scott. It's never been used except for a matter of hours for medical situations. And resignation would not seem to be in President Trump's nature. So unless Vice President Pence decides to push for it, there does not seem to be enough motivation within the Cabinet to remove him using the 25th Amendment.

Albany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he was erasing the handful of remaining orange zones in the state where tougher pandemic restrictions had been in place because of the fast spread of COVID-19. The Democrat cited a post-holiday dip in the number of infections, after a period in which rates had surged to more than 114,000 new cases in one week. Eliminating the zones will allow restaurants to again offer indoor dining, albeit at half-capacity. Indoor dining is still banned in all of New York City, but Cuomo promised to come up with a plan by Friday to address how restaurants might reopen that service, too. His administration is considering whether to again allow indoor dining in the city at 25% capacity. The orange zones had been in central and western New York, Staten Island and Westchester County. Cuomo said he's launching several yellow zones, which require schools to launch testing programs, in certain New York City neighborhoods and a part of Orange County where hospitalizations and infections are increasing. During the past seven days, the state has averaged about 12,800 new infections per day, a rate it last recorded in late December.

Trenton: State lawmakers on Monday passed legislation to prohibit flavored vaping products, sending the measure to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy's desk. The Democrat-led Senate passed the bill 22-15, with the Democratic-controlled Assembly voting 53-11 with eight lawmakers not voting on the measure that bans e-cigarettes flavors, including any fruit or candy among others. Lawmakers say the flavors are meant to hook young people, who are using the products in increasing numbers. Opponents of the legislation, who crowded part of the Statehouse complex Monday, say officials should better enforce the smoking age instead of barring of-age adults from buying products they enjoy using. The smoking age in New Jersey is 21. Murphy has been supportive of the idea of a flavor ban, but his office didn't respond when asked how he'll handle the legislation.
Sanders got to take the first swing at Bloomberg: He went after Bloomberg's record on police policy when he was New York mayor.

The United States got its first hint of the novel virus — a case of an unusual pneumonia in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 30, 2019 — from monitoring news reports and through a notification from Taiwan. While American officials tried various tacks to get them to cooperate — including praising China in public as they pressed them very hard and very firmly in private, they were unsuccessful, he said. Our teams were also pressing for the Chinese government to send us viral isolates from patients there. And China has still, one year later, failed to provide the first-generation viral isolates, Mr. Azar said, describing events in late January. It was not until Feb. 16, he said, that an international team including American experts was allowed into China to investigate. By this time, he said, Chinese intransigence meant that the window of opportunity had passed. Outbreaks had been seeded around the world. On Thursday, a team of experts from the World Health Organization finally arrived in the central city of Wuhan to begin hunting for the source of the coronavirus. But in a sign of Beijing's continuing efforts to control the investigation, the team of scientists and W.H.O. employees almost immediately ran into obstacles. Two scientists were unable to enter China at the last minute and remained in Singapore because they tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, the W.H.O. said. The Chinese authorities required the remaining 13 experts to undergo two weeks of quarantine in Wuhan.

We do not want to have a Bolivarian type of Latin America, as was the case in Brazil under previous administrations, he said. I believe that this new wave of interacting with South American countries has had a contagion effect – more center, center-right leaders have been successfully elected in these neighboring countries. I believe this is a clear cut response indicating that the left wing will not prevail in that region, which is a very good development in my view, not only for Latin America but for the rest of the world, he continued. Left-wing regimes continue to prevail in neighboring Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba, all of which Bolsonaro has pledged to push back against by forming a global coalition against communism.

And, he said, the premium hikes still wouldn't cover the cost of people who are really waiting until they are sick to sign up — on average, he said those members cost about twice as much as a normal member, not 30 percent more.
According to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for a new car in America is about $33,543. But there are also six other factors that Kelly Blue Book evaluates to determine the true cost of owning and operating a vehicle in its first three years. Those costs include: sales tax, title fees, registration fees, average annual insurance premiums, annual gas expenses and average maintenance and repair costs. For a three-year period, the average additional cost per year to owning a car in the U.S. can vary by as much as about $3,742 a year.
We don't think it's going to be an acute problem unless people lose faith in the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, Stritch says. It's likely to just eat away at potential GDP growth over time.
That's all they've ever seen someone like them do, Atwater said. The visibility to what their opportunities can be is just nonexistent.
Multiple studies have found that safety-net programs for children have big long-term consequences. Children who receive adequate nutrition and health care grow up to become healthier, more productive adults. And in addition to the humanitarian side of these benefits, there's a monetary payoff: Healthier adults are less likely to need public aid and are likely to pay more in taxes.
Gangi, also in Sicily, started selling vacant homes for €1 in 2015, and Ollolai, in Sardinia, followed suit. At the heart of those efforts are attempts to revive their economies and preserve their cultures as young residents flocked to big cities and older inhabitants passed away, leaving a stock of abandoned homes in their wake.
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Robert Mueller has delivered his report, but the political fight over it is just beginning.
There might be an assumption, for example, that people would avoid jail at any cost. And yet, for many of my clients, being on probation for a year or two or three years with the burdens and intrusions of probation - having to make appointments and meet with their probation officers monthly, having to be drug tested routinely, giving up their privacy, having the restrictions on their freedom - for many of them, they decided that, for them, going to jail made more sense. Even though they knew that jail was risky, that it was dangerous, that it was painful, the intrusion into their lives and the burdens on their lives of supervision and probation often seemed, in the long run, to be even more disruptive.

Other pieces of the economy seem more likely to cause a slow drag than to suddenly crater and take the rest of the country with them. Tariffs, for example, have only started to increase prices in a few industries, which may eventually lead to lower orders.
When the vote was slated for December, she postponed it, to the anger of MPs from all parties who suspected she was trying to run down the clock and make her deal a fait accompli by not allowing enough parliamentary time for a debate on any alternative. Brexit is happening on March 29, in 79 days – but in parliamentary terms, the timeframe is much tighter because of weekends and breaks, and there are only around 40 days left for debate.
Trump's memo directed the State Department to extend this to all federal departments and agencies. According to a 2020 State Department report, only eight out of 1,340 prime awardees who received funding between May 2017 and September 2018 declined to adhere to the expanded policy.

A big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to create more jobs at higher pay. And that means for us, creating an infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and complement our public investments. $25 billion in government seed funding could unlock more than $250 billion and really get our country moving on our infrastructure plans. — Hillary Clinton

In Connecticut, the gun industry advocacy group National Shooting Sports Foundation's Mark Oliva, a public affairs manager, said he was encouraged by the court's decision to take up the case. It was its first major Second Amendment case since the court upheld the right to possess firearms, striking down a strict Washington, D.C., gun law in 2008, Oliva said.
One possibility is that people will be incentivized to avoid any gaps in coverage, to avoid that 30 percent premium surcharge. But here's another scenario: A young, healthy person lacks coverage. She goes to sign up, but she faces a penalty that would make her plan more expensive. Why not just wait until she really needs insurance, since she'll be paying the penalty either way? In contrast, sick people who need insurance are more likely to pay the penalty.

In the mid-1980s, bipartisan alarm grew over soaring federal budget deficits under President Ronald Reagan. Biden, along with two Republican senators and another Democrat (Max Baucus of Montana), proposed a simple solution — a one-year freeze on all spending, including defense spending and social programs such as Social Security.
People got mad at me, they said, 'Hannity, you were talking about, well, rich people won't buy boats.' No, rich people won't go to restaurants, because they won't have the money, he claimed without evidence. Rich people won't invest in companies, that means they're not going to hire people.
Luscombe said ID theft victims can expect that they will be asked for some documentation, such as verifying that you are still employed with your employer.
Without the aggressiveness of Bobby Kennedy or the aloofness of Eugene McCarthy, McGovern has forged a coalition of followers from both camps. On one flank are such Kennedy men as Advisers John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., former Kennedy Press Secretaries Pierre Salinger and Frank Mankiewicz, Writers Richard Goodwin and Adam Walinsky. (His principal financial contributors are Max Palevsky, chairman of the Xerox Executive Committee, and Henry Kimelman, board chairman of West Indies Corp.) On the other are legions of young staffers and student volunteers bristling with go-for-George enthusiasm. The spectacle of the old Kennedy pros followed by McGovern's young crusaders, says Eugene McCarthy, is like German officers leading Irish troops. Index Cards. But they march well together. Typical of McGovern's young minions is Gene Pokorny, 26, a scholarly Nebraskan who, says Campaign Manager Gary Hart, has the mind of a revolutionist in the body of Henry Aldrich. Dispatched to Wisconsin a year ago on a salary of $200 a month, he tirelessly crisscrossed the state with clipboard and index cards in hand, organizing and opening 39 McGovern headquarters. When it was discovered that voting day fell during campus spring vacations, Pokorny ran forms in students newspapers which could be exchanged for absentee ballots. By election day an estimated 70% of the students cast their votes for McGovern and the number of workers had grown from 80 to 10,000. McGovern, say staffers, is no softie, despite his easygoing ways. He's a classic Clark Kent, says Aide Ted Van Dyk.
If it says your payment was sent to an account you do not recognize, it's not necessarily an indication of fraud, the I.R.S. said. It might just mean you were linked to a temporary account, and you should continue to watch your bank account for a deposit. More than 100 million stimulus payments have already been deposited directly into recipients' accounts, the I.R.S. said. About 8 million payments will arrive in the mail on prepaid debit cards. By law, the I.R.S. said, it must issue the stimulus payments by Jan. 15. After that, those who are entitled to a payment but haven't received one must instead claim a credit on their 2020 returns. Filers can fill the so-called Recovery Rebate Credit on line 30 of the 2020 Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
You should have received most of your tax paperwork by Jan. 31.
For 2017, you can contribute $3,400 to an HSA if you have a high-deductible individual health insurance plan or $6,750 if you have a family plan. And individuals 55 or older can contribute an extra $1,000. Contributions are deductible from taxable income, the money grows tax-deferred, and the distributions are tax-free -- as long as they are used for qualified healthcare expenses. Individuals can also make a one-time transfer from an IRA to fund an HSA.
A 401(k) is a tax-deferred retirement plan that allows you to contribute a portion of your salary before taxes. The money is then invested according to your selections and remains tax deferred. The price is that you cannot withdraw any of the money until the year you turn 59 and a half, without paying a penalty. Then, when you are retired and begin withdrawing the money, it will be taxable income, presumably at a lower rate.
Biden himself shows no sign of changing course. Every signal from the president and his top economists has been consistent and clear since his election victory in November: He will not roll the dice on the country or his presidency with a skimpy bill. On Friday, after the Senate approved an early version of his proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, the president told a meeting of House Democrats: We can't do too much here. We can do too little. We can do too little and sputter.
This wasn't the first time Republican senators have paid the price for a cynical bargain. Many of them are institutionalists who at first denounced Trump during the 2016 primary race, but endorsed him after he won the nomination and swore he'd grow into the presidency. Asked to justify his fealty, McConnell has pointed to the federal judges and three Supreme Court justices Republicans seated under Trump, as well as tax cuts. But Senate Republicans continued to defend Trump even as he repeatedly sabotaged his own party. There was the pointless 2018-2019 shutdown over Trump's border wall (the longest shutdown in history) and the president's recent threat to veto the coronavirus spending bill, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, just before the Georgia runoff elections that would decide which party controlled the Senate. There was the Ukraine scandal, which forced the Senate to spend time debating Trump's use of foreign policy for personal gain, even if the GOP did use its majority to acquit him at his impeachment trial. And there was Trump's tight embrace of Saudi Arabia after its leader had Jamal Khashoggi killed, a policy that so outraged Republican senators that they rebuked him for it.
If you are going to dabble in high-risk trading, Castro said you should have a few other things in order first.
In just one day, the fate of the Senate -- and the nation -- will be decided by Georgia voters. While the ballots and votes cast will determine if Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue deserve to be re-elected -- and it's undeniably clear that they do -- the Georgia runoff elections have far greater implications.

Shrinking savings. Most HSAs are churn accounts, and saving might actually be going down instead of up. Devenir's latest report found participants holding over less in 2016, just $5.7 billion, compared with $5.9 billion in 2015 and $6.2 billion in 2014.

SpaceX on Monday will take another crack at launching a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 60 Starlink satellites from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station after bad weather scrubbed a planned launch Friday. However, the weather forecast continues to be a concern for the Monday mission with 9:49 a.m. ET liftoff. This mission will mark the fourth full flight of a Falcon 9 with 60 Starlink satellites, bringing SpaceX's constellation to 240 satellites in low-Earth orbit. The initiative is designed to transmit broadband internet connectivity, including some underserved regions. SpaceX will attempt to land the Falcon 9 booster on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean following the launch.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. whites, Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.

Social Security recipients who are not typically required to file a tax return need to take no action, and will receive their payment directly to their bank account, said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.
No objective person who reads my books and those written by authors like Larry Swedroe, John Bogle, Burton Malkiel, William Bernstein and many others would continue to be seduced by the marketing hype of Wall Street. Movies like The Big Short do a great job of exposing the underlying greed that pervades the industry. But don't be fooled. While the financial crisis dealt a devastating blow to the retirement dreams of many, it pales in comparison to the daily plundering of assets that occurs when investors listen to the recommendations of those who claim an ability to beat the market.
The AP's review found at least three of the Trump campaign aides named on the permit rushed to obscure their connections to the demonstration. They deactivated or locked down their social media profiles, removed tweets that referenced the rally and blocked a reporter who asked questions.
As the tax season moves forward, consumers also need to be warned about other scams, too.
Unfortunately, most tax reform talk these days focuses on the supposed need to lower America's official corporate tax rate of 35 per cent. But as the example of Microsoft proves, that rate is easily sidestepped. Numerous studies have found that, after all their deductions, credits and other breaks, corporations actually pay only about half the official rate. And all those profits stashed offshore have only been taxed at 6 per cent, because they are mostly in tax havens. A huge loophole lets U.S. corporations avoid income taxes on those profits until they are brought home--which may never happen.

If you're looking for a quick, low-cost way to pay off your student loans, you can find a few options. But while you may be able to consolidate or refinance (even private loans), you won't find many ways to significantly pay off those loans without forking over more money every month.
It's possibly the most exhausted easy money-saving tip of all time: Cut back on those coffeeshop lattes, and you'll save enough to buy a home! Sounds straightforward enough, but also too good to be true. Besides, are we really spending that much on coffee? According to a new study, we apparently are. SurveyMonkey says that 44 percent of millennial women put less money into their retirement accounts this year than into their coffee funds. (Um, guilty.)

When we talk about ending sexism, and ending all forms of discrimination, those beliefs cannot just be words, Sanders said. They must be based in day-to-day reality and the work that we do. And that was clearly not the case in the 2016 campaign. The allegations that I have heard speak to unacceptable behavior that must not be tolerated in any campaign or in any workplace.
Women age 63 on average end up with only two-thirds of the retirement savings and benefits that men do.

Thanks to five men in the state Senate, women in Tennessee are likely going to have to keep paying higher taxes when they go to the store to buy tampons than they pay on their other groceries.
Some lawmakers have cited research that shows higher-income families are rebounding well from the pandemic's economic impact, as a rationale for lowering those income thresholds. Given that debate, many lawmakers are unlikely to support recurring stimulus payments.
Single people could receive as much as $1,400 each, while married couples filing jointly could receive $2,800. Only individuals earning up to $75,000 would get the full payments, as would married couples with incomes up to $150,000. For incomes above those thresholds, payment amounts would decline, phasing out completely for single individuals earning above $100,000 and married couples with a combined income of more than $200,000.
DeVos was also sued by former Corinthian Colleges students, angry that their debts had not been fully forgiven. DeVos refused to change course and was held in contempt by a federal judge for violating an order to stop collecting loan payments.
The Office of Government Ethics has rejected a White House attempt to block the agency's compilation of federal ethics rules waivers granted to officials hired into the Trump administration from corporations and lobbying firms.
Even when researchers carefully match students at different schools based on demographics, it's possible that families that are more organized and more invested in education are also more likely to seek out charters and voucher programs. Or, selection bias can also work the other way: The students who struggle in traditional public schools may be more likely to seek alternatives.

It is unclear why Mourdoukoutas' article and the resulting backlash prompted Forbes to act so quickly. In the age of Internet journalism, bad opinions are often met with swift and persuasive rebuttals. Disagreements are best had when each party has an opportunity to express their opinion. Moreover, it's important that no one fears that the mere expression of their opinion will result in brigading and censoring of their words.

In 1984, Joe Biden first pushed to freeze funding for Social Security — which would end up cutting Social Security benefits.
DeVos hired for her team a group of former for-profit college executives, and they worked to dismantle all the protections, block debt relief for ripped-off students, and ensure that federal dollars kept flowing to the worst colleges, said David Halperin, an attorney who has been critical of the for-profit industry.

Howard Dean just cannot compete with George Bush on foreign policy, an announcer intones over a magazine cover featuring bin Laden's visage. It's time for Democrats to think about that, and think about it now.
A phone call was scheduled with Rebekah, Bannon and CA's attorney. I understand she's a nice lady, Wilson says politely of Rebekah. According to multiple people on the call, she accused Wilson of undermining CA. Bannon, meanwhile, unleashed a torrent of profanities at the Cruz team. Someone on the call gave me a censored version of his outburst: The only reason this campaign is where it is right now is because of our people and I. My recommendation to the Mercers is just to pull them out of there and we'll have them on another campaign by Monday. Bannon's language was so foul it was difficult to listen to, says one person on the call who had never met him before. Another of the political pros, who knew Bannon well, wasn't shocked. That's Steve doing business, he says. The Cruz team was taken aback by Rebekah's reaction. Some even wondered if she'd been given all the facts. One person who was close to the campaign says, She is somewhere between the daughter of a brilliant hedge fund manager and mathematician and somebody who runs a bakery in New York. She clearly has a skill set, but the skill set we're discussing here regarding the understanding of the value of data and analytics doesn't fall into that area. She is operating under the information she's been given.
Just this week, for example, several conservative Republicans in Congress said they would vote against any bill with refundable credits, because they would consider giving money to people with no income tax liability akin to creating a new entitlement. Of course, a bill with no refundable credits would, by definition, leave out a huge chunk of the population now getting coverage through Obamacare.

Ford Motor Co. F, +1.06% said Tuesday it expects a record 2015 pre-tax profit, around the upper range of the car maker's guidance of $10 billion to $11 billion. The results for 2016 are expected to be equal to or higher than 2015, the car maker said. The company also declared a supplemental dividend of 25 cents a share, which would be on top of first-quarter dividend of 15 cents a share. Ford said it plans another active product year with 12 global car product launches, including a new Ford Focus electric, with a projected 100-mile range. Shares of Ford fell 1.6% in late trading Tuesday after ending the regular trading day up 0.6%.
Insurers currently charge more to people based on their age, but current rules limit the spread to three times the costs of the youngest group of insured people. The bill would allow them to charge five times as much to older people. It also does away with a requirement that plans offer products with a specific value — a provision that created bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans that were progressively more expensive.
I've always been wary of arguments about art's necessity. But a soul-sick nation is not likely to recover if it loses fundamental parts of its humanity. Without actors and dancers and musicians and artists, a society will indeed have lost something necessary — for these citizens, these workers, are the technicians of a social catharsis that cannot come soon enough. A respiratory virus and an insurrection have, in their own ways, taken the country's breath away. Artists, if they are still with us in the years ahead, can teach us to exhale.
Once homeowners factor in all of these costs, the rental option often turns from a roughly break-even scenario to one that generates a deficit each month. This puts additional pressure on the capital appreciation required to make the rental option a sound choice. In other words, the capital appreciation has to more than compensate for the monthly deficit. In a flat or down market, the rental option can be financially devastating.
So, in 2008, everybody thought that the World Bank's green bonds would have a lower rate of interest than its traditional bonds. The bank would then pass the lower payments on to its developing country borrowers, who, in turn, would be more likely to do more environmentally beneficial projects. Socially Responsible Investors would be willing to accept a lower rate of interest in return for the satisfaction of knowing that their money was creating environmental benefits. What a neat system!

Only essential services will be operational. These include water, electricity, health services, fire services, groceries and municipal services.
Jurisdictions also impose fees in addition to fines - user fees that fund the criminal system itself. And so there are all kinds of ways that an encounter with the misdemeanor system generates criminal debt. Individuals who come into the system incur all kinds of debt - fines and fees and bail and other kinds of monetary penalties. And for the low-income individuals who typically, you know, represent the average person who encounters the misdemeanor system, that debt can be crushing.

Salem: The City Council has voted unanimously to draft an emergency declaration legally allowing car camping in certain areas. Many members of the public who spoke at the council meeting Monday supported the push for car camping but stressed more needed to be done to help the homeless population. Most demanded immediate action. Mayor Chuck Bennett said he was deeply concerned about the homeless crisis, but it has been 30 years in the making, and officials are working to fight that crisis in a matter of weeks. He said the actions made during Monday's session will help meet the needs of the community. A study researching the option found the city has neither the funds nor the resources to manage a city-sponsored program. A privately sponsored program – where site owners provide supervision, trash receptacles and access to bathrooms – was suggested as an alternative.

Americans are told to fill 50 percent of our plates with fruits and vegetables. But here's the contradiction, as the researchers see it: U.S. agriculture policies focus on financing the production of corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, sorghum, dairy and livestock, the researchers write. About $170 billion was spent between 1995 and 2010 on these seven commodities and programs, according to the researchers.
ELVING: Yes, he has already issued a slew of pardons. Many consider some of those to be unsavory, including for his former associates who had pled guilty to lying to the FBI and were about to be sentenced to prison. He has pardoned individuals who killed civilians in Iraq while on contract with the U.S. military. And there is a general expectation he will pardon members of his family and quite possibly himself while he still can, although the actual legal effect of a self-pardon has never been tried and remains very much a matter of debate.

But as the field remains fractured ― not a single candidate dropped out after Monday night's caucuses in Iowa ― and the entrance of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg starting on Super Tuesday is set to throw the race into further chaos, some Warren allies have begun suggesting the candidate who consistently emphasizes her ability to unify the party could do just that from a contested Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee in July.
The governor told residents to brace for social-distancing measures and warned of significant disruption to your daily lives for a period of time. He urged local governments to consider canceling large events, ordered nursing homes to bar nonessential visits, curtailed walk-in visits to the Motor Vehicle Administration and instructed local schools and preschools to be prepared with contingency plans for potential long-term closures.
When politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. (From left to right) Rebekah Mercer, Robert Mercer, Stephen Bannon When politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. Last December, about a month before Donald Trump's inauguration, Rebekah Mercer arrived at Stephen Bannon's office in Trump Tower, wearing a cape over a fur-trimmed dress and her distinctive diamond-studded glasses. Tall and imposing, Rebekah, known to close friends as Bekah, is the 43-year-old daughter of the reclusive billionaire Robert Mercer. If Trump was an unexpected victor, the Mercers were unexpected kingmakers. More established names in Republican politics, such as the Kochs and Paul Singer, had sat out the general election. But the Mercers had committed millions of dollars to a campaign that often seemed beyond salvaging. That support partly explains how Rebekah secured a spot on the executive committee of the Trump transition team. She was the only megadonor to frequent Bannon's sanctum, a characteristically bare-bones space containing little more than a whiteboard, a refrigerator and a conference table. Unlike the other offices, it also had a curtain so no one could see what was happening inside.

If this happens, it will be a hopeful sign (along with the centrist Democratic victories in 2018) of an emerging truce among various partisans of both the right and left.

Then there is the assistance on cost-sharing. It is available only to consumers who buy silver policies and whose incomes are below 250 percent of the poverty line ― about $30,000 for an an individual and $61,000 for a family of four this year. It gets very little attention because even most of the people who get the money don't realize it. (The exchanges factor in the assistance automatically, so that policies simply appear to have lower deductibles and co-payments.) But for the millions who get it, it's the difference between insurance that works and insurance that doesn't.
And, if that's not bad enough, here's another one.
As most people know, an excellent credit report and a high credit score will afford you ample choices when you're shopping for a home loan at an attractive interest rate. But they can do so much more, too. Your credit report could also help you nab the job of your dreams, or get auto or home insurance at a lower premium than the average American. A pristine credit report could also mean little or no deposit when opening an account with a utility company.

So crazy, in fact, that despite not being an ultra-partisan fanatic, I am forced to the conclusion that either the GOP leadership is even stupider than ordinary political cynicism would assume, or the plan is simply not meant in earnest. (Is it a trap for Trump, to discredit him if he's foolish enough to buy into it? Dunno. A trap for the idea of tax-based trade reform? Ditto. But either of these hypotheses would make more sense than the idea that they actually mean it.)

If you don't hold the line, I will: That's what the veto is for. Now that's my plan to cut the deficit. Mr. Reagan is keeping his plan secret until after the election. That's not leadership; that's salesmanship. And I think the American people know the difference. I challenge tonight, I challenge Mr. Reagan to put his plan on the table next to mine - and then let's debate it on national television before the American people. Americans want the truth about the future - not after the election. When the American economy leads the world, the jobs are here, the prosperity is here for our children. But that's not what's happening today. This is the worst trade year in American history. Three million of our best jobs have gone overseas. Mr. Reagan has done nothing about it. They have no plan to get our competitive edge back. But we do. We will cut the deficits, reduce interest rates, make our exports affordable, and make America number one again in the world economy. We will launch a renaissance in education, in science, and learning. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. And this must be the best-educated, best-trained generation in American history.

Boston: A push to expand school breakfast programs is making its way through the Legislature. The state Senate last week unanimously approved legislation aimed at increasing participation rates in the programs. The bill would require public schools with 60% or more of students currently eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program to offer breakfast after the school bell rings. Massachusetts currently requires all high-poverty schools to provide breakfast to every eligible student. Because breakfast is typically offered before the bell, participation levels are less than 40%, compared to up to 90% participation for free and reduced lunch. Supporters of the bill say moving breakfast to after the bell will boost participation and ensure all students have the nutrition they need.

Whatever one may make of the proposal, it was not aimed at Social Security specifically but was part of an effort to reduce the budget deficit. The Washington Post reported the dramatic simplicity of the plan was its fatal flaw as conservatives rebelled at the deep cuts it would have made in Reagan's military buildup, liberals balked at the constraints it would have put on major domestic benefit programs such as Social Security and many moderates shuddered at both results.

We think over half of the undocumented are uninsured, said Ken Janda, an adjunct professor of healthcare management at Rice University. That's a challenge because if they don't have the cash to pay, those costs are shared by the rest of the community.

For close watchers of the debate, Buttigieg is repeating an attack that Sanders, and Warren, have confronted before. As proposed, Sanders' Medicare for All plan, which would move all Americans to a single government-run health insurance program, is more generous than most private-sector plans. He has not identified a payment plan but instead cites a list of possible taxes he supports. And for unions with even stronger health care plans, Sanders has since said he would include a provision mandating companies with union-negotiated health plans to enter contract negotiations under the National Labor Relations Board.

Bismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum on Wednesday lowered the statewide risk level for the coronavirus, increasing the recommended occupancy limit for bars, restaurants and other food service establishments. Burgum noted that active cases dropped by 1,016 Wednesday from more than 10,000 in mid-November and that the state's 14-day positivity rate has decreased to about 3%, the lowest since Aug. 22. The governor adjusted the risk level from moderate to low effective Jan. 29. We're grateful to all North Dakotans, including our medical, education and business communities, for their actions that have contributed to these positive results, Burgum said in a statement. We continue to use a data-driven approach to navigate this pandemic, and all data indicates North Dakota is heading in the right direction. A low risk level increased occupancy limits at bars and restaurants from 65% of the establishment's licensed capacity up to 200 patrons and to 80% of licensed capacity up to 300 patrons, with social distancing. Face covering are strongly recommended or required.

Oklahoma City: A state panel that includes appointees of Gov. Kevin Stitt has approved more taxpayer subsidies for the Jenks-based company the governor founded and ran until after his election in 2018. The three-member Quality Jobs Program Incentive Approval Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to approve an application from Gateway First Bank. The contract was first reported by the online publication The Frontier. Two of the members who approved the application, Department of Commerce Director Brent Kisling and Oklahoma Tax Commission Chairman Charles Prater, were appointed by Stitt. Under the program, companies that create up to $2.5 million in new annual payrolls within three years can qualify for quarterly cash payments of up to 5% of new payroll costs. The company already has received more than $876,000 in taxpayer subsidies under an existing contract under the program, state records show.

There's such a wealth of inappropriate conduct coming from the Trump administration that I think that they're actually going to have to prioritize what they'll look at, Holder said. If you looked at all the negative things, all the inappropriate things, you would spend an inordinate amount of time focusing on the inappropriate conduct by Cabinet members, White House officials, the president himself, and that could inhibit the ability of the new administration to focus on what the American people want them to focus on. But, Holder added, You can't simply let it go. People need to be held accountable.

There's not that many unions, generally speaking, but American workers in a tight labor market have bargaining power, even as just individuals. But if the labor market is expanded to include in effect the entire world, then there can never be a tight labor market. It becomes effectively impossible. That puts employers in the driver's seat and takes away any [marketplace] bargaining power that American workers would have, even those who aren't in unions or have any kind of formal organization.

The most important thing to understand is that you only pay taxes on investments when you realize their gains. So if you bought a stock in 2020 and its value went up, you won't pay taxes on those gains until you sell. And if it sank in value, the same rules of realizing apply. Investment losses hurt, but you can use them to offset your gains, up to a limit.

Biden, like most Democrats, proposes raising the cap on the level of income that is subject to the payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. That cap is set at $137,700 for the current tax year, meaning any income beyond that threshold is still subject to personal income tax, but not payroll taxes. Biden — and many other Democrats — propose lifting that cap to increase the tax revenue flowing into the Medicare and Social Security trust funds.

Buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems that act in parallel but do not link together and a lack of outreach is causing exasperation and exhaustion among older New Yorkers and others trying to set up vaccination appointments. It is also stymying New York's efforts to get the vaccine to many of the city's most vulnerable, creating a situation that risks exacerbating the inequalities that Covid-19 has already laid painfully bare. The race to vaccinate millions of New Yorkers has reached a critical point, as officials on Wednesday announced that two cases of a more contagious variant of the virus first detected in Britain had been found in New York City, one in Manhattan and one in Queens. The state has used 35 percent of its available vaccine, in line with the national average in a rollout that has gone far slower than expected nationwide. New York City has distributed 38 percent of its shots, with 491,000 available doses as of Thursday. But in the race to get shots in arms, some say the bigger picture about exactly whose arms should be prioritized has been lost. Here we are, facing a global pandemic, with thousands of New Yorkers who have lost their lives, and who is again the forgotten group of people? The very people who need help the most, said Mark Treyger, a city councilman from Brooklyn who said his office had been inundated with calls from family members trying to get appointments for their parents.

The good news, then, is that — as Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome H. Powell took pains to emphasize on Friday —this is exactly what they intend to do. If things do indeed get bumpy over the next few months, the Fed is perfectly willing to put its rate-hiking plans on hold, and even stop its bond holdings from shrinking any further. Which are real possibilities. See, while it's easy to make fun of the stock market for, as the old saying goes, predicting nine out of the last five recessions, it's important to understand that part of the reason it has so many false positives is that it often prompts policymakers to act before things get worse. So both we and the Fed should take it seriously, especially when the much less erratic bond market is telling the same story. Indeed, the fact that long-term interest rates are very close to being lower than short-term interest rates is its way of saying that it thinks the Fed is going to have start cutting rates soon — which it would do only to fight a recession.

JAMES BROWN: And welcome back to the Super Bowl today presented by Pizza Hut, as we continue from inside the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. You know, over the years Super Sunday has become far more than a championship football game. It is now an unofficial American holiday.

What's more, if the implication is that the U.S. is not admitting Christian refugees or that the U.S. is making it difficult, that's not true at all. In fact, the number of Christian refugees to the U.S. in 2016 was almost equal to that of Muslim refugees — 37,521 to 38,901, according to the Pew Research Center, which is basing its numbers on figures from the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Services.

The National Health Commission reported that nine of the 144 cases recorded on Thursday involved people returning to China, but most of the new ones have spread domestically. In Shijiazhuang, a city of 11 million people where residents have been ordered to stay home since last week, the authorities have scrambled to build a large quarantine center in a rural district. The facility, which covers 82 acres, will ultimately have 3,000 trailer-like units, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Claire Fu contributed research.

— Mary Mayhew, the Trump administration's Medicaid director, resigned from her post last week after less than three months on the job. Mayhew, who was tapped in October to be the director of the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, will now run Florida's health-care agency, the Miami Herald's Elizabeth Koh reports. Before her stint in the Trump administration, Mayhew served for seven years as the health and human services commissioner under Maine's former Republican governor Paul LePage.
After the year ends, Medicare compares the plans' bids to the actual spending. If the insurer overestimated its costs, it pockets a chunk of the extra money it received from Medicare—sometimes all of it—and this can often translate into more profit for the insurer, in addition to the profit built into the approved bid, Joseph and Christopher write. If the extra money is greater than 5% of the insurer's original bid, it has to pay some of it back to Medicare....A detailed analysis of the confidential industry data obtained by the Journal shows that 69% of Part D members from 2009 to 2013 were in plans that overestimated costs by at least 5% over that time.

Richmond: The state moved a step closer to ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment on Tuesday, even as the measure's future nationally remains in doubt. A House committee approved a resolution to ratify the gender equality measure, which advocates hope will become the next amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The 13-9 vote split along party lines, with all Democrats supporting it and all Republicans opposing it. A Senate committee already advanced a similar resolution. The resolutions are now before the full House and Senate, where floor votes are expected Wednesday. Democrats control both chambers, and their legislative leaders have said their caucuses unanimously support the measure. Each action we take to move this resolution forward signals to the country that we're more than ready to do our part in creating a world where women are treated as equals, Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, a sponsor of the House resolution, said in a statement.

Oklahoma City: The state attorney general's office is attempting to return $2 million worth of a malaria drug once touted by former President Donald Trump as an effective treatment for COVID-19, a spokesman said Wednesday. Alex Gerszewski, a spokesman for Attorney General Mike Hunter, said Hunter is attempting to negotiate a return of the 1.2 million hydroxychloroquine pills Oklahoma acquired in April from a California-based supplier, FFF Enterprises. He said the office was acting on a request from the Oklahoma State Department of Health, which authorized the purchase. A spokeswoman for FFF Enterprises didn't immediately return a message Wednesday seeking comment. The attempt by Oklahoma to return the hydroxychloroquine was first reported by the online news publication The Frontier. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt defended the purchase last year, saying the drug was showing some promise as a treatment in early March, and he didn't want to miss an opportunity to acquire it. The drug has since been shown to have little or no effect on severe cases of COVID-19, and a former state health official chalked up Oklahoma's purchase to something that happens in the fog of war.

Hopefully, you can get the state unemployment agency to correct the 1099-G and file a corrected version with the IRS, but if not, attach a statement to your tax return that the 1099-G was a response to a fraudulent application that you are trying to get corrected and you did not apply for and did not receive any unemployment benefits, Luscombe said.
When you sell investments in a nonretirement account at a profit, you have to pay a capital gains tax. In 2020, the capital gains rate is either 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on your income and filing status ― that is, unless you held the asset for less than a year. In that case, your earnings are taxed as ordinary income according to current tax brackets. And keep in mind that your stock market earnings could bump you into a higher bracket.
The Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran's page promotes cultural events such as one for school children entitled The Seal of Hostages, attended by several top Iranian officials, according to the book. Another event is the inherently antisemitic Quds Day on the last day of Ramadan. The organization also arranges marches, as well as organizes posters and other materials, for Quds Day. Its site says, A new plan for the destruction of Israel will be launched, and the Quds Cultural Radio station will be located at the Radio Station. Also, the 'I love the fight against Israel' is distributed among the people. Schweizer notes, Quds Day typically features massive crowds organized by the Iranian government chanting 'death to America' and burning effigies, with full media coverage.

Mulvaney thinks a simpler tax code will help close the gap-- he reasons that one of the biggest reasons people don't pay taxes is that they don't want to or are unsure how. Much of the White House's pitch for tax cuts hinges not necessarily on cuts, but on how the plan -- still in a preliminary stage -- would make filing taxes simpler for the average American.
An HSA account is similar to other retirement accounts in that the account is portable and moves with you, the funds roll over from year to year, and you can invest the money in the account for the long term. Even if you use some of the funds during the year and are able to save only a portion of your yearly contribution, you can invest the balance, making this another opportunity to save for your retirement years.

Before the current stalemate set a new record, the longest shutdown lasted 21 days and occurred in late 1995 and early 1996. The lapse in government funding was triggered by a budget battle between President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

Sioux Falls: The state will be receiving more COVID-19 vaccine doses in the coming weeks, the Department of Health said Wednesday. The state will start to receive about 12,800 weekly doses next week, Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said, up from the previous weeks' 11,000 doses. The increase comes after the federal government changed distribution strategies and increased shipments to states, rather than keeping vials in reserve for second doses. Epidemiologist Joshua Clayton said South Dakota has had about 117,725 doses allocated so far. As of noon Tuesday, about 82,000 doses had been administered, and just over 60,000 people had received at least their first dose. Roughly 24,000 people have received both doses of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Those numbers do not include tribal vaccination distribution, which is being handled by the Indian Health Service. Most South Dakotans who have been eligible for the vaccine have opted to receive it. About 65% of health care workers offered the vaccine have taken it, and at least 95% of nursing home residents have received the vaccine.

The insurance industry has been clear that it wants a stable transition, meaning that subsidies that help people pay for their insurance premiums shouldn't be abruptly yanked out from underneath them.

For states in the Northeast, by contrast, most fuel arrives by pipeline from the U.S. Gulf Coast. The transportation costs add to the overall price of gasoline. In addition, since many of these states do not have any refineries, there is also no opportunity to tax fuel at the production stage. Northeastern states, therefore, may levy relatively high gas taxes in order to make up for the lack of other sources of revenue.

Door-to-door follow-up visits by census workers help make up the most expensive part of the 2020 census. The head count is expected to cost a total of $15.6 billion. But the visits have helped the agency ensure that as many residents in the U.S. as possible are counted accurately and at their usual addresses.
The basic challenge facing Social Security is demographic. The system relies on payroll taxes from people who are working to pay benefits to those who are retired. That worked well when there were four or five workers for every retiree. But that ratio has now dropped below three workers per retiree and it's drifting towards two. Absent another baby boom or a massive influx of immigrants, that's not likely to change.

Biden has vowed to try to unite the country, and has said addressing the economic and health crises caused by the coronavirus is his top priority is a big part of that.

While the GAO highlighted the challenges of the pandemic as a culprit in the surge in interest payments, it pointed out that the IRS has been paying out more in interest payments on late refunds for several years prior to the pandemic.

Parents must turn off that television; students must do their homework; teachers must teach; and America compete. We'll be number one if we follow those rules; let's get with it in America again. To big companies that send our jobs overseas, my message is: We need those jobs here at home. And our country won't help your business - unless your business helps our country.

We will have a president who stands up for American workers and American businesses and American farmers in international trade.

But a few months ago, when I visited a grade school class in Texas and asked the children to imagine the future, they talked to me about nuclear war. As we've neared the election, this administration has begun to talk about a safer world. But there's a big difference: As president, I will work for peace from my first day in office - and not from my first day campaigning for re-election. As president, I will reassert American values. I'll press for human rights in Central America, and for the removal of all foreign forces from the region. And in my first hundred days, I will stop the illegal war in Nicaragua.

►Other direct aid. While extra unemployment benefits should be extended into summer (they currently end in March), it's not necessary to increase the federal supplement from $300 a week to $400. Other forms of aid — hikes in child and earned income tax credits, and child care assistance — could better be considered in a future Biden recovery plan that spells out ways to offset the cost through tax hikes.

His most optimistic scenario now is to win Massachusetts, where his liberal following is strong, on April 25, then Nebraska on May 9, run well enough (meaning third behind Humphrey and Wallace) in Michigan on May 16 and then go on to take Oregon, California and New York. For Humphrey and Muskie, April 25 will be critical. That is the date of both the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania primaries. Humphrey, badly needing a victory, will count on his support among organized labor for a win in Pennsylvania. Despite Wisconsin, Humphrey's camp insists that McGovern is not really a factor -- This is a race between Humphrey and Muskie. McGovern's advisers, meantime, regard Muskie as a political corpse, seeing the race as a head-on collision between McGovern and Humphrey. Muskie had planned to run in Pennsylvania against Humphrey and in Massachusetts against McGovern, to regain momentum. Last week, however, his advisers were discussing a stop-Humphrey ploy with McGovern's forces -- Muskie would concentrate on winning in Pennsylvania while leaving Massachusetts to McGovern. With each future contest, the political equations will change and the pressures increase. It is now highly likely that after all the bloodshed of the primaries, no one will go to Miami Beach with a lock on the nomination. If so, it will be a fascinating week in July. A deadlock would probably eliminate McGovern as too leftward and experimental, even though that might provoke a fourth-party rebellion. Humphrey might also be unacceptable: too much like 1968...a loser's image.

Drought: California suffered one of the worst droughts in its history for much of the decade. The effects were made worse because the state has failed to invest in new water storage infrastructure for decades. Though politicians point to climate change (inaccurately) as the cause of recent wildfires, poor forestry management — state and federal — plus restrictions on logging and poor residential planning have turned natural variation into man-made disasters.

While more permissive in allowing Chinese tourists to enter the country, the Kim regime does allow Westerners to see it, but only through restrictive tour programs where a North Korean guide stays with each individual at all times, ensuring they do not ask incorrect questions or wander out of the sight of the government.

They have not taken Americans since Congress passed a law banning American tourism to the country in 2017.

Unlike his predecessors, father Kim Jong-il and grandfather Kim Il-sung, dictator Kim Jong-un made his avid interest in attracting tourism to the country well known early in his tenure. In 2013, Kim debuted the massive Masikryong Ski Resort, which official North Korean propaganda described as a feat of the supreme will of the people despite widespread hunger and disease that rendered skiing far from a priority of the average North Korean. Two years later, Kim announced that he would launch a campaign to attract up to two million foreign tourists by 2020, when the most common kind of tourist to the country was an elder Chinese communist seeking to relive the glory days of the Maoist era.

Detroit: Michigan State Police has suspended the contract with the company that issues the state's breath alcohol testing devices amid concerns the results could be flawed. In a letter written to police and prosecutors statewide, state police officials warned law enforcement agencies about performance-related issues with the Datamaster DMT breathalyzer devices, according to the Detroit News. Such issues could affect drunken driving cases. The letter did not identify the problems or how they were uncovered. State police Lt. Michael Shaw said the agency will take over calibration of the devices, as well as the contractor's duties of certifying and serving the breathalyzer units. Oakland University criminal justice professor Daniel Kennedy said such issues with the breathalyzer devices could be troublesome for drunken driving cases in Michigan.
Some Democrats will argue that this is just a plea to pick a pseudo-Republican. This is childish. I accept that elections have consequences, and I know what I will get with any Democratic president. Even as a Republican, I never argued for incessant warfare against Obama, whom I supported on any number of issues ranging from missile defense to Cuba. I opposed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denying the president's constitutional right to a Supreme Court nomination in his last year in office.

Before this point, Rebekah's resume had consisted of a brief run trading stocks and bonds (including at her father's hedge fund), a longer stint running her family's foundation and, along with her two sisters, the management of an online gourmet cookie shop called Ruby et Violette. Now, she was compiling lists of potential candidates for a host of official positions, the foot soldiers who would remake (or unmake) the United States government in Trump's image. Rebekah wasn't a regular presence at Trump Tower. She preferred working from her apartment in Trump Place, which was in fact six separate apartments that she and her husband had combined into an opulent property more than twice the size of Gracie Mansion. Still, it quickly became clear to her new colleagues that she wasn't content just to chip in with ideas. She wanted decision-making power. To her peers on the executive committee, she supported Alabama senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general and General Michael Flynn for national security adviser, but argued against naming Mitt Romney secretary of state. Her views on these matters were heard, according to several people on and close to the transition leadership. Rebekah was less successful when she lobbied hard for John Bolton, the famously hawkish former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, to be deputy secretary of state. And when Bolton was not named to any position, she made her displeasure known. I know it sounds sexist, but she was whiny as hell, says one person who watched her operate.

Harlan: A man has asked a judge to let him engage in a sword fight with his ex-wife and her attorney so he can rend their souls from their bodies. David Ostrom, 40, of Paola, Kansas, said in a Jan. 3 court filing that his former wife, Bridgette Ostrom, 38, of Harlan, Iowa, and her attorney, Matthew Hudson, had destroyed (him) legally. The Ostroms have been embroiled in disputes over custody and visitation issues and property tax payments. The judge had the power to let the parties resolve our disputes on the field of battle, legally, David Ostrom said, adding in his filing that trial by combat has never been explicitly banned or restricted as a right in these United States. He also asked the judge for 12 weeks' time so he could secure Japanese samurai swords.

There are so many dirty deals that happen before people file for divorce. I recently heard of a case where a husband took $1 million equity out of the home that he lived in with his wife (his name was on the deed) shortly before they filed for divorce. That's the kind of paper trail that leads all the way back to a disgruntled judge in divorce court. I've had so many letters in recent months from or about people who want to pull a fast one: The wife who wanted to disinherit her stepchildren in the event that her husband of one year dies, and even a psychotherapist who wanted to be in cahoots with his client to cheat the insurance company.

The ice formation comes just about a year after a disk measuring about 100 yards in diameter was spotted in the Presumpscot River. It eventually had a devoted webcam; social media users compared it to an alien spacecraft and the moon; and ducks used it as a raft. A video of the disk shows a nascent ice blob that is thinner and less circular than the famous disk of 2019.
Indeed, just before Mr. de Blasio's expected announcement, the incoming Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said that he and Mr. Biden had reached a deal for the federal government to cover the full costs of state and city expenses related to a disaster declaration from last March, when the virus was first discovered in New York. The move is expected to save the state and city about $2 billion, money that Mr. Schumer's office said can be used to tackle Covid-related budget gaps. And on Thursday, Mr. Schumer was promising more to come. This is just prelude of better days ahead out of Washington for New York, he said. With Biden as president and me as majority leader, it's going to get better. Still, few expect the federal government to be able to fully meet the budgetary needs of state and local governments.

But as the company closes up a supposed backlog of 450,000 vehicles, cracks are beginning to appear.

Rubio's proposal: Marco Rubio suggests gradually raising the retirement age at which younger workers like himself become eligible for Social Security. This is effectively a cut in benefits, since retirees would have fewer years to collect. Raising the top retirement age from 67 to 70 as Rubio proposed would fill about one-third of the Social Security shortfall. Rubio also suggested a form of means testing, in which wealthier retirees would see smaller benefit increases in the future. The Senator didn't offer any details, but other means testing proposals have been estimated to reduce the funding shortfall by about 10 percent.

The youth, who is openly gay and is now in college, said in an interview with WWL-TV that he wants to expose Yenni's behavior because he finds it disturbing. While the youth was initially flattered and intrigued by Yenni's overtures, he said the texts and phone conversations began to make him uncomfortable, such as one proposing three-way sex with him and the 19-year-old mutual friend. He asked me to go with him to his house in Oxford (Mississippi), the youth said. Records show Yenni owns an apartment there. Also, the way he would describe the sexual things he wanted to do to me. And he asked me to be a secretary or assistant in his office; that way I could be with him and not be questioned. Weeks after the sexting began, in June 2015, the youth said he broke off communication and blocked Yenni's number.

Wearing masks is one of the pillars of recommendations from health experts worldwide to slow the spread of the coronavirus, along with physically distancing and avoiding crowds. The move comes as Wisconsin lags in distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, health officials warn about the spread of contagious new variants, and total deaths due to COVID-19 near 6,000. This is no time to remove a mask mandate in our state, Wisconsin Department of Health Services Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said Tuesday. Vaccines alone won't stop the spread, she cautioned, noting the emergence of more contagious variants.

Richmond: State officials and U.S. hate-monitoring groups are warning about the potential for violence ahead of a gun-rights rally expected to draw a mix of militias, firearms advocates and white supremacists to the city. Citing credible threats of violence, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a temporary state of emergency days ahead of Monday's rally, banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square. Virginia's solicitor general last week said law enforcement had identified credible evidence that armed out-of-state groups planned to come to Virginia with the possible intention of participating in a violent insurrection. Online, threats of violence have been rampant among anti-government and far-right groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white supremacists and other extremists. Conspiracy theories and other misinformation have also proliferated.

Shrift, from the verb to shrive, is confession of one's sins to a priest and presumably forgiveness. This was a rite so important to some Christian believers that it was sometimes done by a priest on the battlefield, with less than proper time or ceremony, for a dying soldier to expiate his sins before meeting his maker. This was known as short shrift, an expression that has come to mean to make a rush job of something. Victims of various plagues in history also got short shrift, without priests to hear their final confessions, and, sadly, many of the more than 350,000 Americans who have died of the coronavirus were also deprived of the comfort of last rites or family in their last hours because of the dangerous contagion of this disease.

But, Mark Willis, a research fellow at New York University's Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, said that property tax exemptions are essential to development of mid-rise housing in areas with moderate- to low-market rents. If fewer mixed-income units were built, he said, it could only intensify our current affordable housing crisis.
House GOP leaders, after speaking with Pence, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Tuesday, seemed similarly aligned.
President-elect Barack Obama followed a similar pattern, regularly fielding questions from reporters, as he made choices about who would serve in his administration. In all, Obama fielded questions from the White House press corps on 18 different occasions as president-elect. George W. Bush, who had a shorter transition period, did so 11 times.

The tax gap, simply put, is the amount in taxes individuals and companies owe the government, but that the government never receives. There are three reasons for that gap --some fail to pay any taxes, others underreport income, and yet others underpay their taxes, according to the IRS. Mulvaney said the president's proposed tax plan doesn't include an expectation that the gap will close, but pointed out how shrinking it would help the proposed $4 trillion budget. The tax gap in 2016 was $486 billion -- out of the expected revenue from income and corporate taxes of roughly $1.9 trillion.
Rather than adopt the populist rhetoric of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Booker defended his work combating predatory financial practices, including exploitative lending to low-income homeowners in Newark, and vowed that he would continue to stand up to bad actors in corporate America whose practices harm ordinary people.
Kulp is among the 15 analysts tracked by FactSet who have the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock; two say hold.

For businesses, the desire to rely on PRI to strip out non-commercial risk from transactions will become greater than ever, for the same reason - to grow and generate ever greater revenue, deals must be done, even when the ground shifts beneath them. There will be ever greater competition for the product, but only those transactions with the best story to tell, and having the right combination of quality, tenor, size, and location, will receive coverage. Revenue in coming years will become increasingly associated with thought leadership and bravado, combined with deployment of the right risk management tools.
BALDWIN: Picture For A Sunday Afternoon.
DeVos submitted a letter of resignation to Trump on Thursday, calling Wednesday's events unconscionable for our country.
During his presidential campaign, Trump touted his company's hiring practices. In the fall of 2016, when he opened a new Trump hotel in Washington, he told the assembled audience: We didn't have one illegal immigrant on the job. Everybody knows it.
Denver: After former Gov. John Hickenlooper came under fire for how he spent money from a little-known account in his office, similar accounts have been noted throughout state government that hold millions of taxpayer dollars, KCNC-TV reports. The money in the accounts comes from sources like federal dollars and legal settlements, and departments don't have to disclose it to the Legislature. Democratic Sen. Dominick Moreno plans to change that with a bill he says the powerful Joint Budget Committee is drafting this year. As vice chair of the committee, Moreno has in-depth knowledge of state finances. But he says even he didn't know about all the money state departments take in that isn't reported and over which the Legislature has no control. The Colorado Sun reports the Hickenlooper account is paying ongoing legal bills related to an ethics complaint against the current U.S. Senate candidate.
Marek's DACA refers to President Barack Obama's 2012 award of work permits to roughly 800,000 young illegal migrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. The DACA work-permit giveaway has not been approved by Congress, partly because many millions of Americans are worried about their families' jobs, income, and health in an increasingly elite-controlled economy. It's not amnesty, Marek wrote in 2014. It is a sensible program aimed at identifying people and taxing them for working in the United States. That's the kind of border security we need.
In response to a question from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) about what economic metric might offer a clue that the government is borrowing too much, Yellen pointed to the amount that the government spends on interest on the debt. As a percentage of the U.S. economy, interest costs have risen much more slowly than the debt itself, reflecting the continued willingness of financial institutions to loan money to the government. Net interest outlays actually declined last year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, despite a surge of pandemic borrowing.
The announcement marked a victory for President Trump, who had disparaged Toyota for selling vehicles in the U.S. that are made in foreign markets. About half of Toyota vehicles sold to Americans are made domestically, according to Barclays.

Besides, the Upton signing did nothing to hurt their future or farm system. The Tigers, who were protected because they had one of the 10 worst records in the major leagues last season (74-87) lost only a third-round pick by signing Upton, after losing a second-round pick with the signing of Zimmermann.
It's easy to get swept up in the GameStop success stories. One Redditor claimed to use his stock market profits to pay off his student loans. Another paid for his dog's lifesaving surgery. But that doesn't mean anyone with a Reddit account and some cash to burn should get into the same kind of day trading activity.
That Trump paid Cohen, while in office, to cover the costs associated with buying the silence of a woman who said she had had a sexual relationship with Trump years earlier. Trump has acknowledged the payment but denied the underlying allegations about a sexual relationship.

This is unacceptable. It's fine and necessary for the government to provide resources to private companies to speed up development and testing of the vaccine, but there need to be two conditions. First, all the findings have to be made public as quickly as is practical. We want researchers worldwide to be able to benefit from any new findings to get to an effective vaccine as quickly as possible. The model here is the Bermuda Principles for the Human Genome Project, where results were posted nightly.

While Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider. And Wall Street executives still receive huge compensation packages as if the financial crisis they created never happened.
Some left-leaning groups that support the president's promises to end offshoring embraced the view that the administration's trade policies simply haven't gone far enough.
And yet, as MPs prepare to begin a five-day debate ahead of that vote on the May deal next week, we are no closer to discovering what MPs actually want.
For example, the bill does not include several expansions of visa-worker programs which were included in the July 2018 draft budget by Rep. Kevin Yoder and many GOP and Democratic appropriators. Yoder was defeated in November, but the border security panel is dominated by House and Senate appropriators.
In 2011, they made one of their most consequential investments: a reported $10 million in a new right-wing media operation called Breitbart. I don't know any of your fancy friends, Robert Mercer told Sheldon Adelson, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. That the family gravitated toward Andrew Breitbart's upstart website was no accident. The Mercers are purists, says Pat Caddell, a former aide to Jimmy Carter who has shifted to the right over the years. They believe Republican elites are too cozy with Wall Street and too soft on immigration, and that American free enterprise and competition are in mortal danger. Bekah Mercer might be prepared to put a Democrat in Susan Collins' seat simply to rid the party of Susan Collins, a family friend joked by way of illustrating her thinking. So intensely do the Mercers want to unseat Republican senator John McCain[2] 2. Some have speculated that McCain may have angered the Mercers in 2014, when the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which McCain was the ranking member at the time, asserted that Renaissance had used complex financial methods to underestimate its taxes by $6 billion. Renaissance has told The New York Times its tax practices are lawful. that they gave $200,000 to support an opposing candidate who once held a town hall meeting to discuss chemtrails—chemicals, according to a long-standing conspiracy theory, that the federal government is spraying on the public without its knowledge.

New York has always been the critical, strategic and much-anticipated component of any U.S. online gambling agenda, and it represents one of the top three states in terms of economic potential, he said. It's no surprise that this is moving on the back of budget deficits in states like New York, and I think it's a great way of bringing tax dollars from offshore operations to the city and state coffers.

Also, take the opportunity to change passwords to lessen the odds of having an account hacked. Americans don't change their passwords often. Nor do they utilize complex, lengthy passwords.

We came so far during the last administration – from prioritizing American energy development to ending the far-left's war on fossil fuels. The Keystone XL pipeline would create thousands of jobs in Oklahoma and throughout the nation and President Biden's disappointing choice today to revoke this permit will harm the nation's tremendous progress toward energy independence. I am sad to see this decision to continue the failed Obama-era legacy of denying tens of thousands of Americans good, well-paying jobs at the expense of satisfying liberal, 'Green New Deal' inspired interest groups.
BILL BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: When I first saw the news reports, I said, gee, the news is spinning this. This is not what we were going to do.

If a product is positioned as unique, smart marketing companies will typically use all three of these strategies in combination. For example, Apple has priced its new iPad Air and iPad Pro starting at $499 and $799 respectively. Apple is using a MSD strategy in addition to a WTMWB strategy because the iPhone has uniqueness built-in since Apple controls the platform. It also aims for a GPMT, which is not officially published, but which is in the 30 to 50% GPM range of well-positioned products in competitive markets. When Johnson & Johnson launched a margarine developed in Finland that lowers cholesterol, it priced a tub of this margarine at between $5.79 and $5.99. At the same time, a tub of regular margarine sold for 99¢. Based on this pricing, which used MSD and WTMWB strategies, many speculated that J&J priced the product at 8C, which gave it a GPMT of roughly 87.5%.
Higher consumption of calories from subsidized food commodities was associated with a greater probability of some cardiometabolic risks, the authors conclude. For instance, they found a higher probability of both obesity and unhealthy blood glucose levels (which raises the risk of Type 2 diabetes) among people who consumed the most calories from subsidized foods.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Jonah, the President weighs in on a lot of things, and he weighed in on this a few times this week. And then this morning said, African-Americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in Virginia. It's not clear what he was referring to, it might have been this Washington Post poll that said the majority of black residents were okay with Northam remaining in office. Why weigh into this?

Right now, you can various levels of TurboTax at great discounts.
One reason is that the elimination of the federal personal and dependent exemptions could increase a Colorado resident's state tax bill by $191 per family member on one's return, according to estimates from staff economists of Colorado's legislative council.
How GOP Tax Credits Would Work
When Trump sent those tweets, the Post immediately rejected criticism. It stood behind its reporters just as it did in the Watergate era, when the team of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein sparked the larger, official investigations that would drive President Richard Nixon from office. Their work relied substantially on unnamed sources, including one in particular (Deep Throat) who turned out to be the deputy director of the FBI.

GROSS: That's Randy Rainbow. And if you want to see more of his videos, they're all on YouTube. And that was recorded December 11, 2017. And if you think that that song is hopelessly out of date because Roy Moore lost, consider that in June, Roy Moore announced he intends on running again for the Senate. So Sixteen Going On Seventeen seems like an obvious song choice to use for the Roy Moore story. But how did you make that connection in your mind? It seems obvious after somebody makes the connection for you, but how did you think of using that melody?

Trone went on to win the 2018 election to replace Delaney in another Maryland district; he and all House Democrats will vote soon on the For the People Act, a package of campaign finance and ethics changes that would, among other things, create a robust public campaign finance system. Republicans have said they'd block the legislation in the Senate.

I have a budget for the campaign we're going to run between Iowa and New Hampshire, and my personal funds will make up for any shortfalls, Delaney said in an interview as he headed to weekend events in Michigan and Iowa. It may end up being about 50-50. Raising money creates a connection to the campaign; what gets you out of bed is the fact that people have invested in you.
South Dakota GOP Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the GOP whip, said he doesn't think the emergency declaration is the right move and that I prefer that we get this resolved the old-fashioned way.
Somewhat more speculative are the thoughts indirectly attributed to former White House personnel such as Kelly, including Rex Tillerson (his first secretary of state), Jim Mattis (his first secretary of defense) and Don McGahn (his first White House counsel). All the above come off as valiant public servants who strove to be guardrails — to keep the president's rogue instincts in check – until they were fired or resigned.

Grassley has also signed on to the Creates Act, whose House and Senate versions are supported by a broad range of lawmakers — so broad, in fact, that they included both Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who nearly beat Cruz in the November midterms. The measure would allow generic companies to sue branded companies for failing to provide them with samples needed to create generic versions of their products (we explained the Creates Act more in this Health 202).
In the run-up to the World Cup, she received another raise, which did not fall within the time-frame of the latest tax records. Estimates placed her base salary at $500,000. She did not receive a bonus for success in the World Cup qualifying tournament but did earn considerable bonuses for winning the World Cup.
When skeptics like my seatmate hear these facts, support for international study programs rises dramatically. At a time of great concern over the fiscal health of our colleges and universities, examples of win-win solutions are hard to come by. And this economic story goes hand-in-hand with the powerful societal benefits of international education programs. American students benefit from attending schools with a greater diversity of ideas and perspectives from their international peers, while international students return to their home countries with a world class education and a better understanding of America and our values.
Like we saw last week with GameStop and AMC, at any given point, there are a number of factors that can come in and completely change the direction of any given stock or market index that may be completely irrelevant to the fundamentals of investing, such as investing in companies with strong balance sheets, Castro said. Those types of curveballs make successfully timing the market on a consistent basis nearly impossible.

Sanders' camp, meanwhile, maintains that Biden's history is more important than his current proposals. Another of their favorite video clips shows then-Sen.

When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security, as well, Biden said at the time. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans' benefits. … And I not only tried it once. I tried it twice, I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.

Basically, Democrats believe there should be a right to decent, affordable insurance. They wrote the Affordable Care Act with that principle in mind.

But something like 20 million people now have comprehensive policies they didn't have before. Overall, financial security and access to health care have improved.

According to two confidants of Trump's, who have spoken to him in recent days but were not authorized to speak publicly, Trump is looking at how such a move would play out and has told his aides that such a drastic turn could rattle the Democrats and compel them to offer him wall funding. The legality of such a move is unclear, however, and Trump would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges in the courts.
Bismarck: A pipeline spill of oil-field wastewater has affected cropland in northwestern North Dakota. State environmental scientist Bill Suess said regulators were notified Monday of the 8,400-gallon pipeline leak in Renville County. The pipeline is operated by Wichita Falls, Texas-based Cobra Oil and Gas. Suess said the spill of produced water happened 2 miles north of Sherwood and within a mile of the U.S.-Canada border. The cause of the pipeline leak is unknown. Produced water is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals. It's a byproduct of oil and gas development. Suess said about 1,000 square feet of cropland was affected. He said no water sources were harmed.

Its factory here is expected to eventually employ 2,000, and it has already begun shifting employees from elsewhere, including 100 from the town in upstate New York where the company was founded two centuries ago.

As for taxpayers who rely on accountants, there's the danger that your CPA may not have time to handle your returns the closer you wait until April 18. It's not all that unusual to file for an extension, since about 8 percent of all returns the IRS receives are filed with the additional 6 months that the extension provides.
What I can speak to is this broader, interesting issue of how dependent the United States of America is on the global supply chain, not just for its medicines but for its medical supplies and medical equipment, Navarro told CNBC's Squawk Box Monday, as stocks plummeted amid the worsening economic impact of the virus.

People may be working one week and not the next week, so if you look at one week's worth of data you dramatically undercount the workforce, Stephane Kasriel, CEO of the freelancing platform Upwork, told CBS MoneyWatch. A substantial part of the workforce is moonlighting.
Trump is expected to deliver remarks highlighting his administration's efforts to curb illegal immigration and the progress made on his signature 2016 campaign promise: building a big, beautiful wall across the length of the southern border — an imposing structure made of concrete and reinforced steel. Over time, Trump demanded modifications that have been largely rejected: He wanted it painted black to burn the hands of those who touched it; he wanted it adorned with deadly spikes; he even wanted to surround it with an alligator-filled moat.
The proposed tax hike would affect those making $10 million or more, she said.

Why re-litigate 40-year-old news articles and four-year-old news conferences? Because it's worth remembering that Trump at no time was prepared to manage the process of passing legislation through the House and the Senate. The current government shutdown, approaching three weeks in length, stemmed from dual failures on Trump's part: Most recently in an inability to cajole members of Congress to see his side on funding for a wall on the border with Mexico and, earlier, a failure to passing a funding mechanism for that wall during the two years when Republicans controlled the House and the Senate.
Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a Republican who had supported a bipartisan immigration reform plan, ripped Biden's legislative plan as mass amnesty – the exact words used by Trump loyalist Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.

Buyers can avoid paying property tax on the homes if Sambuca becomes their principal residence. Otherwise, a tax rate of up to 0.76 percent applies. A secondary tax, that varies across municipalities, also applies, in the range of zero to 3.3 percent. You could have zero point zero taxes depending on the municipality, Kalashian said.

Barrientos says for too long health officials considered it the responsibility of patients to change their diet and exercise routines. They either did it or didn't. He says now it's become clear that addressing one of Mexico's biggest health crises requires changes at a much higher level and includes lobbying for healthier public spaces where people can easily get out and exercise.
Some conservatives have long argued that the cost of tax cuts should be evaluated using dynamic scoring, rather than traditional scoring. They don't believe tax cuts must be fully paid-for in legislative text, clalming that the economic growth they create will counterbalance any additional money the tax cuts add to the national debt.
The article put a lot of emphasis on op-eds that caused controversy over the past year, rather than op-eds that advanced public policy debates and helped to develop an informed consensus. The real story is that op-eds, when done right, make us think and help us understand — they build consensus on policy concerns and contribute to a public debate.

In 2014, some conservative Republicans said they feared that Howell was secretly on board with McAuliffe's plan to expand Medicaid as they pushed for a budget amendment that they thought was needed to tie the governor's hands. The speaker had called the amendment unnecessary but eventually got on board. McAuliffe later acknowledged that the amendment blocked a loophole that he had intended to use to expand Medicaid unilaterally.

The idea that wealth trickles down from the richest to those less privileged has been bashed by none other than billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has argued that people like him should pay more in taxes.
Over the last four years, Trump and his administration have taken extreme — and often unlawful — action to try to curb both illegal and legal immigration. Their efforts were aided in his final year by the coronavirus pandemic, which ground international travel to a halt. But the number of people stopped trying to cross the southern border illegally has been creeping back up in recent months. Figures from December show nearly 74,000 encounters at the southwest border, up 3% from November and up 81% from a year earlier.

It's just -- I can't even adequately describe it. And I know exactly how Ambassador Yovanovitch feels.
Here are five takeaways from Wednesday's debate:
How high would the tax be?
Mulvaney said there are two reasons for the tax gap -- people either don't want to pay, which is always a problem, or filing out the form is just too hard. It's not easy to make headway into that first problem, Mulvaney conceded, but that second reason has a solution.
Why not let people express their opinions and investigate? Well, as you
Hearing from Bolton would force the Republican senators to confront uncomfortable facts. Instead, they seem eager to accept the word of a President who many acknowledge to be a liar and pretend that the highly relevant new information is not worth further investigation. Dershowitz's argument gives them a whisper of an argument to justify their complicity in a Trump coverup.

Over the past decade, the much-vaunted freelance economy has spawned dozens of platforms designed to help people launch their unrealized dreams of independent work: from TaskRabbit to Fiverr to Upwork to Handy to the much-maligned Uber, to name just a handful.
At the request of the Washington Post, Moody's Analytics recently modeled Trump's trade proposals for Mexico and China. It showed that if Congress were to approve such changes, China and Mexico would fall into recession — and about 4 million U.S. workers would lose their jobs, and another 3 million jobs that otherwise would have been created will be lost.
And so they fled to more affordable places, like Georgia, and states with no income taxes, like Texas and Florida. The report added that the number one choice of relocation for people leaving San Francisco is Austin, Texas.
HECK: You know, Colonel, I have to say I find it a rich but incredible painful irony that within a week of the President contrary to all advise of the Senior Military Officials he pardons those who were convicted of war crimes, which was widely decried in the military community. Within the week of him doing that he is engaged in an effort and allies on his behalf including some here today to demean your record of service and the sacrifice and contribution you have made. Indeed, sir, less than 20 minutes ago the White House officially quoted out, out of context the comments referred to earlier by Mr. Morrison in (ph) your judgment.
The bill would replace the premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies in the Affordable Care Act with a flat tax credit, based on age. Currently, only people who make between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty limit are eligible for tax credits that defray their premiums. The size of the credits are pegged to people's incomes and the cost of a benchmark plan in the marketplace where they're buying insurance. That helps account for the fact that the average premium can vary widely depending where a person is buying insurance.
FINRA also ordered MetLife Securities Inc. to return $5 million to customers for making negligent material misrepresentations and omissions on applications for switching into new variable annuities contracts. Tens of thousands of customers were affected, the regulators said.
The administration has been saying they were going to use economic growth to deal with our fiscal challenges and reduce the debt. Now they want to use growth effects to pay for tax cuts, she explained. You shouldn't assume growth effects before they occur, and you sure shouldn't count them twice.
Ongoing maintenance and capital reserves : Sellers should remember to budget for ongoing maintenance (leaky toilets, appliance repairs, etc.) and larger capital expenses (roof repairs, HVAC repairs, etc.). Ten percent of gross rents is a good rule of thumb.

Louisville: A Christian school expelled a student last week after her family says school officials discovered the 15-year-old had celebrated her birthday with a rainbow-themed cake. Kimberly Alford says that until Jan. 6, her daughter had been a freshman at Whitefield Academy. That's when Alford says she received an email from the academy's head of school, Bruce Jacobson, explaining how her daughter was being expelled immediately due to a post on social media. Alford had recently posted a photo on her Facebook page showing her daughter celebrating her birthday at a Texas Roadhouse restaurant, wearing a sweater featuring a rainbow design and sitting by a colorful, rainbow-themed cake. Alford says someone shared the photo with school officials. Alford says Jacobson wrote that the picture demonstrates a posture of morality and cultural acceptance contrary to that of Whitefield Academy's beliefs and follows two years of lifestyle violations. Alford says her daughter is not gay, and the cake was simply a fun treat.

He chaperoned dances, supervised weekend recreation programs, directed one of the school district's summer camp programs. And you say he was strict with you because he'd seen what happens to kids who go off the track and who start drinking or using drugs. So in what way was he strict with you?

5) If you really can't annuitize anything, live on Social Security plus 3 percent of your beginning assets each year (4 percent if you are quite unhealthy). For example, if a person enters retirement with $200,000 in assets, they will need to adjust their consumption to hit Social Security plus $6,000 per year. If they consume more money than that, they risk running out of everything but Social Security, which has its own problems.

Maybe he pretended he had a job at night, and he was really just doing something else.
So what should the Fed do then? Well, in this case, the easy answer is the correct one. It should wait. That's because we don't know how much of today's growth will go away tomorrow once the stimulative effect of Trump's tax cuts fades away. Or how much of the slowdown in the rest of the world will put a speed limit on our own economy. Or whether higher wages will continue to suck more people into the workforce, as they did last month, or are instead a sign that companies are starting to run out of workers.

They put together a tax-exempt municipal bond that DC Water would issue. They called it an Environmental Impact Bond (EIB). And it is, indeed just that: an environmental impact bond! Remember a few paragraphs above where we said that the goal of environmental finance was to produce the lowest cost. Well it was a stroke of genius on the part of Mark Kim, DC Water's CFO, and Eric Letsinger, the CEO of Quantified Ventures, that they realized that lowest cost didn't necessarily mean lowest interest rate. So they built into the EIB a unique and brilliant feature: if the flow reduction exceeds 41.3%, DC Water will pay the investors an additional $3.3 million. BUT, if the flow reduction is less than 18.6%, then the investors will get $3.3 million less interest.

Nevertheless, the Republican governors of Oklahoma and Tennessee are still seeking federal approval to accept more limited federal funding for their Medicaid programs, respectively known as SoonerCare and TennCare.
A 16-day shutdown in 2013 stemmed from a fight over funding for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Unable to repeal President Barack Obama's signature health care law, Republicans in Congress approved a temporary measure that would fund the government but would cut funding to implement Obamacare. The Senate, controlled by Democrats, rejected the plan. The standoff ended when Republicans conceded defeat and a deal was worked out to reopen the government.
The measure, which the House passed in 2016, faces an additional vote in that chamber before being taken up in the Senate, where it failed last year. The legislation is sponsored by Del. Luke H.

All of which is to say that the Federal Reserve is in a fairly awkward spot right now. How is that? Well, all of the backward-looking economic data says that we're nowhere near a recession — not when we've added an average of 254,000 jobs a month in the past three months, compared with the 100,000 or so we'd need to keep the unemployment rate from going up — while most of the forward-looking financial indicators say that one might not be that far away. In other words, for every bit of good news about today, such as the continued growth in manufacturing employment, there's a bit of bad news about the outlook for tomorrow, such as the big drop in manufacturing production. Which is why the Fed is justified in thinking that it'll need to raise rates a few times this year to keep inflation in check at the same time that markets are, maybe not equally justified, but still on firm ground in thinking that it's more likely that the Fed will end up cutting them.

Men died of Covid-19 at far higher rates than women during the second quarter of last year, with 148.1 deaths per 100,000, compared to 124.6 per 100,000 for women. When the figures were adjusted to account for the age differences between the sexes, the disparities were even more stark: the Covid-19 death rate for men was 133.9 per 100,000 during the second quarter of 2020, compared with 86.9 per 100,000 for women. The center has collected data on racial and ethnic disparities in death rates, but has not yet published the research. Another paper published on Thursday, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, calculated that Covid-19 has reduced life expectancy for all Americans by about a year on average, but found that the impact differs dramatically by race. While the life expectancy of white Americans has been shortened by less than a year, to 77.84 years on average, life expectancy among Black and Hispanic Americans has been reduced by two years and three years, respectively, to 72.7 years and to 78.7 years. (Hispanic Americans live longer on average than white or Black people.) The reduction represents the single largest single drop in life expectancy in 40 years. The N.C.H.S. report is not the first to show that the pandemic has increased deaths from a variety of causes.

An annuity can be a very smart retirement investment for many people. That's not just because an annuity can provide a secure revenue stream — a monthly check — for the rest of your life, no matter how long you live. On top of that, the longer you live, the more you get what's called a mortality credit as you outlive other people who bought into the annuity. The income gain from that can be many times greater than any other secure investment you're likely to find.

In fact, Congress has already recognized these realities.

If we do cut taxes and repeal and replace Obamacare it doesn't matter what Bannon does because we'll win.
Trump and Clinton both champion manufacturing in their speeches — it goes hand in hand with their strong rhetoric on trade. Trump focuses on the sharp decline in manufacturing jobs — the U.S. now has around 12.3 million manufacturing jobs, down by more than 7 million from a late-1970s peak. And while automation has helped to eat away at manufacturing jobs, there's also good evidence that China — one of Trump's chief villains when he talks about trade — played a big role in hurting U.S. manufacturing jobs.

Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt – many jobs being lost! posted President Trump in August 2017, adding in December, Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!
To compensate, the package contains deep cuts in entitlement programs that would hit hardest many of the economically strained voters who propelled the president into office. Over the next decade, it calls for slashing more than $800 billion from Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor, while slicing $192 billion from nutritional assistance and $272 billion over all from welfare programs. And domestic programs outside of military and homeland security whose budgets are determined annually by Congress would also take a hit, their funding falling by $57 billion, or 10.6 percent.
But then again, we don't want the scammers to get even better at this game, do we? Best to kill and ignore all such phishing e-mails.

Under the Trump policy, announced in January, a state facing increasing Medicaid enrollment or higher spending on medical care for enrollees could choose to jettison people from the program or eliminate covered benefits. The alternative would be for the state to increase its own spending to maintain coverage and benefits, which would be significantly challenging because nearly all states must balance their budgets and can't turn to deficit spending. And given that this proposal is designed to appeal to Republican state officials, tax increases to finance additional spending would be unlikely.

In phone surveys, staffers said, CA's predictions fell short of the 85 percent accuracy the campaign expected. (Different models have differing levels of accuracy, Nix said in his response. I suspect these numbers have been taken out of context to make us look bad. In many previous articles the Cruz campaign have highly rated the quality of our data scientists.) By September, CA's first six-month contract was up. A CA employee in the campaign's Houston office accidentally left the invoice in the photocopier, and Wilson happened to fish it out. The invoice totaled an eye-popping $3,119,052 for work that Wilson estimated to be worth $600,000 at most. I can't fucking believe it, Wilson told Roe, who concurred.

However, a former consultant for the campaign, Tommy Sears, attended budget meetings for two if not three days over the matter. There was an understanding between both parties that the totality of the contract through March 2016 would be $5.5 million, he says. The heartburn felt by the Cruz team was that over $3 million had already been spent by September 1, 2015. When the Cruz team decided not to pay the full $3 million, bedlam ensued.

These figures suggest that for some workers -- particularly those with specialized and in-demand skill sets, who also tend to be older -- independent work really is one path to a more satisfying life. That's the line that many independent work platforms have been pushing for some time.

Implication: a mad rush by consumers and businesses to establish direct import relationships with foreign suppliers. But this a) evades the tax and spoils the incentive, and b) has no rational economic purpose, so it undermines economic efficiency.
Manafort reached a plea agreement with Mueller's office on Sept. 14 to avoid a second trial on additional charges in D.C. District Court. Under the deal, Manafort pledged to cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly with Mueller's probe and any other investigation.

He wasn't expecting so many newsmen to show up. But since then, it has become a tradition, a fixture of the relationship between the president, the press and, by extension, the American public.
Wolf has also received endorsements from community leaders across the state — although, he acknowledged, relatively few north of Interstate 80.
The bulk of taxpayers are not procrastinators, Greene-Lewis said. About 20 percent file in the last two weeks before the deadline, and another 10 to 12 percent pay later, but the majority file earlier. She pointed out that with all the improvements in tax filing software and support available, there are few excuses to delay.
Josh and Alicia Green embraced the concept of trashing their own house, writing a description for their appeal that was the polar opposite of a real estate agent's gushing ad. We reminded them we lived on a busy road, Western Avenue, Josh Green said. We also told the city about costly repairs we needed, like a new roof. In addition, the Greens noticed that the District listed their house as having three bedrooms. But we alerted them that the previous owner had knocked out a wall and made it two bedrooms, thus lowering the value more, Green said.
On January 10, Pelosi said that Trump's proposed barrier to Central American migration is discriminatory.

Last Friday, the American Center for Law and Justice (where I serve as Chief Counsel) filed its Second Amended Complaint against the United States, the IRS, and a legion of IRS officials. This Complaint, in which we represent 41 organizations in 22 states, presents perhaps the most complete story yet of the IRS conservative targeting scandal.
They spent this money in order to get the government off their backs and to show the American people what they could do with that new-won freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people. In 2008, the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly destroyed the U.S. and global economy.
Levine is quick to point out that his calculators are meant to complement, not replace, the net price calculators that colleges have been required to post online since 2011. But the net price calculators are often cumbersome. Levine and other experts say many users, facing a slew of complicated questions about tax returns, assets and home equity, fail to take advantage of them.
CHARLIE ROSE: What do you admire about Ted Williams?
last several years. We've worked closely with President Trump on issues
Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., the co-chair of the moderate House Problem Solvers Caucus, told reporters Wednesday that the inclusion of the minimum wage increase could make the package seem like it was contaminated by partisans who wanted to use it as a vehicle to legislate on things that are not related directly to the crisis.
But the reporter persists, and eventually the man agrees to share his story. But wherever we wind up, in whatever amount, I think we'll exit riding some force to show us out, the engineer tells the reporter. Death is room-temperature. It has no mass but is a Fact. And nothing's out to torture us except certain other people. No hidden meanness is waiting to trap us.
All day, Vaccaro has been in meetings discussing the decision.
Castro, Karl Marx. And Georgians need to know who he is, because he is out
LIASSON: Well, we're looking forward to what he has to say about this because he really personifies the total reversal by Republicans about deficit spending. They've done a 180-degree turn on this. Most economists say what they just did was fiscally irresponsible, exactly the opposite of what you want to do when the economy is booming, and there's low unemployment. You would rather run a small deficit or a surplus, so you have some room to spend if the economy does go into a recession, which - most economists think it will in the next couple of years because this expansion is getting so old. But instead, Republicans passed a tax cut that adds $1.5 trillion dollars to the deficit. Now the spending bill treasury just announced it's going to issue almost a trillion dollars of new debt next year. That's an 84 percent increase.
Big picture, nothing has changed. We're getting more confirmation, the public is getting educated, putting faces on these people and learning what, indeed -- how unprecedented that a president would use his office in this manner to get political advantage over his potential opponent.
Moving our resources to greater markets is a greater priority, not just for Albertans, but for Canadians, and we are going to do that in a responsible way, he said.
Also, while this won't impact many families, the 4x return at US supermarkets is capped at $25,000 per calendar year with the Gold Card. If you spend more than that on groceries in a year, you'll earn just 1 point per dollar after that.
Warnock has already proven he will be attentive to radicals and those in the Black community who agree with him (but not those who disagree with him). However, since Warnock describes people who want to cut taxes as baby killers in the tradition of King Herod, it is difficult to see how he can serve the majority of Georgians, who prefer lower taxes to higher taxes.
He added that Congress will have future opportunities to address the long-term impact of the coronavirus crisis when it writes regular annual spending bills later in the year.
Right now, you can find discounts on software from the two top tax preparation providers through Amazon. These are the same price drops we saw last year, and frankly, we think they're still just as awesome. Unless you have the simplest taxes, the free online filing services TurboTax and H&R Block offer are not robust enough to help you get the biggest refund you're entitled to.
On Tuesday, police announced that a 28-year-old Arab-Israeli man from the northern city of Umm al-Fahm is to be indicted for arson.
So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post, President Trump declared. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands! Trump was referring to reports in the National Enquirer about Bezos' alleged affair.
DOOCY: Warnock argues recent allegations are irrelevant.
GROSS: Did any of the, like, food restaurant bar kind of jobs you have have a theatrical aspect to it, like a piano bar or anything like that?
Corolla: A group that manages herds of wild horses on the state's coast is warning drivers to watch out for the animals taking advantage of unseasonably warm weather by sleeping on the sand at night. Temperatures in the 60s and 70s across the Carolinas have the wild horses acting more like it's June, not January, the Corolla Wild Horse Fund said in a message posted to social media. The pleasant weather has coaxed the animals out of the islands' forests, where they usually shelter from cold winter winds, and into the path of recreational vehicles, The News & Observer reports. Daniel T. Myers III was driving on Corova Beach over the weekend when he spotted the horses in the dark. He told McClatchy News Group the animals are very hard to see and warned others to keep an eye out. Crashes are one of the leading causes of death among the Outer Banks herds, the newspaper says.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: You are unaware of any factual basis for his accusations against Ambassador Yovanovitch. Right?
Barrientos and others are now saying the focus of diabetes prevention in Mexico needs to shift away from shaming individuals to looking at new government policies to tackle this mounting health crisis.
Can I just tell you? Of all the people I have ever met, let alone public figures I have ever met, he might be one of the few I can think of as colorblind. And I mean that in a good way. Not blind in the sense of a convenient indifference to other people's real-life circumstances, but a real lack of interest in race — or class or status, for that matter — as a determining factor in his opinions about people.
In light of the urgent humanitarian and security crisis on our border, the president is requesting $5.7 billion for physical barriers and border security, McConnell said. For some context, that is just about one tenth of one percent of federal spending. One tenth of one percent -- for physical barriers like the fences and barriers which already exist, which Democrats have previously voted for with enthusiasm.
Those who followed these events in real time may feel as if they are being dragged back through nightmares they would rather forget. At the same time, for those who have not been as focused on the daily and weekly ups and downs, this catalog may come with the force of revelation. For that reason alone, it is highly valuable.
Pelosi's focus on a technological wall of sensors and drones helps the Democrats hide their push for more migration, despite its impact on Americans' wages, productivity, tax spending, crime, and civic peace, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.
LOEFFLER: Well, look, I voted to support the NDAA. The bill that came out
Yet, according to legal experts, no president has ever pardoned someone for illegal immigration during the nation's 245-year history. Presidential pardons historically have addressed criminal violations; entering or being in the country unlawfully is a civil offense unless it's a repeat violation.
These are the kinds of changes that allow us to move out of the era of fossil fuels and the era of the automobile and into a green future as part of our commitment to the New York City Green New Deal, de Blasio said.

That's about the amount of tax revenue Microsoft is not paying because it has stashed $108 billion in profits offshore. As revealed in a Seattle Times report last month, Microsoft uses a web of overseas subsidiaries to dodge U.S. taxes, knocking its tax rate down to a minuscule 4.5 per cent on its offshore profits. That's lower than most working families pay.

By contrast, if you have decades to go before you need to tap your retirement assets, then investing your IRA in more aggressive investments can produce the best returns over the long run.
The president shapes the public character of the nation. Trump's character falls short. That is a quote, an excerpt. Actually, the headline of a scathing new Washington Post op-ed by Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate praised President Trump's tax cuts and his hard line on China. But the gist of this op-ed is a moral and ethical takedown of the president of the United States by a new senator from his own party. This comes as Trump meets with congressional leaders today to talk about border security and presumably come up with a plan to end the partial government shutdown.
They have to make it sound like they are for some kind of enforcement, and so what they say they are in favor of is 'smarter enforcement,' just like the [Barack] Obama administration used to say their ICE strategy of 'prosecutorial prioritization' was really 'smarter enforcement,' she said.
JOHN DELANEY: Capital has left this region. That doesn't mean people don't invest here. They do. But the owners of that capital are often not located here anymore like they used to be.
Of course, the partial government shutdown now in its third week is consuming all the oxygen in the room right now. But advocates say they're still betting lawmakers will come together on an issue that troubles 80 percent of Americans.
It's important to reopen the doors of the Church, to let the people who sometimes come once in their life to visit this holy place, he said. Because a holy place without people is nothing ... only the stones.
So with all this, whom do you think China's rooting for in November? Do they want the current president who's forced them to make concessions on trade, the one who slapped tariffs on them or would they want the guy who will basically give them everything they want?
The first presidential press conference happened by accident
The prices have fallen down to a level that leaves very little capital for exploration in these companies, Myers says. So that's one of the biggest negatives.
Secret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said a Secret Service pin bearing the U.S. flag is a novelty item and is not used by the Secret Service as a means of identification, verification or access control. She declined to discuss what kind of pins agents may have provided Morales.
CNN's Erica Orden is following all of this. Erica -- let's start with Michael Flynn. This was a fascinating moment because both sides, the Flynn legal team and the Mueller legal team had said that Michael Flynn deserves no jail time because of his extensive cooperation. Now we see the Mueller coming out swinging saying that Michael Flynn's version of the facts is untrue and he should have known that lying to federal investigators is against the law.
MCCAIN: I wanted to ask you. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She was on 60 Minutes this weekend proudly calling herself a radical. And she's promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car should be eliminated within the next eleven years. Everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly and this ideology of the socialist left could splinter your party?

Between 2016 and 2018, GM attempted to outsource nearly 700 American jobs in Warren, Michigan, to foreign workers brought in on the H-1B visa. The corporation also tried to outsource 167 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign workers in Detroit, Michigan, another 154 U.S. jobs in Milford, Michigan, an additional 82 U.S. jobs in Pontiac, Michigan, and about 20 U.S. jobs in Roswell, Georgia.

Once you get to the tippie-tops, on your $10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60% or 70%. That doesn't mean all $10 million dollars are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more, Ocasio-Cortez said.

Hockessin: A local temple is now home to a statue of a Hindu god said to be the tallest in the country. Hundreds of people celebrated the arrival of the 25-foot granite statue of the Hindu god Hanuman on Saturday morning at a temple in Hockessin. A welcome ceremony was held after a truck delivered the 60,000-pound statue. Across India, Lord Hanuman is often enshrined and worshipped in the form of a towering statue, and we are proud to bring that tradition to Delaware, says Patibanda Sarma, president of the Hindu Temple Association. Organizers of the effort to bring the statue to Delaware had said it would be the tallest statue of a Hindu god carved out of a single piece of stone in the United States. Sculptors in India spent about a year carving it.

Why The Difference In Tax Credits Matters So Much
REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I think that that's accurate. Obviously, no one wants it, the President doesn't want it. Mick doesn't want it. I don't want it. At-- at the same time what we're seeing with these negotiations going on-- I-- I don't know that they're real serious about reaching a compromise. I mean, they've met twice in-- in almost two weeks now.
The Treasury chief's remarks came a day after some Democrats in Congress urged the IRS to consider a filing delay given the possibility of disruption from the outbreak.
According to a new review by the Chicago Tribune, the massive debt isn't necessarily crushing the state's schools, because the state legislature has passed laws to give schools the power to keep borrowing no matter what, so there is no incentive for the schools to mind budgets. According to the paper, the debt has accrued due to special deals in Springfield that have given districts exemptions so they can keep borrowing beyond limits set by law.

The opposite is true. Republicans made clear this week they will not support even emergency economic relief from a Democratic president. Democrats will have no choice but to go it alone, and passing a popular bill will not hurt their ability to pass additional popular measures in the coming months. The economic growth enabled by Biden's COVID-19-relief bill will not crowd out other investments, but produce an expanding economy in which more investments are possible. His next bill to reform the mangled international trade system and update American infrastructure must be every bit as ambitious as his COVID-19 relief legislation, and Biden stated emphatically last month that it would be.
My mother used to say it will all work out in the wash, he told me Tuesday. And I'm sure it will.
China sacrifices a province to save the world from coronavirus. And this one. The U.S. charges a leading nanoscientist with lying about his work with the Thousand Talents program. Will China's most brilliant minds balk at coming to America? So you get the idea.

It's important not to make this transactional and ask them for a job, which may turn people off in a first encounter. Rather, you're asking them for information and actionable advice. Once you have a lot of these conversations, you'll start to notice patterns in these career paths, and in the meantime, you'll build relationships that could eventually lead to a referral, Hernandez said.
One of the few dissents from this new consensus is Larry Summers, the principal economic architect of the Obama stimulus who only a few months ago was among the chorus of economists urging President Joe Biden to go big. But Summers abruptly changed course on Thursday, arguing in The Washington Post that Biden's agenda risked inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, along with consequences for the dollar and financial stability ― in other words, another crash.

I mean all kinds of things, a world war coming on. But this country, it moves ahead.

On August 9, 2010 the president warned of attack ads run by shadowy groups with harmless-sounding names during his weekly radio address. The President said: We don't know who's behind these ads and we don't know who's paying for them . . . you don't know if it's a foreign controlled corporation. ... The only people who don't want to disclose the truth are people with something to hide.

What I think is taking place is the 10-year Treasury break-even rate has exceeded 2% for the first time in more than two years, said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist, Capitol Securities Management, pointing to the closely watched gauge of what holders of Treasury inflation-protected securities anticipate inflation will average over the next decade.

Joining me here now, Senator Kelly Loeffler.
While the included credits are worth almost as much as the annual fee each year, they take a bit of strategy to use. The credits are capped at $10 per month, so you can't just use them in one fell swoop. Plus, the list of eligible restaurants is small. If you live in an urban area where Grubhub and Seamless are available, utilizing this credit becomes easier. But if you don't, maximizing the dining credit can be a challenge.
The tour guide companies – smaller than the major cruise corporations investing in Cuba, for example – have expressed a willingness to serve Americans with North Korea tours if Trump repeals the current ban. On its website, Koryo Tours states, as and when this travel ban is lifted, we would be more than happy to take you [Americans] to the DPRK (North Korea), and share our experience and knowledge there with you.
Oh, & 2 big caveats about comparing this CWSto the prior one: reasonable to think that contingent work is seasonal, so that will explain some of the difference between Feb 2005 and May 2017. Also those 2 months very well might not be apples-to-apples in the business cycle either — Ernie Tedeschi (@ernietedeschi) June 7, 2018
In the meantime, workers can make their own calculations to see if they'll owe money. Unemployment benefits are subject only to federal income tax paid at income-tax rates (not Social Security or Medicare taxes that are taken out of employer paychecks.) People living in states without an income tax or in select states that don't tax such benefits — including Alabama, California, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia — don't need to worry, said Robbin Caruso, a partner in the tax practice at Prager Metis.
Five of those requests involved potential school shootings, he said. Maryland judges approved around half of the requested seizures after evidentiary hearings, Popkin said.

He answered, President Donald Trump is a man of his word. … [H]e decided, the day after the election Bret, that that number one priority, the first priority of the Congress when they came back, is to keep his word to repeal and replace Obamacare. And we're going to make sure it happens.
In an interview after the event, Thompson praised Warren: She understands intersectionality. For too long, marginalized people have been placed on the back burner. But he also said he was under no illusion about how much demand voters in New Hampshire, the third-whitest state in the union, might have for racial justice.
If confirmed, Garland would confront immediate challenges, including an ongoing criminal tax investigation into Biden's son, Hunter, as well as calls from many Democrats to pursue inquiries into Trump after he leaves office. A special counsel investigation into the origins of the Russia probe also remains open, forcing a new attorney general to decide how to handle it and what to make public.

Biden signed the executive order despite consistent polling that shows Americans share bipartisan unity on barring taxpayer funding of abortion both within the United States and abroad.
Wright favors high-quality companies, based on factors that include financial strength, and consistent dividend and earnings growth.

Matteo Lieb, who works on employment policy and programs at the National Down Syndrome Society, said employers often treat hiring people with disabilities as an act of philanthropy. It should be about snagging the best talent, he said.
Biden does owe a lot to young people. But it's not just repaying us for helping him to get elected, it's making sure that he actually is working with us, said Charlotte Kerpen, the chair of the High School Democrats of America. For Biden to have a group of young people that he can really consult to, would make sure that the policies are not only reflecting the beliefs of young people, but are helping to make sure that in the future, the policies are representing what we have always believed. 
It is vitally important that the American people understand how President Trumps unethical demand that Ukraine deliver a politically- motivated investigation in exchange for military assistance created a security risk for our, the United States of America, national security. The president was not just playing a political game by upholding military aid and meetings with Ukraine, threatening the hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance that Congress had appropriated has real-life consequences for Ukraine and for the USA.
Orphan drugs are among the most expensive in this country, in part because they are shielded from from generic competition for longer than other prescription medicines.
And you know, I'm going to say this to President Trump, you want to investigate Joe Biden, you want to investigate Hunter Biden, go at it. Do it. Do it hard. Do it dirty. Do it the way you do do it. Just don't do it by asking a foreign leader to help you in your campaign. That's your job, it's not his.
Finally, it's worth mentioning that Membership Rewards points take some studying and effort to really maximize. Managing transfer partners and dealing with dynamic award charts may feel like too much work for many, and you can't easily transfer Amex points to friends who may view this as a hobby. If you're looking for travel rewards that are easier to redeem, you'll likely want to pick a card like the Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card or Chase Sapphire Preferred Card as an alternative.
On the flip side, if you're habitually late with your payment, or you have unpaid utility bills, then the utility may not hesitate to turn your account over to a collection agency. Having an account sent to a collection agency can show up on your credit report for years, and it can adversely impact your credit score.
Presidential candidates typically don't release their tax returns until they've become their party's nominee. President Trump broke tradition and refused to make his tax returns public. As Democrats have continued to make that a political issue, the majority of the 2020 field have made their own financial information public. Biden's campaign points out that he's now disclosed the last 21 years of tax returns, including disclosures during his 2008 run and time as vice president.
David -- a point that I have been trying to get at with some of our guests is --

Biden signed the bill Thursday, securing the first major legislative accomplishment of his term. The legislation includes direct payments, which Biden said would begin to go out as soon as this weekend, extended unemployment benefits and an expanded child tax credit.

House Democrats promised to tackle the issue of gun control with their new majority. The new Democrat-controlled House will almost certainly be able to muster the votes to pass a gun-control measure that expands background checks, Karoun writes. The measure may even pull along some Republican support. … But it remains unclear whether such legislation could clear procedural hurdles in the Senate, which remains under Republican control. The closest that the Senate has come to passing gun-control legislation expanding background checks was in 2013, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, when 56 senators rallied behind a measure — four votes shy of what they needed to clear procedural hurdles.
The Trump foundation has been accused of using its assets to pay debts incurred by Trump and his businesses over the past decade. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating the foundation.
Millions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes and their life savings.
States could also limit access to certain medications, or eliminate Medicaid's retroactive eligibility standard that covers recent medical expenses accumulated by new enrollees prior to signing up, or impose asset tests that block benefits for people who own homes or cars or other property, regardless how low their incomes are. That would be especially burdensome on newly jobless people, who still possess their assets but no longer have incomes.

Still, unless changes are made to the bill, more than 60 million Americans would be ineligible for the two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of family and medical leave it offers for those impacted by the global pandemic. That's because larger companies, those with 500 or more employers, are exempt from the proposal's provisions.
And all these things work in tandem to create troubling cases and troubling outcomes. It's not that the government should never be able to cut a deal.

This week is not the first time Trump used presidential trips to spend time at his own properties, even though it added considerable travel and security costs for taxpayers. In 2018, for example, he spent two days between official meetings in London and a Helsinki summit with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin at his own resort in Scotland, rather than waiting in London. And last summer, he insisted on staying at his resort on the west coast of Ireland on the days surrounding his visit to Normandy, France, even though it required several additional hours on Air Force One.

I don't know if there is anything Italy can do.
Independent contractors earned slightly less than traditional workers, while temp workers and on-call workers made significantly less money.

The reality is that a person that was hired as a laborer in 1988, I paid $15 an hour and within a month if I could leave him on the job alone, he got $20 an hour. If I hired somebody that already knew how to do certain types of labor or certain types of operations, they would get $20 an hour. Now, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. They can't go lower than the minimum wage. And much of that, if they're not being paid by the hour at less than $11 an hour, they're being paid per piece — per piece of plywood that's installed, per piece of drywall that's installed. Now, the subcontractor can circumvent paying them as an hourly wage and are now being paid by 1099, which means that no taxes are being taken out.
Newsom is set to propose the policy and include it in his budget after his swearing in on Monday, the New York Times's Claire Cain Miller and Jim Tankersley report.

His alternative proposal, SB 96, would cap the number of individuals who would qualify for Medicaid, add work requirements and lower the annual income limit. Prop. 3 supporters had wanted the coverage available for people who made up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000 a year. But Christensen's bill would offer Medicaid coverage only to people who made less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $12,000 for an individual.

He also cut his Carmike Cinemas Inc. US:CKEC price target to $27 from $32, but also maintained an outperform rating. Carmike, which has about 2,800 screens, generally in midsize communities, has the greatest upside of any other exhibitor from either buying another company or being bought, he said. The theater chain will also likely outperform peers as it institutes a tax-on-top pricing strategy — essentially a stealthy way to increase ticket and concession prices. Rather than an all-inclusive price of, for example, $5 for popcorn, the price would stay the same but no longer include tax. Kulp said AMC benefited from a similar strategy last year.

But that gain was wiped out on Wednesday, as investors sold stocks despite extreme government intervention aimed at cushioning the economy against a coronavirus-fueled recession.

Sales of variable annuities, which are tax-deferred and often used to save for retirement, have ballooned in recent years. They're contracts with investors in which the company selling them agrees to make periodic payments to the investor. The periodic payouts change depending on the performance of the mutual funds, bonds or other investments linked to the annuities.
So obviously, when it came to launching a mad plan with zero chance of success solely to benefit himself, Trump turned to the weakest members of society, the very people whom he had used to get elected and then betrayed.

And there's a trickle-down effect to that: You have a difference of $500,000 here, $1 million there (in the cost of paying a coach and the excise tax) and that can be the difference in being able to go after the best coordinator in the game or hiring a football staff full of analysts as some schools have done, or installing a camera system in your gym to help the basketball teams with video study, or putting WiFi in your stadium.

The federal loan program has a surprising number of generous provisions if you're sick, disabled or can't pay back your loan. Federal student loans offer significant benefits that aren't standard with mortgages, such as death and disability discharges, economic hardship deferments, forbearances, income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness options, said Kantrowitz. The tax treatment may be less favorable. The traditional wisdom over the years has been to favor mortgage debt over other kinds of credit because home-related debt is tax deductible. However, Kantrowitz pointed out: There's a deduction for mortgage interest, but you must itemize (most taxpayers don't). The student loan interest deduction, on the other hand, lets you deduct up to $2,500 in interest on federal and private student loans. It's an 'above-the-line' exclusion from income, so you can claim it even if you don't itemize. It also reduces the [adjusted gross income], which may have other benefits.
SWERDLICK: Yes. No -- I think we're going to -- it's a little bit of a wait and see.

The statement that Gunnels highlighted reflects a common Biden argument from the 2020 campaign: that Republicans pushed a tax cut whose benefits are tilted to corporations and the wealthiest Americans, knowing it would balloon the deficits, so the GOP could then justify cutting Social Security and Medicare.

●Understand assessment ratios. Some jurisdictions tax your house based on 100 percent of its value, but others assign a lower assessment ratio, such as 60 percent. This means a house with a market value of $100,000 would have an assessed value of $60,000. If you see a number that's lower than your home's true value, check the assessment ratio before assuming you don't have a case. You can find that ratio on your actual tax assessment notice or on the assessor's office website.

Concord: Animals are on the agenda at the Statehouse with bills aimed at both protecting and pursuing them. Lawmakers have filed at least a dozen bills this session focused on wildlife or domesticated animals, including measures to ban the declawing of cats and docking of dog tails. Both bills have public hearings Thursday. Three bills before a House committee Tuesday were about killing other species. One would repeal a prohibition on hunting with ferrets; another would create a new safari hunting license for those taking elk and boar at a private game reserve; and a third would lower the bar for killing animals that damage crops or other property. Current law allows someone to kill wild animals that cause actual and substantial damage, but a bill sponsored by Rep. Howard Pearl, R-Loudon, would remove the and substantial language. He said requiring substantial damage was too subjective.
Many jurisdictions criminalize their traffic offenses. Even though we don't typically think of speeding as a crime, 25 states define speeding as a misdemeanor. Sometimes people go to jail for these offenses, more often they don't, at least not right away. And so it's a whole world of low-level petty offenses, criminalizing low-level conduct, imposing punishments that are relatively light compared to the kinds of felony sentences that we've become accustomed to.

Even more encouraging, the financial benefits of enrolling international students extend beyond the campus itself. A research study just released by the Brookings Institution analyzed 16 regions and concluded that in areas that would otherwise likely face economic hardship as a result of industrial job loss, colleges and universities act as an antidote, anchoring tax revenue, a wide variety of jobs, and often supporting industries that benefit from an educated and young workforce.

The Dec. 27 obituary for George Blake, British spy divulged secrets to Soviets, did a good job capturing the remarkable life of one of the Cold War's most dangerous spies. However, the article mistakenly reported that the famed Berlin tunnel — the 1950s CIA and MI6 operation tapping Red Army communications in East Berlin that was betrayed by Blake — produced no worthwhile intelligence and that the Soviets used the phone lines for . . . disinformation. In fact, the consensus now among intelligence historians is that the information captured by the tunnel was valuable and that the KGB likely did not plant false information on the tapped lines. The sheer volume of intercepted phone calls and teletype messages — some 90,000 over 11 months — speaks to the improbability of a disinformation campaign.
●Look for errors on your property work sheet. Contact your tax assessor's office and request the internal notes and data the assessor used when setting a value for your property. Different jurisdictions call this paperwork different things, including property work sheet and property card. What you're requesting are the internal notes and data the assessor used when setting a value for your property. Study these documents, checking for lot size, house age and dimensions, number of bedrooms and baths, most recent purchase price, and anything else that could affect your home's value. If you find mistakes that make your property seem more valuable than it is, that is strong ammunition. This is the tactic the Greens used when they pointed out that their house had two bedrooms, not three.

Anchorage: State health officials plan to launch a live phone service for residents trying to schedule vaccination appointments. The state currently provides an answering service through which residents seeking appointments can only leave messages, Alaska Public Media reports. The hotline will become available in anticipation of a February shipment of COVID-19 vaccine from the federal government, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's administration said Monday. Tessa Walker Linderman of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services said more than 40 staff members will answer calls from people wanting to book appointments. Many of the workers were previously tasked with tracing the contacts of people who were infected with the coronavirus. A decrease in the number of new cases has allowed those employees to shift to the hotline, Walker Linderman said. Callers may still have to wait, but the system should allow personal interaction within reasonable amounts of time rather than automatically requiring residents to wait for return calls. New appointment openings are expected to be added to the state's vaccine website starting Thursday, officials said.

Fort Collins: The state Department of Public Safety announced Monday that it will scale back proactive investigation of mysterious drone sightings that have perplexed residents since late last year. The department has confirmed no incidents of criminal activity, and investigations have not substantiated reports of suspicious or illegal drone activity, according to a report released Monday. Beginning before the holidays, the drones – which were initially spotted traveling in grid-like formations – were reported to be seen flying at high altitudes from about 7 to 10 p.m. in northeastern Colorado, as well as in southwestern Nebraska, according to the Denver Post. The FAA, 25 other government agencies and private companies, including Amazon, claimed to know nothing about the initial sightings in northeastern Colorado, according to a list compiled by 9News.

She described herself as pro-choice on abortion rights and – asked if she considers herself a feminist – said, My mother always told me to do my best, to think my best and to do right, and to consider myself a person. Women's rights groups expressed delight with the selection of a woman who Women's Legal Defense Fund President Judith L. Lichtman described as a stellar attorney with an extraordinary track record. The lesson of the agonizing nomination process, said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center, is that there are superb women as well as men who can serve the country with distinction and having someone like Janet Reno in charge of the Justice Department is a wonderful step forward. But the American Family Association of Florida, a conservative Christian group, said it would oppose Reno's nomination because of what it called her deplorable record on prosecuting pornography cases. Since Reno took office, said organization President David Caton, Dade County has become stomping grounds for pornographers. In turning to Reno, Clinton departed from the practice of most presidents who choose either close advisers or nationally known figures. Clinton said he settled on Reno – whose extensive criminal law background also distinguishes her – because he wanted someone with management as well as legal experience, and who had dealt with a wide range of real-world problems. He said he had known of Reno for some time because his brother-in-law Hugh Rodham is a public defender in the drug court that Reno established.

KCUR reports that Planned Parenthood's affiliates in Overland Park, Kansas, appealed Missouri's cutoff of their fiscal 2020 funding last week in Jackson County, Missouri, after an administrative law judge ruled against them last month. Meanwhile, an appeal of the cutoff of 2019 funding is pending before the Missouri Supreme Court. It's kind of a continuation of the same old song and dance, said Charles Hatfield, Planned Parenthood's attorney. Republican lawmakers in Missouri have for years sought to stop any taxpayer money from going to Planned Parenthood, even clinics that do not provide abortions. But legislators struggled with loopholes that allowed Planned Parenthood clinics that provide other health care to continue receiving funding.

First rebate checks sent to taxpayers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government mailed out nearly 8 million tax rebate checks Friday, the first wave of about 92 million checks that will be sent out in the next 10 weeks. The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri. Friday.

And so, to some extent, I think it does give us a-- a preview and gives the Democratic Party a preview of the pitfalls of zero tolerance, and also the kind of traps of saying we're going to hold ourselves to a higher standard than-- than President Trump or-- or his party.

Eventually you will be maxing out your contributions, without feeing too much pain in any one year.

Montgomery Public Schools continue to claim about half of county spending. The 159,000-student system would receive $2.3 billion under Leggett's proposal, about $25 million over state-mandated funding levels. That is significantly less than last year's increase, which was nearly $90 million more than the state minimum. Montgomery College would receive $2 million over state requirements, bringing its annual operating budget to $309 million.

Cheyenne: A new supercomputer in the state will rank among the world's fastest and help study phenomena including climate change, severe weather, wildfires and solar flares. Hewlett Packard Enterprise won a bid to provide the $35 million to $40 million machine for a supercomputing center in Cheyenne, the National Center for Atmospheric Research announced Wednesday. The HPE-Cray EX supercomputer will theoretically be able to perform almost 20 quadrillion calculations per second – 3.5 times faster than the existing machine at the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center. The new machine's maximum speed per second will be roughly equivalent to each person on Earth completing a math equation every second for an entire month. That power will enable some of the most sophisticated simulations yet of large-scale natural and human-influenced events. It will support basic research in ways that will lead to more detailed and useful predictions of the world around us, thereby helping to make our society more resilient to increasingly costly disasters and contributing to improved human health and well-being, center Director Everette Joseph said in a news release. A contest among Wyoming schoolchildren will decide the new supercomputer's name.

In fact, in a poll just released by Students for Life of America's Institute for Pro-Life Advancement from the polling company, inc./WomanTrend, we found that 54 percent of Millennials surveyed opposed abortion as a form of contraception or when a mother doesn't like the sex of the baby.
The rise in inequality is widening at an alarming rate. Top 1 percent controlling 95 percent of the overall wealth is causing the rest of Americans to head to the poor house. America's financial elite has put a stranglehold on American citizens to the point of determining the quality of their life (or lack of it). They are effectively controlling the country's economic and political agenda through their powerful lobbies and monetary contributions to politicians and decision makers of their choice.
The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said HHS's decision is shameful, illegal and immoral, and that it allows a government funded foster care agency to openly discriminate against Jews, gay couples and others who don't follow their faith.

Research shows that hiring disabled workers benefits firms' bottom lines. A 2018 report from Accenture, which analyzed the disability protocols and financial performance of 140 companies, found that firms with the best practices saw 28 percent higher revenue, double the net income and 30 percent higher profit margins, on average, over a four-year period.
If you had to pay the licensing fee, it wouldn't necessarily be cost prohibitive, Mark explained. But with the taxes, your clientele is going to disappear. A lot of people would just balk at paying that.
But then again, the candidates weren't giving any of their fellow competitors a free pass either. Warren went after just about everyone on stage — twice over. Buttigieg seemed to have it out for Sanders and Klobuchar. And Biden and Sanders took their turns punching at Bloomberg, like the rest of them.

The math is unforgiving, Samaras said. Infrastructure lasts for a long time and a…plant can run for 30, 40, 50, even longer — 60 years. If we think about a budget that Pennsylvania can use, each new fossil (fuel) infrastructure asset is going to use up some of that budget.

Debate on the bill went until nearly 1 a.m. on Saturday.
Trump is quoted saying to Modi at one point: It's not as though you have China right on your border... We are told this prompted Tillerson to cover part of his face with one hand so as to signal something to Modi without Trump seeing it. (For the record, India's 2,500-mile border with China is more than 500 miles longer than the U.S. border with Mexico.)
Berkshire set up operations in India when Buffett visited in 2011, selling insurance online in a partnership with Indian firm Bajaj Allianz. But Buffett's firm reportedly exited that partnership two years later, citing excessive regulation.
I've seen it time and time again, where either someone's been doing their own tax return or they have a friend do it. No one has asked them about being able to set up a Roth IRA. No one's talked to them about what it means to maximize 401(k) contributions. No one is telling them that maybe it's time to make estimated tax payments, she says. Two or three points that they recommend could be life-changing.
1) For an annuity to make sense, you should ideally have saved up in excess of $500,000 in today's dollars for retirement. That's because $250,000 is the amount a couple retiring today should have ready for out-of-pocket medical expenses, even if they are on Medicare, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute and NetBenefits. The other $250,000 is a cushion for other things that might come up.
In my view, the goal of Wall Street -- under the guise of managing your money -- is to maximize the transfer of your assets to itself and to avoid regulation that would hinder its attempt to do so. It succeeds in these efforts through massive contributions to congressional campaigns. In 2014, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), a securities industry trade group, was the top contributor on Wall Street to these campaigns, investing more than $7.4 million.
Reynolds has been representing himself. In a Wednesday filing, he argued that one year of probation would be an appropriate sentence. Prosecutors argued earlier that he deserves at least two years behind bars because he had flouted the law for so long. The maximum sentence is four years in prison.

When asked about objections to the repeal and replace in three phases, Pence responded, I think they can count on President Trump's going to be a man of his word. And the president made a commitment to not only repeal Obamacare, but to replace it with the kind of reforms that would allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines, the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance, and by giving states the flexibility to implement reforms in Medicaid a little bit like we did in the state of Indiana, where those programs will better serve our most vulnerable citizens.

The citizenship-for-sale program has strong supporters in both parties, including from New York's Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer and Texas' GOP Sen. John Cornyn.
Garland will take over a Justice Department that Trump sought to weaponize against his political opponents and use as his personal law firm. Trump has fired or pushed out a number of key department officials, most famously former FBI Director James Comey. Trump appointees have used the Justice Department's power in an overtly political fashion, even if they've resisted Trump's desire to wield the department's prosecutorial power as a blunt political weapon.

According to the National Taxpayers Union, less than 5 percent of homeowners do what the Greens did, even though the union estimates that between 30 and 60 percent of properties in the United States are over-assessed. The vast majority of assessors are not malicious or careless; they are simply making judgment calls about how to utilize limited resources in tackling a big job, said Pete Sepp, the union's president. Homeowners shouldn't take it personally, but they shouldn't assume the government is right, either. Sepp says that when well-prepared homeowners take the time to appeal, most win at least a partial victory. Here's how to improve your chances of being one of the winners:

Beginning late last summer and early fall, our economy, especially the manufacturing sector, began slowing, he said. The combination of this tax relief and lower interest rates should help get it moving again. Not everyone will get a rebate check. Those who did not file a return last year, those who had no taxable income and those who can be claimed as dependents on someone else's tax return will not qualify. The amount of some taxpayers' checks may be smaller, too, if they owe any back taxes, child support payments or federal loan payments. The government will deduct those debts from rebate checks before sending them. So how will you spend your rebate check, if you're getting one? About 47 percent of those questioned for a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll said they would pay bills with the money, 32 percent will save it, 17 percent will spend it and 2 percent will donate their check to charity. If you're undecided about how to spend the money, several stores are ready to help you make that crucial decision.
Part of that has come from eliminating certain full-time service positions while hiring elsewhere.
She gave the example of someone switching from the hospitality industry to logistics.

RICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER ADVISER TO BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON: Yes, so the short answer is of course. That's you know, Democrats are so intent on beating Donald Trump, I think that they would be happy to have Michael Bloomberg and indeed, they're probably thrilled to see in this Quinnipiac poll that I've seen cited repeatedly over the past few days on Fox news, Michael Bloomberg beating Donald Trump by nine points today.
Since 2010, the IRS has faced every tax season with fewer and fewer staff. This year, just over 70,000 permanent agency employees are on hand for a projected 155 million tax returns.

The ethics waivers are supposed to be public documents, but the administration so far has not released them.

American Oversight had previously filed FOIA requests.
So we have seen empirically that the law -- that it is severable. The law still works without it. Congress in its wisdom has declared that it's severable, has said, look, we're going to keep the law but remove the mandate penalty.

Chicago: Chicago Public Schools should allow students back into classrooms in no more than 100 facilities and then gradually reopen others, an organization of school principals proposed Wednesday, saying most of them doubt the nation's third-largest school district can safely handle a mass reopening. Troy LaRaviere, the president of the Chicago Principals and Administrators Association, said during a news conference that a survey revealed its members don't believe there will be enough staff at schools to safely reopen, nor enough safety supplies to guard against the spread of COVID-19. And he said the members haven't received adequate guidance from the district on how to reopen the schools that have been closed since March. We salute the district's goals, LaRaviere said in a statement. However, their plans are not realistic or safe for most of our schools. The new plan also says vaccinating teachers and other staff at the first schools to reopen should be a priority. That, LaRaviere said, would not only make the schools safer but also make teachers more willing to return to classrooms. Some special education and pre-K teachers had refused to return to in-person teaching this month.
Withholding issues can be complicated, and the calculator is designed to help employees make changes based on their financial situation, said acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter.

The union claimed Thomas Cook, Liverpool's travel partner which was chartering four flights from Liverpool John Lennon Airport to Kiev, had deliberately increased prices.
And make no mistake, the two Democratic candidates — Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — have no business representing any state in Congress. Despite the legacy media's attempts to bury any negative evidence of their checkered pasts, it's clear that both Warnock and Ossoff are wholly unqualified to be U.S. senators. Georgia voters would be right to reject their candidacies outright even if the balance of the Senate wasn't on the ballot.
The main advantage of buying annuities on a deferred basis is that you can often lock in annuity payment rates today, well before you retire, when your rates can be different. You can also buy a deferred annuity after you retire, for example, to start at age 80, after you think that you will have exhausted your other resources.

JAMELLE BOUIE (The New York Times/@jbouie): I think there are a variety of issues, I mean, with Northam and Herring in particular, there is sort of the-- this larger national reckoning with racism that's ongoing. In some-- to some extent prompted by the President and the President's sort of use of-- of racialized rhetoric and-- and racist rhetoric over his term. And I think Democrats and Virginia Democrats nationally are seeking to kind of basic (INDISTINCT) of zero tolerance for anything like that to create a contrast by saying, in our party, if you have any sort of like whiff of racism in your past or present, that kind of renders you radioactive for-- for the rest of the party. And so, I think that is kind of what is driving this. I think also there is just the element of-- it's-- it feels so old-fashioned, and I think just talking to people who are not Virginians, even talking to Virginians, sort shocked that in 2019 an entire state is facing controversies over blackface, a thing that I think many observers would have thought is in-- in our past or at least recognized as being unacceptable. And so, I think that the shock and surprise of just the circumstances of the controversy, plus the-- the way it resonates in our current national politics has come to driving a lot of-- a lot of the attention.
At the time Mexico was the leading per capita consumer of soda in the world. In regulatory filings in 2015, Coca-Cola said that the annual consumption of its beverages in Mexico was more than 600 8-ounce servings per person per year.

Frankfort: Faced with a weakening of his executive powers, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has offered an outline for potential compromises in a letter to top Republican legislative leaders. Beshear sent the letter to House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers last week, soon after vetoing a series of bills that would limit his executive authority, including in times of emergency. The governor doesn't have much leverage unless he can mobilize public support for his proposals. GOP lawmakers have the numbers to override his vetoes when they resume their session in early February. The governor has said the measures would hamper the fight to slow the spread of COVID-19. Beshear's letter said his strong preference is to hold off on legislation altering executive powers until Kentucky has overcome the pandemic. But he told the House and Senate leaders his letter was an attempt to provide a potential framework for discussion and compromise. If the General Assembly is determined – even in the midst of a deadly pandemic and in spite of our comparatively successful response – on passing legislation, then I recommend we discuss narrowly tailoring that legislation to address concerns that you raise, Beshear wrote.
According to the agency's own numbers from last November, the IRS expected to process 1.2 million electronic tax refunds and 300,000 paper refunds during its fourth working week of the year, from Friday, Jan. 18 to Thursday, Jan. 24.

Administration officials are also hitting the airwaves, with a White House official putting the tally at more than 100 national television, radio and podcast interviews since Jan. 21. This week alone, they've done some 30 local TV interviews in Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana and Colorado. This is a reprisal of Biden's campaign strategy: he traveled less due to the coronavirus, but he did a lot of local TV interviews to bring his message into voters' homes.
A few years ago, when I was self-employed and had recently had my second child, my husband went combing through my credit card statements, looking for tax deductions that I'd missed. I'm financially disorganized at the best of times, and with a baby and a toddler, I was barely even trying to keep track of my business expenses. So it's not surprising that I hadn't noticed the hundreds of dollars of weird recurring bank charges that my husband discovered.
The rapid spread of a variant of the deadly pathogen that was first reported in Britain prompted the UK prime minister on Monday to order a new national lockdown until at least mid-February. Also raising anxieties are new aggressive variants reported in South Africa, New York, Colorado and California, where Gov. Gavin Newsome has extended regional stay-at-home orders remain in place as the vaccination effort continues.
The head of the U.S. Federal Reserve -- Janet Yellen -- could give the markets a direction when she testifies before Congress for a second consecutive day starting at 10 a.m. ET.
As Blake told me when I interviewed him in 2015 for my book about the Berlin tunnel, slipping disinformation into an enormous stream of genuine communications would have been very easily spotted. Blake was one of only a handful of American and British intelligence officers who knew about the tunnel, and he would almost certainly have been exposed as a spy had the communications been doctored. Despite learning of the tunnel before it was even dug, the KGB opted to protect Blake and not warn Red Army commanders.
Waterloo: Organizers of an emergency warming shelter say they will have to close because the space doesn't meet fire code regulations. The Waterloo Warming Center opened Jan. 6 at Jubilee United Methodist Church's Freedom resource center. But after an inspection, officials noted the space didn't have a sprinkler system and ordered that the center close by Tuesday. Organizers began searching for a new location and implored city officials not to force them out of the current site until a replacement can be found. Temperatures are supposed to remain below freezing until later this week. We understand and appreciate the need for fire safety regulations, but we cannot close this location down until a new appropriate location has been secured, Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. The alternative is leaving folks out to freeze to death on our streets.
It's a lot of people with a lot of buying power, he said. You can't have a billion people and not be important to this world.
Moorhead: The city might consider requesting a state permit to remove aggressive wild turkeys after some residents complained about the birds, a police official said. Moorhead Deputy Police Chief Tory Jacobson said the police department doesn't have the skills or resources to add wildlife management to its list of responsibilities. The department, which also runs the city's animal control unit, estimates about 300 turkeys are currently roosting and walking in residential neighborhoods. Moorhead residents shared tales about living in close proximity to the wild turkeys during the department's meeting last week, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Some feel as though the turkeys are taking over. But others welcome the animals as neighbors. Brett Bernath says about 20 to 30 congregate in his backyard, leaving behind filth.
Trump's promise of a border wall was the hallmark of his first presidential campaign. In office, he tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows people brought to the U.S. as children to remain in the country, but he was largely blocked by court rulings. As part of a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry, children were separated from parents at the southern border. The administration tried to prevent most migrants from claiming political asylum and required those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico.
It is rare but not unprecedented for attorneys general to have previously served as judges. It happened in 2007 when President George W. Bush picked Michael Mukasey, a former federal judge in Manhattan, for the job. Eric Holder, President Barack Obama's first attorney general, had also previously been a Superior Court judge.
Even through UEFA, they were selling tickets for £394 ($530). That's ridiculous. That's not fair pricing. That's a tax on loyalty, a tax on passion for your football team.
Yes, the phone lines will be busy. Yes, the websites will certainly crash. There are simply vastly more Georgians that want the vaccine than can get it today.
Finally, make sure you acknowledge some of the risks that many investors neglect. Being conservative with your retirement account can minimize the risk of market losses, but being too conservative comes with the attendant risk that inflation will erode the purchasing power of your retirement nest egg and keep you from being financially secure when you retire.

Biden pitched it as the last best chance to keep deficits from undermining the economic recovery and dropping the country into another recession. He also said it would avoid having to make other significant changes in Medicare and significant changes in Social Security generally.
Torres's account, first reported by the New York Times, suggests that the presence of undocumented workers at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., was known by at least some managers. Last month, several women went public to say that they worked at the club without legal immigration status.

The decades of research on stimulus checks back up the argument that much of this is spent, which helps stimulate the economy, and sources like the Census show there is immense need for more funding despite the fitful recovery, said Claudia Sahm, an economist who has worked at the Federal Reserve and the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.
Smith's strategy is a bit of a judgment call – and one that isn't suggested by everyone. But he's going to try something different if a corrected 1099 doesn't arrive in time to file a return by April 15.
There's one exception to this rule: Independent contractors and small business owners can deduct home office costs from their business income. To qualify for the tax break, the workspace must be exclusively and regularly used as a place of business, Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert at TurboTax, told the Associated Press. That means working from the dining room table doesn't qualify.
It's also possible that farm subsidies have less influence on what we ultimately choose to eat than this study suggests. (More on that below.) So, this paper doesn't prove a cause and effect. However, this is certainly not the first time that U.S. farm policy has been implicated in the obesity epidemic.
Oh, my friends we're talking billions and billions of dollars in fees made in communist China and here's a fun little fact, Bloomberg's operations rake in more money each year from China and Hong Kong than all of the businesses of the Trump organization combined that they made in all of 2018.

Williams also said he believes the tax cuts signed into law by President Trump last month will boost the economy modestly and won't crimp growth in a couple of years by swelling the deficit and pushing up borrowing costs. That sanguine view contrasts with many economists' forecasts that the tax overhaul will serve as a drag on growth as soon as 2020.
Martin Carnoy, a professor at Stanford University who has been studying the issue for decades, terms this response to competition an accountability effect. In other words, When you announce that there's a new sheriff in town, all of a sudden everybody perks up.
Here's the problem: How does the Senate move such a measure (still unwritten) and avoid a filibuster? That requires 60 yeas. Moreover, how do Democrats advance a plan in a 50/50 Senate? The answer is budget reconciliation. It is an arcane, one-year fiscal process that curbs debate in the Senate to only 20 hours. No filibusters allowed. And it only needs 51 votes to pass.
ERIC PIERCE: If we can fix the underlying genetic defect, we have the potential to restore vision to people who never had normal vision before. It would indeed be amazing.
Mr. Biden in his American Rescue plan, calls for an additional $1,400 in stimulus checks for Americans, on top of the $600 that's already been approved, bringing the total stimulus to $2,000. Other financial aid includes expanding unemployment insurance by $100, bringing the weekly total to $400, and increasing the child tax credit to $3,000 per child.
Trump was delighted by the mob he'd unleashed on the Capitol, but according to sources, appalled by how badly dressed they were. He expressed disgust on aesthetic grounds over how 'low class' his supporters looked, one Trump adviser told New York magazine, adding, He doesn't like low-class things.
If Democrats are successful in the Georgia runoff elections on Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will have the power to enact the radical left's socialist agenda that has become mainstream in today's Democratic Party. The Green New Deal, socialized medicine with care decided by unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington, European-style taxes on American industry and workers, radical regulations that will harm small businesses, and capitulation to the Chinese Communist Party will all be on the agenda.
Then, once your essential expenses are covered with guaranteed sources of lifetime income, you would invest whatever was left over in so-called risky assets – stocks and bonds – to pay for discretionary expenses and to pay for living expenses many years from now. After all, you will want some of your investments to be safe and some to keep pace or outpace inflation, or the cost of living.
Although all votes hadn't been counted, preliminary figures showed that a vast supermajority of some 30,000 educators voted in favor of the tentative deal, therefore ending the strike and heading back to schools tomorrow, said Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of United Teachers Los Angeles.
Whether we can turn the defeat of Trump into a real American reconciliation, however, is at this point completely in the hands of the Democratic Party. What happens after November depends on who the Democrats nominate and how the victor governs.

As part of his embrace of laissez-faire capitalism, Bolsonaro has also pledged to push back against communist movements around the world. Last month, the 63-year-old former army captain called for a global coalition against communism, instead urging people to support the wide struggle for freedom, democracy, and free commerce.
In the same month in which hundreds of thousands will come to Washington D.C. to March for Life in sad memorial of the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that created a legal right to abortion, the justices may take up a case that gives them the chance to reconsider. Vice President Mike Pence cracked the door to that possibility in 2016 with the stroke of a pen in defense of women in a unique #MeToo moment.
That Trump's team didn't advance the overhaul legislation is the least surprising part of this. At the same news conference in Iowa, he proudly proclaimed that he was reticent to put together position papers — both because voters don't really care about them (fair enough) and because they would tie his hands in negotiations. Part of it, too, was obviously that the specifics of drafting legislation never appealed to him. So he has continually left the details up to his colleagues on the Hill, then has had to advocate for things that he himself didn't develop. Pun intended.
But the way this unfolded revealed that Bernieworld, which consists of everything from the senator's staff to outside groups such as Our Revolution, is not being careful enough to protect the senator from controversy. The fuse of the harassment story was lit when Arturo Carmona, a former Sanders staffer and congressional candidate, posted photos of his trip to the Sanders Institute Gathering in Vermont last month. Masha Mendieta, who in 2017 had torpedoed Carmona's own campaign by alleging that he'd sexually harassed female staffers, posted an essay on Medium asking how Carmona could have possibly remained in the senator's orbit.
Crucially, the attempt to block a no deal is, on closer scrutiny, flawed – because without an alternative, no deal is the default, no matter what Parliament says. If May's plan is voted down next week and no other plan is put forward, Britain is leaving the EU without a deal, on the starkest of terms. The May plan is more than just a plan – it is a legal withdrawal agreement with the EU.
The estimated gross commercial revenue of UEFA's European competitions – the Champions League, Europa League and Super Cup – during the 2017-18 season is approximately 2.35 billion euros ($2.78 billion), according to European football's governing body.

Such cases — when there is no obvious likely origin — are the most concerning to health officials and are a primary reason for considering widespread closures and disruptions, officials say. The goal is to limit the spread of the virus by patients who have not yet been diagnosed and quarantined.
It's been roughly five years since Piketty published Capital in the Twenty-First Century. One of the book's central arguments was that the rate of return on capital will be higher than the rate of economic growth (r>g) and, as a result, the wealthy will continue seeing their fortunes increase faster than everyone else's.
Risch said in the statement that pro-abortion groups have set their sights on exploiting loopholes and even overturning the long-standing pro-life provisions of law that have provided a solid foundation for values-based U.S. foreign assistance.

Hess said when he ran DEP from 2001-2003, funding for the agency did not depend so much on permit fees. About half of DEP's current budget relies on those fees, while just 20 percent comes from the general fund, he said. Federal funds make up the rest. In the early 2000s, permit fees, general fund dollars and federal funds each contributed about one-third.
Judith Adams, vice president at the Alabama State Port Authority, speeds visitors through warehouses of wood fiber products, steel ingots and other goods ready to ship abroad. The port is spending $47 million to boost its capacity to 500,000 containers a year from 300,000. The longer-term the goal is to triple that to 1.5 million.
That's not going to stop us from trying to get Republican members of Congress, the House and the Senate. But we believe this plan is bipartisan already because it has such support from other Republican elected officials.
For foodies, there's one other notable credit card to consider: the Capital One® Savor® Cash Rewards Credit Card. This cash back credit card has a $95 annual fee and offers unlimited 4% cash back on dining and entertainment, 2% cash back at grocery stores and 1% cash back on all other purchases. If you prefer cash back over travel points or miles, the Savor card may be the way to go — particularly if you can't easily leverage the annual credits on the Amex Gold.
Officials in suburban Henderson approved a resolution Tuesday that allows the city to move forward with a direct sale of 55 acres (22 hectares) to the Raiders for more than $6 million — half the land's appraised value. The city is using a Nevada law that allows for no-bid sales at under-market prices when they are considered to be in the public interest.
Freidman, when asked by Reuters about the report, declined in a text message to answer any questions about cooperating with prosecutors or the terms of his agreement.
The concept behind block grants and similar proposals for Medicaid is simple: Instead of open-ended federal funding to cover whatever costs the state's Medicaid beneficiaries require, the state gets a flat amount of money it must stretch over the year. And that amount is less than states get now.
As it ramps up production, local officials say 20 suppliers have already arrived in Airbus' wake, with firms like Ireland's Maas Aviation looking to put 150 people to work painting planes.
It's bare-faced greed, said Aaron Carr, founder of Housing Rights Initiative, a tenants' rights watchdog that compiled the work permit application documents and shared them with The Associated Press. The fact that the company was falsifying all these applications with the government shows a sordid attempt to avert accountability and get a rapid return on its investment.

In late January, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's in the race to become president in 2020, added a new kind of tax to the American conversation, causing anxious pacing on superyachts in every port: a wealth tax. It's a cousin of the property tax, but it encompasses all forms of wealth: cash, stocks, jewelry, thoroughbred horses, jets, everything. Warren calls the policy her Ultra-Millionaire Tax. It would impose a 2% federal tax on every dollar of a person's net worth over $50 million and an additional 1% tax on every dollar in net worth over $1 billion. Economists estimate it would hit the 75,000 richest households and raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.

Mark Dunn, associate director of admissions at Yale, said the university hopes the MyinTuition calculator will fill an information gap about college expenses. Like many other highly selective schools, Yale promises prospective students that it will meet their financial need. But Dunn acknowledged that many remain skeptical. Our sense is that until you can actually see what a need-based financial aid award would mean for your family, it's hard to honestly believe what colleges say, Dunn said. He said Yale plans to promote the MyinTuition calculator prominently as it begins outreach in coming weeks to high school juniors who would enter in 2019.

An analysis from the Tax Foundation found that those House Republican income tax brackets would provide tax cuts across the economic spectrum, but that the benefits would be much bigger for rich Americans. The top 1 percent would see their after-tax incomes grow by 5.3 percent, while people below the 80th percentile would see little change, with their incomes growing by less than 1 percent (these figures do not take into account any additional economic effects the plan would have).
It's easy to see why the story resonated so much last year with readers who were just weeks into a pandemic of their very own. In 31 pages, Gurganus spotlights the best and worst in America: the selflessness of those who put their own lives in danger to help others, and the inexplicable mean-spiritedness they're too often subjected to in return. It's a story that hits way too close to home, and Gurganus tells it beautifully, with an underlying anger that nonetheless never turns to cynicism.

Take a family of four with income of $70,000 a year, cash of $5,000, non-retirement investments of $25,000, and home equity of $25,000. If the sibling is not in college, the estimated expected family contribution for Wellesley would be $5,000 to $15,500 a year. If the sibling is in college, the family's contribution range for the women's college would be $3,000 to $9,300 a year. In addition, the calculator tells this prospective student that she would be expected to borrow $1,800 a year and earn $2,100 through a work-study program. The rest of the college's $68,000 annual expense would be covered by grants and scholarships.

Gas taxes are also largely determined by local politics, which often parallels the general attitudes towards taxation within a given state. Often the highest taxes are in the Northeast and West Coast, whereas the lowest taxes are in the Southeast and the Central United States, Green said. New York, California, and Connecticut — states with traditionally high income and real estate taxes — also have among the highest gas tax rates.
Because I believe that the mental health of our people has suffered so greatly under the stresses of COVID-19, the social justice issues that have been so painful for so many, and now with the rending of our nation over questions raised about the presidential election, I cannot support language that results in incitement of violence and risks our very existence, she added.

He is particularly upset about an idea from freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to finance the plan by introducing a marginal tax rate of up to 70 percent for the nation's wealthiest people. Doing so would have dreadful effects on the very rich, Hannity said Tuesday in an at-times nonsensical rant on his radio program.
That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more, Ocasio-Cortez said during the interview.

To protect Social Security, Biden said he would bring both parties to the table to keep the plan paying out. That would include discussing options such as upping the retirement age and raising the cap on income subject to the Social Security tax past the $97,500 it was in 2007. 'It ain't broke — it doesn't need privatization,' he said of Social Security. 'There's other ways to help savings.'

Salt Lake City: The city's school district has reopened to elementary students after increased pressure from state lawmakers and parents amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Salt Lake City School District board first voted to reopen middle schools and high schools after all teachers and staff were vaccinated, but it extended its vote to open all schools by Feb. 8, KUER-FM reports. It's a little scary with the virus still going on, said Marissa Book, who dropped off her kindergartener daughter, Vivian, at Franklin Elementary School for its first day back Monday. But they honestly need it. Salt Lake County Health Department epidemiologist Mary Hill said the schools reopened with all safety precautions and will likely continue to follow measures closely, such as closing a school if 1% of its population tests positive for the virus. The question now is whether bringing older students back to campuses will lead to an increase in social gatherings outside of the school, she said. A lot of the transmission, I don't believe, has been occurring in school, Hill said. They take off their mask, and they go to their social activities and go to each other's houses and play. And then they bring it back to school.

The case, Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, presents an interesting dilemma for the abortion industry, which actively opposes a review by the high court.

MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA - MAY 06: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. Gov. DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

But he's got a lot of work to do to regain the trust of the people of Virginia.
Concord: Businesses that have been fined for violating emergency orders during the pandemic would get their money back under a GOP-sponsored bill that went before a House committee Wednesday. Rep. Andrew Prout, R-Hudson, told the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee that eight businesses have been fined a total of $10,000 so far. His legislation would require the state to reverse any findings that businesses violated the rules, refund any fines paid, and restore any suspended or revoked permits or licenses once the state of emergency has ended. I think a lot of people feel like this all came at them fast, they don't fully understand it, and even with the best intentions, they may get caught up in this, he said. Some lawmakers on the committee questioned whether businesses were given adequate warnings. But according to the attorney general's office, all had been repeatedly reminded of the rules before facing enforcement action. For example, a general store in Loudon was warned more than 10 times that workers must wear masks, but it refused to comply and posted a sign that read: Please refer to the Constitution of the United States! We know how to wash our hands, clean surfaces and NOT cough or sneeze on people.

A winter storm system packing snow, sleet and ice is bearing down on more than 20 million people this weekend, with heavy snow expected from Denver to New York City. The storm will most likely disrupt travel in the mid-Atlantic as it settles in on Saturday night. Motorists along key Interstate highways will be hardest hit, especially the I-64 and I-70 corridors of the Plains and Midwest. For many areas, this will be a long-duration winter storm event that lasts more than 12 hours and perhaps as much as 48 hours in some cases. Most of the snow should be over for the NFL playoff game Saturday in Kansas City, and forecasts indicate New England will escape the snowy onslaught for the game in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Sunday afternoon. Several major airlines are also waiving change fees.

Senate impeachment trial returns today with Trump's defense team
In addition, Biden's nominee will have to deal with the delicate question of how to handle the ongoing tax investigation into the new president's son, Hunter Biden, which is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware. The nominee will have to reassure the American public that there won't be political interference in the probe, perhaps by walling off the investigation. Republicans, the vast majority of whom were unconcerned with Trump's repeated attempts to improperly interfere in Justice Department matters, might even call for a special counsel to assure the probe's independence.

Richmond: The mayor has tested positive for the coronavirus. Mayor Levar M. Stoney said in a statement that he was informed of his positive test result Wednesday morning. Stoney said he began to experience mild COVID-19 symptoms Monday. He is isolating at home. And the people with whom he has been in contact are quarantining and taking other precautions. He said the pandemic is far from over and must be taken seriously. Since the coronavirus first started to spread in our region roughly a year ago, over 12,000 residents in our city have been infected with COVID-19. Today, I count myself as one of them, the mayor wrote. While I do not feel 100 percent, I am thankful that my symptoms are currently manageable and will continue to work from my home to ensure the continuity of city government. The mayor's annual State of the City address has been moved from this Thursday to Feb. 11. It will be delivered virtually. I look forward to sharing with all of you my vision for moving the city boldly forward in the coming year, and beyond, Stoney said.
Thus, Trump came up with the manifestly insane idea that his vice president, Mike Pence, should refuse to certify the electoral votes.

And, with current Medicare payments already 40 percent below private payments, more hospitals would close if this payment scheme were thrust on the entire system. The current physician shortage would worsen as reimbursement rates and pay were capped to control costs. Anyone who ever lived through or read about war time rationing would see a return to the ugly side of an economy of shortages.

Some economists are skeptical that the dollar would become substantially more expensive under a border adjustment. Yet as William Cline of the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington noted, if the dollar does not increase, then foreign companies would be stuck paying the new tax on their sales to U.S. customers.
A state has payment obligations from three main sources — interest on its outstanding bonds, unfunded liabilities for pension benefits, and unfunded liabilities for health care payments to state retirees (before Medicare at age 65). The interest on outstanding state bonds is relatively easy to estimate; the total outstanding amount of all state bonds was $500 billion in 2016. With the advent of improved accounting rules, it is now possible to compute the unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities of each state.

Homelessness: The most visible change in California over the past decade has been the surge in homelessness — 16.4% in 2018 alone, which entirely accounted for the nation's overall 2.7% rise. Tent cities are becoming a common sight in the big cities, and even in rural towns. The state has done nothing to address the root causes of homelessness; it keeps offering generous welfare benefits and asking the federal government for housing money.
A Message of Discontent from Wisconsin (TIME, April 17, 1972) -- Like some metaphysical lottery, with hazards of sudden political death or prizes of resurrection, the American primary system ramshackled through Wisconsin last week to the end of its first phase -- and a pause before the next series, starting April 25, in such crucial industrial states as Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. The Wisconsin primary left the eventual outcome of the long spring campaign more enigmatic than ever, but some of the election results were startling: -- George McGovern, hitherto regarded as a one-issue antiwar champion of the liberal-left, exploited his own superb organization in the state, tapped deep wells of economic discontent and, by winning a 30% plurality, transformed himself at last into a major candidate. In Wisconsin his support was astonishingly broad, bracketing liberals, conservatives, blue- collar workers, farmers, suburbanites and the young. -- George Wallace, with the help of 35% of the G.O.P. voters who crossed over to vote Democratic, similarly appealed to a restive mood of the little man. Although he campaigned for only eight days in Wisconsin, Wallace came in second, with 22% of the vote. Adding the Wallace and McGovern totals, 52% of the voters cast ballots for anti-Establishment candidates. -- Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey, who had counted on his longtime popularity in neighboring Wisconsin to catapult him into the Democratic lead, came in third, with 21%. It was a serious, though by no means fatal blow for Humphrey, who has yet to win a presidential primary.
CHARLIE D'AGATA: Local commander Khaled Baran told us there had been a pause to let civilians leave before the final offensive, yet moments later, airstrikes in all probability from a U.S. warplane struck an ISIS position in the no man's land between the front line and the village. And then one much closer to us followed by a whizzing noise, what sounded like an incoming mortar that sent everyone scrambling. It's not clear how many ISIS militants remain holed up, but the past few days have seen an exodus of families along with some suspected ISIS fighters among them. They arrive hungry and cold to a desolate holding camp in the desert. The men separated from the women and interrogated.
Honolulu: The U.S. Navy is honoring a World War II hero in naming a new aircraft carrier for Mess Attendant 2nd Class Doris Miller. The announcement is expected to be made at Pearl Harbor on Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for valor. He was recognized for manning a machine gun on the USS West Virginia and returning fire against Japanese planes during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. USS Miller, a destroyer escort, was previously named in his honor. An African American was not allowed to man a gun in the Navy in 1941, said Doreen Ravenscroft, a team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial. Without him really knowing, he actually was a part of the civil rights movement because he changed the thinking in the Navy, Ravenscroft said. Two of Miller's nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement.

Greenville: A feature that has helped Furman University receive past honors as one of the most beautiful campuses in America has been taken away. Forty of the decades-old oak trees that lined Furman's Mall have been cut down. They'll be replaced with new species of oaks with life spans from 250 to more than 400 years: overcup, Nuttall's, scarlet and swamp white, the university says. The nearly 70-year-old trees were starting to die, and limbs were starting to fall and become hazardous, according to Clinton Colmenares, spokesman for the university. Their removal is the latest phase in a multiyear project to replace original trees with better species that live longer and are just as big, Colmenares says. Furman broke ground on its current campus in 1953. The trees along the mall were planted between 1956 and 1958, the university says.

Tallahassee: Seniors will get their second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared Tuesday, even as frustration grows nationally over spotty supplies of the life-saving medicine. Later in the day, President Joe Biden announced that states would get a roughly 16% increase in deliveries over the coming weeks, allowing more Floridians to get a shot in the arm against a disease that has killed more than 25,600 in the state. The rise in shipments translates to 307,000 first doses and 254,000 booster shots for Florida, according to the state health department. While good news for those waiting to get inoculated, it surely won't satiate the demand for the vaccine – even if the increased shipment does help ease concerns about availability for the growing number awaiting booster shots. Of the more than 1.4 million in Florida who have gotten shots, less than 11% have gotten their second dose, according to the latest records provided by the state Health Department. That means more than a million people – most of them at least 65 years old – are coming due for the second of two shots required to achieve the highest level of efficacy against the disease.

Sacramento: The state increased its efforts Friday to keep the federal government from allowing oil and gas drilling on more than 1 million acres of public land, suing to block the Trump administration from issuing new permits in the central part of the state. The federal lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management follows a new state law also intended to counter Trump administration plans to increase oil and gas production on protected public land. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued on behalf of Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration, saying the permits would allow the controversial extraction method called hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. Newsom in October signed a law barring any California leasing authority from allowing pipelines or other oil and gas infrastructure to be built on state property. Federally protected areas are adjacent to state-owned land.

Little Rock: The Republican governor on Monday defended his decision to continue accepting new refugees, challenging skeptical GOP lawmakers to avoid creating fear about welcoming people from other countries. Gov. Asa Hutchinson told a legislative committee that fewer than 50 refugees will likely be resettled in Washington County in northwestern Arkansas under his decision.

Each of you are leaders in your community. You've got a choice to make: You can create fear, or you can help resolve fear, Hutchinson told lawmakers. He introduced them to two refugees from Congo and another from Afghanistan who have resettled to Arkansas in recent years.

The movement, which waned over the holidays, appears to be resurging despite President Emmanuel Macron's promises of billions of euros in tax relief and an upcoming national debate to address demonstrators' concerns. Online groups mounted calls through the week for actions in Bourges, a provincial capital with a renowned Gothic cathedral and picturesque wood-framed houses, and the suburban Paris business district of La Defense. But authorities warned that could be a ploy to draw police away from key sites in the capital, which epitomizes the power and wealth that's the target of the provincially driven protest movement. Protesters want deeper changes to France's economy and politics, seen as favoring the rich.

There are a lot of reasons that the current fight with Congress is unwinnable for the president. He chose to make a stand on his most politically divisive proposal precisely because it is so divisive and, therefore, so important to the most vocal part of his base. But it also gives his opponents even less incentive to side with him than they might otherwise have. He has been ineffective at making his case, in part because the case he's making is the same one he has made over the entire course of his political career. He is left flailing, with no obvious way out but to fold.

Job losses can be traced to the virus surge, with restaurants and hotels hard hit. Why did job growth go into reverse? It's simple: the resurgent pandemic. As virus cases rose across the country in the fall, governors and mayors reimposed restrictions on businesses and consumers pulled back on activity. Job losses soon followed: Restaurants and bars cut 372,000 jobs in December. Hotels cut 24,000 more. Private schools and colleges cut more than 60,000. The leisure and hospitality industry was hit hard in December, while other sectors made small gains Cumulative change in jobs since before the pandemic, by industry By Ella Koeze · Seasonally adjusted · Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics It's more pandemic-induced job loss, said Nick Bunker, head of North American research for the career site Indeed. It's a really vivid demonstration that the labor market can't bounce back in any sustainable form until the pandemic is under control. Industries less exposed to the virus, on the other hand, mostly kept hiring. Manufacturers added 38,000 jobs. Construction companies added 51,000. Even retailers, hit hard in the spring but able to adapt more readily, added 120,000. Mr. Bunker said the hiring in those areas was encouraging, suggesting that the economic damage was contained and potentially allowing for a faster rebound once the pandemic was under control. But the concentration of job losses also means that low-wage workers, many of them Black or Hispanic, are again bearing the brunt of the crisis.

The recent Volkswagen TDI scandal — in which it came to light that the German manufacturer intentionally misrepresented the fuel efficiency of its diesel vehicles — highlights the importance of fuel efficiency to Americans, even in times like now, as gas prices are at a multi-year low. Much of the decrease in overall fuel economy is attributable to higher sales of pickup trucks and SUVs, cars that burn more fuel than smaller, lighter vehicles. Other extremely low efficiency luxury models continue to reach high-end buyers as well. The Bugatti Veyron gets roughly 15 miles per gallon on the highway and 8 miles per gallon in the city.

Topeka: Republican legislators suggested Tuesday that mistakes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly's administration are making it more difficult for older residents to get COVID-19 vaccines. But Dr. Lee Norman, head of the state health department and Kelly's top public health administrator, said the biggest problem Kansas faces in administering the vaccines is there's just not enough. Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature have grown increasingly critical of Kelly and the Department of Health and Environment, peppering Norman with pointed questions during Tuesday's joint meeting of the House and Senate health committees. One GOP lawmaker even argued that Kansas was wrong to focus on vaccinating health care workers first, rather than people 65 and older. I've never felt like our leadership, the Kelly administration, the KDHE, has learned lessons from this virus and adapted strategies to it, said freshman Sen. Mark Steffen, a Hutchinson Republican and a physician, who didn't wear a mask at Tuesday's socially distanced meeting and said he doubts the effectiveness of mask-wearing, despite a growing scientific consensus that masks provide protection for others as well as those wearing them.

And so this kind of black market of trading guilt and information has really undermined a lot of the integrity of the criminal system. Criminals are getting away with very serious offenses.

RAINBOW: And I would do, you know, sort of horrible DIY kind of stop motion animation. It was really bad. And then I - you know, I had a bunch of friends. I grew up doing theater.

And that's kind of how I got started in the sketch comedy world. And that's what ignited my interest there.
The American car industry is getting worse, weaker and more expensive, Gabriel told Bild on Monday. If U.S. buyers are choosing German models, as Trump suggests, then that's why the U.S. needs to build better cars, he said.

It is right that, after months of the government trying to force an unpopular version of Brexit on the Commons, MPs try to scrutinize the process of Britain's departure as much as they can.

►Other public schools — including Texas, Texas A&M, Clemson, Oregon, Minnesota and Houston — can claim they will not have to pay because they assert that they are government units that have federal tax immunity without holding any other tax-exempt status. Whether they ultimately will take this position remains to be seen. If Texas A&M does, it would save close to $1.4 million related just to the compensation of football coach Jimbo Fisher, whose basic annual pay is $7.5 million.

And really the experts should be the ones deciding how we spend it.

Mr. Trump has been largely holed up at his Mar-a-Lago resort since the Friday before Christmas, making frequent golf outings.

Flash forward to 2017, Congress acts to get rid of the tax penalty. So this judge last night says, look, you got rid of the tax penalty. That's the legal underpinning of this Supreme Court opinion. So now, not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional, but everything else must fall. That is a huge win for critics of Obamacare.
If you're the old school type, you may decide to file your taxes on paper this year rather than do so electronically. Bad move. Filing on paper means you're far more likely to make a mistake, and if that happens, your return could land on that audit list faster than you can say whoops.

In what can only be described as a chilling, Orwellian effort now has emerged to silence, cancel, erase any opposition voices, Hannity said. Now, couple this with the most radical, big government Socialist agenda that's ever been proposed in American history, and a commitment to implementing it, and, of course, starting with this radical environmental Green New Deal and regulations canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, amnesty for illegal immigrants, and so much more – everything we warned you so much about.

Ms. Warren and Senator Cory Booker, among others, have recently endorsed the idea of a Green New Deal, a call to reimagine an environment-first economy that would phase out fossil fuels. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez thrust that issue into the national dialogue after she joined a sit-in protest in the office of then-incoming House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi, in one of her first, rebellious acts in Washington.
Once the Senate considers its version of the bill, progressives in the House could threaten to withhold their support for the final package unless some kind of minimum wage hike is included. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested on Thursday that progressive members of the House should pressure their own party in ways similar to conservative Democrats in the Senate.

JENNINGS: He has. I wonder if Mitt Romney is not delivering a little bit of payback to Donald Trump, who sort of led him on for secretary of state and then went with Rex Tillerson, of course, there, during the transition. These two guys have a long and interesting history. I suspect this won't be the last chapter that's written. But these Senate terms being six years, it does give you a lot of political freedom, especially at the beginning, to do things that you don't immediately have to answer for from voters back home.

But Democrats aren't the only ones who are calling for conditions to bailouts for major industries that are severely affected by the economic crisis. Keith Anderson, co-founder of investment firm BlackRock, suggested in a letter to The New York Times this week that stock warrants should be attached to any loans given by the federal government, similar to what a private investor would require when bailing out a troubled company.

The results are consistent, and I don't think there's any debate, says Douglas Harris of the Education Research Alliance at Tulane University. Charters, vouchers and tax credits create competition and positive spillovers. When school choices expand, public schools stand to lose students, and thus money, and they seem to respond by stepping up their game.
The caveat: Walk very, very carefully with online legal solutions, says Lawrence Lehmann, an immediate past president of the National Association of Estate Planners & Councils. He advises talking to an estate attorney or, if you can't afford one, seeking help through a low-cost legal aid clinic. These are powerful documents, and there are plenty of opportunities for missteps, which could wreak havoc later. The devil is in the details, he says.

His solution was a wealth tax, but he recognized that exemptions and freedom of travel had doomed the European experiments. So he suggested a global wealth tax: The whole world would decide to do one thing at one rate. That such a solution is highly unlikely is a perfect symbol for the difficulty of getting money from people with the best accountants, the best lobbyists, and the best boats.

Now a clue has emerged as to how President Trump's son-in-law's firm was able to move so fast: The Kushner Cos. routinely filed false paperwork with the city declaring it had zero rent-regulated tenants in dozens of buildings it owned across the city when, in fact, it had hundreds.

It's actually not so bad on the import side. Basically, it would force companies to pay their effective corporate tax rate on the value of imported goods. The average corporate tax rate is about 13%, so this would imply approximately a tariff of that amount. (To be fair, the average tax rate on importers is considerably higher, because importing doesn't offer as many loopholes as, say, running a hedge fund, so the de facto tariff would be more.)
One of those improvements is road paving. Teegardin even jokes that maybe they should be paving the road in green to show people how their marijuana tax dollars are being spent.

But Teegardin is not banking on this money coming in forever.
In 1990, twelve countries in Europe had a wealth tax. Today, there are only three: Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries—and, perhaps worst of all, it didn't raise much revenue.

In a response to the findings, the IRS pointed to the delay in the tax filing deadline as one reason for the increase in interest payments. The agency must issue refunds within a 45-day window after the April 15 filing date, or else it owes interest on the refund. But the delay in the tax deadline meant the IRS had to pay interest going back to that April 15 filing date even though it had given taxpayers more time to file.
Instead Trump has opted for rallies, press releases, photo ops, a handful of interviews and tweeting. Lots of tweeting.

GAO, which analyzed the tax gap problem in 2012, pointed out that simplifying the tax code is only one way to help close the gap. GAO said the IRS also needs to improve customer service lines for taxpayers, devote additional resources to enforcement, expand compliance checks before issuing refunds and modernize information systems, among other things, to address the gap.

Previous presidents on extended trips away from the White House typically stayed in the city of each day's final event, or traveled to the city of the following day's first event.

We must act now, and we must act decisively.
Angry tweets responding to the article's author garnered thousands of likes on Twitter.
Finally, when it comes to voucher and tax-credit programs, many states don't even require private schools to administer the state's test. In Florida, it can be any nationally normed test. So these programs are a bit of a black box. Going forward, if private school options expand, we may know less and less about the schools that more and more students are attending.
In my view, it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve. That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president. When I am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed. Under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and handpick its members and staff.

Pricing is one of the fundamental building blocks of marketing. Many believe price is easy to understand when, in fact, it is one of the most difficult. McKinsey points out in an article entitled Shedding the commodity mind-set, too many companies leave large amounts of money on the table. Pricing experts know that setting the right price is difficult because, in addition to the physical factors of cost and profit, price is subject to psychological factors. The best companies can do to have control over these psychological factors is to do a great job of branding. And to get the branding right, companies have to know how to develop the right underlying corporate image and positioning strategies. In short, creating a brand image of the product that is impossible, or extremely difficult, to copy is the key to having control over your pricing strategies. If you are able to do that, you will be able to employ the most powerful and effective of all pricing strategies -- What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB).

Virus drains $2.5 billion from N.Y.C. property tax revenue. A Courtyard Marriott is boarded up after closing in Manhattan. Credit... Gabby Jones for The New York Times As New York City officials fight to control the coronavirus by this summer, it is becoming clear that the economic fallout will last far longer: The city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, the largest such drop in at least three decades. The anticipated shortfall, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, is largely driven by a projected drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties, which have all but emptied out since the pandemic began. Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate, and the economic projections suggest the city's budget will remain in a precarious position for the foreseeable future. For now, the city will partially offset the loss with increased revenues from income taxes: The rich got richer, according to a slide from the mayor's presentation. But the city will still likely have to substantially cut spending elsewhere. This is just a total economic dislocation for certain industries, the mayor said. We've never seen anything like what's happened to the hotel industry. We've never seen Midtown in the situation it is now. Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who have battled with the Trump administration for more federal aid, have expressed optimism that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., together with a Democratic-led Congress, will bring substantial assistance.

Since the financial meltdown, salaried employees have financed the cutting of expenses. Too many jobs and profits have gone bye bye. According to Bloomberg, US companies are keeping $2.1 trillion overseas to avoid taxes. Some pay less income tax than you and I. When consumers have less money to spend, this creates a vicious cycle, which hurts these companies too. To help avoid these problems, many believe it is preferably to focus on revenue to increase profits because that can produce more win-win situations where all boats rise. Where does revenue come from? It's the result of price times quantity (Revenue = Price x Quantity).

Second, and perhaps more important, administration officials appear to be counting on the agreement to revive business investment in the United States, which has fallen in recent quarters after surging in the first half of 2018. The uncertainty that Mr. Trump and the Chinese sowed as they imposed escalating tariffs on each other's imports was largely to blame for that sluggishness, many companies and economists have said.

Annapolis: The state Senate plans to add about $520 million to Gov. Larry Hogan's proposal to help Maryland recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, leading Democrats who control the chamber announced Wednesday. Democrats are keeping the Republican governor's proposals in his $1 billion plan over several years. The Senate's proposed additions would come this year, focusing largely on education, business, health, housing aid, transportation and unemployment assistance. It would bring the total amount of the proposal to almost $1.3 billion in the current fiscal year. This is the immediate relief that Marylanders need, said Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore. Hogan's plan includes direct stimulus payments to low-to-moderate income residents, with benefits of up to $750 for families and $450 for individuals. It repeals all state and local income taxes on unemployment benefits. The governor's plan also includes sales tax credits of up to $3,000 a month for four months for small businesses. The governor's proposal is on top of roughly $700 million the state already has allocated in aid relating to the pandemic.

Boston: A group working to make it legal in the state for doctors to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to mentally competent patients with terminal illnesses says it will continue its fight despite a recent legal setback. Compassion & Choices in its suit filed in 2016 said legalizing the practice, referred to as medical aid in dying or MAID, would help terminally ill patients avoid needless suffering. In a decision Dec. 31, a judge said the issue should be left up to lawmakers. Compassion & Choices said in a statement Monday that it intends to appeal. This setback is disheartening, but we will continue this legal battle, Dr. Roger Kligler, a Cape Cod physician with terminal cancer and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in the statement.

Altogether, Trump's plan would slash revenues and thereby grow the deficit. His former plan would have added $9.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. This one, with its higher income tax rates, would cut that figure, though it's unclear by how much. Larry Kudlow, a CNBC commentator and informal advisor to Trump, said the addition to the deficit would now total $3 trillion.
Honolulu: This tropical state is getting its first Olive Garden.

The Mai Tai Bar and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. at Ala Moana Center, the state's largest mall, are slated to close next month, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Bubba Gump Chief Operations Officer Jim DuFault said the closure is the result of a rental dispute, and Bubba Gump is prepared to file a lawsuit if the landlord or a future tenant attempts to steal our Mai Tai intellectual property. Olive Garden filed a $50,000 building permit for the mall location.

If you're thinking of going down this road, the first thing you should do is to identify and acknowledge your emotional reasons for selling. What we typically hear is that homeowners didn't get the sale price they wanted so they consider renting out the property for a while as a placeholder so they can wait for the market to bounce back. This logic often has less to do with the actual costs/benefits of renting, but rather the emotional burden of selling at a perceived loss.

The transit authority spent $2.2 million on contracted cleaning services, according to the inspector general. The audit found the employees weren't doing their job properly 84% of the time. The Metro system took action immediately and began pressure-washing efforts after learning of the inspector general's findings, spokeswoman Sherri Ly said in a statement, according to news outlets. The agency also plans to phase out contractors in favor of hiring custodial workers in-house, according to the statement.

Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.

experts visit in July to lay the groundwork. They were not allowed to visit Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. For months, China delayed approving a visit by a full team of experts, frustrating the health agency's leaders. When the visit seemed to be finalized this month, it fell apart when Beijing declined to provide visas for the visitors, according to the health agency. Now that the investigators have arrived, critics say Beijing's desire for control means the inquiry will probably be more political than scientific. Tracing the virus will be a painstaking task. The team that has come to Wuhan will face a city radically transformed from when the virus first emerged, in late 2019. The city, which went into lockdown on Jan. 23 last year and became a symbol of the virus's devastation, has since been held up by Chinese officials as a success story in vanquishing the virus. The W.H.O. experts have decades of experience plumbing the depths of viruses, animal health and disease control. But tracing the source of the virus that as of Thursday had killed almost two million people worldwide and infected more than 92 million will be painstaking. While experts believe the virus originated naturally in animals, possibly bats, little else is known. How much access the team gets in China will be critical, public health experts say. The team will have to sidestep attempts to politicize its inquiry.

In short, unlike other donors, the Mercers are not merely angling to influence the Republican establishment—they want to obliterate it. One source told me that, in a meeting with Sheldon Adelson and Robert Mercer a few years ago, the casino mogul asked Robert if he was familiar with certain big Republican players. According to the source, Robert shut him down. I don't know any of your fancy friends, he replied, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. And so it seemed almost inevitable that their paths converged with Bannon's when he took over Breitbart in 2012. The Mercers recognized Bannon as an ideological ally. They also appreciated how quickly he improved the website's finances. Unlike many people in their orbit, Bannon wasn't obsequious: According to one person who often spends time with them, he made zero effort to dress up around his benefactors, often appearing in sweatpants and looking almost like a homeless person. Bannon was respectful around Robert, says this person, but with Rebekah he was more apt to say precisely what he thought: He worked for Bob; he worked with Rebekah. Although the Mercers had initially been persuaded to back Texas senator Ted Cruz in the Republican primary, Bannon preferred Trump, and by the time of the Republican National Convention the Mercers were with him. Rebekah made her move last August, at a fundraiser at the East Hampton estate of Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets.

The I.R.S. is trying to redirect millions of stimulus payments that went to unused accounts. Some Americans who used tax preparation services have temporary accounts on file with the I.R.S. Credit... Eric Gay/Associated Press The Internal Revenue Service misdirected stimulus payments for an estimated 13 million accounts, but the agency on Friday said it is trying to redirect to the money to the proper place. If you're anticipating a stimulus payment that hasn't yet landed, continue to monitor your bank accounts — and your snail mail. The I.R.S. was taking immediate steps to get stimulus payments to the correct accounts, the agency said in a statement on Friday. Many additional taxpayers will receive payments following this effort, the IRS added. Here's what happened: Millions of payments were sent to temporary accounts, which are often set up by companies like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt when they prepare returns. They use the accounts when customers opt to have their preparation fees deducted from their refund, for example, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest.

But when you get to the heart of the matter, a refund is the result of overpaying income taxes during the year. Worse, you must file a tax return to ask the IRS to return your overpayment. When else do Americans gladly overpay for something and wait till the next year to get a refund?

The number of illegal border crossings is down from 1.6 million in 2000 to less than 400,000 last year. But the number of families coming over the border has risen sharply, putting a strain on health care and immigration services that came into sharp focus with the deaths of two migrant children in December. Administration figures show that 161,000 family units crossed the border in fiscal 2018, a remarkable 50 percent increase from the year before. Homeland Security officials have also said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 percent increase.

Wolf is also calling on lawmakers to enact a $1 per ton increase in tipping fees for municipal waste landfill deposits as a way to support the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Fund. The fund is expected to become insolvent by the end of this year, the Wolf administration said, and the governor says increased tipping fees would generate an additional $22.6 million. That could help with any cleanup associated with emerging PFAS contamination.

Providence: Brown University allowed some smaller classes to meet in person starting Wednesday. Classes of 19 students or fewer are now allowed under Level 2 of the Ivy League school's coronavirus protocols. The campus has three activity levels, with Level 1 being the most restrictive. All levels still require face coverings and social distancing. Libraries are open, but students are required to reserve study space online and check out books using a contactless circulation system. Office hours and advising are still remote. Athletic and recreational facilities remain closed. Socializing is only allowed in groups of five or fewer students unless outdoors, where social distancing can be maintained. The university bookstore is open only to members of the Brown community, and a university ID is required for admission. Students are still required to follow all state and federal guidelines.

New Orleans: Plans are on again to implode a hotel building that partially collapsed last fall, killing three workers, city officials said Friday. Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said at a news conference that the implosion is expected to take place in mid-March. Implosion had been considered and then rejected in the weeks after the Oct. 12 collapse at the planned Hard Rock Hotel on Canal Street, at the edge of the French Quarter. But on Friday, officials said the implosion plan was back on. It was deemed safer than having workers dismantle the structure. Putting more people at risk, I cannot live with that and will not support that, Cantrell said. And it will mean commerce and traffic can return to the area around the unstable building more quickly. Implosion will also bring the building down ahead of hurricane season, which begins June 1.

For those who use brokerage accounts to invest, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation offers protection of up to $500,000 for securities and cash, including a $250,000 cash limit. IRAs get the same protection as other brokerage accounts. But it's important to understand that while FDIC insurance actually protects your principal from risk of loss, SIPC insurance only protects you against problems with the brokerage company you use. When a broker gets into financial trouble and has to liquidate, SIPC makes sure the assets in each investor's account are present and accounted for. If cash or securities are missing, then the SIPC makes investors whole, up to the dollar limit protected.

Many polls show that the public welcomes legal migrants — but also much prefers that new jobs go to Americans first.

Just 30 percent of Hispanics opposed the border shutdown.

Let's face it: those 11 million [illegal migrants] are not sitting on their duff. They're working somewhere. They may be working under a fake Social [Security Number], they may be working as an independent subcontractor, but they're working and they've got skills. A lot of these workers working in the underground economy, used to work for [construction company] people like me. They were let go because of ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] audits or Social Security No Matches, or insurance audits or whatever, and yet they're 11 to 12 million people in this country on payrolls sending in about $6 to $7 billion a year of Social Security [payments] that they would never get. These ICE audits have taken millions of people off of payrolls and dumped them into the underground economy where they're working for cash and not paying taxes.

Skwentna: Weeks after a man's remote cabin burned down, he was rescued by Alaska State Troopers who found him by a makeshift shelter with an SOS signal stamped in the snow. Tyson Steele, 30, was picked up Thursday in what appeared to be good health at his remote homestead 20 miles outside Skwentna, troopers said in a dispatch. A mid-December fire had killed his dog and left Steele with no means of communication, Steele told troopers. After his family members and friends hadn't heard from him for several weeks, they requested a welfare check. The trooper helicopter crew reached the homestead about 11 a.m. and saw Steele waving his arms near the makeshift shelter. Skwentna, with a population of 35, is 70 miles northwest of Anchorage. The trooper helicopter transported Steele to Anchorage.
Augusta: The state plans to launch a system to allow residents to register for a COVID-19 vaccine. The statewide system will include a website and a telephone option, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Nirav Shah said Tuesday. Maine is looking to launch the registry system in as little as a few weeks and at a time when demand for vaccines greatly outstrips supply. More than 115,000 doses of vaccine have been administered in the state, but most of the population is still not able to access it. The registry system will be designed to allow residents to consent to the vaccine and sign up for an appointment to receive it. Meanwhile, Maine's public university system has expanded its coronavirus wastewater monitoring program through the end of the spring semester. The University of Maine System said it's adding new sample collection sites and increasing sampling and testing frequency. The university system uses the program to track for the presence of the virus on its campuses and in surrounding areas. The system said samples will be collected twice weekly at campuses around the state.

Now, the decision to roll all or some of the money in your 401(k) account to an IRA requires a good deal of analysis as well. For instance, at a minimum, you'll want to compare and contrast fees, expenses and investment options. You'll also want to determine what sort of services you require, whether you want to pay for advice or not and how much, whether you need creditor protection, whether you currently own a good deal of company stock in your 401(k), whether consolidating your respective investment accounts makes sense (note: you can only consolidate your own IRAs not each other's); whether you'll need to use the money in your IRA to pay for higher education expenses; whether – if you plan to keep working – you might want to delay taking required minimum distributions (RMDs), and so on. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to tell you want to do in the absence of learning more about your situation. As for how to invest your money, that too is another difficult question to answer. There are at least two strategies to consider: the floor-and-upside approach and the bucket approach.

The investment you're going to make in Cuba, just like North Korea, is going to be China spending money there or some other entity spending money, but North Korea has no money and neither does Cuba, Dr. Javier García-Bengochea, whose family owned one of Cuba's most lucrative ports in Santiago before Fidel Castro stole it during the Revolution, told Breitbart News. So you are going to be effectively … cannibalizing or appropriating their natural or cultural resources going in for whatever their minerals are or tourism there is. You're not going to build Cuban society, or North Korean society.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement Saturday that the House will begin passing separate bills to reopen the government in the coming week, starting with the funding bill that covers the Treasury Department so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.
Yet, the total fine for this offense was less than 2% of the bank's $12.3 billion profit for 2009 and no one went to jail. No one went to jail.
After his metamorphosis, Jones became a staunch opponent of U.S. military engagement abroad and took part in bipartisan efforts to curtail the White House's power to deploy troops on foreign soil, including in Syria.
A few countries are especially vulnerable. Among large developing countries, Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia all have outstanding debts in dollars equivalent to roughly a quarter of their gross domestic product, according to a report from Fitch, the ratings agency. Mexico and Russia are also at risk, with dollar-denominated debts worth about one sixth of GDP.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up real estate prices in New York, California, and elsewhere, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
Pain in the US job market: Another 730,000 filed first-time claims
Judging by the extraordinary appreciating values of some urban centers such as San Francisco, LA, San Diego, Denver, Miami and Atlanta, foreign nationals that are able to (in many cases illegally) smuggle monies out of their own countries, mostly from China, Russia, Malaysia and others, are now out-bidding Americans with ease, driving real estate prices to higher levels than the pre-crash prices of 2007. If America does not curtail the foreign buying of American residential real estate, which has tripled since 2005, there may not be another cyclical correction to provide Americans with a chance of purchasing their homes. Charging any non-American citizen duty stamp on the purchase of residential property, is the only way to put a damper to rich foreigners snatching homes away from Americans.
We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit. As a member of the Financial Services Cmte, I'd support a hearing if necessary, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.
The bottom line here is, we have to figure out what it is that we want to do, and what it's going to take to be able to do it well, and hire the people with the skills to make that happen, and we don't have a very good system in the federal government right now for doing that, Kettl says. He says it will be interesting to see how Trump, a businessman, changes government hiring.

A senior administration official told CNN on Friday that Trump's mid-March meeting with leaders of southeast Asian countries in Las Vegas had been postponed.
LIASSON: Well, he's reassessing his campaign. But even if he doesn't continue as a candidate, he is still on track to play what could be a game-changing and historic role in the election because he has said he will spend whatever it takes - billions of dollars if necessary - to support whoever is the nominee of the party. And he'll fund down-ballot Democratic candidates. He'll fund get-out-the-vote drives. He'll fund everything. That's what he says he'll do. And that is pretty significant.
Many investors worry that the equity market has rebounded too far and too fast and that there are signs of excess starting to emerge in parts of the financial system, Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman Sachs' chief global equity strategist, told clients this week. This is a reasonable concern given that the rebound in equities since the bear market trough in March of last year has been remarkable.
The corporate demand to hire illegal migrants instead of Americans comes amid a housing boom that could otherwise help pull many sidelined Americans back into jobs and the middle-class. But Marek's video excludes any talk about Americans' current or future role in their own nation's economy.

The kinds of informant deals I think we should be worried about are the ones that are not scrutinized, where people - where defendants, for example, are not represented by counsel, where it takes place off the record where no one ever learns about it, where the informant gets to go on and commit additional crimes because the government finds them so useful. But at the top of the pyramid, if you will, in the highly scrutinized, highly resourced environment of these political crimes and the Mueller investigation, that's about as good as we get in terms of the integrity of these kinds of deals.
It is nothing more than a symbol when you look at it in this perspective, Bustos said during an interview on CNN's New Day, in reference to President Donald Trump's proposal for a wall. If we have a partial wall, if we have fencing, if we have technology used to keep our borders safe, all of that is fine. But it has just become this symbol that the president is not going to have any give-or-take when it comes to this $5 billion.
This is largely due to the proximity of oil refineries. In the Southeast, for example, where state governments levy low taxes on gas and drivers pay low gas prices, there is an abundant supply of oil. Texas and Louisiana are home to 27 and 19 petroleum refineries, respectively — the most and second most nationwide. Such states are also subject to fewer supplementary costs associated with the fuel, such as transportation costs or price spikes brought on by local supply shortages.
But the administration — represented by Pence, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner — refused, according to multiple officials.
Max Schachter is the only person on the advisory commission opposing the arming of Florida teachers.
The Republicans, their African-American party chairman notwithstanding, need to determine whether they will stand on ideas — and which ones — or resort to old tactics and tropes. The civil rights leadership, having been denied the respect and appreciation most deserved in their prime, sometimes seems to the younger generation overpraised and accorded excessive deference now, to the point where some younger leaders fear they will never be free of these elders' assumptions and expectations.

Freidman's lawyer, Patrick Egan, declined to comment on the Times report.
In the past we've seen too often where there will be a public engagement arm and it's just separate from the actual policy work that's happening in an administration, said Audelo. And that's just unacceptable and that is not what young people are trying to do. They want to make sure that their concerns, that the unique perspective that young people have into the fight on climate, into the fights on the economy... that those perspectives, their ideas are reflected in actual policy discussions.
BIDEN: And then came South Carolina, and they had something to say about it.
MARQUARDT: So much to discuss, we could spend hours on it but unfortunately we have to go.

It's important to note that the current Medicare program is not self-sufficient. Payroll taxes collected from workers and employers and all of the premiums paid by those enrolled cover only about half of Medicare's costs. Taxpayers subsidize the rest.
ELVING: But back in town, members felt entitled to speechify on the floor, prompting one of the few women in Congress at that time, Katharine St. George of New York, to suggest that they all just put their remarks in writing in the Congressional Record. Future generations yet unborn will be able to see them, she said, but those of us who are here on this Christmas Eve need not listen to them.
Jefferson Parish Council members called upon Yenni to resign, and the school board discussed banning him from their schools. Both the Gretna and Westwego City Councils voted for his resignation. Assessor Tom Capella, clerk of court Jon Gegenheimer, coroner Gerry Cvitanovich and sheriff Newell Normand also called for Yenni's resignation.
Not that the economy doesn't face speed bumps that continue to restrain growth. Those include vestiges of the recession, such as cautious lenders, fewer business startups and millions of prime-age men who remain outside the labor force. Those scars are probably going to be with us for the foreseeable future, Williams said. He also highlights long-term challenges such as an aging population and sluggish gains in productivity, or worker output.
RAINBOW: They are, yes. They're - they are ripped karaoke versions that I play with and sort of fine-tune and adjust to be, you know, unique to my videos.

The legislature went very anti-gun, and the governor is very anti-gun, he said. It's going to be a tough fight, there's no question about it.

The message to Ukraine -- the real message to Ukraine, our U.S. policy message is don't engage in political investigations. The message from the President, however, was the exact opposite -- do engage in political investigations and do it for my re-election.
Asked if she worried that Sanders couldn't bring the party together, Picciano was diplomatic: What I worry about is the soundbite of bully-ism, she said. I feel like, unfortunately, that's where Bernie is right now.

They may meet them literally in the lockup in the courtroom 10 minutes before a hearing with no time to discuss the case, the facts, the file. This is sometimes referred to derogatorily as meet-them-and-plead-them lawyering, that essentially your public defender meets you. They tell you what the government's deal is, and they engage in the process of you pleading guilty immediately.
State businesses will have an automatic extension on state tax filings, until June 1, Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot said.
The Dow and S&P 500 on Monday booked their sharpest daily drop in almost 10 weeks, with investors facing concerns around the potential for borrowing costs to rise, the spread of COVID-19 and the slow pace of the vaccine rollout.
Identity theft is a growing problem and one often tied to tax refund fraud, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. Once your return is filed with the IRS, the information — in particular your social security number — is locked and cannot be used again by anyone else.
The president's support for this policy is a game-changer. The one-year expansion is important pandemic relief policy but permanently expanding the benefit could give millions of children the opportunity to succeed. The permanent expansion is estimated to lift 4 million children out of poverty and cut deep poverty among children in half, he added.
DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. And what you haven't heard is any Republican on that day say anything other than that. No Republican has tried, even attempted to poke a hole in that fundamental question, why we are all here, why these hearings are taking place.
Trenton: Barring health insurance that excludes coverage for preexisting conditions and letting children stay on their parents' plans until 26 would be preserved under a slate of new laws the state enacted last week, even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in court. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the nine bills Thursday. They're aimed at shoring up key provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, which is opposed by Republicans in Congress and the White House. Democratic and Republican attorneys general are fighting in court over the law, sometimes referred to as Obamacare. New Jersey has about 800,000 people benefiting from the law, with about half a million people getting covered through Medicaid expansion under the law and 300,000 on the individual marketplace.
At one point, Secret Service agents arrived at the Bedminster club and kitchen supervisors asked all kitchen staffers to put their names, ages and Social Security numbers on a list, Torres said. She said she could not recall exactly when that occurred.
KING: Yeah. That's right. The Fed made an emergency interest rate cut yesterday to try to protect the economy from the effects of the virus, but it didn't seem to work. The S&P, the Dow and the Nasdaq all fell yesterday anyway.
