I believe that this new wave of interacting with South American countries has had a contagion effect – more center, center-right leaders have been successfully elected in these neighboring countries. I believe this is a clear cut response indicating that the left wing will not prevail in that region, which is a very good development in my view, not only for Latin America but for the rest of the world, he continued.

{"sentence": "The government of Afghanistan confirmed this weekend that the 2019 presidential elections will occur on July 20, raising a host of questions regarding the nation's democratic norms and ability to maintain security for voters in light of ongoing, and increasingly frustrating, peace negotiations with the Taliban. The July date pushes the election back from April 20, the original election day; government officials cite security, operational, and technical related issues making that deadline impossible.", "label": 0}

{"sentence": "Who wins the Afghan presidential election is less important than whether the country can pull off organizing a nationwide election without major intervention by the Taliban. The Taliban rejected yet another call for direct talks with Ghani's government this weekend, insisting that they had gained too much ground to bother entertaining Ghani. The Taliban has repeatedly rejected talks with Ghani because they consider themselves the legitimate government of Afghanistan and Ghani merely a puppet of the United States.", "label": 0}

{"sentence": "Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, held its first successful democratic transfer of power in 2015, when incumbent Goodluck Jonathan lost to former dictator Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari won the presidency largely on his promise to eradicate the Boko Haram threat in northeastern Nigeria, a promise he has entirely failed to live up to despite repeatedly declaring victory against the terrorist group as early as December 2015.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "The 2019 election is pivotal for the future of Nigeria not just because of the prolonged Boko Haram threat, but because it will be a test of whether the 2015 election was a mere fluke or whether Nigeria has fully embraced democratic institutions. Democratic traditions are built over time, and the lack of overt threat of a military takeover or coup d'etat bodes well for the state so far.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "Democracy is so in demand in Nigeria that, by October, 79 political parties had registered to field candidates in the 2019 election. In the regional legislative elections, 89 parties registered to run candidates. Yet the frontrunners remain the candidate for the two major parties: Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). The campaign has already turned bitter – Buhari's campaign is accusing Abubakar of having a sealed indictment against him for corruption in the United States, while Buhari has had to deny that he is a clone of himself deployed to replace the real, dead Buhari. According to some estimates, as Buhari kept some of his medical treatment for unspecified conditions a secret, he spent up to 15 percent of his term abroad receiving healthcare.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "Argentina was the first major country in the Americas to turn rightward after the early 21st-century wave of leftist presidents took over the region – including the United States, as former Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri took over the country before President Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Macri won his election largely in response to the tremendous backlash against leftist predecessor Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's ties to the Venezuelan dictatorship and Iran's Islamic theocracy in the aftermath of the suicide of the prosecutor investigating Iranian terrorism in Argentina, Alberto Nisman.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "Despite running as a pro-business candidate, Macri's biggest challenge in 2019 will be justifying the languishing status of his nation's economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently gave Argentina a $56 billion credit line to fix its recession, the largest ever, which only exacerbated concerns that the Argentine peso's value is about to plummet. The economic situation has deteriorated to a point that speculation has begun that Kirchner will attempt to reclaim the presidency from Macri despite an ongoing corruption investigation and the still-unresolved status of the Nisman murder.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "It is impossible to fully assess the status of the Argentine election until candidates, Kirchner in particular, confirm their running status. Whoever confronts Macri, however, will have to navigate residual bitterness from the Kirchner presidency – and fear of becoming another Venezuela under yet more socialist rule – to adequately use Macri's woeful economy against him.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "Canada's is not technically a presidential election, but the nation will choose its head of government in October 2019 through its parliamentary elections, granting the nation a chance to review the record of leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trudeau will face off against Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer and Jagmeet Singh of the New Democratic Party, attempting to run on issues such as environmental regulation and regional trade.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "Conservatives appear eager to discuss environmental regulation under Trudeau; this summer, Scheer spelled out the Carbon Tax! in black marker on a white plate, donned safety glasses, and smashed it in a gleeful if somewhat cheesy performance of the traditional Greek celebration at a political event. In parts of Canada dependent on the energy industry for its economy, Trudeau is highly unpopular, facing boos even at the peak of his popularity nationwide.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "Trudeau is also running as a sort of anti-Trump for the region, repeatedly referencing the alleged polarization of the Western political climate and how embracing leftist policies can temper its effect. The campaign, for now, appears to be working, though not by much – early polls show Trudeau's Liberals with a four-point lead over the Conservatives, whose major challenge will be Scheer's relatively lackluster name recognition.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "Few doubt that longtime socialist leader Evo Morales will win Bolivia's 2019 presidential election, scheduled to take place in October.

{"sentence": "Bolivia held a referendum on term limits in 2016, and the people spoke clearly: they did not want Morales to have the ability to run for yet another turn. Morales responded to this news by turning to the nation's Supreme Court, which ruled in December that, despite the referendum, Morales' name should appear on the ballot. If he wins, Morales will begin his fourth term in office.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "Opponents call the Supreme Court move a slow-motion coup and organizers have planned protests attended by thousands against Morales. Morales is currently facing five official opponents, the most prominent of which is former president Carlos Mesa, who has made the questionable legality of the Supreme Court ruling a key issue in his campaign.", "label": 0}

The tax treatment may be less favorable. The traditional wisdom over the years has been to favor mortgage debt over other kinds of credit because home-related debt is tax deductible. However, Kantrowitz pointed out: There's a deduction for mortgage interest, but you must itemize (most taxpayers don't). The student loan interest deduction, on the other hand, lets you deduct up to $2,500 in interest on federal and private student loans. It's an 'above-the-line' exclusion from income, so you can claim it even if you don't itemize. It also reduces the [adjusted gross income], which may have other benefits.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "The tax gap, simply put, is the amount in taxes individuals and companies owe the government, but that the government never receives. There are three reasons for that gap --some fail to pay any taxes, others underreport income, and yet others underpay their taxes, according to the IRS. Mulvaney said the president's proposed tax plan doesn't include an expectation that the gap will close, but pointed out how shrinking it would help the proposed $4 trillion budget. The tax gap in 2016 was $486 billion -- out of the expected revenue from income and corporate taxes of roughly $1.9 trillion.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "If you can really fill out your tax reform -- tax returns on a single piece of paper, you're much more likely to actually do it, Mulvaney added.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "However, Mulvaney's hopes of closing or even significantly shrinking the tax gap may be a stretch. The tax gap has remained relatively stable during the last decade, with the majority of the gap stemming from individual, rather than corporate, tax, shortages. The total tax gap was $450 billion in 2006, and the total tax compliance rate was 83 percent, according to the Government Accountability Office. The Obama administration made attempts to close the gap by stepping up enforcement, but probably only reduced it by $50 billion to $100 billion over a decade, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Mulvaney thinks a simpler tax code will help close the gap-- he reasons that one of the biggest reasons people don't pay taxes is that they don't want to or are unsure how.

{"sentence": "GAO, which analyzed the tax gap problem in 2012, pointed out that simplifying the tax code is only one way to help close the gap. GAO said the IRS also needs to improve customer service lines for taxpayers, devote additional resources to enforcement, expand compliance checks before issuing refunds and modernize information systems, among other things, to address the gap.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "The request comes as the Senate takes up Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package this week, which would include a third round of stimulus checks that would direct $1,400 to millions of eligible Americans. Congress distributed $1,200 checks a year ago under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and sent an additional $600 payment in December as part of a broader stimulus bill. The senators didn't specify an amount they are seeking for monthly direct aid.", "label": 1}

Only individuals earning up to $75,000 would get the full payments, as would married couples with incomes up to $150,000. For incomes above those thresholds, payment amounts would decline, phasing out completely for single individuals earning above $100,000 and married couples with a combined income of more than $200,000.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Some lawmakers have cited research that shows higher-income families are rebounding well from the pandemic's economic impact, as a rationale for lowering those income thresholds. Given that debate, many lawmakers are unlikely to support recurring stimulus payments.", "label": 1}

First, it would direct an extra $400 per week to unemployed Americans, up from $300, which would be helpful to jobless workers and their families but wouldn't help those who are struggling with cut hours or other income losses.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The bill also would expand the Child Tax Credit and transform it from an annual break claimed on tax returns — and which typically shows up in people's annual refunds — into a monthly payment. Under the plan, the tax credit would rise from $2,000 to $3,600 for children up to 6 years old and to $3,000 for children up to age 17. The IRS would pay the tax credit in monthly installments. That means that a family with two children under 6 could receive monthly checks of $600 from the IRS, for example.", "label": 1}

Sometimes parents will alternate years, with one claiming the child tax credit in odd years, and the other claiming them in even years. Or, if two children are involved, one parent can claim each child.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "I've had situations in my practice where I've had parents come in and complain to me that, even though they're legally entitled to claim a child on their tax return, their former partner has claimed the child and gotten extra tax refunds, said Jonathan Medows, a CPA based in Manhattan.

If you paid someone to care for your kids so that you could work or look for work, you likely qualify. The deduction limit is $3,000 for a single child, or $6,000 for two or more children.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "A quick reminder of the difference between tax credits and tax deductions: Credit reduces the amount you owe in taxes dollar-for-dollar, making them generally more valuable than deductions.

It mandates that employers with less than 500 employees fund paid leave at varying rates for varying amounts of time, with wide variations for different circumstances, they wrote. Government tax credits would offset some of those costs.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The 500 employee cap likely leaves millions of Americans without the new benefit, Allen and Hammond wrote.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "As it stands, the bill provides tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses finance the new benefit.

For self-employed workers, that relief would also come when they pay their annual taxes.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Either way, that presents problems, given that many employers are already taking an income hit from the virus, Glynn said. For one, the bill would not take effect for two weeks after being signed into law.

{"sentence": "One was bipartisan and long-standing, and that was to assist Ukraine, which had freed itself from the domination of Russia, to fight corruption and to resist Russian aggression. Is that a fair statement, Colonel Vindman?", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "VINDMAN: Those -- there are different estimates, but it's on that scale, yes.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "WELCH: In our bipartisan support, and by the way, I want to say to my Republican colleagues, a lot of leadership to have this bipartisan support came from your side, thank you. But our whole commitment was to get rid of corruption and to stop that Russian aggression, is that correct?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "VINDMAN: That amounts to some of the key pillars. WELCH: That's right. And the Giuliani, Sondmand (ph), and it appears, Trump policy was not about that, it was about investigations into a political opponent. Correct? I'll take that question back, we know it.", "label": 2}

In the process they've -- the Department of Justice, FBI, State Department, elements within the I.C., the ICIG have all suffered long-term damage.

That's our goal, fighting corruption in Ukraine, this terribly corrupt country. The problem of course with that is there is no evidence of the president trying to fight corruption.

Now, they still haven't gotten the White House meeting but they had to release the money because the whistleblower blew the whistle -- the whistleblower the President wants to punish -- and because Congress announced it was doing investigations, and very soon thereafter, the President was forced to lift the hold on the aid.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "They argue well this makes it -- this makes it OK, that it was a failed effort to bribe Ukraine, a failed effort to extort Ukraine. That doesn't make it better, it's no less odious because it was discovered and it was stopped.

This is the day after that July 25th call -- are they going to do the investigations? And he's ensured by Ambassador Sondland they're going to do it.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "First rebate checks sent to taxpayers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government mailed out nearly 8 million tax rebate checks Friday, the first wave of about 92 million checks that will be sent out in the next 10 weeks. The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri.

Beginning late last summer and early fall, our economy, especially the manufacturing sector, began slowing, he said. The combination of this tax relief and lower interest rates should help get it moving again. Not everyone will get a rebate check. Those who did not file a return last year, those who had no taxable income and those who can be claimed as dependents on someone else's tax return will not qualify. The amount of some taxpayers' checks may be smaller, too, if they owe any back taxes, child support payments or federal loan payments. The government will deduct those debts from rebate checks before sending them. So how will you spend your rebate check, if you're getting one? About 47 percent of those questioned for a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll said they would pay bills with the money, 32 percent will save it, 17 percent will spend it and 2 percent will donate their check to charity. If you're undecided about how to spend the money, several stores are ready to help you make that crucial decision.", "label": 2}

Home Depot stores are offering customers credit, based on the expected amounts of their rebates, until their checks come in. Some analysts say that if people immediately spend their checks, it could stimulate the economy. This is not a one shot deal. This is a down payment on future tax cuts, and I think people would be more apt to spend more of it than they would if they were just handed a one-shot rebate check, said Gerald Cohen of Merrill-Lynch. Others disagree. The problem right now is we're likely to see mounting job losses, and that's likely to erode confidence and induce consumers to save and not to spend, said Anirvan Banerji of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. If you filed your 2000 income tax return late, your check will come after the end of September. And if you moved since you sent in that return, make sure you've filed an official change of address form with the U.S. Post Office. The government says the checks will not be counted as taxable income for the 2001 federal tax returns, but residents of some states may have to pay slightly higher state taxes because of the rebates. One of the states -- Iowa -- has already moved to trim the extra taxes. The others affected are Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Oregon.", "label": 2}

In Missouri the issue will be a subject of discussion at a special session of the legislature in September. Special sessions are being considered in Alabama and several of the other states, and a Montana official said something could be done in a future year to offset this year's slightly higher tax.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "To keep your IRA safe, you'll have to take a smart approach to your investing decisions. There are several things you can do to try to balance the returns that your IRA investment portfolio can produce against the risks that you face anytime you invest.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "First, diversifying your portfolio across several different types of investments can help you avoid catastrophic losses if one of your holdings suffers a setback. Diversification can take many different forms, such as holding many different broad asset classes including stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments. It can also mean selecting several different options within a particular asset class, such as buying stocks in various sectors to offer more broad-based exposure.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Second, be aware of your time horizon. If you're already in retirement, then you'll generally want to be somewhat more conservative in your investing philosophy, because you're in a less favorable position to endure market downturns that could hurt the value of your portfolio.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "By contrast, if you have decades to go before you need to tap your retirement assets, then investing your IRA in more aggressive investments can produce the best returns over the long run.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Finally, make sure you acknowledge some of the risks that many investors neglect. Being conservative with your retirement account can minimize the risk of market losses, but being too conservative comes with the attendant risk that inflation will erode the purchasing power of your retirement nest egg and keep you from being financially secure when you retire.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Similarly, selecting investments that come with higher management fees creates the risk that even if your return on investment is good, the net value of your nest egg at retirement could still be insufficient due to the thousands of dollars in inflated fees that your financial institution took out of your IRA over the course of your career.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "As if filing taxes weren't stressful enough, one aspect of the process that really shakes workers to their core is the prospect of getting audited.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Statistically speaking, your chances of getting audited are pretty low, as less than 1% of all returns land on the IRS's list each year.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "That said, in preparing your tax return, you could end up making certain moves that increase your audit risk without realizing it. Here are a few that could subject you to further IRS scrutiny.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Some people wind up filing their taxes at the very last minute because they're forced to wait on key information or are at the mercy of their CPA friend who's supposed to be helping out. But in many cases, folks who end up sweating it out right around the deadline are those who simply procrastinate.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Either way, you should know that rushing through the process is a good way to inadvertently increase your audit risk, since, in doing so, you're more likely to omit key information or enter the wrong data.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "A better bet? Pledge to start tackling your tax return a minimum of one month prior to the deadline, which falls on April 17 this year. That's right — you get a couple of extra days, which means you have even less of an excuse to run out of time.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "If you're the old school type, you may decide to file your taxes on paper this year rather than do so electronically. Bad move. Filing on paper means you're far more likely to make a mistake, and if that happens, your return could land on that audit list faster than you can say whoops.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Consider this: The IRS reports that the error rate for paper returns is 21%, which means that one in five tax filers who go this route manages to muck something up. The error rate for electronic returns, on the other hand, is less than 1%. Remember, we're all human, and therefore subject to the occasional blunder. But if that slip-up results in an IRS audit, you'll be kicking yourself for not doing everything possible to lower your risk.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "3. Guessing at numbers -- even if you're close", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "If there's one thing the IRS is big on, it's accuracy. So as you sit down to file your taxes, make sure you're dealing with hard numbers. Guessing at data or deductions is a great way to raise your audit risk, and it doesn't matter if you're reasonably close — the IRS wants those numbers exact. This means that if you did freelance work last year but are missing that 1099 form that summarizes your income, don't just throw out a number you think is correct. Get on the phone with that client, insist on a copy of that tax form, and get that figure just right.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Similarly, if you lost a 1099, contact the issuer and find out what exact number that document contained. Remember, every time you get a 1099, the IRS receives a copy as well, and if your return doesn't match its records precisely, you'll automatically boost your audit risk.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The IRS offers a host of deductions that, if you're itemizing, could lower your tax burden significantly. But proceed with caution when claiming deductions, because if you don't, the IRS might choose to take a closer look at your return.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "For one thing, avoid round numbers unless your deductions happen to work out that way. If you racked up, say, $6,966 in medical expenses, don't claim $7,000 for convenience purposes. Not only is that technically a lie, but having too clean a number, so to speak, will likely raise an eyebrow.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Furthermore, try to avoid claiming disproportionately high deductions relative to your income. While it's one thing to list $5,000 in charitable contributions with a $60,000 income, if you claim a $15,000 deduction, it's apt to look suspicious. Of course, if you're looking at an exceptionally high deduction that's perfectly legitimate, by all means, claim it — just be sure to have meticulous documentation to back it up, because chances are, the IRS will ask for it.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "Responding to Tlaib's comments, Nadler said on CNN, I don't really like that language. But more to the point, I disagree with what she said. It is too early to talk about that intelligently. We have to follow the facts, we have to get the facts. That's why it is important to protect the Mueller investigation, that's why it's important to do our own inquiry. We have to get the facts. We will see where the facts lead. Maybe that will lead to impeachment. Maybe it won't. It is much too early.", "label": 2}

There's no reason to think that the President should not be indicted.", "label": 2}

One, were there impeachable offenses committed, how many, etcetera. And secondly, how important were they? Do they rise to the gravity where you should undertake an impeachment?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Regardless of whether the House initiates impeachment proceedings, Pelosi now has a great deal of power to make Trump's life miserable – both legally and politically – as the leader of a Democratic-led House with the power to hold hearings, subpoena witnesses and dig into Trump's tax records. And she knows it.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "First, the Trump administration losing yet another cabinet member. Just moments ago, the President announced on Twitter that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has resigned and will leave the administration at the end of the year.

{"sentence": "A federal judge in Texas striking down Obamacare, a controversial ruling that is setting the scene for a major legal battle ahead. This could once again leave the fate of President Obama's landmark health care law in the hands of the Supreme Court.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Now the Texas judge's decision centers round the individual coverage mandate which requires all Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty. Congress effectively eliminated that penalty as part of the 2017 tax cut bill. Now the judge is saying that mandate is unconstitutional. So the entire law, he says, is invalid.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Many states in reaction are vowing to fight back and appeal that calling the ruling an assault while President Trump who campaigned vociferously against Obamacare is taking a victory lap on Twitter touting that new ruling.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So for more, we are joined by our Supreme Court reporter, Ariane de Vogue.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Ariane -- break this down for us. Obamacare, signing up for that ends at midnight. Millions have signed up for Obamacare for 2019. But this really will not affect -- will not immediately affect them? ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORT: Right, it won't. But this", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "is a really broad ruling. This judge said not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional. He said the entire law must go.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Now it's just one judge right, Reed O'Connor --", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "DE VOGUE: It can be appealed on this. But boy, it sends into doubt the future of a lot of people thinking about health care. He said it can remain in effect pending appeal.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "But let me walk you through just a bit the history of it --", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "DE VOGUE: -- so we understand how we got to today. Remember back in 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Remember it was Chief Justice John Roberts, he said it was ok under the taxing power.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Flash forward to 2017, Congress acts to get rid of the tax penalty. So this judge last night says, look, you got rid of the tax penalty. That's the legal underpinning of this Supreme Court opinion. So now, not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional, but everything else must fall. That is a huge win for critics of Obamacare.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: And as you and I were discussing right before the show this goes well beyond what the Trump administration had even wanted.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So game this out for us. It will go through an appeals process but it could make its way to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court has now shifted dramatically since the last ruling. So how does this all play out?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "DE VOGUE: Well, first of all, remember, the Trump administration they've declined to defend this law. So California and a group of other states, they stepped in and last night they said we are going to the Fifth Circuit. That's a very conservative federal appeals court in Texas.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So the Fifth Circuit will look at it. And if it upholds exactly what O'Connor did then this thing will shoot right to the Supreme Court because that's so broad. The Fifth Circuit could scale back a little bit and so maybe it wouldn't go to the court. But the court likes to hear things when they are big. national laws like this.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "We do have this new, solidified, conservative majority but we also might have a concern about what is called severability, really kind of jibes by knocking down one provision, take the whole thing. That might be at issue at the court, too. So they will have to look at it if it gets to them.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: A lot of moving parts. But the important part to remember is nothing changes immediately --", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: -- but it is once again in jeopardy.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: So a lot of drama ahead probably.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Ariane de Vogue -- thanks so much for joining us and explaining that.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: All right. Well, the Affordable Care Act was, as we mentioned, one President Obama's biggest achievement while in office. This latest ruling threatens to wipe away the protection for people with pre-existing conditions, as you just heard from Ariane", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "[11:04:59] That is a major staple of the law which was widely featured in the 2018 midterm campaign on both sides among Democrats and Republicans.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So joining me now is one of the architects of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber. Jonathan -- thanks so much for joining us this morning.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "First of all, what is your reaction to this ruling out of Texas?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "JONATHAN GRUBER, ARCHITECT OF OBAMACARE: Well, I think it's really disappointing. I mean essentially a perversion of representative democracy.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Republicans controlled the Congress. They had a chance to strike down Obamacare. They said no, we are going to leave Obamacare and strike down the tax penalty. So they have literally said it is severable. Republicans have spoken. They said it's severable.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Yet, this judge is saying, no, I don't believe what the representative democracy delivered. I'm going to declare it unseverable.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So that's why legal experts, even legal experts who were opposed to the Affordable Care Act in previous cases are saying this is just ridiculous.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: And the judge did say that because the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the whole law is as well. That mandate as we know is what they called as central and inseverable, as you were just discussing, from the remainder of Obamacare. So do you agree?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "GRUBER: Well look, I think when the law passed we all thought the mandate was a very important part of the law. We have now basically been proven that it's important but not as important as we thought because look, we now have experience of the law without it, they removed the mandate. And we are seeing it weakens the law, it raises premiums, but the law still remains quite strong, albeit not as strong as it would have been.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So we have seen empirically that the law -- that it is severable. The law still works without it. Congress in its wisdom has declared that it's severable, has said, look, we're going to keep the law but remove the mandate penalty.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So really there is just no basis for a judge in Texas to just say despite what the body that represents the American people have said, I'm going to decide this is not severable. There's just no reason to do it.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: Are you confident in the appeals process that this won't go any farther?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "GRUBER: No, I'm not confident. Previous cases on the Affordable Care Act have all been clearly, by an objective standard, easy wins for the Affordable Care Act, and yet they've all passed by the skin of their teeth.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The Supreme Court clearly does not represent the constitutional expertise of the broad Senate constitutional experts, who for example in 2012 by about an 80 percent to 90 percent margin said the mandate was constitutional. Yet the Supreme Court found it wasn't.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So I'm nervous. What's fortunate is the Supreme Court I think does care about the opinion of the American people. The American people have spoken. They believe that protecting people with pre-existing conditions against insurance market discrimination is a key contribution of this law. And indeed it is.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "And I think hopefully the Supreme Court will see that that's something that matters to people. And that because of some obscure severability clause --", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "GRUBER: -- Or lack of severability --", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "GRUBER: -- they will not go against the will of the Congress.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: You say you are nervous. At the same time you say that the Supreme Court listens to the will of the American people. But now we have a Supreme Court that has two new conservative justices in Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on it. So if this makes its way to the Supreme Court, do you have any sense of how you think they might rule or how the whole court would rule?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "GRUBER: I honestly don't. I just hope that they will look and realize that even without the individual mandate, we are talking about a law that provided insurance to 17 million people, and for the 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, it's saying don't worry, if you lose health insurance you can go buy it on the exchange.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "If this law goes away, we return to a day where people who are sick can't get health insurance, which defeats the whole purpose of the product.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: All right. Jonathan Gruber -- thanks so much for joining us this morning. GRUBER: You bet. >", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: All right. Joining me now is NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell, and assistant editor at the Washington Post and CNN political commentator David Swerdlick.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "David -- let's start with you. Protecting those with pre-existing conditions was a focal point of the midterm campaigns and did help Democrats take back the House. What do you think are the political consequences of this ruling?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "DAVID SWERDLICK, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: So, good morning -- Alex.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "I think the political consequences are that Republicans have now basically done the equivalent of playing Jenga. They pulled the bottom block out of something hoping it will collapse. It's not going to go away yet because as your previous guest has said it's going to have to go up to the Supreme Court probably to resolve this.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "But if the Affordable Care Act eventually does fall apart, then you have a divided Congress that's not going to be able to agree on how to proceed with health care and that will leave millions of Americans who depended on the Affordable Care Act sort of in the lurch.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Democrats are moving left toward Medicare for all. Republicans have been unable to pass their plans, which are a version of, you know, market-based health care where states can choose what kind of plans they have. The two sides are far apart.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "[11:10:02] I don't think Democrats in the immediate future are going to be able to deliver on this because they don't have the Senate. And I think Republicans are going to have to answer in the coming months why they want to take this apart if they don't have a plan in place that can replace it that's clearly better.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: And Kelsey -- picking up on that, the soon-to-be House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi has slammed this ruling. Is there anything that she can do?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "KELSEY SNELL, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, NPR: Well, she is very capable for bringing up bills to vote on her Congress at this point so that the House could potentially take a vote and uphold portions of the law or even bring back the penalty for the individual mandate that was zeroed out by Republicans last year.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "But I think it's very important that this is a big political issue for Pelosi. She firmly believes and has strong evidence for the fact that Republicans lost many, many congressional races in states like New Jersey and in Florida and California based on messaging on the Affordable Care Act because voters really started to like this law.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "SNELL: They may not like it being branded as Obamacare but they really do like the protections that are in the law.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "David -- a point that I have been trying to get at with some of our guests is --", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "SWERDLICK: -- if we play this -- if we game this out and it gets to the Supreme Court and now you have the Supreme Court that is firmly conservative with the nominations of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh -- how does that impact things? Because the Chief Justice John Roberts was the key vote, the key voice last time and now you've got solid five to four conservative majority. So how is that going to affect things?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "SWERDLICK: Yes. No -- I think we're going to -- it's a little bit of a wait and see. I mean this Texas federal judge has a reasonable if not ultimately winning point that if the Supreme Court in 2012, you know, premised its upholding of the Affordable Care Act on the idea that this was part of Congress's taxing power but now the law does not include the penalty or the tax then that premise is gone.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "On the other hand, the idea I think Ariane was talking about the severability problem earlier in your program -- the problem is does this make the entire law fail. And you know, I can't get into the minds of the Supreme Court justices, including Justice Roberts who is a conservative Bush appointee who's the chief justice, but who I think in 2012 clearly saw what would happen if the Supreme Court intervened to essentially undo the will of Congress. So I have to go with wait and see right now -- Alex.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "Now Zinke had been embattled for weeks now.

Is it just to sort of quash any perception that no one wants the job?", "label": 2}

And there are Democrats who are already out there saying that Trump is picking Mulvaney because he wants to have a bigger shutdown fight and that's something that Mulvaney has always been a kind of a critic of government spending and he was one of the Republicans who always fought to keep spending limited. So it's entirely possible that he is trying to calm the waters.", "label": 2}

This was a fascinating moment because both sides, the Flynn legal team and the Mueller legal team had said that Michael Flynn deserves no jail time because of his extensive cooperation. Now we see the Mueller coming out swinging saying that Michael Flynn's version of the facts is untrue and he should have known that lying to federal investigators is against the law.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "ERICA ORDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. So, as you pointed out, one of the important things to keep in mind is that both sides have asked for little to no prison time for Michael Flynn. However the prosecutors had been pushing back against some of Flynn's claims.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "And one effect that all of this may have in terms of the sentencing is that the judge has brought up in his court filings and, you know, you've seen the judge order prosecutors and lawyers and from the special counsel's office to file additional material in response to some of those claims.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So what you may see during sentencing is the judge seek to elicit more information on some of these issues from both sides -- from Flynn's attorneys and from the special counsel team.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "The FBI has no obligation to tell someone in this situation that they ought to get a lawyer because the interrogation was not in FBI custody. So that's different from like a Miranda setting. The FBI did not have to warn Michael Flynn, hey if you lie to us, that's a crime.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "And by the way of all people who should know that it should be the incoming national security adviser. So I don't know why the lawyers went down this path. I don't see any benefit to it for Flynn.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "[11:35:01] Now the judge has shown some interest, as you said before -- Alex. And I don't -- that could mean either thing. That could meant the judge is thinking about throwing the case out. I don't think that's likely. It could mean that the judge on the opposite side is ticked off and think that Flynn has not truly accepted responsibility now which could result in a slightly higher sentence.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: Right. Let's just remind our viewers what happened is that Flynn was questioned by FBI agents, that those FBI agents did not tell him explicitly that lying to the FBI is illegal.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: And the Mueller's team response was someone who spent this much time heading up an intelligence agency in the military at this highest level of U.S. government should know that.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So Elie -- Flynn was one of the first people in Trump's inner circle to cooperate extensively as both his team and the Mueller have said at the highest level. He was cooperating. He was part of the campaign. He's part of the transition. He's part of the administration. Does it looks like this is a test case for other potential cooperators?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "HONIG: It could be. Look, I always approach cooperators from the point of view that the other potential cooperators are watching. And that's why I think Mueller has been smart.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The cooperators who have come through, who've been honest, who've been truthful, who've given him good information he's gone to bat for. Michael Flynn being one of them.", "label": 2}

And of course, Paul Manafort who Mueller threw out of the prop room altogether. And now Manafort is looking at an extremely high sentence.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "HONIG: No, if I was representing the President I would fight that at all costs. But there's two ways this can go. They can agree to terms of an interview between Mueller and Trump's team.

{"sentence": "And if not then the ball moves over to Mueller's court, is he going to issue a subpoena? And if he does, we're going to end up in the courts and we're going to have I think a very close contest up to the Supreme Court.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "MARQUARDT: And if he issues a subpoena, of course, that is to be approved by Mueller's bosses -- Rod Rosenstein, the acting attorney general Matt Whitaker until there's actually a new attorney general. So it's unclear whether that subpoena would actually come into effect.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "But Elie -- the last question to you. The Trump entities as we highlighted at the top there are under investigation across the board. It does feel like to some extent that the walls are closing in on the President. What does it mean for Trump legally, personally himself? Should he be scared at this moment more so than in the past?", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "A Message of Discontent from Wisconsin (TIME, April 17, 1972) -- Like some metaphysical lottery, with hazards of sudden political death or prizes of resurrection, the American primary system ramshackled through Wisconsin last week to the end of its first phase -- and a pause before the next series, starting April 25, in such crucial industrial states as Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. The Wisconsin primary left the eventual outcome of the long spring campaign more enigmatic than ever, but some of the election results were startling: -- George McGovern, hitherto regarded as a one-issue antiwar champion of the liberal-left, exploited his own superb organization in the state, tapped deep wells of economic discontent and, by winning a 30% plurality, transformed himself at last into a major candidate. In Wisconsin his support was astonishingly broad, bracketing liberals, conservatives, blue- collar workers, farmers, suburbanites and the young. -- George Wallace, with the help of 35% of the G.O.P. voters who crossed over to vote Democratic, similarly appealed to a restive mood of the little man. Although he campaigned for only eight days in Wisconsin, Wallace came in second, with 22% of the vote. Adding the Wallace and McGovern totals, 52% of the voters cast ballots for anti-Establishment candidates. -- Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey, who had counted on his longtime popularity in neighboring Wisconsin to catapult him into the Democratic lead, came in third, with 21%. It was a serious, though by no means fatal blow for Humphrey, who has yet to win a presidential primary.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "-- Edmund Muskie, limping into fourth place with only 10% of the vote, was the real loser. Once regarded as the front runner, Muskie's defeats in Florida and Wisconsin have deflated his trust and confidence campaign. In an almost breathtaking descent, Muskie in a matter of weeks has become merely another contender. At least one candidate did not survive Wisconsin at all. New York Mayor John Lindsay, with a dismal 7% showing on top of his 7% in Florida, declared himself out of the race. A Muskie aide who had earlier called Lindsay the wild card in this campaign remarked last week: He turned out to be a deuce. Washington Senator Henry Jackson, who won 8% in Wisconsin, remained the darkest of horses, suffering from a massive problem of nonrecognition; on primary day last week, his workers were still distributing a leaflet headlined WHO IS SENATOR JACKSON? On the Republican ballot, Richard Nixon was opposed by Ohio's conservative Congressman John Ashbrook, who got 1% of the vote. California's liberal Republican Congressman Paul McCloskey, who had already withdrawn from the race, also got 1%. The President scored 97%. The Wisconsin campaign was a furious montage of political styles. With mod glasses and carefully darkened hair, 61-year-old Humphrey bounced through 19-hour days. We can sleep next year, he told his workers. Everywhere, except among college students, he found deep affection, but the warmth did not always convert to votes. At times, his campaign savored of last hurrah. In Milwaukee, a woman wearing a McGovern button told H.H.H.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": ": We love you. But you're voting for McGovern, replied Humphrey. Said the woman: Yes, but we love Hubert Humphrey. George Wallace planned only a minimal campaign in Wisconsin, where busing was not an issue, and he had virtually no organization. But when he sensed the crowd's mood at his first rally in Milwaukee on March 23, Wallace abruptly changed his schedule. Suddenly all his earlier explanations about our inability to rent halls because of basketball games became academic. Wallace sought his little man with eleven rallies in eight days and a flurry of local television interviews. He repeatedly brought up busing as a philosophical issue. He complained that the other candidates were horning in on his populist issues: I dig the bone up and throw it out there, and the big dogs grab it. I'm just a little dog from Alabama. McGovern's television commercials confirmed the Wallace complaint. If you want lower property taxes, you want George McGovern, said one. It's as simple as that. But McGovern emphasized direct campaigning. In oblique reference to Lindsay's stylish and futile TV campaigns in Florida and Wisconsin, one McGovern press release claimed: The day of the media candidate is over. People have stopped watching television commercials and started listening to details. Top-Heavy. Despite his efforts to sharpen his stand on issues, Muskie failed to come across clearly on any topic. His organization, top-heavy with endorsements and contributors, never took root on the local levels where primaries are won. He failed to define a constituency.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The overall message from Wisconsin is of a contrary mood, an impatience with more traditional candidates and a deep undercurrent of economic dismay. Most specifically, Wisconsin signaled a massive discontent with taxes and inflation -- the pocketbook issues that McGovern and Wallace hit the hardest. In a study of TIME, the attitude research firm of Daniel Yankelovich Inc. found that four of the five top issues that influenced Wisconsin voters were economic. The sixth was the Vietnam War, and McGovern made that into an economic issue as well, emphasizing its continuing costs. According to the survey, 82% of those interviewed said that the Administration's wage and price policies are not working. Fifty-two percent called for overall tax reform, with 41% complaining about high prices and 36% about high unemployment. McGovern and Humphrey both hammered away on the issue of tax reform, of giving the little taxpayer and the working man a fairer break. They shared the rewards: well over half of McGovern's voters and almost two-thirds of Wallace's assailed tax loopholes. The issue cut across both party and ideological grounds, attracting liberals as well as conservatives, Republicans as well as Democrats. The Yankelovich pollsters found a surprising degree of second-choice support for McGovern among the Wallace voters -- support rooted in McGovern's broad anti-Establishment campaign. It was not that Wisconsin voters were running to ideological extremes at the expense of centrist candidates, but rather that both McGovern and Wallace seem to have located an authentic area of concern that the other candidates failed to articulate.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Significantly, the survey found that voters still saw Centrist Humphrey as the Democrat with the best chance to be nominated and, if nominated, to beat Nixon. According to the TIME/Yankelovich survey, McGovern trailed both Wallace and Humphrey among blue-collar workers and union members, but he still got 25% of their votes. More than any other, McGovern came through as someone you can trust. Improbably, he won the Fourth Congressional District, on the blue-collar and ethnic south side of Milwaukee, with the largest concentration of Poles in the state. Muskie, who had emphasized his Polish ancestry, finished fourth. Cross-Overs. Wallace and McGovern worked the same vein of economic distress, but the McGovern vote was moderate-liberal, according to the survey, while the Wallace vote was essentially moderate- conservative. McGovern fared well with young voters (47%); Wallace did poorly. The final results were complicated, of course, by the fact that 26% of the votes cast in the Democratic primary came from Republicans and Independents. The cross-overs cost Humphrey a second-place finish, since most of them went to Wallace. Yankelovich found, however, that most of the cross-overs came not as spoilers but as voters anxious to make their views known on the economy and other issues. Wisconsin served to prolong and compound the suspense of the race. It established the major Democratic theme -- a profound economic disgruntlement -- but not a party leader. It's kind of a scramble now, Humphrey said last week. Coming out of Wisconsin, Muskie still led in committed delegate votes, with 96 1/2.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "McGovern, gaining 54 in Wisconsin, had a total of 89 1/2, trailed by Wallace with 75 and Humphrey with 19. With the delegate-rich primaries in Pennsylvania (182), Massachusetts (102), New York (278) and California (271) still to come, all the candidates are still far from the 1,509 needed for nomination in Miami Beach. For the moment, Wisconsin seemed to have reduced it to a three-man contest among Muskie, Humphrey and McGovern. Although McGovern now ranks as a heavyweight contender, he must still establish that Wisconsin was not a fluke in which the candidate was secondary to the issues. McGovern displayed surprising strength among labor's rank and file in Wisconsin, but his comparative radicalism and long anti-war record have earned him the hostility of many labor leaders as well as Democratic professionals. If McGovern begins to seem a serious threat, many of the regulars might mount a counterattack in favor of Humphrey. Some Democrats fear that a McGovern candidacy might be the equivalent of Barry Goldwater's campaign in 1964 -- an ideological debacle -- and they are already poor-mouthing his victory on the grounds that his excellent Wisconsin organization and Republican cross-over votes distorted the natural outcome. Scenarios. These primaries, said McGovern last week, are going to go on from state to state, from battle to battle.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "His most optimistic scenario now is to win Massachusetts, where his liberal following is strong, on April 25, then Nebraska on May 9, run well enough (meaning third behind Humphrey and Wallace) in Michigan on May 16 and then go on to take Oregon, California and New York. For Humphrey and Muskie, April 25 will be critical. That is the date of both the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania primaries. Humphrey, badly needing a victory, will count on his support among organized labor for a win in Pennsylvania. Despite Wisconsin, Humphrey's camp insists that McGovern is not really a factor -- This is a race between Humphrey and Muskie. McGovern's advisers, meantime, regard Muskie as a political corpse, seeing the race as a head-on collision between McGovern and Humphrey. Muskie had planned to run in Pennsylvania against Humphrey and in Massachusetts against McGovern, to regain momentum. Last week, however, his advisers were discussing a stop-Humphrey ploy with McGovern's forces -- Muskie would concentrate on winning in Pennsylvania while leaving Massachusetts to McGovern. With each future contest, the political equations will change and the pressures increase. It is now highly likely that after all the bloodshed of the primaries, no one will go to Miami Beach with a lock on the nomination. If so, it will be a fascinating week in July. A deadlock would probably eliminate McGovern as too leftward and experimental, even though that might provoke a fourth-party rebellion. Humphrey might also be unacceptable: too much like 1968...a loser's image.", "label": 2}

Or is it possible, as some politicians have already begun to fantasize, that stalemated delegates from all factions of the party will send up a cry from the floor: Kennedy! Kennedy! Success at Last for George I believe the people of this country are tired of the old rhetoric, the unmet promise, the image makers and the practitioners of the expedient. The people are not centrist or liberal or conservative. Rather, they seek a way out of the wilderness. So said Senator McGovern as he officially hit the campaign trail 15 long months ago -- and all but disappeared into the political wilderness. As the earliest declared candidate for the presidential nomination in recent memory, he had a plan: challenge Edmund Muskie before he built up an insurmountable lead, go all out to make a credible showing in the New Hampshire primary, and then, gathering momentum, overtake the field in Wisconsin. Back then, his strategy seemed dreamy, if not downright doomed. Few political leaders took his candidacy seriously, dismissing him as a self-appointed conscience of the party or a stalking horse for Ted Kennedy. The Margin. The professional polls had clearly underestimated George Stanley McGovern, 49, child of the plains, minister's son, college-debate champion, World War II bomber pilot, former history professor, father of five and, according to Robert Kennedy, the most decent man in the Senate.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Decency and doggedness -- traits that served him well when he first ran for Congress in 1956, traveling the dusty side roads for one-to-one meetings in farmhouses and general stores. Taken singly, the encounters were insignificant; taken together, they meant the margin of victory. Recalls Journalist Harl Andersen, who covered the campaign for the Associated Press: George only builds a stone at a time. After a while, though, it begins to show up. In 1962 he moved on to the Senate, winning a seat by only 597 votes. One of the earliest and most persistent antiwar Senators, McGovern began building a small but strong following with his co- sponsorship of the 1968 McGovern-Hatfield resolution calling for an end to the war. Though unsuccessful, the legislation occasioned a rare flash of fire from the quiet man. Every Senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. McGovern fumed. This chamber reeks of blood! When Robert Kennedy was assassinated, McGovern sought to keep Bobby's antiwar supporters together by entering the race in his stead less than three weeks before the 1968 convention. Though he polled only 146 1/2 of the 2,622 delegate votes, the effort gave McGovern the presidential bug. The candidate of 1972 has changed little; he is still the personable but plodding campaigner. McGovern's success is a combination of his persistence and a new, high-powered, appealingly unprofessional organization.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Without the aggressiveness of Bobby Kennedy or the aloofness of Eugene McCarthy, McGovern has forged a coalition of followers from both camps. On one flank are such Kennedy men as Advisers John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., former Kennedy Press Secretaries Pierre Salinger and Frank Mankiewicz, Writers Richard Goodwin and Adam Walinsky. (His principal financial contributors are Max Palevsky, chairman of the Xerox Executive Committee, and Henry Kimelman, board chairman of West Indies Corp.) On the other are legions of young staffers and student volunteers bristling with go-for-George enthusiasm. The spectacle of the old Kennedy pros followed by McGovern's young crusaders, says Eugene McCarthy, is like German officers leading Irish troops. Index Cards. But they march well together. Typical of McGovern's young minions is Gene Pokorny, 26, a scholarly Nebraskan who, says Campaign Manager Gary Hart, has the mind of a revolutionist in the body of Henry Aldrich. Dispatched to Wisconsin a year ago on a salary of $200 a month, he tirelessly crisscrossed the state with clipboard and index cards in hand, organizing and opening 39 McGovern headquarters. When it was discovered that voting day fell during campus spring vacations, Pokorny ran forms in students newspapers which could be exchanged for absentee ballots. By election day an estimated 70% of the students cast their votes for McGovern and the number of workers had grown from 80 to 10,000. McGovern, say staffers, is no softie, despite his easygoing ways. He's a classic Clark Kent, says Aide Ted Van Dyk.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "All calmness on the outside -- serene -- but when crisis strikes, it's into the phone booth. He has other useful traits as well. Accused at a University of Wisconsin rally of being a warmonger for voting for passage of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, McGovern did not turn peevish as Muskie has done in the face of similar baiting. Instead, McGovern asked that those who believed the charge raise their hands; when less than six hands shot up, McGovern moved on to other matters. He has successfully overcome his image as a one-issue peace candidate by promoting his stands on income distribution, tax, reform and decreased defense spending. McGovern projects simplicity, honesty and candor. He remains confident despite the many Democratic leaders who still dismiss his candidacy. Meanwhile, stone by stone, George moves on. What Happened to Muskie? In just one month, Maine's Ed Muskie slipped from the position of the serene front runner to that of an embattled man on the verge of being knocked completely out of the race for his party's nomination for President. Before the plunge, much of the press (including TIME) and many politicians saw him as almost a certain first-ballot winner at the Democratic Convention in July. Now he could easily turn out to be what President Nixon derisively termed him after the 1970 Congressional elections: the George Romney of the Democratic Party. What went wrong? No single reason, or incident, can be cited to explain Muskie's decline.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "There was, in fact, a whole series of mistakes made by political pros, journalists, Muskie strategists and Muskie himself. In the first place, he probably should never have been rated so far ahead. That status was based largely on the fact that national surveys showed him to be the Democrat with the best chance to defeat Nixon -- but those polls do not translate into strength in state primaries. Yet that impression of Muskie's popularity had never really been tested in voting booths nationwide. Muskie had looked cool and impressive as Hubert Humphrey's running mate in 1968, and he exuded much more of a presidential aura than did his G.O.P. counterpart, Spiro Agnew. Yet few voters select a President primarily by looking at the vice presidential candidates, and Muskie's appeal was not really an issue in that election. Muskie was now recognized by most Democratic voters all right, but how did they really feel about him? No one could be sure. Euphoric. Nevertheless, Muskie and his advisers almost euphorically accepted the pleasant notion that he was far ahead of the field -- and they designed a campaign based on that assumption. He would speak cautiously, even vaguely, if need be, on most issues, so as not to antagonize any large blocs of voters. Ignoring his rivals for the nomination, he would campaign against the President. The essence of that campaign would be to portray Nixon as an excitable, expedient politician whose statements were rarely credible.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "By contrast, voters were urged to trust Muskie, the man of integrity. That strategy might have been sound if the premises had been right. Muskie at his best is far more inspiring than Nixon, who does have credibility problems and is unpredictable. Nixon had sounded shrill and unfair as he tried to link Democrats with crime, drugs and antiwar violence during the 1970 congressional campaigns, while Muskie on that election eve effectively deplored such tactics and appealed for a return to reason. Perhaps the voters did long for a calmer, loftier leader. To further the bandwagon psychology, the Muskie strategists won endorsements from big names in the party: California Senator John Tunney, Ohio Governor John Gilligan, Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson III, Iowa Senator Harold Hughes, Pennsylvania Governor Milton Shapp. Each new name made the nomination seem that much more inevitable. This was organizing the party drive from the top down, rather than from the bottom up. Suddenly, the edifice began to crumble, and the entire strategy was shattered. Democratic voters showed that in primaries, at least, they were not all that concerned about finding a contrast with Nixon. They were not looking for a unifier and mollifier. They were in a balky, grumpy mood. They wanted specific answers to specific problems that plagued them. They were more interested in voting against the status quo, and men like George McGovern and George Wallace seemed to offer that chance to protest.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Moreover Muskie hurt his own image as the judicious, controlled candidate by sobbing in the snows of New Hampshire, ironically at the very time that Nixon in Peking was acting as the healer of international passions. This outburst was partly the result of Muskie's emotional and physical fatigue. Trying to be all things to all people, and torn by his commitments to so many primary campaigns, he lost his sense of direction, creating doubts about his ability to stand up under pressure. Fed Up. Muskie's overconfident staff had also erred badly in ignoring grass-roots organizational work. In a primary, voters have to be coaxed to go to the polls and persuaded to select a particular name out of a crowded field. In New Hampshire, the Muskie camp had to send out-of-state organizers in at the last minute to get out a favorable vote. Muskie now concedes that entering the Florida primary was a mistake; once Wallace had entered, he should have known it was hopeless and avoided that first big blow to his front-running status. He relied heavily for support in Florida upon its Democratic state legislators -- but they were tied down by their duties in Tallahassee and were of little help. Muskie came out of his Florida defeat in a new fighting mood. He tackled specific issues, such as taxes and the economy, and began berating his competitors. Yet the turnabout gave Muskie the impression of a man lashing out in desperation, seeking a new image. Muskie's dilemma is painfully difficult.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "He has come across as a fuzzy Establishment kind of politician in a year when voters seem in revolt, and has been unable to put his brand on any issue that can attract that fed-up, turned-off voter. If he cannot beat such lesser-known Democrats, how can he be seen as the man to beat Nixon? He's got to find the ways to tap the anger and frustration that people have about big government and big business, says Senator Tunney, one of his now-disillusioned supporters. I know Muskie favors reform of institutions, but he hasn't been able to convey that. There is perhaps one consolation in all of the Muskie miscalculations so far. If the voters are as unpredictable as they early primaries indicate, similar troubles could lie ahead for the other candidates. Muskie may be no more finished now than he was a shoo-in in January.

{"sentence": "Your budget should include a line item for each spending category you encounter, from housing to cable to healthcare. But many people forget to incorporate one key line item: savings. If your budget doesn't have any wiggle room for savings, then it's time to reallocate your income so that savings come first.

{"sentence": "Many of us have bills that creep up just once a year, like that annual heating maintenance fee or warehouse club renewal. If your budget doesn't already allow for these, look at your records from the past few years and identify the different one-off expenses you encountered. Then add those numbers up, divide the total by 12, and factor that amount into your budget each month.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Let's say you spent $100 last year on a gutter cleaning in January, $400 in April on your annual lawn treatment, and another $100 in June to renew your warehouse club membership. In that case, you'll need to add a $50 line item each month to cover these sporadic expenses. If you pay your homeowners' or renters' insurance all at once, that's another cost to allocate over the course of 12 months.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American household spends $3,008 a year, or $250 a month, on restaurants and takeout. But because most food establishments charge a 300% markup on what they serve, spending that much each year means throwing away a good $2,000 all-in. If you were to cut that spending in half, you'd have an extra $1,000 a year to save, invest, or use to pay down debt.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Owning your own vehicle can be a nice convenience, and in some places, it's truly a must. But if you live in or near a city with ample public transportation, you might consider getting rid of that automobile, relying more on buses, trains, or a bicycle, and pocketing the savings. AAA estimates that it costs $8,700 a year, or $725 a month, to own a vehicle. On the other hand, according to LendingTree, the most expensive public-transportation commute in the nation -- in our capital of Washington, D.C. -- costs $237 a month. Compared to $725, that's a $488 monthly savings.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Even if you were to take an Uber back and forth to work every day in New York City, you'd spend just $705 a month on average, which might still be slightly cheaper than owning a vehicle.

{"sentence": "5. Stop banking on that bonus or tax refund", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Maybe you've gotten a bonus or tax refund over the past few years -- perhaps even consistently. But if you're including that money in your budget, then you're making a big mistake. Bonuses in particular are by no means guaranteed, and if your company has a bad year or you don't meet certain goals, you might not see that extra income this time around.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Tax refunds can be tricky, too. First of all, in an ideal world, you shouldn't be getting a significant refund in the first place, because that's just loaning the government money for free. But even if you've snagged a sizable refund over the past few years, it can be tough to figure out where it came from unless you're really in tune with your finances. It could be, for example, that you were eligible for certain tax credits or deductions in the past that no longer apply. That's why banking on a bonus or tax refund can really hurt you.

{"sentence": "And then there are the points. How much potential value can you get with the Membership Rewards points you earn with the Amex Gold?

{"sentence": "Related: Read CNN Underscored's review of the Citi Double Cash Card.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "While the included credits are worth almost as much as the annual fee each year, they take a bit of strategy to use. The credits are capped at $10 per month, so you can't just use them in one fell swoop. Plus, the list of eligible restaurants is small. If you live in an urban area where Grubhub and Seamless are available, utilizing this credit becomes easier. But if you don't, maximizing the dining credit can be a challenge.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Also, while this won't impact many families, the 4x return at US supermarkets is capped at $25,000 per calendar year with the Gold Card. If you spend more than that on groceries in a year, you'll earn just 1 point per dollar after that.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Finally, it's worth mentioning that Membership Rewards points take some studying and effort to really maximize. Managing transfer partners and dealing with dynamic award charts may feel like too much work for many, and you can't easily transfer Amex points to friends who may view this as a hobby. If you're looking for travel rewards that are easier to redeem, you'll likely want to pick a card like the Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card or Chase Sapphire Preferred Card as an alternative.", "label": 2}

The district has lost 245,000 students over the past fifteen years.

{"sentence": "Numerous experts have estimated the cost of Medicare-for-all, including former Medicare Board of Trustees member Charles Blahous. He estimates the cost to the federal budget at $32.6 trillion. The Urban Institute estimated $32 trillion over10 years as well. Medicare-for-all would double the size of federal government spending. Even a doubling of corporate and individual income taxes would fail to cover its costs.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "But cost is just one issue. Medicare-for-all is mandatory, single-payer national health insurance. There is no opt-out provision, and there are no private health plans, as competition with the government would be illegal.

{"sentence": "Sanders adviser David Sirota has also referenced the speech in the Jan. 7 edition of his email newsletter, Bern Notice, claiming that Biden had lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Paul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code. What's the first thing he decided we had to go after? Social Security and Medicare, Biden said at the time. That's the only way you can find room to pay for it.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "We need a pro-growth, progressive tax code that treats workers as job creators, as well, not just investors; that gets rid of un-protective loopholes like stepped-up basis; and it raises enough revenue to make sure that the Social Security and Medicare can stay, it still needs adjustments, but can stay; and pay for the things we all acknowledge will grow the country, he added.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "A voter asked Biden at a campaign event in Indianola, Iowa, on Saturday about claims she had heard in phone calls that Biden supports Social Security cuts.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Politifacts [sic] looked at it and they doctored the photo, they doctored the piece and it's acknowledged that it's a fake, Biden responded. What we're doing is we're putting out what the actual exchange between [former House Speaker] Paul Ryan and I were. And I have been a gigantic supporter of Social Security from the beginning.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The fact-checking site PolitiFact indeed rated Sirota's claims in his newsletter false, because Sirota omitted some words from Biden's speech to Brookings. Sirota, and a video that PolitiFact does not directly address, do not include Biden's insistence that a progressive tax code must raise enough revenue to make sure that the Social Security and Medicare can stay though those programs still needs adjustments.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "But doctoring a video such that it could be considered a fake, generally refers to footage that is fabricated or tampered with, rather than a video excerpt that is simply lacking the full context.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "What's more, Biden's uses the term adjustments in reference to Social Security after going on a riff about whether affluent Americans actually need their benefits, making it sound as if he implicitly is interested in some form of means-testing or income-based benefit reductions.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Biden's campaign maintains that the plan on his campaign website, which would increase benefits, is what he meant by adjustments. Biden would not so much as consider cutting Social Security benefits in any way, according to the campaign.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Now, I don't know a whole lot of people in the top one-tenth of 1 percent or the top 1 percent who are relying on Social Security when they retire. I don't know a lot of them. Maybe you guys do, he said in his speech to Brookings, before launching into his plans for a pro-growth, progressive tax code.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "As Biden notes in his conversation with the voter on Saturday, his Social Security plan would increase benefits and extend the program's solvency by lifting the cap on taxable income for Social Security purposes. The benefit increases he proposes include the creation of a minimum benefit at 125% of the federal poverty level, tackling poverty in late old age through a benefit bump-up for people collecting benefits for 20 years or more, and a change allowing surviving spouses to keep a larger share of benefits.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "But in the past, some proposals to reform the program that have included at least one of these benefit increases also cut benefits in other ways.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "And as the Sanders campaign is fond of noting, Biden has a long history of endorsing Social Security benefit cuts dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "As then-President Barack Obama's vice president, Biden served as Obama's liaison to Senate Republicans at a time when Obama had put a cut to Social Security cost-of-living adjustment on the table in pursuit of grand bargain that would also increase tax revenue. Obama would make that technical change, the chained consumer price index, part of his 2013 budget resolution, prompting a White House protest where Sanders spoke.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Joe Biden should be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security. The facts are very clear: Biden not only pushed to cut Social Security ― he is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement on Saturday evening. The vice president must stop dodging questions about his record, and start explaining why he has so aggressively pushed to slash one of the most significant and successful social programs in American history, which millions of Americans rely on for survival.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "He then threatened to get non-English speakers in the restaurant deported:", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "My guess is, they're not documented, so my next call is to ICE to have each one of [them] kicked out of my country. They have the balls to come here and live off of my money. I pay for their welfare, I pay for their ability to be here. The least they could do, the least they could do is speak English.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "Trump's failure to codify his preferred policies through legislation, relying instead on a black Sharpie marker to scrawl his signature onto executive actions and then show them off for the cameras, left them vulnerable to Biden's signature on countermanding orders. And so far, the new president has signed dozens of them ― albeit with a ballpoint pen and less flourish, but every bit as effective ― wiping out much of Trump's legacy in a matter of days.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "On his promise to build a wall along the southern border, for example, Trump neglected it entirely during the two years Republicans controlled both the House and Senate, then triggered a monthlong government shutdown to try to coerce Congress into giving him funds to construct it, and finally declared a national emergency that provided a justification for him to raid military construction budgets ― taking money that otherwise would have gone for such things as schools and on-base housing for service members and their families. Doing so allowed him to build 453 miles of new steel fencing along the 2,000-mile Mexican border, although only about 80 miles are in stretches where no previous barrier existed. (Trump had promised hundreds of times during his 2016 campaign that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, but in four years he never made that request even once, and Mexico never paid a dime.)", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "One former White House official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that in Trump's first year, after failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the White House focused on passing the tax cut bill. They got it through while he had both houses of Congress, the former official said.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Cutting taxes, though, is a perennial priority for Republicans and almost certainly would have passed a GOP-controlled Congress with or without Trump's backing. Legislation pushing Trump's own agenda, on the other hand, was almost nonexistent.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "I'm proud of today's executive actions, and I'm going to start by keeping the promises I made to the American people, he said in the Oval Office on Inauguration Day, a tall brown stack of binders on his desk awaiting his signature.

{"sentence": "President-elect Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion worth of new spending on things like direct payments to households, unemployment benefits and a national program for vaccinating people against COVID-19. The Biden plan would support the economy at a time when employers are shedding jobs and an out-of-control pandemic is still killing more than 3,000 Americans daily.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Republicans supported trillions in pandemic relief spending last year, but at a confirmation hearing for Biden's Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen, Republicans prodded the former chair of the Federal Reserve about how much spending is too much.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The one thing that concerns me that nobody seems to be talking about anymore is the massive amount of debt that we continue to rack up as a nation and in fact, the president-elect has proposed a couple trillion dollars fiscal plan on top of that which we've already done, said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). Nobody seems to care much about it.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Yellen said that while the federal budget ought to be on a path that's sustainable, now is not the time to cut back.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The most important thing in my view that we can do today to put us on a path of fiscal sustainability is to defeat the pandemic, to provide relief to American people, Yellen said. To avoid doing what we need to do now to address the pandemic and the economic damage that it is causing would likely leave us in a worse place fiscally with respect to our debt situation.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The national debt is the sum of the federal government's past budget deficits, which result from the government spending more money than it raises through taxes in a given year. Economists have said that too much government borrowing could hurt the economy at some point or limit the government's ability to respond to a crisis, but the ever-widening deficits of the Trump years, which have pushed the national debt to historic levels, do not appear to have caused any problems ― or that much concern among Republicans.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Even before the pandemic, with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, and no recession or national emergency, Republicans abandoned their prior calls for fiscal discipline and added nearly $4 trillion to the national debt through tax cuts and new spending.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "In response to a question from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) about what economic metric might offer a clue that the government is borrowing too much, Yellen pointed to the amount that the government spends on interest on the debt. As a percentage of the U.S. economy, interest costs have risen much more slowly than the debt itself, reflecting the continued willingness of financial institutions to loan money to the government. Net interest outlays actually declined last year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, despite a surge of pandemic borrowing.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "I would submit that we have to find an earlier warning sign because once interest rates start kicking up, in some ways it is too late, Lankford said.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Republicans sometimes dislike federal spending for other reasons that are less theoretical than the debt burden. Business owners complain that federal unemployment benefits put upward pressure on wages, and a booming economy will make it harder for Republicans to retake the White House in 2024.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "During Barack Obama's presidency, Republicans often insisted that any spending on relief for workers be offset by cuts to other parts of the budget, even though the sums at stake typically represented a tiny fraction of what Republicans approved in the Trump years.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "On Tuesday, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) warned low interest rates could rise, that the federal budget deficit is frightening and that Yellen should be a voice of fiscal sanity within the administration.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Yellen pledged to be that voice, but said fiscal restraint is for later. Right now, short-term, I feel that we can afford what it takes to get the economy back on its feet, to get us through the pandemic, and to relieve the burdens that it is placing on households and small businesses, she said, adding that helping a weak economy can result in a lower debt burden long-term.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The debt threat is relatively remote stacked against the threat of plague-related job loss and poverty facing millions of Americans. In her prepared testimony, Yellen anticipated the debt concerns but said they were not a good reason for lawmakers not to mitigate pointless human suffering.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "That's about the amount of tax revenue Microsoft is not paying because it has stashed $108 billion in profits offshore. As revealed in a Seattle Times report last month, Microsoft uses a web of overseas subsidiaries to dodge U.S. taxes, knocking its tax rate down to a minuscule 4.5 per cent on its offshore profits. That's lower than most working families pay.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "But if Nadella really wanted to show his support, he'd stop his company's tax dodging. And Congressional leaders would make true corporate tax reform a priority, forcing big corporations to finally start paying their fair share.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Unfortunately, most tax reform talk these days focuses on the supposed need to lower America's official corporate tax rate of 35 per cent. But as the example of Microsoft proves, that rate is easily sidestepped. Numerous studies have found that, after all their deductions, credits and other breaks, corporations actually pay only about half the official rate. And all those profits stashed offshore have only been taxed at 6 per cent, because they are mostly in tax havens. A huge loophole lets U.S. corporations avoid income taxes on those profits until they are brought home--which may never happen.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Some companies zero out their tax obligation altogether. Boeing, General Electric and PriceLine.com are among two dozen profitable U.S. firms that went five years without paying a nickel in federal income taxes, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "And yet big corporations like Microsoft still want more. They are fighting for legislation in Congress that would exempt all of their offshore profits from any U.S. taxes. Known as a territorial tax system, this will create even more incentives to shift profits--and jobs -offshore. Instead, U.S. corporations should pay the same tax rate on profits no matter where they are earned.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "If Nadella ever does take that seat at a committee witness table, he'd be following the Microsoft tax executive who testified about the company's offshore tax dodging before the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations three years ago.

{"sentence": "The Subcommittee, using Microsoft as Exhibit 1 of corporate tax abuse, called for real reforms. But nothing happened because corporate lobbyists control the agenda.

Most of them died but the mission became a symbol of resistance for Texans, who eventually defeated the Mexican army.", "label": 4}

Instead of looking at the glass is half empty, some argue that these might be good things. There are definitely trade-offs. To increase profits, too many businesses focus on cutting expenses.

McKinsey points out in an article entitled Shedding the commodity mind-set, too many companies leave large amounts of money on the table. Pricing experts know that setting the right price is difficult because, in addition to the physical factors of cost and profit, price is subject to psychological factors. The best companies can do to have control over these psychological factors is to do a great job of branding. And to get the branding right, companies have to know how to develop the right underlying corporate image and positioning strategies. In short, creating a brand image of the product that is impossible, or extremely difficult, to copy is the key to having control over your pricing strategies. If you are able to do that, you will be able to employ the most powerful and effective of all pricing strategies -- What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB).", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "In markets where there is little or no competition, companies can employ a pricing strategy that optimizes profits. It is often called a What The Market Will Bear (WTMWB) price. This strategy sets the price based on the maximum price the market will pay for the product. On the one hand, the company wants to realize the highest profits possible in the shortest amount of time to help recoup high start-up costs, such R&D (research and development), production, and marketing costs. On the other, it may not want its profits to be so attractive as to entice cutthroat competition to enter the market within the time window it needs to build market share and establish a leadership position. This strategy typically works because those likely to buy a new product -- the Innovators and Early Adopters -- are not particularly price sensitive. If there is considerable uniqueness and desirability built into the product brand, your company can employ a WTMWB strategy. If not, you might consider other effective pricing strategies.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "In almost all cases, pricing strategies should begin with a Gross Profit Margin Target (GPMT) strategy. Companies typically know the gross profit margin they need to pay back their expenses and generate positive net income and cash flow. Once your company knows the cost of sales (cost of goods and services sold) of a particular product and the Gross Profit Margin Target it wants, it can easily employ a GPMT strategy. Gross Profit Margin is defined by the formula (P-C)/P, where P=Price and C=Cost of Sales. Anybody can put this formula into a spreadsheet program, and as costs change, recalculate the price that will produce the targeted Gross Profit Margin. Most companies know the GPMT they want.

Studies and experience show that sales will be significantly higher if a product is priced at say $29.95 or $29.99 instead of $30. Most humans focus on the most significant digit - the 2 in this case. To them $29.95 or $29.99 seems a lot less than $30 even though it is only 1 to 5¢ less. Even expensive homes in Beverly Hills might sell for $7,995,000 rather than $8 million. There are exceptions. In upscale restaurants, it is usually a mistake to price an entrée at $31.95. Instead it will be priced at $32-. For some reason, people do not think the food is as good if MSD pricing is used in a high-end restaurant.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "If a product is positioned as unique, smart marketing companies will typically use all three of these strategies in combination. For example, Apple has priced its new iPad Air and iPad Pro starting at $499 and $799 respectively.

It also aims for a GPMT, which is not officially published, but which is in the 30 to 50% GPM range of well-positioned products in competitive markets. When Johnson & Johnson launched a margarine developed in Finland that lowers cholesterol, it priced a tub of this margarine at between $5.79 and $5.99. At the same time, a tub of regular margarine sold for 99¢. Based on this pricing, which used MSD and WTMWB strategies, many speculated that J&J priced the product at 8C, which gave it a GPMT of roughly 87.5%.", "label": 4}

If you have created a product image that is impossible, or very difficult, to copy, you can employ a WTMWB price that will give you a good GPM that enables you to achieve your desired GPMT. And, if you sell your product in a consumer market, it would be a good idea to also employ an MSD pricing strategy. For example, if you are a manufacturer that is targeting a GPM of 50% and your cost of sales is $15, you might consider selling the product for $29.99 - a penny less than the price of 2C.

The price of going too big isn't a crash, but a little unwanted inflation ― something that can be reined in through Federal Reserve policymaking or some tax increases from Congress. These may be unpleasant when they come, but it will be much worse for people to lose jobs, incomes and homes in the meantime.

Even a cursory examination of most of Warren's proposals shows that she is proposing just that, to remove tax subsidies for those who can afford to hire lobbyists and attend expensive fund raisers. Ryan, on the other hand, has been proposing tax subsidies or tax cuts for the very rich in the hope that, once digested by them, some of the remains might benefit the rest of us. Ryan, in short, is a plutocrat enabler, not a conservative and the media has an obligation to inform the public about what he is really proposing.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "It is an open secret that the best political reward is a tax subsidy because it continues indefinitely, is hidden from the public, and never has to be justified once its on the books. That is why the plutocrats have made our tax code so complicated and irrational. As my old boss, Senator Proxmire once said the more complicated a tax provision is, the less justification there is likely to be for it. Everyone, who isn't benefiting from it, agrees that carried interest, for example, should be taxed as ordinary income. Just as everyone, who isn't benefiting from it, agrees it is irrational to encourage the export of jobs and profits by deferring taxes on so-called foreign income. But they remain as part of our tax code because those who benefit from them are willing to spend whatever it takes to defend them while the ordinary citizen, who may know about them, isn't organized enough to mount a campaign against them or those who support them.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The solution to our complex business tax code is to follow Milton Friedman's lead and eliminate all tax subsidies and lower rates so the free market can work without the government picking winners and losers. That's a true conservative's position. Speaker Ryan's proposals, on the other hand, pick the rich as winners and the rest of us as losers.

{"sentence": "As even casual visitors to Washington D.C. can attest, there are no multi-thousand acre tracts of active farmland or forests in the Nation's Capital. These features perform an invaluable environmental function in that they absorb rainwater and prevent it from gushing into - and polluting - lakes and streams. And so, rainwater, especially its virulent form, called stormwater, is a major nightmare for the District. So much so that the District, specifically its water/wastewater utility, called DC Water, has been working through a 25+ year solutioning process with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over what to do with the billions of gallons of stormwater that the District must deal with whenever there is a major rainstorm.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The upshot of this struggle is a consent order under which DC Water must dig enormous caverns - right under downtown DC - to trap the stormwater before it can get to, and overwhelm, their sewage treatment plant. Over the last few years, DC Water has been looking at green infrastructure to see if it offers a cost-effective and more environmentally friendly alternative. Green infrastructure is basically vegetation that absorbs rain. Think of rain gardens instead of cement patios. Think green roofs instead of tiles or sheeting.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Concluding that it was definitely worth a shot, DC Water, the District, the US Department of Justice and the EPA agreed to amend their consent order. The agreement was that DC Water would build about 300 acres of green infrastructure. Before jumping into a massive 300+/- acre project that might cost hundreds of millions of dollars, DC Water decided to experiment with 25 acres first to see what the green infrastructure would actually cost and, second, how much water flow it would actually reduce. So, they picked out 25 acres and installed flow meters to see what the pre-project runoff was.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "DC Water's engineers told them that the project was likely to reduce flows between 18.6% and 41.3%. They said there was a 95% confidence interval that these goals would be reached. On the other hand, there was a 2.5% probability that the flow reduction would be below 18.6% AND a 2.5% probability that the flows would be reduced by more than 41.3%. The project was slated to cost about $25 million.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "So, here's what DC Water and its advisors at Quantified Ventures did.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "They put together a tax-exempt municipal bond that DC Water would issue. They called it an Environmental Impact Bond (EIB). And it is, indeed just that: an environmental impact bond! Remember a few paragraphs above where we said that the goal of environmental finance was to produce the lowest cost. Well it was a stroke of genius on the part of Mark Kim, DC Water's CFO, and Eric Letsinger, the CEO of Quantified Ventures, that they realized that lowest cost didn't necessarily mean lowest interest rate. So they built into the EIB a unique and brilliant feature: if the flow reduction exceeds 41.3%, DC Water will pay the investors an additional $3.3 million. BUT, if the flow reduction is less than 18.6%, then the investors will get $3.3 million less interest.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "This looks like it's backwards. With this Environmental Impact Bond if more environmental benefits are created, the bondholders get MORE money, not less. Not only do they get the satisfaction of improving the environment, but they get an extra cash bonus too.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "So, the question now arises: why would DC Water pay more for success? Well, let us say that the project exceeds its goals by 100%. That could mean that DC Water doesn't need to spend a possible $300 million on 300 acres of green infrastructure. They might be able to spend half of that to achieve their targets. That's could translate to enormous savings. So, why would DC Water pay its EIB investors an extra $3.3 million? The answer is simple: they are happy to pay out $3.3 million because they might save millions more!", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "In other words, DC Water and QV want to motivate investors to support investments that can develop environmentally positive results - motivating by paying for performance - encouraging environmentally minded investors to underwrite the likelihood of success for the project and get paid according to its riskiness - as one does with the rest of the investment market - thus mainstreaming environmentally beneficial projects into the investment community.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "What did the investment world think of this Environmental Impact Bond? What did the market think about Quantified Ventures' proven Pay for Success type of bond? Well, the venerable bible of the municipal bond industry, The Bond Buyer, named the issue the 2016 Non Traditional Deal Of The Year!", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Does this mean the end of the type of green bonds discussed above? No. They will still be issued. There may be no financial implications to such bonds, but they do, after all, create good will. They do let investors know that the bond issuers are doing the right thing for the environment with the investors' money.

With the looming possibility of trade wars, a deterioration in investment climates, and ever tightening lending standards, there is every reason to believe that, as much as the industry has grown - and that growth has been dramatic over the past 25 years - it also stands to grow dramatically in the coming 5-10 years.", "label": 4}

The temptation will be to incorporate a variety of long-term investment transactions and short-term credit transactions into underwriting portfolios, based on the many lessons learned as a result of previous claims. That temptation will be tempered, however, by the realization that history is no longer the teacher it once was. When paradigms shift, meaningfully predicting the future will become an even greater challenge.", "label": 4}

An astounding 95% of English authority bosses plan a council tax hike while 93% said they will increase charges to make ends meet, the LGiU think tank discovered. The greatest immediate pressure on budgets came in children's services (32% of councils) followed by adult social care (28%), and housing and homelessness (19%), the report found. Adult social care was the greatest long-term pressure (38%), the survey said. Lord Porter, Local Government Association Chairman, said councils had been warning a cliff-edge was looming for council at the end of the decade. Some councils continue to be pushed perilously close to the financial edge, Porter said. Many will have to make tough decisions about which services have to be scaled back or stopped altogether to plug funding gaps. Extra council tax raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face. This means many councils face having to ask residents to pay more council tax while offering fewer services as a result.", "label": 4}

Tory austerity has blighted our communities and forced councils to cut and privatise many public services that we all rely on, he will say. The next Labour government will end austerity and properly fund local authorities, instead of cutting back and passing the buck like the Conservatives are doing. But we cannot afford to wait until we are in power nationally. Tory peer Lord Porter said local authorities face a funding gap of more than £5bn by 2020, but children's services was the area most in need of urgent attention. He said: The LGA has warned about the urgent need to address the £2bn funding gap facing children's services. A child is being referred to council children's services every 49 seconds on a daily basis and councils started more than 500 child protection investigations every day last year - up from 200 a decade ago.

But they can only do this this by raising council tax, increasing charging and draining their reserves. The system is unsustainable and needs far more fundamental reform than is presently on offer. It's simply not acceptable that we don't know how local government will work post 2020. Councils are calling for assurances around funding for the next three years and for a fundamental redesign of the finance system. At present government is offering neither. That has to change. Andrew Gwynne, Labour's Shadow Communities Secretary, added: These findings show that after almost eight years of cuts, councils are facing unprecedented pressures to balance their books. When faced with choices; of where to cut, and where to invest - the government has failed to show that they understood the real life, human challenges facing this country. There's now a widespread consensus, across the political divide, that how we fund local public services desperately needs reform, but the Government does not appear to be listening to the sector.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "Recent research supports this thesis. For example, a working paper published last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research reports that increases in the enrollment of foreign students generate substantial gains in university tuition revenues, which partially offset the loss in appropriations [from state funding cuts].

{"sentence": "The economic impact on the national level is significant as well. Across the U.S., the more than 1 million international students who studied in the U.S. last year generated over $35 billion for the U.S. economy. This represents a direct inflow of foreign capital to support U.S. universities and state and local economies. Looking at job creation, the numbers are equally compelling – international students were found to support over 400,000 jobs nationally. This equates to three U.S. jobs created or supported for every seven enrolled international students.", "label": 4}

A research study just released by the Brookings Institution analyzed 16 regions and concluded that in areas that would otherwise likely face economic hardship as a result of industrial job loss, colleges and universities act as an antidote, anchoring tax revenue, a wide variety of jobs, and often supporting industries that benefit from an educated and young workforce.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "When skeptics like my seatmate hear these facts, support for international study programs rises dramatically. At a time of great concern over the fiscal health of our colleges and universities, examples of win-win solutions are hard to come by.

Over the last decades, billions of dollars supposed to be paid on account of taxes, were successfully moved out of the country and pocketed by directors of such corporations. The theory that such untaxed money is used to start new enterprises and create jobs for Americans proved to be totally flawed. Rich are not starting new businesses that create more jobs. Instead, by-and-large, they end up hoarding their tax-avoided funds in their offshore accounts ... or ... buying out small start-ups to stifle the entrepreneurship that might compete with their hegemony.

But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. Last December, about a month before Donald Trump's inauguration, Rebekah Mercer arrived at Stephen Bannon's office in Trump Tower, wearing a cape over a fur-trimmed dress and her distinctive diamond-studded glasses. Tall and imposing, Rebekah, known to close friends as Bekah, is the 43-year-old daughter of the reclusive billionaire Robert Mercer. If Trump was an unexpected victor, the Mercers were unexpected kingmakers. More established names in Republican politics, such as the Kochs and Paul Singer, had sat out the general election. But the Mercers had committed millions of dollars to a campaign that often seemed beyond salvaging. That support partly explains how Rebekah secured a spot on the executive committee of the Trump transition team. She was the only megadonor to frequent Bannon's sanctum, a characteristically bare-bones space containing little more than a whiteboard, a refrigerator and a conference table.

Rebekah wasn't a regular presence at Trump Tower. She preferred working from her apartment in Trump Place, which was in fact six separate apartments that she and her husband had combined into an opulent property more than twice the size of Gracie Mansion. Still, it quickly became clear to her new colleagues that she wasn't content just to chip in with ideas. She wanted decision-making power. To her peers on the executive committee, she supported Alabama senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general and General Michael Flynn for national security adviser, but argued against naming Mitt Romney secretary of state. Her views on these matters were heard, according to several people on and close to the transition leadership. Rebekah was less successful when she lobbied hard for John Bolton, the famously hawkish former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, to be deputy secretary of state.

It's very unlikely that any of them actually worked, he has said. I didn't get to use a real computer until after high school. Robert went on to work for decades at IBM, where he had a reputation as a brilliant computer scientist. He made his vast fortune in his 50s, after his work on predicting financial markets led to his becoming co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world's most successful quantitative hedge funds. A longtime colleague, David Magerman, recalls that when Robert began working at Renaissance in 1993, he and his wife, Diana, were grounded, sweet people.

When, in 2014, Robert accepted an award from the Association for Computational Linguistics, he recalled, in a soft voice and with quiet humor, his consternation at being informed that he was expected to give an oration on some topic or another for an hour, which, by the way, is more than I typically talk in a month. Sebastian Mallaby's account of the hedge-fund elite, More Money Than God, describes him as an icy cold poker player who doesn't remember having a nightmare. He likes model trains, having once purchased a set for $2.7 million, and has acquired one of the country's largest collections of machine guns. For years, Robert has embraced a supercharged libertarianism with idiosyncratic variations. He is reportedly pro-death penalty, pro-life and pro-gold standard. He has contributed to an ad campaign opposing the construction of the ground zero mosque; Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, a group that is associated with fringe scientific claims; and Black Americans for a Better Future—a vehicle, the Intercept discovered, for an African-American political consultant who has accused Barack Obama of relentless pandering to homosexuals.", "label": 4}

But since Robert was so averse to publicity, his ideology wasn't seen as a cause for concern. None of us ever thought he would get his views out, because he only talked to his cats, Magerman told me. Robert's middle daughter Rebekah shares similar political beliefs, but she is also very articulate and, therefore, able to act as her father's mouthpiece.

Under Rebekah's leadership, the family foundation poured some $70 million into conservative causes between 2009 and 2014. [1] 1. According to The Washington Post, the family donated $35 million to conservative think tanks and at least to $36.5 million to individual GOP races.

That the family gravitated toward Andrew Breitbart's upstart website was no accident. The Mercers are purists, says Pat Caddell, a former aide to Jimmy Carter who has shifted to the right over the years. They believe Republican elites are too cozy with Wall Street and too soft on immigration, and that American free enterprise and competition are in mortal danger. Bekah Mercer might be prepared to put a Democrat in Susan Collins' seat simply to rid the party of Susan Collins, a family friend joked by way of illustrating her thinking. So intensely do the Mercers want to unseat Republican senator John McCain[2] 2. Some have speculated that McCain may have angered the Mercers in 2014, when the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which McCain was the ranking member at the time, asserted that Renaissance had used complex financial methods to underestimate its taxes by $6 billion. Renaissance has told The New York Times its tax practices are lawful. that they gave $200,000 to support an opposing candidate who once held a town hall meeting to discuss chemtrails—chemicals, according to a long-standing conspiracy theory, that the federal government is spraying on the public without its knowledge.", "label": 4}

According to the source, Robert shut him down. I don't know any of your fancy friends, he replied, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. And so it seemed almost inevitable that their paths converged with Bannon's when he took over Breitbart in 2012. The Mercers recognized Bannon as an ideological ally. They also appreciated how quickly he improved the website's finances. Unlike many people in their orbit, Bannon wasn't obsequious: According to one person who often spends time with them, he made zero effort to dress up around his benefactors, often appearing in sweatpants and looking almost like a homeless person. Bannon was respectful around Robert, says this person, but with Rebekah he was more apt to say precisely what he thought: He worked for Bob; he worked with Rebekah. Although the Mercers had initially been persuaded to back Texas senator Ted Cruz in the Republican primary, Bannon preferred Trump, and by the time of the Republican National Convention the Mercers were with him.

Rebekah knew of this and arrived at her meeting with props, says the source who strategized with the Mercers: printouts of news articles about Manafort and Russia that she brandished as evidence that he had to go.

They traveled on Robert's 203-foot luxury superyacht, the Sea Owl, and anchored just off the WASP enclave of Fishers Island in New York's Long Island Sound. Their destination, a medieval-style granite castle called White Caps, towered over the shoreline. This was the summer home of Lee and Alice Hanley, Reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in Texas oil and gas but lived mostly between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. Like the Mercers, the Hanleys were convinced that the American political establishment was rotten to its foundations. Unlike the Mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider.

They saw Cruz as a unicorn: a dedicated fiscal and social conservative who had broken with his party repeatedly. They were dismissive of Trump. He doesn't understand politics or geopolitics or anything about the running of the government, Alice Hanley told me recently. Rebekah Mercer saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology. Robert Mercer and Cruz had met before during a conference in February 2014, when Lee Hanley had invited them to the five-diamond Breakers resort in Palm Beach for a grilling session. Robert was impressed by Cruz's intellect, according to a person at the meeting, but worried that the 43-year-old senator was too young and might struggle to capture voters' imaginations. Still, Robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various Hanley homes. Apparently, Cruz can hold his alcohol (his preference is cabernet), which is a prized attribute in the Hanleys' circle.

She wanted to disrupt the conservative movement, too. Rebekah saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a mechanism to promote a more hard-line ideology. According to Politico and other sources, she was frustrated at the time that no one was taking her seriously. As it happened, however, the family owned what seemed to be an ideal vehicle for achieving her goals. Around 2012, Robert Mercer reportedly invested $5 million in a British data science company named SCL Group. Most political campaigns run highly sophisticated micro-targeting efforts to locate voters. SCL promised much more, claiming to be able to manipulate voter behavior through something called psychographic modeling. This was precisely the kind of work Robert valued. There's no data like more data, he likes to say. Robert had made his money by accumulating piles of data on human behavior (markets might move in a certain direction when it rains in Paris, for instance), in order to make extremely precise and lucrative financial bets.

Besides, Rebekah was the political animal in the family. (Her older sister Jenji has practiced law; her younger sister Heather Sue is, like Robert, a competitive poker player). This was a relatively new phenomenon.

It was in 2012 that she really attracted attention in GOP circles when, not long after Mitt Romney lost the presidential race, she stood up before a crowd of Romney supporters at the University Club of New York and delivered a scathing but detailed diatribe about his inadequate data and canvassing operation. Who is that woman? people in attendance asked. With SCL, Rebekah finally had the chance to prove she could do better. The company's American branch was renamed Cambridge Analytica, to emphasize the pedigree of its behavioral scientists. And Rebekah started flying Alexander Nix, the firm's Old Etonian CEO, around the country to introduce him to her contacts.

However, Mike Shields, then the RNC's chief of staff and Data Trust's senior adviser, told me the Cruz campaign was in fact the second to sign an agreement with Data Trust, in 2014. Meanwhile, the red flags kept coming. Wilson found the data scientists that CA sent to Houston to be highly efficient at the day-to-day work of his research operation.

In retrospect, Wilson told people, he believed that Nix resented the campaign for allocating work through a competitive bidding process, rather than favoring CA. Two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Wilson assigned a contract to a firm called Targeted Victory. CA then locked its data in the cloud so it couldn't be accessed by Roe's team. The data remained unavailable until, a Cruz campaign source said, it was pretty much too late to be useful. Cruz won the Iowa caucuses anyway. The Cruz operation became so fed up with Nix that they pushed back, hard, on CA's bill for its second six-month contract. Wilson was able to negotiate the fees down after, as Cruz staffers recalled, a CA representative accidentally emailed him a spreadsheet documenting the Houston team's salaries. (Nix said CA had intended to send the spreadsheet.) Still, the campaign wound up paying nearly $6 million to CA—which represented almost half of the money the Mercers had pledged to spend on Cruz's behalf. The acrimony lingered long after Cruz exited the race in May. When he decided not to endorse Trump at the GOP convention, the Mercers publicly rebuked him.", "label": 4}

Trump has acknowledged the payment but denied the underlying allegations about a sexual relationship.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "That Trump's camp encouraged Cohen to lie to Congress and the public about the negotiations the Trump business had carried on with powerful Russians about a potential Trump Tower real estate deal in Moscow. The statement Cohen prepared, he said, was edited by Trump's lawyers. In a statement provided to NPR Wednesday night, Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump's personal attorneys relating to the Justice Department's 2016 Russian election interference investigation, said Today's testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the president edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Cohen said Trump told him to lie about the medical deferments Trump received that excused him from the draft during the Vietnam War. Cohen said Trump had no medical records to back up his claim of a medical deferment but said he wasn't stupid and had no intention of being drafted.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Trump ordered Cohen to find a fake buyer for a portrait of Trump to make it appear that the painting had sold for a lot of money and was therefore valuable; actually, Cohen said, Trump arranged to use money from his foundation to inflate the sale price.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., emphasized that the check was drawn on the trust that Trump created to give up control of his business after he was elected.

{"sentence": "Meadows also invited an official from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Lynne Patton, who was a former Trump employee. She stood up at the hearing. If Trump is a racist as Cohen charged, Meadows asked, why did he hire Patton, a black woman?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Cohen asked in response why there aren't there any black executives within the Trump Organization. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Mich., called Meadows' showcasing of Patton insensitive.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "This week, NPR and some member stations will be talking about trade on the campaign trail and in communities around the country.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In this presidential election cycle, many Americans are casting votes based on their feelings about past trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and proposed deals, especially the Trans-Pacific Partnership.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But for lots of us, understanding trade deals isn't easy because international commerce creates a complex web of winners and losers — all stretched over a nearly $19 trillion U.S. economy with 323 million people. With an issue so big, how can a voter reach good decisions about candidate positions?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The single most important idea to remember is that in such a large economy, well, it's complicated. Consider this example:", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In February, Carrier Corp. announced it would shut down some manufacturing operations in Indiana and move jobs to Mexico. The U.S. workers are angry, as of course they would be: Their lives are being turned upside down by a cold, corporate decision. How can there be two sides to that story? Carrier provides a slam-dunk example that NAFTA is bad for Americans, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But remember that Carrier is best known for making air conditioners. As recently as 1993, about a third of U.S. homes had no air conditioning. Now, only about 1 in 10 lacks air conditioning. The change largely reflects the plunge in AC prices, thanks to lower production costs. Even a retiree with limited income may be able to afford a foreign-made room air conditioner for as little as $112 at Wal-Mart.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Heat can be deadly for the elderly. Does the pain felt by a laid-off Carrier worker cancel out the relief felt by an 80-year-old Mississippian who finally can afford an air-conditioned bedroom?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Welcome to trade. Let's get started learning.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Polls generally have reflected bipartisan support for trade over many years. In 2000, Gallup found that most respondents said increasing trade with China would help. And such support held up until the recession, when, as a December 2008 poll showed, Americans became more skeptical about trade.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In 2010, as the Tea Party rose up, many anti-establishment Republicans started turning against trade. Business-oriented Republicans (think: Chamber of Commerce) were still very much in favor of trade, but the split with older, blue-collar conservatives was widening.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Despite the recession-related dip and Tea Party backlash, trade bounced back in popularity by 2013 and 2014. Clear majorities of Americans said trade was more of an opportunity than a threat to them. In 2015, Pew found Americans continued to support trade in general — and even TPP specifically.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In January 2016, a Pew poll showed that global trade was not a hot-button issue, at least not when compared with much bigger concerns about economic growth, terrorism and education.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "However, the most recent Pew polling shows anti-trade sentiments have now surged among Republicans (with 40 percent calling free trade a good thing vs. 52 percent seeing it as a bad thing). Those who support candidate Donald Trump are especially anti-trade (67 percent said it was a bad thing vs. 27 percent a good thing). Even though Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have said they oppose the TPP, most Democrats support trade (60 percent good thing vs. 30 percent bad thing).", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Overall, 51 percent of Americans say such trade agreements have been a good thing for this country, while 39 percent believe they've been a bad thing, according to Pew.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What Economists Think About Trade In General", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "A 2012 survey of top economists showed 85 percent say the benefits of free trade are much larger than any effects on employment. Only 5 percent were uncertain. But critics point to data showing trade puts downward pressure on low-skilled factory wages and jobs. They also say the deals have done far too little to protect workers' rights and the environment.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What Economists Say About Trade With Mexico", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "On NAFTA's 20th anniversary in 2014, economists re-examined the fallout and concluded it was largely a wash — with the U.S. losing some and gaining some. After reviewing that NAFTA research, the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank said: The general consensus in the literature is that NAFTA has not had significant effects on aggregate outcomes in U.S. labor markets.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In its NAFTA-impact report, the Congressional Research Service also concluded: NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What Economists Say About Trade With China", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "A recent important study showed that Chinese goods hurt low-skilled Americans. China's immense workforce helps create a lot of wealth in the U.S. (e.g., Apple grew wildly by using China as its manufacturing backshop) but it tends to make low-skilled workers in the U.S. worse off — not just temporarily, but on a sustained basis. Economists also say that low-cost imports from China hold down prices for U.S. consumers.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "U.S. Coalition for TPP: The benefits of trade are clear: better jobs, higher wages, and lower costs for American families.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "What Moody's Says About Trump Proposals", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Trump calls for a 45 percent tax on all Chinese imports, and a 35 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "At the request of the Washington Post, Moody's Analytics recently modeled Trump's trade proposals for Mexico and China. It showed that if Congress were to approve such changes, China and Mexico would fall into recession — and about 4 million U.S. workers would lose their jobs, and another 3 million jobs that otherwise would have been created will be lost.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The U.S. economy would end up 4.6 percent smaller by 2019 than it otherwise would have been, and unemployment would rise to 9.5 percent. U.S. unemployment currently stands at 5 percent.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Chinese imports did hurt a lot of U.S. workers, but most of that may now be in the rearview mirror. That's because so many factory workers already have been replaced, either by low-wage competitors in other countries, or by technology, just as farm laborers were replaced by tractors a century ago. Because of automation, U.S. manufacturers employ less than 9 percent of the U.S. workforce but generate more than 12 percent of GDP.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Book-length critiques of the presidency of Donald Trump keep piling up on American reading tables, so it seems time for a one-volume wrapup on what we have learned so far.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Imagine, for a moment, a high-octane courtroom prosecutor summing up for the jury a case built on the vivid testimony of multiple eyewitnesses.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "More than a dozen previous books by close observers and insider-survivors of the Trump administration have provided that testimony. Now come Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig of The Washington Post to make the closing argument with plenty of reporting of their own.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "You could scarcely ask for more capable advocates. Leonnig won a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting on the U.S. Secret Service in 2015, then joined Rucker and others on a team awarded the Pulitzer for stories on Russian interference in the 2016 election.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Their new, collaborative account — titled A Very Stable Genius: Donald J. Trump's Testing of America — walks readers step by step through the first 30 months or so of a presidency like no other. They leave little doubt that they and many of their sources regard that presidency as an unmitigated and deepening disaster — a threat to American government as we have known it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Two kinds of people went to work for the administration, we are told on the prologue's third page, those who thought Trump was saving the world and those who thought the world needed to be saved from Trump.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Rucker and Leonnig's mission is manifest in their title, a sarcastic jab at one of Trump's more memorable moments of self-congratulation. Accused of being either unthinking or unstable, Trump at the time denied being either. He was, he said, a very stable genius. Whether the president meant that with a touch of self-deprecating humor or not, it functions here as the epitome of self-delusion.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Trump stands accused in these pages of gross incompetence, rampant racism, pathological narcissism, indifference to facts and ethics, and a penchant for chaos. There can be no doubt the prosecutors are asking the jury — and the judgment of history — for a verdict of guilty.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Can a president really be this far removed from the reality base that the rest of official Washington takes for granted? Yes, say Rucker and Leonnig — and what is more, his free-form defiance of norms and restraints is the essence of Trump's governance — and of his enduring appeal to his adherents.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Older readers may recoil from much of this assessment — not only because the behavior described is repellent, but also because its depiction in such relentlessly damning detail is disturbing. People naturally ask: How much of this can be true?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "One example sure to be much discussed is an anecdote from Trump's 2017 trip to Asia, which involved a stopover in Hawaii and a tour of Pearl Harbor. The authors relate how, while en route to the memorial for U.S. service members killed in the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that brought the U.S. into World War II, Trump pulled [Chief of Staff John] Kelly aside for a quick consult.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The authors then have Trump saying: Hey John, what's this all about? What's this a tour of?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Next we are told: Kelly was momentarily stunned. Trump had heard the phrase 'Pearl Harbor' and appeared to understand that he was visiting the scene of a historic battle, but he did not seem to know much else.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Later on the same page, we have one senior former adviser adding that Trump was at times dangerously uninformed.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Kelly formally left the White House at the start of 2019, so is he the senior former adviser being quoted here? Or was the adviser someone who had heard the Pearl Harbor story from Kelly? Or did the Pearl Harbor story come from someone else entirely?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Kelly would seem to be the only person who would have firsthand knowledge of the president's question and of Kelly's own reaction. This is only one of several points in the book where the former Marine Corps general seems the likeliest source on one incident or another.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So if he was the source, why not say so? Perhaps because Kelly spoke to the authors on background or for some other level of attribution.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Previous books about Trump have also prompted debates about sourcing and attribution. Like Michael Wolff's two efforts at exposés and Bob Woodward's Fear, this account relies on a mélange of on-the-record and off-the-record insiders with varying degrees of proximity to the president.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "At times, this mixed methodology presents real problems. We are told many things that some critics or some in the White House or former officials have told the authors. Without questioning the legitimacy of these quotations, can we rely upon them the same way we would trust direct attributions?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "To the authors' credit, the on-the-record elements are compelling on their own. These include attributed material from former strategist Steve Bannon, former transition chief (and former New Jersey governor) Chris Christie and some of Trump's Manhattan peers, Tom Barrack Jr. and Chris Ruddy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Somewhat more speculative are the thoughts indirectly attributed to former White House personnel such as Kelly, including Rex Tillerson (his first secretary of state), Jim Mattis (his first secretary of defense) and Don McGahn (his first White House counsel). All the above come off as valiant public servants who strove to be guardrails — to keep the president's rogue instincts in check – until they were fired or resigned.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We often hear that a particular White House official was surprised or that they felt one way or another. Without a direct quotation, this is either a species of omniscient narrator or an example of reporters protecting their sources. In this work, as in much contemporary reporting, reporters offer a real-time, firsthand narration of events they did not witness personally. We are being given the eyewitness accounts secondhand.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "One such anecdote tells of Trump meeting for the first time with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Trump is quoted saying to Modi at one point: It's not as though you have China right on your border... We are told this prompted Tillerson to cover part of his face with one hand so as to signal something to Modi without Trump seeing it. (For the record, India's 2,500-mile border with China is more than 500 miles longer than the U.S. border with Mexico.)", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "On another occasion, we are told, Trump summoned various officials to discuss the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. companies from paying bribes to foreign governments to secure business contracts. Trump said he wanted that law erased. Told he could not do undo legislation by fiat, Trump reportedly turned to ultra-loyal aide Stephen Miller and said: Steve, draft an executive order to repeal that law.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Those who followed these events in real time may feel as if they are being dragged back through nightmares they would rather forget. At the same time, for those who have not been as focused on the daily and weekly ups and downs, this catalog may come with the force of revelation. For that reason alone, it is highly valuable.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Still, you don't have to be a Trump loyalist to feel the authors have chosen only the incidents and eruptions that cast Trump in the most unfavorable light, a style reminiscent of the muckraking journalists of a century ago. Those who wish to see Trump's offenses balanced against his tax-and-regulation cuts or hear encomiums to his transformation of the federal judiciary will need to look elsewhere.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "As excerpts of the book appear in the Post, we can expect a blizzard of blowback from Trump. In fact, even before publication, he had begun tweeting insults to inoculate his followers against any infection from Rucker and Leonnig's labors — calling Rucker Mr. Off-the-Record and suggesting that the Post's nasty White House bureau chief should not be allowed back on the grounds.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "When Trump sent those tweets, the Post immediately rejected criticism. It stood behind its reporters just as it did in the Watergate era, when the team of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein sparked the larger, official investigations that would drive President Richard Nixon from office. Their work relied substantially on unnamed sources, including one in particular (Deep Throat) who turned out to be the deputy director of the FBI.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We have long relied on front-line reporters from the most prominent news organizations to write books about the powerful figures they once covered. Such books have always trafficked in insider knowledge and insights gleaned from hours spent close to the flame of political power.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Yet there is something unsettling about the evolution of this genre. Is it purely a matter of Trump's excesses or has he occasioned a sea change in journalism as well? Is it all about Trump, or are we also witnessing a new set of standards for the presentation of a presidency — or of politics in general?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In terms of the Trump timeline, this book wraps up around the time the Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 election is being debated. Although special counsel Robert Mueller concludes the Russians did interfere in 2016 in hopes of helping Trump, his report does not find a criminal conspiracy involving the Trump campaign itself. But Mueller also provided a list of occasions when Trump's actions could be seen as interfering with the investigation, adding that he could neither indict a sitting president nor say these actions were not indictable.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Nonetheless, with Attorney General William Barr and Republicans in general treating the report as an exoneration, the authors tell us, Trump felt liberated. As one former official of his administration tells them: There's a new ethos: This is a presidency of one. It's Trump unleashed, unchanged, unhinged.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In their final pages, the authors draw a clear line from that moment to the one when Trump makes the moves regarding aid to Ukraine and his desired investigation of prospective rival Joe Biden — the line that led on to Trump's impeachment.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Whatever may happen to that impeachment effort in the weeks and months ahead, it creates a moment of intermission in the Trump saga and a chance to consider how the landscape has already been altered by this president.

Many people probably remember him because he was such a popular figure on the talk show circuit, both while he was in office and after he left.

{"sentence": "As many people know, after his football-playing days ended, Kemp served as a member of Congress for nine terms, representing western New York.

I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as President. — Hillary Clinton", "label": 5}

But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. He also warned that the Trans Pacific Partnership would mean a million lost manufacturing jobs.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "As for what he would do, in that seven-point trade plan he said he would label China a currency manipulator (people accuse China of manipulating its currency's value to exports cheap, meaning other countries' consumers would buy more), crack down on intellectual property theft, and impose tariffs on countries that cheat.", "label": 5}

She's proposed an infrastructure bank — an idea that has been around in Washington for decades now (at times, with bipartisan support, though it has been more of a Democratic cause in recent years) but that continually fails to gain much traction.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The basic idea is that the government would start a fund — in Clinton's case, $25 billion — and use it to finance major projects, for example through loans and loan guarantees (this CBO report is a good background). This can help spur new private investment that construction projects do not currently attract, as the left-leaning Center for American Progress explained in a 2012 report.", "label": 5}

In fact, he recently overhauled his initial tax plan (which has been removed from his website) in favor of a new plan with brackets that match those proposed by House Republicans, though Trump has said would also add in a zero bracket. His new plan would lower the top rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, and with that zero bracket would have only four brackets, down from the current seven.", "label": 5}

Larry Kudlow, a CNBC commentator and informal advisor to Trump, said the addition to the deficit would now total $3 trillion.", "label": 5}

Lower and middle-income people, meanwhile, would see their incomes change little — some with a slight decline — while the richest one percent would see their incomes fall by 5 percent or more, according to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center.

(However, many U.S. businesses take advantage of tax breaks to pay far less than that 35 percent rate right now.)", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Trump's 15 percent plan may have an unintended consequence, however; he would apply that rate to pass-through business income, which is taxed at a top rate of 39.6 percent.

{"sentence": "The Supreme Court said no matter what the crime, no matter how minor the misdemeanor, no matter what the ultimate punishment is, even if you can't be incarcerated for it, the police have the power to effectuate a full-fledged custodial arrest - that is, take you to jail, book you, lock you up.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And it really - it was such an important case because it opens a gateway into the kinds of arrests and intrusions and jail stays that characterize this low-level world of misdemeanors and minor offenses. And so in many ways, the size and the harshness of the misdemeanor system trace back to Gail Atwater.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: So how long was she in jail?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: Gail Atwater spent a few hours that day in jail. She was booked. They took her personal possessions. She was fingerprinted. She spent the time in the lockup as anybody would if they were arrested for any offense in that jurisdiction.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So although I don't know who Gail Atwater spent her afternoon with in the lockup, it's possible that anyone in her situation could have spent the afternoon with people accused of very serious crimes, violent offenders, people with mental health or substance abuse issues. And she had an arrest record, so her information now is in the booking system. And it's an arrest record that will follow her for the rest of her life.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: When you say she had a record, this is her record. She didn't have one before this.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: Yeah. So let's talk more about what a misdemeanor is. Not having your children wear seatbelts - that's a misdemeanor. But there's a wide range of crimes that qualify as misdemeanors. Can you give us a sense of that range?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: So misdemeanors are minor offenses. Every jurisdiction defines them differently. Typically, they're defined as any criminal offense for which you can do no more than one year incarceration as punishment. But misdemeanors come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Sometimes we call them petty offenses. Sometimes we call them violations or ordinance violations. In Texas, Gail Atwater's offense - her seatbelt offense - even though she couldn't go to jail for it, was a criminal offense. It was a criminal misdemeanor.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Many jurisdictions criminalize their traffic offenses. Even though we don't typically think of speeding as a crime, 25 states define speeding as a misdemeanor. Sometimes people go to jail for these offenses, more often they don't, at least not right away. And so it's a whole world of low-level petty offenses, criminalizing low-level conduct, imposing punishments that are relatively light compared to the kinds of felony sentences that we've become accustomed to.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: So your book is, in part, about the inequality of the misdemeanor system and how it's racially unequal and there's a class system within the misdemeanor system. So I don't know what kind of income the woman who was arrested for the seatbelt violation had, but what are the differences in how that might've been handled between a person who had money and a person who didn't?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: One of the startling things about our enormous misdemeanor system is just how unequal it is. It often goes after low income and impoverished individuals. It sweeps in people of color, often disproportionately, for order maintenance and other low-level offenses. One of the particularly burdensome and inegalitarian aspects of low-level offenses is the effect of imposing fines and fees on misdemeanor defendants.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So Gail Atwater, for example, it appears that she didn't have any trouble paying the $50 fine for her seatbelt violation, but many people do. And for many people, they are set bail for low-level offenses - hundreds of dollars which they cannot pay - and therefore languish in jail while their cases are being resolved.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Jurisdictions also impose fees in addition to fines - user fees that fund the criminal system itself. And so there are all kinds of ways that an encounter with the misdemeanor system generates criminal debt. Individuals who come into the system incur all kinds of debt - fines and fees and bail and other kinds of monetary penalties. And for the low-income individuals who typically, you know, represent the average person who encounters the misdemeanor system, that debt can be crushing.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It can be unpayable, so much so that they end up spending time in jail that they otherwise wouldn't have spent. If they do pay those fines, it can cast them into deep debt, ruin their credit. They may end up on probation solely in order to pay off those fines because the fines are so crushing. So now they're under court supervision, not because they committed a particularly terrible offense or because they need supervision, but merely because they cannot pay.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So there is a profoundly regressive quality to the way that the misdemeanor system deploys fines and fees and bail and monetary sanctions. And because the system is heavily funded by those fines and fees and monetary sanctions, the misdemeanor system turns out to be a kind of regressive tax policy. It's stripping the poor and the - and working people in the system of their wealth and their resources in order to fund itself.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: Let's talk about bail. I mean, what is the purpose of bail, and how do you think it's being misused now?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: The purpose of bail is supposed to be to ensure that people appear for court when they're charged with an offense. When people are charged with an offense, they're, of course, presumptively innocent. They haven't been convicted of anything. So bail has nothing to do with whether anyone is guilty or innocent. It's essentially a deposit that the court can require of an individual to make sure that they come back to court.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But what has happened in the misdemeanor system is that bail has morphed into a tool for raising money, for extracting fines and fees from individuals and has contributed to a sort of misdemeanor version of mass incarceration. Many jurisdictions have bail schedules, a set list of fees for various low-level offenses.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So if you're charged with trespassing, your bail is automatically $500. If you're charged with marijuana possession, your bail is automatically $1,000. These amounts have nothing to do with whether this particular individual is a flight risk, whether they're dangerous. Rather, they're just set schedules.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And for many people, those bail fees are out of reach. And so they remain incarcerated because they can't pay. And so we've seen around the country - many jails are filled with individuals who are there not because they've done anything particularly wrong or pose any particular threat or even a risk of flight but simply because they can't afford to pay bail.", "label": 5}

So in that sense, kind of like traffic tickets, they're an important part of fundraising for the budget.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: And misdemeanors are moneymakers for local jurisdictions. They fund courts. They fund probation offices. They fund public defender offices. They fund prosecutor offices. Some counties and municipalities use them to fund the general budget. It's one of the covert aspects of the misdemeanor system that, in many instances, it's running, not aimed at rounding up dangerous people or solving crimes or protecting public safety but cities and institutions and courts are reliant on the revenue stream that the misdemeanor system produces. It's a real distortion, you know, of what our criminal system is for.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Our criminal system is an extraordinarily important public, democratic institution. We need it to go after dangerous people. We need it for deterrence and for public safety. And yet, the misdemeanor system has quietly converted much of the misdemeanor apparatus into a revenue source. Whatever we think of punishment - whatever we think the purposes of criminal punishment are, raising money is not supposed to be one of them.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: I think, for some areas, the police are expected to - or may be required to - pull over a certain number of people per month. Like, there's a quota. And I'm wondering if you think that contributes to problems within the misdemeanor system.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: We've recently learned through lawsuits and through police officers speaking out that many police departments rely on quotas - sometimes formal, more often informal - pressures on police officers to produce a certain number of arrests or citations or summons in order to measure their productivity or in order to support their promotion or their advancement in the department. And we've heard from police officers just how distorting these formal or informal quotas can be. They put pressure on officers to make arrests that they might not otherwise make, to issue summons and citations that otherwise might not be justified.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "There have been lawsuits in New York from police officers that, when they are assigned to low-income communities of color, under pressure from these quotas, they feel forced to contribute to the racial disproportion of the criminal system - that in essence, because they've been assigned to communities of color, that they have to issue citations, that they have to engage in arrests, even when some other police action or some other intervention might be more appropriate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And it is a distortion of the police function. Police discretion is an extraordinarily important resource in the criminal system. We rely on police discretion to advance public safety, to make sure people are treated fairly. And when we put pressure on police officers to produce citations and low-level arrests when they might not otherwise exercise their discretion that way, we're really interfering with a key aspect of the system's integrity.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: In your book, you write that you were a federal public defender in Baltimore from 2000 to 2003. And one of the things you learned from the people you represented there was that there was a very messy calculation of punishment - trying to decide, like, whether to plead guilty or pay a fine or you know. Give us a sense of what that calculation of punishment is when you're facing a misdemeanor charge and you don't have much money.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: I learned an enormous amount from the people that I represented in Baltimore - listening to their stories, meeting them and their families and hearing how they grappled with the challenges of facing a low-level misdemeanor charge. And I learned that often the calculus of punishment doesn't necessarily shake out the way you would think.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "There might be an assumption, for example, that people would avoid jail at any cost. And yet, for many of my clients, being on probation for a year or two or three years with the burdens and intrusions of probation - having to make appointments and meet with their probation officers monthly, having to be drug tested routinely, giving up their privacy, having the restrictions on their freedom - for many of them, they decided that, for them, going to jail made more sense. Even though they knew that jail was risky, that it was dangerous, that it was painful, the intrusion into their lives and the burdens on their lives of supervision and probation often seemed, in the long run, to be even more disruptive.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Many of my clients lived in dangerous neighborhoods. They were surrounded by dangerous situations. They often felt caught between a rock and a hard place. So I represented individuals, for example, who were charged with misdemeanor gun possession who knew that if they were caught they would be punished. And yet, they felt the pressure from their neighbors - from the people in their neighborhoods that if they did not carry a gun or at the very least were not perceived to be carrying a weapon, that they would be in danger, that they would be seen as a target. It was a heartbreaking calculus that they had to go through.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: So in terms of lack of resources, among the things you're mentioning is the resource of time, that public defenders don't have enough time to represent all the clients that they're supposed to be representing, and judges don't have time to hear all the cases they're supposed to be hearing. So what are the consequences of that?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: The lack of resources in the misdemeanor system is one of the great challenges to the integrity of that process. And the reason that there's a lack of time is because the case loads are so enormous. There are so many people coming in to the misdemeanor system. Thirteen million misdemeanor cases are filed every year in this country. That's 80 percent of American criminal dockets.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so for public defenders - and it's worth noting that every official - every legal official in the misdemeanor system is faced with this crushing case load. Public defenders, prosecutors and judges are all under pressure to move cases along. For public defenders in particular, having hundreds, sometimes thousands of cases that they have to resolve means that they don't have time to talk to their clients.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "They may meet them literally in the lockup in the courtroom 10 minutes before a hearing with no time to discuss the case, the facts, the file. This is sometimes referred to derogatorily as meet-them-and-plead-them lawyering, that essentially your public defender meets you. They tell you what the government's deal is, and they engage in the process of you pleading guilty immediately.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The lack of resources also means that public defenders lack the ability to investigate cases. So there are very few, if any, investigators and public defender offices available for misdemeanors, so if an individual is innocent or if there are witnesses or if there are facts about the encounter with the police or the crime that could be uncovered, that public defender office may simply be unable to unearth that information.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The lack of resources means also that in many ways, the law itself is put aside. Misdemeanor cases can be legally very complicated. They may involve unconstitutional searches and seizures. They may involve unconstitutional statutes. They may involve complicated factual issues. But without the time and resources to engage those questions, there's very little litigation. Motions are not filed. Issues are not aired both because public defenders lack the resources but also because there's enormous pressure on them from prosecutors and judges not to litigate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We've seen around the country examples of judges who actually punish public defenders when they try to litigate issues on behalf of their clients when they want to go to trial, when they want to file a motion. Judges have been known to hold public defenders in contempt or threaten to hold them in contempt because they're holding up the docket.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so it's not the way that we think a judicial system is supposed to work. There's little room for law. There's little room for investigation. There's little room to have the adversarial conversation that we rely on to produce valid cases and valid convictions.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Alexandra Natapoff, author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. She's a professor of law at the University of California Irvine and, before that, was an assistant federal public defender in Baltimore. When we left off, she was describing how people accused of misdemeanors who don't have extra cash on hand face a backlogged justice system with public defenders who don't have adequate time or resources to properly defend their clients, so the clients are often encouraged to take a plea whether or not they're guilty.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "You mentioned that part of the misdemeanor system is often referred to as meet them and plead them, so, you know, lawyers encourage - often encourage their clients to just like plead guilty and get it done with. So if you decide to take the conviction and you take the plea, what are the consequences of that? Now you have a record.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: So one of the great fallacies of the misdemeanor universe is that getting a misdemeanor is no big deal, that it's just a misdemeanor, that it won't dog you for your life. And that has come to be, you know, profoundly untrue. A misdemeanor conviction, although of course not as serious as a felony conviction, still imposes enormous burdens on the people who carry them.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "First and foremost, a conviction is accompanied by punishment. It can be crushing fines and fees. They may be on supervision, on probation for long periods of time. They may be incarcerated. If they're not incarcerated upfront, they may be incarcerated if they violate their probation or fail to pay their fines and fees. And then that conviction will - is a permanent conviction that follows them for the rest of their lives.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We know that it interferes with employment. It can mean that they lose welfare benefits, become ineligible for financial aid for education. They can lose their housing. It can threaten their immigration status. It can disqualify them for all kinds of jobs and licenses.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So the consequences of a misdemeanor conviction are far from petty, even though the conversation around misdemeanors, you know, really doesn't appreciate the impact that they impose.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: So we've talked a little bit about how the misdemeanor system penalizes the poor more than people who have money because the poor can't afford to pay bail or fines or fees. What are the fees that you're referring to?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: So fees are different than fines. A fine is a punishment. It's punishment for whatever offense you are guilty of. It's typically set by statute. The judge decides how severe your fine will be as punishment for your crime. But fees are not punishment. They are user charges, in effect, that the criminal system imposes on people who go through it for all kinds of functions. They're essentially money-raising mechanisms that, for decades now, have been growing and growing as municipalities, counties and states rely more and more heavily on the revenue stream from the misdemeanor system.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So their fees can include jail fees, supervision fees, fees for applying for the public defender, fees for using the public defender, fees for drug testing, fees when they swab your cheek to put your DNA in the database. They'll charge you a fee if you don't show up to court, and they issue a warrant, they'll issue a fee. If you're late paying your fees, they'll charge you a fee.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In many jurisdictions, the list of fees, ranging from a few dollars here to $10, $20, $30 or a hundred dollars there, can add up to hundreds, even thousands of dollars on top of whatever punitive fine the court decides to impose.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: So wait a minute. You're charged a fee for paying - paying for your own incarceration in jail. And you're charged a fee to have a public defender and - when the whole idea of having a public defender is that it's a free lawyer to represent you.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: I think it's hard for people to really fathom just how unfairly the misdemeanor system strips poor people of their wealth, or more accurately, wealth that they don't have. One of the most infamous is fees charged for the application for the public defender. Of course, by definition, you're only eligible for a public defender if you can't afford a lawyer. And yet, nevertheless, many jurisdictions charge a fee - say, a $50 fee - to apply just to get a public defender assigned. And many people forgo a public defender because the fee is prohibitive.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The Supreme Court has upheld the use of what they sometimes called recoupment fees. So if you use a public defender, the state can come after you and ask for money to pay for that even though, again, by definition, you would only be eligible for a public defender because you can't afford a lawyer in the first place.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Jail fees are particularly egregious and ironic for individuals who are being incarcerated precisely because they couldn't pay their fines and fees. Once they go to jail, in many jurisdictions, the jail will then charge them a fee for having been in the jail. There are fees for the use of health care in jails, so many people forgo health care. They forgo their medication because they can't afford the fee in the jail to get access to their medication. It's really this enormous underground wealth-stripping, regressive mechanism that is only just starting to come to light.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: So I just want to make sure - I know a lot of our listeners are probably thinking, is this person arguing that misdemeanors should not be punished or that there shouldn't be misdemeanors or that everybody should just be left alone - no jail, no fees or fines or bail? So what are you arguing for? I mean, you want reform, but you're not arguing to do away with the misdemeanor system.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: No, I'm not arguing to do away with the misdemeanor system. We need to be able to respond to low-level crimes, to low-level harms. It's not OK to take other people's stuff. It's not OK to engage in low-level violence. It's not OK to drive drunk. And so in many ways mirroring the mass incarceration debate, we need to dial it back.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We need to dial back this enormous, bloated misdemeanor system. We need to dial back arrests. We need to dial back incarceration. We need to dial back the penalties and the use of debtors' prison so that the misdemeanor system can do its job, so that it can go after crime and low-level offenses in a meaningful way and impose punishments that are not so wildly disproportionate to the crime.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "What are a couple of the reforms you would like to see in the misdemeanor system?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: So many of the problems of the misdemeanor system flow from its sheer enormity. And there are things that we can do about that. Police could arrest fewer people. We could put less pressure on police officers to arrest and to issue summons when it's unnecessary. Prosecutors can decline more cases. When police officers arrest, prosecutors then have to decide whether that arrest is going to convert into a criminal case or whether it's going to be declined and remain merely an arrest.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And prosecutors could shrink the pipeline by declining more low-level cases in which an arrest is enough. It was enough of an intervention and enough of a punishment - decriminalization, reduced use of jail, the reduced use of bail, as we're starting to see in jurisdictions across the country. There are any number of points along the misdemeanor pipeline which we could meaningfully and sensibly shrink it so that it can - so that the cases that are left can get our full attention.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: Are you convinced that that would not encourage people to break laws because there wouldn't be consequences or at least there wouldn't be consequences as great as there are today.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: So many of the reasons that people are incarcerated in the misdemeanor system have nothing to do with their wrongdoing. When individuals are locked up because they can't pay a fine or a fee, it's not because they're scofflaws. It's because they're poor. When individuals are arrested for loitering or trespassing because the police are under pressure to clear a corner or make a quota, it's not because they're scofflaws. It's not because they're dangerous.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "They're caught up in a system that's using misdemeanor arrest and using misdemeanor processing in unfair and dysfunctional ways. And I think there is a lot of room in our misdemeanor system to scale back those practices so that we can concentrate on misdemeanors that cause real harm - the drunk driving and the assaults and the domestic violence that require our attention and make our misdemeanor system more truly effective and a better deterrent.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: I want to switch topics to an earlier book that you wrote, a 2009 book called Snitching: Criminal Informants And The Erosion Of American Justice. And this book was about the government's use of criminal suspects and criminal defendants to get information in exchange for deals to get, you know, somebody to talk or to, you know, name another person who is guilty of something in return for leniency for the informant's crimes. What do you think is the problem with that kind of approach?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: The problem with snitching, with the use of criminal informants, is that it is the most extreme version of a basic truth about the American criminal system, which is that ours is a system of negotiation. It's essentially a market. Ninety-five percent of all the convictions in this country, felony and misdemeanor, are the result of a plea. They're not a result of a trial. We almost never litigate guilt anymore.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so within this market, we've created a kind of a black market, if you will, of cooperation, of deals between the government and individuals who are suspect or who have committed a crime in which guilt and information and cooperation are traded, often off the record, informally, without constraint.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so this kind of black market of trading guilt and information has really undermined a lot of the integrity of the criminal system. Criminals are getting away with very serious offenses. Often, individual - vulnerable individuals are pressured into becoming informants at great risk to their lives. The government can launder a lot of its mistakes through cooperation and through the plea-bargaining process. So it's an opaque, under-regulated aspect of a market that is all - that hasn't gotten enough attention.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: I know you're also concerned that somebody who is bargaining for leniency in return for information isn't necessarily telling the truth.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: So there's some big, famous problems with the use of criminal informants. One is wrongful conviction. Informants often lie in order to get a deal. Informants also often continue to commit their own crimes. They get a kind of impunity from cooperating with the government. A lot of it is very secretive, so it's a kind of off-the-record aspect - big off-the-record aspect of the criminal justice system.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And all these things work in tandem to create troubling cases and troubling outcomes. It's not that the government should never be able to cut a deal. It's that for such an important public policy, we should know more about it. The government should be more accountable. These cases should be better scrutinized.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: So in light of what you just told us about what you describe as snitching, what do you think of the use of giving information in return for a more lenient sentence as is being done by the Mueller investigation and the Southern District of New York in investigating the Trump administration?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: So in some ways, those deals and deals like them - by which I mean deals cut by wealthy, powerful, well-represented individuals in a highly scrutinized, transparent environment - are the best version of snitching. White-collar crimes, political crimes like these, where the government has very few options to get information about conspiracies or wrongdoing by powerful, insulated individuals, it's - in my view, it's probably the best version of the informant deal.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The kinds of informant deals I think we should be worried about are the ones that are not scrutinized, where people - where defendants, for example, are not represented by counsel, where it takes place off the record where no one ever learns about it, where the informant gets to go on and commit additional crimes because the government finds them so useful. But at the top of the pyramid, if you will, in the highly scrutinized, highly resourced environment of these political crimes and the Mueller investigation, that's about as good as we get in terms of the integrity of these kinds of deals.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: As good as we get, but do you think it's justified?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NATAPOFF: I think time always will tell whether a particular criminal deal is justified or not. And that's a matter for democratic debate. We will know, eventually, what the government learned as a result of these deals. And then the American public can decide whether it made sense to let people who committed serious crimes against our democracy off or gave them more lenient sentences.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I'm not against the use of criminal informant deals in a system where we have already made the decision to negotiate. We live in a world of plea bargaining. And sometimes, it's worth cutting a deal with a terrible person in order to advance public safety and advance justice.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "He said floods in 2018 were evidence that climate change had already come to Pennsylvania. Scientists say global warming will make the state's weather wetter, since warm air holds more moisture.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's affected our farmers, and the crops that they grow, he said. It's devastated our homes. It's affecting us each and every day.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Wolf followed that up with plans to join regional initiatives to reduce carbon from the transportation and electricity sectors.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The steps pleased many in the environmental community, including Joe Minott of the Clean Air Council.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "He understands climate change, believes that it is already having an impact on Pennsylvania and is proposing to address it, Minott said.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "While Minott says Wolf deserves praise, there is a but. The governor also supports fossil-fuel and petrochemical industries that contribute to the emissions he wants to eliminate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Wolf has extolled the jobs that Shell's Beaver County Ethane Cracker will create for Western Pennsylvania. The cracker, a massive plant that will turn natural gas into plastic pellets, would be part of (an) energy efficient future, Wolf recently told a radio interviewer.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I think if we get this right, these are going to be jobs that stay here, he told a group of local officials in Beaver County in 2016.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The plant, which received a $1.65 billion tax credit from Pennsylvania, is under construction, employing around 6,000 people. When it's built in the next few years, it's expected to employ 600.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Along with jobs, Minott says the ethane cracker will be bringing something else to the region — a large carbon footprint.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "For starters, the plant will further entrench the fossil fuel industry in the state's economy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Though it's helped the state lower its electricity sector emissions by 33 percent since 2005 by displacing coal, natural gas has its own carbon footprint. It produces carbon dioxide when burned, and gas wells and pipelines leak the potent greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "On top of that, Minott says, are the cracker's own emissions.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The Beaver County plant is permitted to emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide a year — the equivalent CO2 of 400,000 more cars on the road, according to the EPA's carbon footprint calculator.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The petrochemical plant is itself a humongous emitter of greenhouse gases, Minott said.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Much of that CO2 will come from burning natural gas to process ethane, a natural gas byproduct, into plastic.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Put another way — that would be the equivalent of nearly 4 percent of the state's carbon dioxide budget of 58 million tons of CO2 in the state's 2050 climate target.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's hard to understand how (Wolf) thinks he's going to be able to achieve the reductions that are needed to meet his 2050 goal, while at the same time (promoting) the petrochemical and the gas industry in Pennsylvania, Minott said.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And the Beaver County plant could be just the first of several in the region. ExxonMobil is considering building a petrochemical plant in Western Pennsylvania, according to one report.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Leah Stokes, a scientist at the University of California Santa Barbara who studies climate and politics, says promoting any new fossil fuels at this point — even natural gas — could tip the world over the edge of climate catastrophe by midcentury. Stokes said that even 80 percent carbon reductions would be insufficient to the scale of the climate crisis.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What the modeling shows is that if we want to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which many consider a sort of safe warming level…we cannot build any new fossil fuel infrastructure.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Costa Samaras, an engineer who studies climate change adaptation and resilience at Carnegie Mellon, said meeting the state's climate targets will be made harder by large additions of CO2, like petrochemical plants.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The math is unforgiving, Samaras said. Infrastructure lasts for a long time and a…plant can run for 30, 40, 50, even longer — 60 years. If we think about a budget that Pennsylvania can use, each new fossil (fuel) infrastructure asset is going to use up some of that budget.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But Wolf has maintained that natural gas, while not perfect, can be done better. He's proposed a severance tax on gas, and rules to limit methane leaks at wells and tightening other drilling regulations.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The governor's spokesman J.J. Abbott says Wolf is hemmed in by a Republican legislature that wants fewer rules on oil and gas, not more.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The governor has been a backstop against some of the proposals (by the legislature) that would reduce our ability to hold the industry accountable to high environmental standards, said Abbott, mentioning the Governor's opposition to SB 790, which would reduce some regulations on the conventional drilling industry, and Energize PA, the GOP's plan to incentive petrochemical development in the state.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Wolf's stance on the industry has placated the state's big trade unions, a major source of support in his own Democratic party.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Jeff Nobers, executive director of the Builders' Guild of Western Pennsylvania, said Wolf's pragmatic approach is better for unions in Pennsylvania than that taken by Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The two U.S. senators each has called for a ban on fracking.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I think the governor's trying to take a very middle of the road approach to this — ensuring certain (environmental protections) on one side while still being able to take advantage, and grow an industry, and create jobs.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's also earned him praise from the natural gas industry, which has successfully resisted Wolf's main request of it — a severance tax on gas production. The industry says it already contributes to the state coffers through an impact fee— which in 2018 brought in $251 million.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Like nearly every pragmatic elected official across the political spectrum, Governor Wolf recognizes the compelling environmental and economic benefits of clean-burning American natural gas, said Marcellus Shale Coalition president David Spigelmyer, in a statement. Natural gas remains a strong source of job creation, especially for our building trades and construction laborers, while boosting manufacturing, consumer savings and air quality.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Political observers say Wolf's middle of the road strategy plays well in Pennsylvania, the country's No. 2 gas-producing state.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I think as a Democratic governor in a state like Pennsylvania that Tom Wolf has in many ways found a sweet spot, said Chris Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg College. Borick points to Wolf's two blowout wins in the state as evidence: he won 55 percent of the vote in 2014, and 58 percent four years later.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "He has found a spot that I think aligns very well with Pennsylvania public opinion, Borick said. He's never called for a moratorium on natural gas, but he's been strong in his proposals and demands for an extraction (or severance) tax.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Borick thinks in a purple state like Pennsylvania, Wolf's balancing act might provide a blueprint for other Democrats to win elections.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "He says that while public opinion on climate change is changing — 68 percent of Pennsylvanians believe climate change is a problem that should be addressed, according to a recent poll — it still isn't seen as critical as other issues, like the economy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "People are concerned about it. They think about it. They're seeing it more in their lives, Borick said. But are they at the point where they're willing to go much more in? I don't know if we've reached that point. I think we're headed to that point, but I don't think we're there yet.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Enlarge this image toggle caption Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Calamari is a favorite on American dinner tables. But while the U.S. has a thriving squid industry, chances are the calamari you are eating made a 12,000-mile round trip before ending up on your dinner plate. That, or it wasn't caught in the U.S. at all.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "More than 80 percent of U.S. squid landings are exported — most of it to China. The rare percentage of that catch that stays domestically goes to Asian fresh fish markets or is used as bait.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Ironically, the lion's share of the squid consumed in the United States is imported.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Squid is a labor-intensive product, says Emily Tripp, founder of Marine Science Today, a website on the latest ocean-based research. It's cheaper in some situations to ship it to China to be processed and ship it back.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Tripp, who recently graduated with a masters from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, did her thesis project on California market squid, which, during non-El Niño years, is California's most valuable fishery.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In California, squid is an economic driver of the seafood industry – it's the fifth-largest fishery in the United States by weight. Yet most of this squid is frozen and exported overseas to China to be processed and distributed to over 42 countries across the globe. It's an export market that, according to 2011 figures, is valued at $107 million. Only 1.4 percent of it, on average, makes it back to the U.S. In 2015, that figure was 0.46 percent.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It has to do with the American desire for a larger squid, explains Diane Pleschner-Steele, executive director of the California Wetfish Producers Association. A lot of squid that is shipped overseas stays overseas because they prefer it. They eat it over there. Our consumers typically prefer a larger squid, and so there's just a ton of squid imported into this country that comes in at a far lower price.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In the U.S., the squid that ends up on our dinner table is typically Patagonian squid from the Falkland Islands or Humboldt squid — a jumbo cephalopod fished predominantly in Mexico and Peru.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "California market squid isn't usually desired because of its smaller size.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Our squid is a learning curve, Pleschner-Steele says. If you overcook it, it can taste like a rubber band. But in my opinion, if you do it right, it tastes more like abalone than any other squid. It's nutty, sweet and delicate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The cost of labor is another, perhaps more significant, factor. Squid cleaning and processing is an extremely time-consuming practice. The eyes, cartilage, skin and guts need to be removed ahead of time, and it's cheaper to have this done overseas than domestically.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "A round-trip freight cost to China is $0.10 per pound and labor is just $7 a day there. By contrast, California wages — with tax and health insurance — amount to $12 an hour, according to Pleschner-Steele.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Also, supply chains and markets are incredibly opaque. Pleschner-Steele suspects that as the Chinese middle-class economy has blossomed, a lot of the squid processing facilities are now based in Thailand.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Tripp says during her research, it was nearly impossible to track down where exactly the squid was being processed abroad.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The biggest challenge was trying to find out where the squid goes when it leaves to the United States, she says. No one wants to say where they partner. It's a bit of a challenge. In the United States we keep such good records of all of our fish and seafood. There's no comparable system in China. I couldn't follow the chain backwards.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Regardless, the narrative is the same: Californians aren't eating Californian squid. And if they are, it likely wasn't processed in California.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "At Mitch's Seafood, a restaurant in San Diego committed to local fish, the owners spent three years looking for a California-based squid processor for their calamari. They eventually found a company in San Pedro called Tri-Marine.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We have to pay twice as much for it, but it's worth it so that we can say we offer California-caught and processed squid, owner Mitch Conniff says. Squid that's caught two to three miles away takes a 10,000-mile round-trip journey before I can get it back into my restaurant.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "All Californian fish processors are capable of dealing with squid, Pleschner-Steele says. However, it's not a money-making operation because people aren't willing to pay for it.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Supporting the local squid industry is much more than just helping the local economy – it's helpful from a sustainability angle as well.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Even with squid being sent on a round-trip journey across the world, the California market squid fishery has one of the lowest carbon footprints in the industry.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "California squid fishing fleets are one of the most energy efficient in the world because [they're] so close to port, Pleschner-Steele says. Our boats can produce a ton of proteins for about six gallons of diesel fuel. ... Efficiency is key.", "label": 5}

The North Carolina author took the book world by storm in 1989 with his debut novel, Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All, which became a massive bestseller and spawned an Emmy-winning television miniseries adaptation. Only four books followed after that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Until now. The Uncollected Stories of Allan Gurganus is his first book since 2013, and it's more than worth the wait. The collection is Gurganus at his finest: funny, compassionate, and marked by the author's amazing ability to reflect the lightness — and darkness — in the souls of his fascinating characters.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The collection kicks off with The Wish for a Good Young Country Doctor, which made something of a splash when it was originally published in The New Yorker last spring. The story is narrated by an antique collector reflecting on his days as an American studies graduate student; he was part of a band of merry hippie researchers and cerebral hucksters who frequented antique stores in the Midwest, delighting in every kitschy old toy they managed to dig up.", "label": 5}

[T]he doctor was soon the only person brave or fool enough to duck under the quarantine ropes, ignoring warning signs he himself had nailed to doors of those farmhouses worst hit, the store owner explains. Despite the doctor's help, the townspeople turn on him, blaming him for the wave of illnesses. In La Verne, if we act too kind or smart or interested in much, they'll make us pay. And pay. And pay, the shop owner says.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The collection is Gurganus at his finest: funny, compassionate, and marked by the author's amazing ability to reflect the lightness — and darkness — in the souls of his fascinating characters.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's easy to see why the story resonated so much last year with readers who were just weeks into a pandemic of their very own. In 31 pages, Gurganus spotlights the best and worst in America: the selflessness of those who put their own lives in danger to help others, and the inexplicable mean-spiritedness they're too often subjected to in return. It's a story that hits way too close to home, and Gurganus tells it beautifully, with an underlying anger that nonetheless never turns to cynicism.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Much more hopeful is Unassisted Human Flight, which follows a reporter wrapping up his stint at a small-town North Carolina newspaper with one last big article: a story about an eight-year-old boy who, decades back, was carried by a tornado and left unharmed.

But wherever we wind up, in whatever amount, I think we'll exit riding some force to show us out, the engineer tells the reporter. Death is room-temperature. It has no mass but is a Fact. And nothing's out to torture us except certain other people. No hidden meanness is waiting to trap us.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's a beautiful story that works chiefly because of Gurganus' gift for writing realistic, but still musical, dialogue. He gets the intonations of Southern speech just right, and never condescends to his small-town characters.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The standout story in the collection is Fetch, in which a narrator tells the story of witnessing a middle-aged couple taking their Labrador retriever to the beach. The woman appears gravely ill, with her partner helping her walk: How many months now has he slowed his gait to honor gravity's sudden tax on hers?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Although the weather is inclement, the man throws a stick into the ocean for the dog to fetch, and it soon finds itself struggling to stay afloat, sending the couple into a panic: And you soon hear in their torn scraps of sound how they no longer simply tease or coax the animal ashore; theirs have become cries and screams ascending to the pitch of non-believers' prayers.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's an astounding story (although one that will likely send any dog lovers reading it into a panic attack); Gurganus proves to be a master of pacing, recounting the dog's struggle in exacting, finely observed detail. Remarkably, he tells the story with no dialogue; the narrator only sees the couple communicating in gestures — it's a technique that somehow manages to amp up the tension of the story while still making clear the love the couple have for each other and for their beloved pet.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And like all the stories in the collection, it's full of Gurganus' deep-seated compassion and fascination with — and love for — humanity. This is a remarkable book, and it proves once again why Gurganus is one of the country's most talented and imaginative writers. Coming after a year where nothing went right, and the world was forced to realize that things might not work out in the end, it's a hopeful tonic. As Gurganus writes, We grant ourselves so little daily hope. Meanwhile, barely noticing, we've already managed wonders.", "label": 5}

Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians.

{"sentence": "But even as ISIS claims it fights for Sunni Islam, fellow Sunni Muslims have also been killed and displaced in greater numbers than Christians.

This was the first time the Fed had cut rates outside of an ordinarily scheduled meeting. And they cut by half a point, not a quarter point as they usually do.

{"sentence": "HORSLEY: Well, it is odd because just a day earlier, the market had jumped 4 to 5% on the promise of just this kind of rate cut. So it's a little bit unusual. I spoke to the chief economist at LendingTree, Tendayi Kapfidze. And he just thinks the Fed missed the mark. This is not the kind of medicine the economy needs to deal with the coronavirus epidemic.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "STEIN: Yeah, yeah. It's really fascinating. You know, a surgeon cut a tiny hole in the patient's eye and then dripped in three tiny, little drops of liquid containing billions of harmless viruses that were genetically engineered to carry the genetic instructions for creating this CRISPR gene-editing tool inside the retina. The CRISPR then hopefully cut out the genetic defect that's causing the disease, letting the cells produce a crucial protein that will hopefully heal the sick cells in the retina and giving the patient the ability to see. Here's Eric Pierce. He's the Harvard doctor running this study.", "label": 5}

Remember; you know, nothing like this has ever been done before. So they're starting with a very low dose in an older patient who already had extensive vision damage.

{"sentence": "ELVING: We are not likely to see the 25th Amendment, Scott. It's never been used except for a matter of hours for medical situations. And resignation would not seem to be in President Trump's nature.

That seems unlikely before the scheduled transfer of power on January 20.

{"sentence": "ELVING: Yes, he has already issued a slew of pardons. Many consider some of those to be unsavory, including for his former associates who had pled guilty to lying to the FBI and were about to be sentenced to prison. He has pardoned individuals who killed civilians in Iraq while on contract with the U.S. military. And there is a general expectation he will pardon members of his family and quite possibly himself while he still can, although the actual legal effect of a self-pardon has never been tried and remains very much a matter of debate.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "ELVING: That question will probably dominate his thinking in his last days in office, Scott. Legal machinery is already working in New York state, possibly elsewhere, fashioning cases to hold him accountable, perhaps for tax deficiencies. There have been allegations of bank fraud, misrepresentations about his properties, among other possible charges. And state charges would be unaffected by his pardon power, which is strictly for federal crimes. And let's not forget that just last weekend, Trump got on a phone, was taped with the Georgia secretary of state pressuring that official to, quote, find, unquote, enough votes so that Trump could win.

But have you learned a lot from using the greatest lyricists' work as your template to write your own lyrics?", "label": 5}

And I've always been - part of me - a little embarrassed that I do it and that I'm, you know, kind of ripping off other people's work. But it's only now that I'm - that I've been doing it - and then I've gotten response from others, including the actual artists who originated the work, that I'm appreciating it as an art form.

And Trump endorsed Moore in spite of the fact that several women had come forward and accused Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were underage girls.", "label": 5}

It seems obvious after somebody makes the connection for you, but how did you think of using that melody?", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "RAINBOW: I think other people probably thought that about me, but I have some kind of weird inner quality that - it's just a confidence that I have. I'm very - I'm not very sure of anything in my life, but there's always been something in me that has known that I'm going to get where I'm going, one way or the other. So it really was never a concern to me. I always knew if I just stuck to my guns and did what I wanted to do and put out work that I thought was good and funny and entertaining, it would work out.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: You say you had this, like, confidence. But at the same time, based on what I read, you didn't have that confidence when you were auditioning at cattle calls for Broadway shows.", "label": 5}

And the fact that I've been able to utilize it to get myself out there is really something I'm really grateful for because it's given me the opportunity to produce things, you know, for myself in the way that I want to present myself to the world and then put them out there. I don't know if I didn't have that ability that things would've taken off as they did.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "RAINBOW: Well, just behaviorally and - so much so that my father, who's no longer with us - he actually died shortly after Trump's election - but his campaign was going on, you know, at the end of his life. And even he said that he couldn't watch Trump on TV because it reminded him so much of himself. So these conversations that the world is now having about Trump's behavior are conversations that were had within my family about my dad constantly. So I think that's kind of why I really have his number.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: So what were the similarities?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "RAINBOW: Just that kind of phony, you know, bravado. And there's just, like, a - you know, I hate to put down any group of people, but there's just a generation of, like, New York guy that - he just came from that stock. And it was just - there was nothing genuine, nothing introspective. It was just textbook narcissism. And I think there are - there's a large group of men who are like that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: So how did that affect you growing up?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "RAINBOW: Well, it was hard. I mean, it was - it made things very uncomfortable in my home and - you know, which is why I was locked in my room, making videos with my Barbie dolls.

{"sentence": "RAINBOW: Absolutely. Yeah. And it was a full-time job to sort of, you know, try to brush the cloud away. And you know, that's why I was really happy at 21 to leave the house. And that's kind of where - when my life really began and I kind of came out of my shell.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROSS: How - what was his reaction to you being gay?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "RAINBOW: He was - you know, for as negative a force he was in my life, he was also - he was not the worst. He was very tolerant and did not mind at all that I was gay.

{"sentence": "RAINBOW: I often think of that, and I don't know. She very well might. And I think of that because I was an effeminate kid and - but I don't necessarily think - you know, I know I'm not trans. I don't feel - I don't think I ever felt that I was trapped in the wrong body. But yeah, I think that the lines are a little blurred now, and people are still kind of figuring those things out.

But much to my chagrin, the first show they took me to was Cats.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so I remember having a - you know, a temper tantrum walking under the marquee for Into The Woods. But she would put - my mother put me to bed - I mean, talking about making me gay - I joke, but only half. She would put me to sleep with the cast recordings to Oklahoma and The Music Man.

I don't know what gave me the courage to even come here and live on my own, but I just knew this is where I belong. But I did not go right into the musical theater audition thing.

And if you come in, he'll probably give you a job. So I worked first at Hooters as a host.

{"sentence": "Dana Bash, CNN: According to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. Marco Rubio: Anyone who tells you Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, 'We don't have to do anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,' they're not being honest with you. Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents. For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68....If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow a fast as someone who made less money. Ted Cruz: Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it's irresponsible.....For younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dana, we need to have for younger workers that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts like the 401(k) that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "1. The question from CNN somewhat overstates the problem. Social Security won't run out of money in 20 years. What will happen — somewhere around 2035 — is the program will exhaust its Trust Fund, which Social Security uses to help supplement money from payroll taxes. Even after the trust fund is gone, payroll taxes paid by workers will continue to flow into the system, and those funds will be sufficient to cover about three-quarters of all retirement benefits. In other words, if nothing is done, future retirees could still expect to collect 75 cents for every dollar of Social Security they're owed. (Social Security has a separate program that pays disability benefits, and it faces a more urgent cash crunch. If money from the retirement program is diverted to back fill the disability program, the trust fund will be exhausted a few years earlier.)", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "2. There are a number of ways to close the gap between the money Social Security expects to take in from payroll taxes (the sole source of revenue once the trust fund is exhausted) and what it's expected to pay out in retirement benefits. All of the fixes involve some combination of raising revenue and/or cutting benefits. If policy makers act now, the gap could be closed with relatively modest changes. The longer we wait, the larger the required changes will have to be. Some of the fixes proposed by the GOP candidates would help to narrow the gap, but none would close it altogether.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The basic challenge facing Social Security is demographic. The system relies on payroll taxes from people who are working to pay benefits to those who are retired. That worked well when there were four or five workers for every retiree. But that ratio has now dropped below three workers per retiree and it's drifting towards two. Absent another baby boom or a massive influx of immigrants, that's not likely to change.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "If policy makers take no action, there will still be money coming in to Social Security from payroll taxes. It just won't be enough to cover all the benefits that retirees will be owed. (It will be enough to pay about 75 cents on the dollar.)", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Closing that gap will require cutting benefits, raising taxes, or some combination of the two.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Rubio's proposal: Marco Rubio suggests gradually raising the retirement age at which younger workers like himself become eligible for Social Security. This is effectively a cut in benefits, since retirees would have fewer years to collect. Raising the top retirement age from 67 to 70 as Rubio proposed would fill about one-third of the Social Security shortfall. Rubio also suggested a form of means testing, in which wealthier retirees would see smaller benefit increases in the future. The Senator didn't offer any details, but other means testing proposals have been estimated to reduce the funding shortfall by about 10 percent.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Cruz's proposal: Ted Cruz suggests a different form of benefit cut, in which future retirees would receive smaller cost-of-living adjustments. Some argue that the current inflation measure used by Social Security overstates the price increases seniors face, although others insist cost of living adjustments should be bigger, not smaller. The cut that Cruz suggests would fix about 15 percent of the funding shortfall. Cruz also proposes letting workers divert a portion of their payroll taxes into private retirement accounts. This may or may not be a good idea. It was hotly debated during the George W. Bush administration. But using payroll taxes for any purpose other than Social Security would make the system's solvency problems worse, not better.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Kasich's proposal: John Kasich also advocates means testing with reduced benefits for wealthy seniors.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Trump's proposal: Donald Trump argues against any cut in benefits or increase in taxes, instead relying on faster economic growth to close the Social Security funding gap. Kathleen Romig of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says faster growth would help with this and many other challenges. But she warns it's not a magic bullet. Forecasters have tried to predict Social Security's fate under many different economic scenarios, and there's no realistic growth level that would close the funding gap on its own. Faster growth cuts both ways, increasing revenue from payroll taxes but also increasing benefits, which are tied to wages.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Revenue proposals: None of the Republicans suggested raising payroll taxes, but that's another way policymakers could help to close the funding gap. Payroll taxes for Social Security are currently 12.4 percent, split between employers and employees. Raising that rate to about 15 percent would close the funding gap entirely. (There's a separate, 2.9 percent payroll tax for Medicare.) Alternatively, policymakers could apply the payroll tax to more income. Wages and salaries above $117,000 a year are currently exempt from Social Security taxes. If that cap were eliminated, it would solve about 90 percent of the funding gap.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Any of these fixes can be thought of as items on a menu, to be mixed, matched, and combined in whatever way is most politically palatable. By acting now, policymakers could solve the Social Security gap with a relatively modest increase in taxes and modest adjustments to benefits.

And I think that it's one thing to speak about tax cuts and regulatory reform and speak to the ideological pillars that the party has been known for. It's another thing when the rhetoric and sort of, frankly, you know, the offensiveness of things that he would say from time to time points in such a manner that it leads to violence.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "COSTELLO: Yes, it does. And the part that bothers me so much is that when somebody says something offensive, whether it's the president or someone else, you know, not saying that's wrong, not cleaning it up allows those who are offended by it to think that that's what the party stands for.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "To me, every American is entitled to certain inalienable rights. And if we are judging folks by things other than just them being a human being, then that's a problem. And I think the flip side for Republicans that gets Democrats in trouble is when we just focus on identity politics, which, to me, is very cancerous in our society. But we're not able to have that debate if we have people storming the Capitol with Confederate flags and saying and doing things on social media that are just outright hateful. It disgusts me. And you can't play to that. You have to outright reject it. And you have to say, I'm not interested in your support. I don't want your support. And if you can't say that clearly and quickly, then people are going to assume the worst.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so it is normally the case that a political party has a reckoning when a president loses after their first term. You know, the party has to look inward. They have to decide what they're going to be based on moving forward. And that's where I think we'll be.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Planning For Your Retirement: Understanding Annuities", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "An annuity can be a very smart retirement investment for many people. That's not just because an annuity can provide a secure revenue stream — a monthly check — for the rest of your life, no matter how long you live. On top of that, the longer you live, the more you get what's called a mortality credit as you outlive other people who bought into the annuity. The income gain from that can be many times greater than any other secure investment you're likely to find.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But annuities can also be overpriced, opaque, terrible products, too. So how do you figure out if an annuity is right for you? And if you think it is, how do you buy a good one that's not an overpriced turkey with massive hidden fees?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "To help explain this, we called on Kent Smetters, an economist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He's an expert on personal finance and he's written extensively about annuities in particular.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "A lifetime, or fixed, annuity pays you a constant amount of money until you die, sometimes called longevity protection. Since no one knows how long they'll live, a fixed annuity is similar to Social Security, except most lifetime annuity payments are not indexed to inflation. Overall, it's a very simple product.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Kent Smetters Courtesy of Kent Smetters", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In contrast, a variable annuity is a very complicated product and, as commonly used, provides very little, if any, longevity protection. Instead, variable annuity sellers tout their tax benefits, but these benefits are often overstated and can even lead to higher taxes in some circumstances.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "You can buy an annuity in two forms: an immediate or deferred. Both forms protect you from outliving your retirement savings. An immediate annuity means that you pay a lump-sum amount of cash, usually at retirement, and immediately start receiving annuity payments. A deferred annuity means that you pay for it, often while working, long before you start receiving annuity payments. Due to recent legal changes, you'll soon be allowed to buy deferred annuities through 401(k) plans.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The main advantage of buying annuities on a deferred basis is that you can often lock in annuity payment rates today, well before you retire, when your rates can be different. You can also buy a deferred annuity after you retire, for example, to start at age 80, after you think that you will have exhausted your other resources.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "If you can afford to live well without the income from the immediate annuity, you are better off with the deferred annuity because it provides greater tax benefits and increased longevity protection.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "How does someone figure out if an annuity makes sense?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "1) For an annuity to make sense, you should ideally have saved up in excess of $500,000 in today's dollars for retirement. That's because $250,000 is the amount a couple retiring today should have ready for out-of-pocket medical expenses, even if they are on Medicare, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute and NetBenefits. The other $250,000 is a cushion for other things that might come up.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "2) Think about buying a fixed annuity for the rest of your money. Once you have met your $500,000 goal, start investing in deferred annuities, especially if you are still working. If you are retired, purchase immediate annuities with the rest.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "3) Base your standard consumption on the monies from the lifetime annuity plus Social Security.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "4) If 3) is not enough for monthly expenses, think about reducing expenses. If not, repeat step 1) with $250,000 as your target.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Annuities seem more complicated than just buying, say, an index fund. How do you shop around and make sure you're getting a fair deal on an annuity?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In general, most people should avoid variable annuities because they have high costs and their tax benefits are often overstated. But true lifetime fixed annuities do make a lot of sense, if one can avoid the large commission loads. In essence, they help replace the former pension plans. Be patient and shop around. I would get quotes from several leading annuity providers: MassMutual, MetLife, New York Life, State Farm, TIAA (if you qualify). Look for a firm with an A.M. Best Company rating of at least A+, the best being A++. IncomeSolutions.com provides quotes with low commissions for some other companies.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Are there other risks to consider?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Most states have programs that will guarantee your annuity payments if you insurer (the company that sold you the annuity) goes bust. The insurer cannot legally discuss these programs with you, and so you must investigate your own state rules. However, I don't have great confidence in these guarantees. Still, the risk of outliving your assets is much larger than the risk of you losing money because a major insurance company that sold you an annuity goes bankrupt. And you can reduce your risk by purchasing multiple annuity contracts across several companies.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What if someone has less than $250,000 saved up? They just can't afford an annuity?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "5) If you really can't annuitize anything, live on Social Security plus 3 percent of your beginning assets each year (4 percent if you are quite unhealthy). For example, if a person enters retirement with $200,000 in assets, they will need to adjust their consumption to hit Social Security plus $6,000 per year. If they consume more money than that, they risk running out of everything but Social Security, which has its own problems.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been a passionate proponent of expanding school choice, including private school vouchers and charter schools, and she has the clear backing of President Trump. But does the research justify her enthusiasm?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Experts say one single, overarching issue bedevils their efforts to study the impact of school choice programs. That is: It's hard to disentangle the performance of a school from the selection of its students.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Students are never randomly assigned to a school. A school's population is always affected by local demographics. With schools of choice, by definition, parents and students are making a decision to attend that school, so their enrollment is even less random.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Even when researchers carefully match students at different schools based on demographics, it's possible that families that are more organized and more invested in education are also more likely to seek out charters and voucher programs. Or, selection bias can also work the other way: The students who struggle in traditional public schools may be more likely to seek alternatives.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Further complicating matters is this: By law, most charter schools must have open enrollment, using a lottery if they have more applicants than spots. However, charters, and private schools, have sometimes been accused of using strict discipline rules or other measures to filter out underperforming or otherwise undesirable students.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The admissions policies of voucher-accepting private schools can also vary widely, depending on school policy and state law. Some must have open enrollment. Others retain the right to select students based on religion, academic achievement, artistic talent, conduct, or other factors.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And, no matter where you look, both private schools and charters tend to enroll fewer students with disabilities compared with public schools, a practice known as creaming.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Choice programs seem to push nearby public schools to improve.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The results are consistent, and I don't think there's any debate, says Douglas Harris of the Education Research Alliance at Tulane University. Charters, vouchers and tax credits create competition and positive spillovers. When school choices expand, public schools stand to lose students, and thus money, and they seem to respond by stepping up their game.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Martin Carnoy, a professor at Stanford University who has been studying the issue for decades, terms this response to competition an accountability effect. In other words, When you announce that there's a new sheriff in town, all of a sudden everybody perks up.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Carnoy's studies of cities including Milwaukee argue that this effect fades over time.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "There's far less agreement among researchers on the effects of choice for the students who choose to leave their traditional public school.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "First, charter schools. Charter students in city centers tend to do better than their public-school peers, according to the most recent research by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford. But charter students elsewhere tend to do the same or worse.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And the learning progress of nearly 200,000 students enrolled in 100-percent online virtual charter schools is generally so bad that representatives of the charter sector recently called for states to close many of them.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Second, private schools. Whether students are using vouchers or tax-credit scholarships, their academic outcomes are a similarly mixed bag.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Most studies find modestly positive or neutral impact on student scores, and that's generally limited to African-American students in large urban centers, says Micah Ann Wixom, a policy analyst with the Education Commission of the States.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Martin Carnoy wrote for the left-leaning Economic Policy institute in February: Extensive research on educational vouchers in the United States over the past 25 years shows that gains in student achievement are at best small.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Do voucher students perform better than they would have in their neighborhood school? asks Josh Cunningham, a senior education policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. At the most I can say, 'Maybe, a little bit.' But there's not a lot of evidence that they'll have any substantial academic gains.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Or, as the Center on Education Policy underscored in its 2011 survey of voucher research: Achievement gains for voucher students are similar to those of their public school peers.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But more recent research has found that private schools, like charter schools, can actually hurt the academic progress of the students who choose them. Studies of programs in Louisiana, Ohio and Washington, D.C., found students who left for private schools did worse, not better, compared with their peers.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Scholarship tax-credit programs, like voucher programs, send students to private schools. Their impact is hard to determine, says Harris of the Education Research Alliance.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The best-case scenario seems to be a slight positive effect, but most people would interpret it as no effect, he says.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Finally, when it comes to voucher and tax-credit programs, many states don't even require private schools to administer the state's test. In Florida, it can be any nationally normed test. So these programs are a bit of a black box. Going forward, if private school options expand, we may know less and less about the schools that more and more students are attending.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Oh, and there's another challenge: Most of these analyses rely on test scores alone. Test scores provide an imperfect and incomplete picture of student performance, as the most recent reauthorization of the federal education law acknowledges.", "label": 5}

Actually, the headline of a scathing new Washington Post op-ed by Mitt Romney.

But the gist of this op-ed is a moral and ethical takedown of the president of the United States by a new senator from his own party. This comes as Trump meets with congressional leaders today to talk about border security and presumably come up with a plan to end the partial government shutdown.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "SCOTT JENNINGS: Good morning. Thank you.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MARTIN: I want to read a little more from this op-ed. Basically, Mitt Romney is saying here that President Trump has, quote, not risen to the mantle of the office. He says the president has failed to lead with honesty or integrity. What is your former boss doing here? I mean, he hasn't even been sworn in yet, and he's attacking the president this way right out of the gate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "JENNINGS: Yeah. I think Senator Romney, Senator-elect Romney is doing what he said he would do during the campaign. I recall back in the summer, he wrote in The Salt Lake Tribune that he was going to speak out when the president does things that he doesn't like. He said he was not going to speak out on every tweet, but that if the president is acting in a way he doesn't approve of, he won't hesitate to speak out. I think he's also doing what a lot of Republicans do, which is separate policy from behavior and style. And that is not something that is unique to Mitt Romney. A lot of Republican voters did that when they voted for Donald Trump in 2016. So Mitt Romney has a six-year term, and he represents a state that won't mind if he tackles the president every now and again. And I expect he'll keep doing that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MARTIN: Although at one point, Romney appeared to get over his moral qualms with Trump because he was vying to become his secretary of state. So he has changed his mind before.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "JENNINGS: He has. I wonder if Mitt Romney is not delivering a little bit of payback to Donald Trump, who sort of led him on for secretary of state and then went with Rex Tillerson, of course, there, during the transition. These two guys have a long and interesting history. I suspect this won't be the last chapter that's written. But these Senate terms being six years, it does give you a lot of political freedom, especially at the beginning, to do things that you don't immediately have to answer for from voters back home.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MARTIN: I want to shift and talk about the shutdown and the border security in that fight. But just briefly, do you think this means Mitt Romney wants to position himself to run against President Trump in 2020?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "JENNINGS: No. I can't imagine that to be the case. I mean, I guess if something catastrophic happened to President Trump and he could not run, perhaps Mitt Romney would be a candidate.

{"sentence": "MARTIN: So the president is meeting with lawmakers today at the White House. It's day 12 of this shutdown. Democrats don't have a lot of incentive to back down. Should the president at this point ease up on his demand for the $5 billion for the wall, do you think?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "JENNINGS: Well, you're right. They don't have a lot of incentive to back down, and the president hasn't given them much. But he ought to. In my opinion, the president ought to put something back on the table that he put on the table back during their previous negotiations, and that's fixing DACA. Fixing DACA was part of the president's four-pillars strategy way back earlier in 2018. It's something he has endorsed before. That would give pause, I think, to this Democratic strategy of letting this thing run out for a very long time. A lot of these new members of Congress ran on a fix for DACA. I think a very fair deal here would be 5 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA. That's a win for everybody...", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "MARTIN: Sorry to interrupt you, Scott, but even as outgoing chief of staff John Kelly said in an exit interview, the administration gave up on the idea of an actual physical wall a long time ago, that it was always more about border security, technology. Maybe the president hasn't gotten the memo on that, but do you think that's ultimately where it's going to end up, anyway?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "JENNINGS: Well, I think that the president says he wants a wall, and John Kelly no longer works there. So (laughter) I don't know, as we message this publicly, what this thing's ultimately going to look like. But I know what the president's going to call it, and that's a wall. And I know the Democrats are going to continue to say they don't want just wall funding. That's why I think there has to be something here, something new, to get past the impasse. That's why I think reintroducing DACA as part of this deal could be that something new that gives everybody a way to go home and say, look what I negotiated for you.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Enlarge this image toggle caption Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "If you're a taxpayer, you're in on this system.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We — the U.S. taxpayers — help subsidize farmers by paying part of the premiums on their crop insurance. This helps ensure that farmers don't go belly up, and it also protects against food shortages.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But are there unintended consequences? For instance, do subsidies encourage the production — and perhaps overconsumption — of things that we're told to eat less of? Think high fructose corn syrup or perhaps meat produced from livestock raised on subsidized grains.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Emory University in Atlanta were curious. In a paper published in JAMA Internal Medicine, they point to a disconnect between the nation's agricultural policies and nutritional recommendations.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Americans are told to fill 50 percent of our plates with fruits and vegetables. But here's the contradiction, as the researchers see it: U.S. agriculture policies focus on financing the production of corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, sorghum, dairy and livestock, the researchers write. About $170 billion was spent between 1995 and 2010 on these seven commodities and programs, according to the researchers.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "To evaluate the association between the consumption of these foods and the health of Americans, the researchers used data collected by a federal health survey to analyze the daily diet of 10,308 adults.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The survey was based on 24-hour recall, where participants are asked to name everything they ate over the past day. The researchers then estimate the consumption of subsidized food commodities as a percentage of total calories consumed. So what did they find?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Higher consumption of calories from subsidized food commodities was associated with a greater probability of some cardiometabolic risks, the authors conclude. For instance, they found a higher probability of both obesity and unhealthy blood glucose levels (which raises the risk of Type 2 diabetes) among people who consumed the most calories from subsidized foods.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It makes sense, says one of the study authors, K.M. Venkat Narayan, a professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "He says the findings from this study and prior research suggest that subsidies increase production and consumption of products made from these seven foods. And [consumption] of those foods is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Narayan acknowledges the study has shortcomings. For instance, the methodology — known as a cross-sectional study — captures the association at just one point, a snapshot in time. It's possible if people had been interviewed about their diets on a different day — or over a series of years — a different picture would emerge.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's also possible that farm subsidies have less influence on what we ultimately choose to eat than this study suggests. (More on that below.) So, this paper doesn't prove a cause and effect. However, this is certainly not the first time that U.S. farm policy has been implicated in the obesity epidemic.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The idea that our agriculture policies may undermine the health of Americans has been gaining traction. Consider this: The U.S. devotes less than 1 percent of farm subsidies to support the research, production and marketing of fruits and vegetables, according to this editorial penned jointly by former New York Times columnist Mark Bittman, food writer Michael Pollan, and Ricardo Salvador of the Union of Concerned Scientists in 2014.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The editorial, titled How A National Food Policy Could Save Millions Of American Lives, points out that Michelle Obama [is] warning Americans to avoid high-fructose corn syrup at the same time the president is signing farm bills to subsidize its production.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The writers suggest the government is funding both sides of the war on Type 2 diabetes, a disease that costs the U.S. $245 billion each year. The government subsidizes soda with one hand, by subsidizing corn farmers, while the other writes checks to pay for insulin pumps to help treat diabetes.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But, hold on! Are subsidies to farmers really driving our consumption of sodas or other less-than-healthful foods?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Not so fast, argues Raj Patel, a research professor at the University of Texas, Austin who studies global food systems. Commodity subsidies are a small part of a bigger problem, he writes in an editorial published in JAMA Internal Medicine alongside the new study.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Lots of factors shape our food choices, from our biological attraction to sugar and other energy-dense foods to the convenience of cheap, packaged goodies. So if we wanted to nudge people to healthier eating habits, what policies might we want to change?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "One way would be to limit demand by restricting the advertising of highly processed food, especially to children, Patel writes. As we've reported, despite pledges by the food industry, most foods and beverages marketed to kids are full of salt, sugar and fat. And food behemoths pay millions of dollars to market junk food and soda — for example, Beyonce's $50 million endorsement of Pepsi.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Another way to nudge people away from sweetened drinks is to tax them. As we've reported, the city of Philadelphia recently voted in a tax on sweetened beverages, and a similar measure in Mexico prompted a decline in sales of sugary drinks.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The evidence suggests that the appeal of sugar is so strong that it's tough to pin overconsumption to something as simple as farm policy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Consider this: Sugar hooked us on yogurt. Americans eschewed yogurt until Dannon began adding sugary jam to the bottom. Same story with cereal. Adding sugar to tasteless flakes drove up sales.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And then there's the idea that crop subsidies don't necessarily make food cheaper. Here are two reasons why. First, only a tiny slice — an estimated 15 percent — of the price we pay for processed foods, say, a box of cornflakes or cookies made with wheat and corn syrup, actually goes to the farmer.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "If the price of corn doubles, the price of cornflakes may go up only 10 percent, says Robert Paarlberg, an adjunct professor of public policy specializing in agricultural policy at Harvard's Kennedy School.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The rest of the retail price is set by packaging, processing, shipping and advertising. Some economists have argued that the cardboard box costs more than the corn inside the box, Paarlberg says. So, 85 percent of what we pay for food has nothing to do with commodity prices.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And reason No. 2: Paarlberg argues that U.S. policies actually increase the price of some foods. Take, for example, corn sweeteners. Paarlberg argues that the price of corn syrup is driven up by the fact that the U.S. taxes imports of foreign sugar.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We place an import levy on cheap sugar from abroad, says Paarlberg. We use it like a quota system to keep cheap sugar from the Caribbean or Australia or South Africa out of our market. And without the global, free market competition, that raises the price inside the U.S. market ... for all sweeteners, including high fructose corn syrup, he says. Also, a significant amount of corn grown in the U.S. is used to make ethanol, so this demand also keeps the price of corn up.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So, as you can see, the way in which U.S. farm and trade policies influence Americans' eating habits is complicated. And Paarlberg argues that the cost of commodity crops is a trivial factor in the obesity equation.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Others sound a similar note. Patel argues that many farmers still need the safety net of crop insurance subsidies. He argues that subsidies are vital for indebted farmers who need to pay off creditors.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Yanking away the income on which many depend will do little to help promote more healthful eating or more sustainable farming practices, Patel says.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I heard this same response from other farm economists and academics who study agriculture policy. The authors of the new study suggest we should realign government support programs toward more healthful foods. I would agree with that, Harold Van Es, of Cornell University, told me. Although this does not necessarily imply that we should not support [i.e., insure] the traditional commodities.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Part of the challenge of encouraging broader consumption of fruits and vegetables is the expense. The production costs of fresh fruits and vegetables is relatively high, independent of government support programs, Van Es says.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Many experts agree: We need new thinking about how to incentivize more nutritious food choices at the retail level, especially given that the U.S. government spends far more on food assistance programs such as SNAP, aka food stamps, compared with crop subsidies.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Perhaps this is why the government has begun funding programs, such as a subsidy for food stamp recipients to buy fresh food at farmers markets. Meanwhile, some insurers are experimenting with nudging shoppers to make better choices by offering rebates for healthful food.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Another example? In several U.S. cities, doctors are now prescribing fruits and vegetables — an Rx that can be traded in for free produce at the farmers market. It's part of a program that aims to reshape the buying habits of people at risk of obesity, diabetes and other lifestyle-related diseases.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "At MGM Grand Las Vegas, a bookmaker takes bets on sports events at the round counter at the Race & Sports Book near the casino. Hockey is among the games being broadcast on 47 flat screens above while gamblers sit in leather seats to watch and strategize.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "For years, Las Vegas has held a fairly exclusive lock on legal sports gambling like this in the U.S. But a Supreme Court decision to strike down an act that effectively banned it in most of the rest of the country now means other states can permit and regulate it, too. And while that means more competition for Las Vegas, casino executives and longtime bookmakers in Nevada are welcoming the decision. They say permitting sports betting is good for everyone in the industry. Besides, they say, people come to Las Vegas for more than that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "On this day, Kevin Olson and Josh Sturm are on a guys' trip, mostly to play cards and golf. The sports betting is just the icing, they say.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Honestly, there's a lot of avenues online that you can use, and people that we know and myself use online sports betting quite often, Sturm said. So it's really, it's not a lucrative thing that we have to come to Vegas just to be able to do it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Sturm is referring to the millions of people already betting online. The American Gaming Association estimates that people bet $150 billion on professional and college sports illegally every year.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But Sturm prefers to gamble and make bets in person.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "You know you always wonder 'is there some element of cheating?' I guess, he said.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And soon enough, Sturm and his friends might be able to make these bets — legally and in person — closer to their homes in Austin, Texas.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "If something opens up in Texas, Olson says, I feel like I would be doing a bit more sports betting just year-round. Not just here in Vegas.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But he'll still head to Las Vegas for the experience: golf, cards, slots, shows, restaurants. And that is what bookmakers and casino executives are banking on. They hope that Nevada will be a model for newcomers to the regulated sports betting industry.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Yes, we've enjoyed a monopoly or a near monopoly on sports betting, but Las Vegas benefits when there there's interest in our field, in our field of entertainment sports, sports betting, gambling in general, said Jim Murren, the chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts International. It will promote activity, increase fan interest in the team, in the sport, in the league which we believe will in turn increase their interest in going to the sports mecca of sports betting and gambling: Las Vegas.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Murren says people were also worried about Las Vegas when legal gambling went to other states and to Native American reservations.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And yet Nevada has grown through that period of time, he said.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MGM hopes to expand sports betting to its other properties in the United States and its online betting app. And with it becoming a legal and regulated industry, Murren said, it's just one more step toward erasing the stigma often attached to the industry as predatory.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The traditional view of the casino industry is starting to evolve, but it will be viewed much differently five years from now and this will be a major reason why, he said.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Currently, sports betting is a drop in the bucket of money made in Nevada off gaming. In the last fiscal year, Nevada took in $688.6 million in a tax fee on gambling and just over 2 percent of that came from sports betting according to the Nevada Gaming Association.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The association welcomed the ruling and offered its expertise to other states that will be regulating sports betting.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But what does this mean for bookmakers like Jimmy Vaccaro, who has been doing this work for 41 years?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's a big day, Vaccaro said at the South Point Hotel and Casino just off the Las Vegas Strip. The in-house satellite radio station praised the decision as enlightened.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Now with it being nationwide, it's going to have an impact, there's no doubt about it, he said. It will be a little less only because if you live in California, you don't have to run over here to make a bet, you could do it right from there.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "There will be fewer people through the doors. But there will be plenty of opportunities a lot of other places for people like us to, in a sense, run their book for them, only because of what we have done, only because the way that we do business, only because of what we do and how we handle it, he says. We will get opportunities. I think the opportunity will outweigh drastically the little part that we lose people coming to the South Point.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "All day, Vaccaro has been in meetings discussing the decision.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "There is a lot to be ironed out to make sports betting lucrative — from state taxes in other places to whether the leagues get a cut of the bets.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Bookmaking has changed since Vaccaro started decades ago — betting has moved online and there is a higher cost to air professional football games. But bookmakers adapt, he says.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Presidential candidates typically don't release their tax returns until they've become their party's nominee. President Trump broke tradition and refused to make his tax returns public. As Democrats have continued to make that a political issue, the majority of the 2020 field have made their own financial information public. Biden's campaign points out that he's now disclosed the last 21 years of tax returns, including disclosures during his 2008 run and time as vice president.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Biden's itemized financial disclosure shows that his income came mostly from his book Promise Me, Dad about his late son Beau Biden and the book tour that accompanied its release.

No one could get near him or really, really bother him in the evening 'cause, you know, he'd get home sometimes, you know, 10, 11 o'clock. And sometimes I think he stayed away.

I'd be like, sure, Dad, sure. It would work like a charm. TV comes on, How Green Was My Valley, my dad passes out on the couch. He falls asleep, and I watch all of How Green Was My Valley.

{"sentence": "In late January, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's in the race to become president in 2020, added a new kind of tax to the American conversation, causing anxious pacing on superyachts in every port: a wealth tax. It's a cousin of the property tax, but it encompasses all forms of wealth: cash, stocks, jewelry, thoroughbred horses, jets, everything. Warren calls the policy her Ultra-Millionaire Tax. It would impose a 2% federal tax on every dollar of a person's net worth over $50 million and an additional 1% tax on every dollar in net worth over $1 billion. Economists estimate it would hit the 75,000 richest households and raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's a direct attack on wealth inequality, and it's influenced by the work of French economist Thomas Piketty, whose book Capital in the Twenty-First Century put a spotlight on the increasing disparity of wealth in developed nations. Warren, who informally endorsed a wealth tax while at an event with Piketty in 2015, is the first U.S. presidential candidate to take up the cause.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The disparity in what Americans own is much greater than the disparity in what they earn. Jeff Bezos has a net worth of $135 billion, but his formal salary is less than $100,000 per year. Warren's proposal aims to tap the fortunes of the ultra-rich and use the proceeds to fund social programs. But a wealth tax faces serious hurdles, including lessons from a failed experiment in Europe, the need for significant bureaucratic expansion, and serious questions over whether it's even constitutional.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Normally progressives like to point to Europe for policy success. Not this time. The experiment with the wealth tax in Europe was a failure in many countries. France's wealth tax contributed to the exodus of an estimated 42,000 millionaires between 2000 and 2012, among other problems. Only last year, French president Emmanuel Macron killed it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In 1990, twelve countries in Europe had a wealth tax. Today, there are only three: Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries—and, perhaps worst of all, it didn't raise much revenue.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "UC Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, whose research helped put wealth inequality back on the American policy agenda, played a part in designing Warren's wealth tax. He says it was designed explicitly with European failures in mind.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "He argues the Warren plan is very different than any wealth tax that has existed anywhere in the world. Unlike in the European Union, it's impossible to freely move to another country or state to escape national taxes. Existing U.S. law also taxes citizens wherever they are, so even if they do sail to a tax haven in the Caribbean, they're still on the hook. On top of that, Warren's plan includes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of all a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Warren's tax is also only limited to the super rich, whereas in Europe the threshold was low enough to also hit the sort-of rich. This higher threshold helps it avoid problems like someone having a family business that makes them look rich on paper but, in fact, they're short on the cash needed to pay the tax.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Also important, Zucman argues, the higher threshold means only a small group will be affected. And smaller groups have a harder time fighting for exemptions, which hurt European efforts. Some countries, for example, exempted artwork and antiques on the grounds they were hard to value. It's true, but it creates a huge loophole: Buy lots of art! Economists hate incentives like these because they distort markets. Warren's proposal calls for no exemptions.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But having no exemptions means the U.S. government will have to get very good at valuing art, diamonds, superyachts, and all the other fabulous things the super rich collect. Indeed, Warren's plan includes a call for a significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget. It was the hefty cost of enforcement that played a big part in Austria killing their wealth tax back in 1993. It turns out it costs a lot to track and value rich people's stuff every year.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And a wealth tax may not even be legal. The ability of the federal government to tax is tightly curtailed by the U.S. Constitution. Legally imposing the first income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment. Legal scholars are currently debating whether a wealth tax would need another amendment. The debate, Josh Barro writes, centers on whether a wealth tax would be a direct tax, which the Constitution makes really hard for the federal government to impose.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "While the legality of a federal wealth tax is in question, the current politics of it are not. A new poll finds that even a majority of Republicans support Warren's wealth tax. It turns out President Trump himself once advocated for one too.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "His solution was a wealth tax, but he recognized that exemptions and freedom of travel had doomed the European experiments. So he suggested a global wealth tax: The whole world would decide to do one thing at one rate. That such a solution is highly unlikely is a perfect symbol for the difficulty of getting money from people with the best accountants, the best lobbyists, and the best boats.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "LIASSON: Presidents' budgets are always political documents. They're not a piece of legislation, but they do express the president's priorities. And, of course, the cliche is to say that the president's budget is dead on arrival on Capitol Hill. This one is probably dead as a doornail. And the reason is that Republicans and Democrats just passed a massive, two-year spending bill, which raises the caps for domestic and defense spending. And the White House was mostly a bystander in those negotiations. So what the president says in his budget tomorrow will not affect spending very much. Congress probably won't be passing a 2019 budget resolution. The bottom line is, in this instance, Congress seems to be ignoring the president.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "LIASSON: Well, we're looking forward to what he has to say about this because he really personifies the total reversal by Republicans about deficit spending. They've done a 180-degree turn on this. Most economists say what they just did was fiscally irresponsible, exactly the opposite of what you want to do when the economy is booming, and there's low unemployment. You would rather run a small deficit or a surplus, so you have some room to spend if the economy does go into a recession, which - most economists think it will in the next couple of years because this expansion is getting so old. But instead, Republicans passed a tax cut that adds $1.5 trillion dollars to the deficit. Now the spending bill treasury just announced it's going to issue almost a trillion dollars of new debt next year. That's an 84 percent increase.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "LIASSON: So this is exactly the kind of thing that Republicans railed against when Obama was in office.

They were protected from deportation by President Obama. Trump lifted that protection. He gave Congress a deadline of March 5 before he says he'll start deporting those kids. What Trump wants is a path to citizenship for these kids. In exchange, he wants an end to the diversity lottery, an end to family reunification migration - he calls it chain migration. And, of course, he wants funding for the wall.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What's interesting is when you listen to people on Capitol Hill, including Republicans in Senate leadership, they are really only talking about two of the president's four pillars. In other words, they want border security and wall funding in exchange for some kind of a path to legalization or citizenship for the DREAMers. They think a smaller, more narrow deal is more doable. So most Republicans also think that Donald Trump will sign whatever Congress sends him on immigration. Otherwise, he has to start deporting the DREAMers.

So while changes in trade policy can shift imports and exports from one country to another, for example, reducing the American trade deficit with China while increasing its trade deficit with Thailand, they are unlikely to reduce the American trade deficit overall.", "label": 6}

{"sentence": "California just made it easier for people to get vaccinated. For many, it feels harder than ever. Credit... Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times Gov. Gavin Newsom's announcement on Wednesday seemed sweeping: California would open up eligibility for a coronavirus vaccine to anyone 65 or older, effectively abandoning a rollout plan that was meant to ensure that the most vulnerable would be first in line. A day later, residents of the vast and varied state were trying to navigate what many described as vaccination chaos. Some counties shifted gears immediately, among them Orange County, which said anyone 65 or older could book an appointment at the vaccination site it opened this week at Disneyland. But the scheduling website was quickly overwhelmed, making finding a shot seem like trying to score Taylor Swift concert tickets. Neighboring Los Angeles County, however, stuck with its strict priority rules, and said that vaccines there would continue to be available only to health care workers. The dueling approaches illustrate the tension across the country between two competing imperatives: getting as many doses as possible out quickly, and getting those who are at the most risk protected first. As of Thursday, about 11.1 million people in the U.S. had received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a figure that is far short of the 20 million the Trump administration had hoped to reach by Dec. 31. Most have received only the first of the two necessary doses so far.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "The confusion is hardly limited to California. In New York City, a million residents who are over 65 became eligible to be vaccinated this week, but the reality of actually getting a shot has proved maddening, with buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems and a lack outreach. California, with its decentralized public health system, is a microcosm of the many problems plaguing the national vaccination effort. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti defended the decision to limit vaccinations for now to health workers, despite the state's new directive. This is really about expectations, he said Thursday. Politically, it'd be easy to say, open it up to 65-plus. But he said that would mean that a senior citizen on the city's wealthier west side, living in a large house, could easily take a spot from an essential worker who's younger and living in a crowded home, with no room to isolate. And so when health care workers in Los Angeles arrive at a vaccination site, like the one the city is set to open at Dodger Stadium on Friday, they'll have to present either an employee badge with a photo or another form of documentation of their work. California relies on county health departments like the one in Los Angeles to administer vaccines, and Dr. David Lubarsky, the chief executive of UC Davis Health, said the counties were up against the same problem they faced when trying to ramp up coronavirus testing: too little manpower.", "label": 6}

Jonah Frohlich, a San Francisco-based health care consultant, said that a combination of factors had left county public health departments scrambling to cope with a deluge of monumental tasks. The same institutions that are trying to manage testing, contact tracing and supports for people, Mr. Frohlich said, are the same people who are managing the distribution of the vaccine. Worse, he said, they must work with often outdated and overwhelmed information systems, and organize it all on the fly. This is the kind of program and process that should take years to implement, he said. The counties are doing the best they can, Mr. Frohlich said, but there is a real human cost to delaying the rollout of the vaccine.", "label": 6}

The anticipated shortfall, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, is largely driven by a projected drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties, which have all but emptied out since the pandemic began. Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate, and the economic projections suggest the city's budget will remain in a precarious position for the foreseeable future. For now, the city will partially offset the loss with increased revenues from income taxes: The rich got richer, according to a slide from the mayor's presentation. But the city will still likely have to substantially cut spending elsewhere. This is just a total economic dislocation for certain industries, the mayor said. We've never seen anything like what's happened to the hotel industry. We've never seen Midtown in the situation it is now. Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M.

But deaths from several other leading causes, including diabetes, stroke, heart disease and hypertension, also increased. Since March, at least 400,000 more Americans have died than would have in a normal year. Deaths related to cancer, which have been declining for some time, continued to drop. The new figures also highlight the unique threat that Covid-19 poses to men.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Men died of Covid-19 at far higher rates than women during the second quarter of last year, with 148.1 deaths per 100,000, compared to 124.6 per 100,000 for women. When the figures were adjusted to account for the age differences between the sexes, the disparities were even more stark: the Covid-19 death rate for men was 133.9 per 100,000 during the second quarter of 2020, compared with 86.9 per 100,000 for women. The center has collected data on racial and ethnic disparities in death rates, but has not yet published the research. Another paper published on Thursday, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, calculated that Covid-19 has reduced life expectancy for all Americans by about a year on average, but found that the impact differs dramatically by race. While the life expectancy of white Americans has been shortened by less than a year, to 77.84 years on average, life expectancy among Black and Hispanic Americans has been reduced by two years and three years, respectively, to 72.7 years and to 78.7 years. (Hispanic Americans live longer on average than white or Black people.) The reduction represents the single largest single drop in life expectancy in 40 years.

The greatest rate of excess deaths was found among young adults and people of color. Calculations of the death toll from injuries — a category that includes suicide, homicide, drug overdoses and firearm deaths — were not included in the new data, as reporting on these deaths frequently lags. But a separate N.C.H.S. provisional report on drug overdose deaths during the 12-month period ending in June 2020 found an 18 percent increase over the previous year to 79,251 deaths, up from 67,821 deaths during the previous 12-month period ending in June 2019. In total, there have been more than 384,000 known virus-related deaths in the United States.

James Estrin/The New York Times Laura Engle, 78, lives alone in an apartment in Midtown Manhattan. She uses a walker and has a chronic lung disease. She is exactly the kind of person who most needs a coronavirus vaccine. Yet she has found it impossible to make an appointment and has become lost in the confusing system set up by the city and the state. Computer-literate, she navigated New York City's vaccine finder page on Monday, found the closest provider and sent an email with her name and phone number to set up an appointment. When no one called, she reached out to the urgent care's corporate office, which told her to wait. She wanted to register at the new Javits Center megasite, which she had heard about on the news, but couldn't figure out how. I'm willing to wait my turn, she said, frustrated, but I would like to have some feeling that I have a turn.

The race to vaccinate millions of New Yorkers has reached a critical point, as officials on Wednesday announced that two cases of a more contagious variant of the virus first detected in Britain had been found in New York City, one in Manhattan and one in Queens. The state has used 35 percent of its available vaccine, in line with the national average in a rollout that has gone far slower than expected nationwide. New York City has distributed 38 percent of its shots, with 491,000 available doses as of Thursday. But in the race to get shots in arms, some say the bigger picture about exactly whose arms should be prioritized has been lost. Here we are, facing a global pandemic, with thousands of New Yorkers who have lost their lives, and who is again the forgotten group of people?

{"sentence": "Q: I am 64 and just retired. I haven't taken my Social Security yet. My husband will be 60 and plans on taking an early retirement next year. So, I am holding out on Social Security until then. We don't have huge savings. But my husband will get a pension, and he'll be able to collect on my Social Security until he takes his. He also has a 401(k) plan. Do we have to rollover his 401(k) plan once he retires? Or do we leave it there? If we have to roll it over, what's best to put it in? Savings, IRA? We don't think we should do any investing since it's all we have besides our home and cars.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "A: So, it's never easy to tell someone what to do with their money in the absence of knowing all the facts and circumstances. But there are some observations and general recommendations worth making.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "First, you're to be commended on not taking Social Security yet. Many people, about 62% according to recent research on the subject, do take it early and that decision costs them 8% of their income for every year they take early, says Joe Clark, a certified financial planner and managing partner of The Financial Enhancement Group.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "In your case, Clark says delaying was probably the right call assuming you're in reasonable health.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "That said, your husband and you should probably talk to a qualified, competent and knowledgeable expert (and/or crunch your numbers using any of the online Social Security claiming calculators) whether your plan to claim Social Security next year makes the most financial sense, whether it will produce the largest possible benefit to your household.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "For instance, Clark says it might make more sense from a financial and income-tax perspective for your husband to collect his pension, for he and you to withdraw money from your 401(k) plans/IRAs for living expenses, and for both he and you to delay claiming Social for as long as possible, even to age 70 if possible. Doing so would likely result in the largest possible monthly benefit for your husband and you.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Given that you don't have a large savings I would recommend that you consider living off the 401(k) savings as long as possible and continue to allow your Social Security income to build, says Clark. This will allow you to manage the amount of income that goes on your tax return each year as you can control the distributions and you add 8% to your future Social Security income each year. If the 401(k) has enough you can delay collecting up until age 70.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Q&A: Spousal issues with Social Security leave couples perplexed", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Now, the decision to roll all or some of the money in your 401(k) account to an IRA requires a good deal of analysis as well. For instance, at a minimum, you'll want to compare and contrast fees, expenses and investment options. You'll also want to determine what sort of services you require, whether you want to pay for advice or not and how much, whether you need creditor protection, whether you currently own a good deal of company stock in your 401(k), whether consolidating your respective investment accounts makes sense (note: you can only consolidate your own IRAs not each other's); whether you'll need to use the money in your IRA to pay for higher education expenses; whether – if you plan to keep working – you might want to delay taking required minimum distributions (RMDs), and so on. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to tell you want to do in the absence of learning more about your situation. As for how to invest your money, that too is another difficult question to answer. There are at least two strategies to consider: the floor-and-upside approach and the bucket approach.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "With the floor-and-upside approach, you would use guaranteed sources of lifetime income – your pension and Social Security benefits – to pay for your essential expenses, however you define them. If you have a gap, you would buy additional lifetime income – an annuity, for instance. Or you might consider buying bonds and/or CDs and laddering the maturities.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Then, once your essential expenses are covered with guaranteed sources of lifetime income, you would invest whatever was left over in so-called risky assets – stocks and bonds – to pay for discretionary expenses and to pay for living expenses many years from now. After all, you will want some of your investments to be safe and some to keep pace or outpace inflation, or the cost of living.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The other approach would have you invest in safe assets to pay for expenses over the next one to five years, a mix of safe and risky assets to pay for expenses five to 10 years from now, and risky assets to pay for expenses more than 10 years from now.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Great retirement planning looks at spending, not income", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Keep in mind that actuarial science suggests that when a couple makes it to age 60 and in reasonable health, there's a high probability one of you will be alive at age 90, says Clark. That's 25 years. The days of not having any investments because of age or retirement have passed. You do need to consider reduced volatility in your decision making but it shouldn't be all cash.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Now, should you decide to use the strategy suggested above and spend down your husband's 401(k) and delay your Social Security benefits then you could consider a more cash-type position for your IRA if it will be exhausted in the next two to three years, says Clark. Keep in mind that your 401(k) should also have a money market or short duration bond choice so you don't have to transfer to an IRA to reduce volatility. Remember investing is not as much about age as it is purpose and need.", "label": 7}

President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the U.S. is boosting deliveries to hard-pressed states over the next three weeks to increase vaccinations. I'm pleased that Alabama will receive a slight increase in our vaccine supply. Any margin of increase is appreciated, but we have a long way to go to be able to provide them to any Alabamian who wants one, Gov. Kay Ivey said Tuesday. State Health Officer Scott Harris said Alabama will receive an additional 10,000 first doses in its upcoming delivery. The state had been receiving about 50,000 to 60,000 first doses each week but will see that jump to 70,000 in coming weeks, according to numbers supplied by Harris. That does not include second doses, and Harris said it is unclear if the increase will be sustained longer than three weeks. Ivey said the state will also have the flexibility to redistribute unused doses in the federal program to vaccinate nursing home residents.", "label": 7}

The state currently provides an answering service through which residents seeking appointments can only leave messages, Alaska Public Media reports. The hotline will become available in anticipation of a February shipment of COVID-19 vaccine from the federal government, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's administration said Monday. Tessa Walker Linderman of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services said more than 40 staff members will answer calls from people wanting to book appointments. Many of the workers were previously tasked with tracing the contacts of people who were infected with the coronavirus. A decrease in the number of new cases has allowed those employees to shift to the hotline, Walker Linderman said. Callers may still have to wait, but the system should allow personal interaction within reasonable amounts of time rather than automatically requiring residents to wait for return calls. New appointment openings are expected to be added to the state's vaccine website starting Thursday, officials said.", "label": 7}

It's going to require certain providers that have 40% or more of their doses being reported as unused, they are going to have to submit a plan to the department that tells us how they are going to significantly increase and use that vaccine within the next seven days, Christ said of the new reporting requirements. If we don't agree they've got a great plan, we can take doses back at the state level. Health providers in Arizona are either not reporting that they are administering the COVID-19 vaccine or simply not administering it at the rate state officials want to see, Christ said.

Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen, who dismissed the suit, called the rational basis for the early closing time obvious given the number of people who have died from COVID-19 nationally and in the state. Public health and safety concerns is a rational basis for regulating how and when people gather to dine and drink alcoholic beverages in commercial establishments, he wrote. Hutchinson said he was glad Griffen dismissed the suit but said a decision had not yet been made on whether to extend the early closing time.

Some gorillas showed symptoms including mild coughing, congestion and intermittent lethargy. The silverback named Winston had pneumonia, likely caused by the virus, as well as heart disease. He has been more active since being put on antibiotics and heart medication, as well as receiving an antibody treatment – a therapy to block the virus from infecting cells, San Diego Zoo Safari Park said in a statement.

Judges have the power to apply legal criteria differently when weighing requests for so-called compassionate release, Colorado Politics reports. Federal inmates can petition courts directly if there are extraordinary and compelling reasons to leave prison, which could include elevated threat to life from COVID-19. In 24 opinions published from September through December in response to compassionate release requests, judges in the U.S. District Court in Colorado found the health condition of inmates or the level of virus transmission in prisons was not severe. The judges commonly denied requests to those who were not 65 or older, who had not served 75% of their sentence, or whose family circumstances did not merit release. In two opinions denying compassionate release, Senior Judge Marcia S. Krieger found that inmates may be safer from COVID-19 in prison than outside of it.", "label": 7}

Jody Barr, the executive director of AFSCME Council 4, said the union was told there would be a plan to vaccinate prison employees by early January, but they have yet to hear when they might get the vaccine or how it will be distributed to them. The department has not asked the correction officers how many of them are willing to take it, Barr said. And without knowing how many vaccines you are going to need, how can they have a plan to distribute it? Correction officers are among the essential workers in the state's 1b group, making them eligible for the vaccine. But the governor's office has said that, because it is receiving only about 46,000 doses a week for those getting a first shot of the two-dose regimen, it is limiting appointments for the time being to people over age 75. Appointments are expected to be expanded in about two weeks to those over 65.

Neither Georgetown University nor MedStar Health/MedStar Georgetown University Hospital reportedly authorized the vaccine for students who did not fit the criteria.

Later in the day, President Joe Biden announced that states would get a roughly 16% increase in deliveries over the coming weeks, allowing more Floridians to get a shot in the arm against a disease that has killed more than 25,600 in the state. The rise in shipments translates to 307,000 first doses and 254,000 booster shots for Florida, according to the state health department. While good news for those waiting to get inoculated, it surely won't satiate the demand for the vaccine – even if the increased shipment does help ease concerns about availability for the growing number awaiting booster shots. Of the more than 1.4 million in Florida who have gotten shots, less than 11% have gotten their second dose, according to the latest records provided by the state Health Department.

Democratic Gov. David Ige proposed the commemoration of Washington Place, the longtime residence of Queen Liliuokalani and a dozen governors, Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Honolulu property, which became a museum and state reception venue nearly two decades ago, turns 175 years old this year. The $53,000 tab represents a tiny portion of Ige's proposed $15.4 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. But the cost has been questioned in the face of impending cuts to state jobs, programs and services. Hawaii faces projected $1.4 billion revenue shortfalls for each of the next four years. What kind of celebration is being planned during COVID, with the inability to gather, that would require that much (money), Democratic Rep.

Numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show Idaho has been distributed vaccine at a rate of 10,298 doses for every 100,000 residents, less per capita than any state but South Carolina. We've reached out to the new administration to lodge our concern, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said Tuesday. Officials with the Biden' administration told Jeppesen they weren't sure why Idaho's distribution was lower but would look into it, he said. Demand for the limited doses has been high and is expected to increase dramatically Feb. 1, when Idaho residents 65 and older will become eligible. It's been impossible for public health officials to adequately track whether the priority group guidelines have been followed correctly or whether some traditionally disadvantaged populations have been offered the vaccine at equitable rates.

But according to the attorney general's office, all had been repeatedly reminded of the rules before facing enforcement action. For example, a general store in Loudon was warned more than 10 times that workers must wear masks, but it refused to comply and posted a sign that read: Please refer to the Constitution of the United States! We know how to wash our hands, clean surfaces and NOT cough or sneeze on people.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Trenton: The state is set to get a 30% increase in COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next three weeks, a top health official said Wednesday. New Jersey's allotment of vaccines from the federal government will rise from about 100,000 doses a week to 130,000 for three weeks, Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. The boosted figure comes after President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that his administration would increase how much states got by about 16%. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy praised the Biden administration for setting a three-week window instead of a one-week interval that was in effect under the previous White House. More vaccines are desperately needed as the state aims to ramp up administration of the shots, with about 643,000 given so far since mid-December, Murphy said. The larger amount is still well below the 470,000 doses New Jersey officials calculated would be needed to meet demand. The state saw 107 additional deaths from the virus overnight, putting the total toll at 19,091. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases fell over the past two weeks from 6,190 a day Jan. 12 to 5,146 on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Santa Fe: An economic relief package is taking shape at the Legislature as a Senate panel endorsed a $600 rebate to low-income workers and a separate bill that would waive licensing fees on liquor stores. Residentswho earned up to $31,200 during 2020 would be eligible for the $600 payout or credit against tax liabilities under a bill that also provides a temporary tax break for restaurants as they endure restrictions on indoor dining. A panel of lawmakers unanimously advanced those proposals Tuesday. The concept of a rebate to low-income workers who labored through the pandemic at essential businesses was pioneered late last year by Republican lawmakers without approval. Democrats have embraced the approach under a bill from Sens. Peter Wirth of Santa Fe, Jacob Candelaria of Albuquerque and Siah Correa Hemphill of Silver City that also includes temporary tax breaks for restaurants and other food service businesses, from food trucks to craft breweries, for a four-month period starting March 1. The income tax rebate alone could distribute an estimated $95 million in credits and rebates. The bill received unified praise from business associations and a progressive-leaning advocacy group for solutions to childhood poverty.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Albany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he was erasing the handful of remaining orange zones in the state where tougher pandemic restrictions had been in place because of the fast spread of COVID-19. The Democrat cited a post-holiday dip in the number of infections, after a period in which rates had surged to more than 114,000 new cases in one week. Eliminating the zones will allow restaurants to again offer indoor dining, albeit at half-capacity. Indoor dining is still banned in all of New York City, but Cuomo promised to come up with a plan by Friday to address how restaurants might reopen that service, too. His administration is considering whether to again allow indoor dining in the city at 25% capacity. The orange zones had been in central and western New York, Staten Island and Westchester County. Cuomo said he's launching several yellow zones, which require schools to launch testing programs, in certain New York City neighborhoods and a part of Orange County where hospitalizations and infections are increasing. During the past seven days, the state has averaged about 12,800 new infections per day, a rate it last recorded in late December.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Raleigh: The state has overpaid tens of millions of dollars in jobless benefits since the COVID-19 pandemic began to people who don't actually qualify for them or have committed fraud, North Carolina's unemployment program director told legislators Tuesday. Pryor Gibson, who leads the Division of Employment Security, described how nearly $70 million had been overpaid during the first nine months of 2020. Nearly all of that total was distributed since the virus lockdowns sent claims rocketing to historic levels. The overpayments remain a small percentage of the $8 billion in federal and state unemployment benefits distributed in North Carolina during all of 2020. That compares to $160 million in benefits paid overall in 2019, when the state unemployment rate fell below 4%. In 2019, the division reported nearly $7 million in overpayments. Overpayments can happen due to fraud or unintentional mistakes that lead a person to receive benefits to which they aren't entitled, Gibson said. The division reported that $9 million in benefits since March 31 have been paid out due to identity theft.", "label": 7}

The central Ohio school of about 1,600 students, which requires all students to live on campus, said the donation allows it to continue a focus on a residential college experience despite the disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic. Kenyon is conducting both online and in-person classes this year, and it reduced the on-campus population to allow all students to live in single rooms. To receive this record-breaking gift during a pandemic that is still gripping our country and disrupting our academic year speaks volumes about the strength of Kenyon's future, school President Sean Decatur said in a statement. Decatur said the donation will also allow Kenyon, founded in 1824, to renew its efforts to grow the college endowment for scholarships and financial aid.

{"sentence": "Oklahoma City: The state attorney general's office is attempting to return $2 million worth of a malaria drug once touted by former President Donald Trump as an effective treatment for COVID-19, a spokesman said Wednesday. Alex Gerszewski, a spokesman for Attorney General Mike Hunter, said Hunter is attempting to negotiate a return of the 1.2 million hydroxychloroquine pills Oklahoma acquired in April from a California-based supplier, FFF Enterprises. He said the office was acting on a request from the Oklahoma State Department of Health, which authorized the purchase. A spokeswoman for FFF Enterprises didn't immediately return a message Wednesday seeking comment. The attempt by Oklahoma to return the hydroxychloroquine was first reported by the online news publication The Frontier. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt defended the purchase last year, saying the drug was showing some promise as a treatment in early March, and he didn't want to miss an opportunity to acquire it. The drug has since been shown to have little or no effect on severe cases of COVID-19, and a former state health official chalked up Oklahoma's purchase to something that happens in the fog of war.", "label": 7}

One solution is allocating more doses of the vaccine to the populated area, said Jessica Guernsey, the Multnomah County public health director. Guernsey said officials have spoken to the Oregon Health Authority about this option and have not received an outright denial. There really is no easy way to say this: Right now we are in a situation in the metro area where we have more people eligible for the vaccine than we actually have vaccine in the metro area, Guernsey said. This is an incredibly frustrating situation. Health leaders in Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties announced Tuesday that the online regional COVID-19 Phase 1A vaccination sign-up survey launched Jan. 12 is now closed because of the limited vaccine supply. Health officials said that while 60,000 eligible people applied for vaccines through the survey, only 11,000 were sent invitations to be vaccinated.", "label": 7}

Tom Wolf defended the state's rollout of COVID-19 vaccines Tuesday, saying that it was left in the lurch by the Trump administration's overpromises and that a decentralized vaccine sign-up system should prove to be more efficient, as opposed to a centralized portal some states use. He also defended federal guidelines – adopted by his administration – that pushed smokers into the first phase of vaccination, calling it an objective assessment of who is most vulnerable, not a value judgment. Meanwhile, Philadelphia abruptly cut off a vaccine clinic operator amid concerns that it had sought to profiteer from the work. Officials said they ended their relationship Monday with the group Philly Fighting COVID, which had been chosen to run the city's largest vaccination site. Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said the city became concerned when the privacy policy on the group's website changed to allow sharing personal information for people signing up for vaccinations, and the group abruptly stopped its coronavirus testing operations. Farley said the organization assured the city that personal information had not been sold, but health department officials were working with the city's lawyers to determine next steps.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "Columbia: A bill that would assure lawmakers have a chance to change or end a prolonged state of emergency from Gov. Henry McMaster passed the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic, now more than 10 months old, exposed some problems with South Carolina's emergency law, which had not been altered in almost 60 years except to add the words public health emergency in 2002. Under current law, McMaster can only issue an emergency declaration for 15 days before the General Assembly has to weigh in. To avoid that, the Republican governor has issued different declarations with incremental changes every two weeks or so. He issued the 22nd such order Friday. The bill would allow the General Assembly to weigh in within 30 days. They could end or continue a state of emergency with one vote of each chamber or alter it through a more lengthy process. If they don't meet, the emergency declaration would last as long as the governor wishes.

The state will start to receive about 12,800 weekly doses next week, Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said, up from the previous weeks' 11,000 doses. The increase comes after the federal government changed distribution strategies and increased shipments to states, rather than keeping vials in reserve for second doses. Epidemiologist Joshua Clayton said South Dakota has had about 117,725 doses allocated so far. As of noon Tuesday, about 82,000 doses had been administered, and just over 60,000 people had received at least their first dose. Roughly 24,000 people have received both doses of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Those numbers do not include tribal vaccination distribution, which is being handled by the Indian Health Service. Most South Dakotans who have been eligible for the vaccine have opted to receive it. About 65% of health care workers offered the vaccine have taken it, and at least 95% of nursing home residents have received the vaccine.", "label": 7}

Instead, state leaders were stunned earlier this month when it was revealed the federal reserve was empty. Tennessee got no surge of doses from the release of the reserve and, separately, is still waiting for increased vaccine supplies that federal officials promised would start this week, said Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey.

{"sentence": "Houston: A federal judge on Tuesday expressed frustration over what she saw as a lack of progress in efforts to try to relieve overcrowding at Texas' largest county jail, where some inmates have described the facility as a metal can of contagion amid worries about a potential COVID-19 outbreak. Concerns about the Harris County Jail were raised this month by Sheriff Ed Gonzalez after its population ballooned to more than 9,000 inmates, leaving little room to quarantine prisoners who test positive for the virus or to separate new inmates when they first arrive. The jail population had only dropped to about 8,800 inmates as of Tuesday, with most awaiting trial. U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal, presiding over a lawsuit that accuses the county's felony bail system of keeping poor defendants locked up only because they can't afford to pay a bond, had asked the sheriff's office, prosecutors, public defenders and state court judges to see if some inmates facing low level, nonviolent felony charges and who were being held on bonds of $10,000 or less could be eligible for bond reductions.

It's a little scary with the virus still going on, said Marissa Book, who dropped off her kindergartener daughter, Vivian, at Franklin Elementary School for its first day back Monday. But they honestly need it. Salt Lake County Health Department epidemiologist Mary Hill said the schools reopened with all safety precautions and will likely continue to follow measures closely, such as closing a school if 1% of its population tests positive for the virus. The question now is whether bringing older students back to campuses will lead to an increase in social gatherings outside of the school, she said. A lot of the transmission, I don't believe, has been occurring in school, Hill said. They take off their mask, and they go to their social activities and go to each other's houses and play.

You may be thinking that closing unused accounts could earn you brownie points with creditors by demonstrating that you're being responsible. However, closing unused credit accounts actually hurts your credit score in two ways.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "First, closing long-standing accounts may reduce the average length of time that your credit accounts have been open. The longer your average account has been open, the higher your credit score, generally speaking.

{"sentence": "Secondly, closing an account means reducing your available aggregate credit amount. Reducing your available credit causes your credit utilization ratio to rise. Anything above 30% aggregate usage could lower your credit score.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "2. Not checking your credit report", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "According to a Google Consumer Survey conducted by TransUnion in 2013, 33% of Americans admitted to never checking their credit reports or credit scores. Ignorance is unfortunately not bliss in this instance, because it's quite possible for errors to appear on your credit report from one or more of the three major credit reporting bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax). Not checking your credit report annually could allow these errors to remain on your report without your knowledge, dragging down your credit score in the process.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Here's the good news: You can check your credit report from all three credit bureaus once annually for free. That's right, I did just say free. To check your credit report for free, head to AnnualCreditReport.com.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "Even if you pay your bills in full each month, it's still possible (and I can speak firsthand on this) to hurt your credit score by going over the 30% credit utilization threshold. The good news is that the dip in your credit score is probably temporary if you're paying your bill in full and on time each month, or at least getting your net balance owed below 30% of your aggregate available credit. However, the timing of when a credit report is run could certainly have some bearing on whether your credit score takes a hit or not.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "Utility bills, such as an electric bill or water bill, can be something of a double-edged sword for consumers. On one hand, it's highly unlikely that utility companies will report timely payments to credit bureaus that'll determine your credit score.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "On the flip side, if you're habitually late with your payment, or you have unpaid utility bills, then the utility may not hesitate to turn your account over to a collection agency. Having an account sent to a collection agency can show up on your credit report for years, and it can adversely impact your credit score.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Believe it or not, tax disagreements between you and Uncle Sam could come back to haunt you in the credit column. If you have unpaid federal income taxes, the government, after enough time and effort to collect what's due, could place a lien on your property or wages to collect what you owe.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Federal tax liens can show up on your credit report for a mind-numbing 15 years, meaning they could wind up wreaking havoc on your ability to open new credit accounts for more than a decade to come.

{"sentence": "While this may be a bit of a stretch, and I'll admit it sounds almost comical, checking out books from the library and failing to return them on time could wind up negatively impacting your credit score.

The Office of Police Accountability said that to get the suspect to turn himself in, the officer told one of the suspect's friends that the crash left a woman in critical condition and that she might not survive, The Seattle Times reports. In reality, it was a fender-bender with no injuries. The driver's friend told him what the officer had said, and the driver began to think he had possibly hit a pedestrian without knowing it. The friend reported that the driver had been addicted to heroin for two decades and became increasingly despondent over the possibility he killed someone. Soon thereafter, in June 2018, he died by suicide. The officer was suspended for six days without pay.", "label": 7}

Just because a dog is at a shelter doesn't mean that there's something wrong with the dog, said Weld, a Republican. That dog needs a second chance and is looking for a new friend, just like you might be. The proposal now moves to the House of Delegates.

Rohrbacher claimed that owner Jeff McMenamy declined to promote her and then forced her to resign in 2013 after she refused to enroll in Church of Scientology courses.

{"sentence": "The IRS estimates that you'll need 16 hours to complete a Form 1040. That's the individual return that, according to the IRS, 69% of us use. The hours to complete this longest of the three options take into account gathering records, tax planning and filling out and submitting the return.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "If you use a tax preparer, you'll also have to commit some time to gathering tax statements and other material. But once you deliver the necessary documents, you'll have more time for other tasks.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "3. How complex (or not) is your tax life?", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "If you're a single filer who rents an apartment and your workplace 401(k) is your only investment, tax software should work fine. Even when things get a bit more complex — you get married, have a child and itemize deductions for the first time — most software will walk you through these tax situations.", "label": 7}

A tax professional, however, can outline what might happen if you want to donate rather than sell the stock your Uncle Henry left to you. A tax adviser can offer insight into tax law changes that might affect you and whether you should make certain moves now or wait.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "4. Are you ready, willing and able to deal with the IRS?", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "By signing your tax return, you are responsible for all the information on the forms. If you do your taxes yourself, that means you're the one the IRS will come to with any questions — possibly years after you've filed.", "label": 7}

I've had so many letters in recent months from or about people who want to pull a fast one: The wife who wanted to disinherit her stepchildren in the event that her husband of one year dies, and even a psychotherapist who wanted to be in cahoots with his client to cheat the insurance company.", "label": 8}

{"sentence": "The recently enacted U.S. tax law restricts federal deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) to $10,000 — including local property and sales taxes as well as local income taxes. While this new restriction will have many implications, it will have a particularly draconian impact on states with large unfunded liabilities for pension benefits and retiree health care, in particular the residents of Illinois, Kentucky, Connecticut, and New Jersey.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Unless states can implement effective ways to circumvent the SALT restriction, they will face much higher political barriers to meeting their unfunded benefit obligations through increased tax revenues. Instead, states will be forced to severely cut spending on public services and/or adopt major reforms of their benefit plans.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "A state has payment obligations from three main sources — interest on its outstanding bonds, unfunded liabilities for pension benefits, and unfunded liabilities for health care payments to state retirees (before Medicare at age 65). The interest on outstanding state bonds is relatively easy to estimate; the total outstanding amount of all state bonds was $500 billion in 2016. With the advent of improved accounting rules, it is now possible to compute the unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities of each state.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "The table below summarizes the situation for each of four states with the highest unfunded liabilities relative to their revenues in 2016 — Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut and Kentucky. The data in the table come from the Investment Strategy Team at JP Morgan Asset Management.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "The table shows the current obligations ratio for each state — the percentage of its revenues currently devoted to paying down its unfunded pension and retiree health care obligations plus interest on its state bonds. The table then compares that ratio to each state's full accrual obligations ratio. This latter ratio was calculated based on two reasonable assumptions — first, that state should pay down their unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities over 30 years, and, second, that annual investment returns of states would average 6% over this period.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "As the table shows, the gap between the two ratios could be filled by increases in state tax revenues. To cover the gap, however, states would have to raise local taxes by an eye-watering amount — ranging from 14% in Connecticut to 26% in New Jersey.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "These large increases in state revenues are not feasible, as illustrated by Illinois. To cope with its mammoth unfunded benefit obligations, Illinois has sharply raised tax rates on both individuals and businesses over the past few years. But higher tax rates in Illinois have backfired — driving local residents and firms to other states. In 2015, for example, Illinois lost $4.75 billion in adjusted gross income to other states, according to IRS data.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Financial instability, debt, and the American Dream", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "The new federal restrictions on SALT deductions ring the death knell for this strategy of raising state taxes to meet unfunded benefit obligations. For instance, middle-class residents of these four states are already paying effective tax rates of 9% to 12% — from local income, property and sales taxes. Since Congress has now limited SALT deductions to $10,000, residents of high-tax states are likely to push hard on their elected officials to lower local income and property taxes.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "States could also deal with unfunded benefit obligations by making substantial cuts in non-retirement spending — between 13% and 24% of state revenues according to the table. But local voters will vociferously object to substantial cuts in public services in areas such as education, transportation, and police protection.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "That leaves one more avenue for states to pursue — enacting benefit reforms. According to the table, if the funding gap were closed entirely by increases in worker contributions, that increase would have to be monumental — by at least 400% in each of the four states. Such an increase would not be acceptable to public unions, and further would not be legally permissible in many states because of constitutional protections for accrued pension benefits.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Yet there is a light at the end of this tunnel. The U.S. Supreme Court has opined that health care benefits of retirees may be legally modified at the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement – unless expressly guaranteed for life. So the scope of health care benefits and premium sharing by public retirees will become a subject of political negotiation between elected officials and public unions.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Reform of public pensions will be much more difficult. Although states may establish a different retirement system for their newly hired employees, this will take years to have much of a financial impact. Already accrued benefits are sacrosanct in most states — with the notable exception of reduced adjustments for costs of living, which have been allowed by many courts.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "The big question: Will courts allow modifications of pension benefits with respect to future years of work by public employees? Historically, California has led the way in blocking such forward-looking pension changes. However, two California courts have recently allowed such changes as long as public employees still receive a substantial and reasonable pension.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "In short, the new federal restriction on SALT deductions will open up a new window on reforming state benefit plans with large unfunded liabilities. As voters absorb the financial implications of the new restriction, they will probably oppose tax increases and service cuts to deal with these liabilities. Instead, they will pressure elected officials to renegotiate benefit plans to the extent legally permissible.", "label": 8}

Carmike, which has about 2,800 screens, generally in midsize communities, has the greatest upside of any other exhibitor from either buying another company or being bought, he said. The theater chain will also likely outperform peers as it institutes a tax-on-top pricing strategy — essentially a stealthy way to increase ticket and concession prices. Rather than an all-inclusive price of, for example, $5 for popcorn, the price would stay the same but no longer include tax. Kulp said AMC benefited from a similar strategy last year.", "label": 8}

The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed.

{"sentence": "Clinton Nominates Reno at Justice By Ruth Marcus", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Friday, February 12, 1993; Page A01 President Clinton yesterday named veteran Miami prosecutor Janet Reno to be his attorney general, selecting a woman he described as a front-line crime fighter of unquestioned integrity to fill the vacancy that has plagued the first three weeks of his administration. Announcing his nomination in a Rose Garden ceremony, Clinton said his selection had been guided somewhat, but not entirely by the desire to name the first female attorney general. Clinton said the position was not set aside for a woman and that he seriously considered at least four men for the job. But he said that he thought it would be a good and an interesting thing to do to name a woman to the position and said that if he had it to do over again, I would have called Janet Reno on November the 5th. In December, Clinton nominated corporate lawyer Zoe E. Baird, who was forced to withdraw because she had violated immigration and tax laws in hiring illegal immigrants. He was poised to name federal judge Kimba M. Wood before she withdrew last week after the disclosure that she had also employed an illegal immigrant to care for her child. Reno, who is not married and has no children, said, I've never hired an illegal alien and I think I've paid all my Social Security taxes, adding with a smile, Certainly in the vetting process in the last week, we've covered everything.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "An administration official said Clinton decided yesterday morning to name Reno, after interviewing her Tuesday. The Florida native, 54, turned aside a question about how she felt about being appointed to a position that was seen as having been reserved for a woman, saying simply, I'm just delighted to be here and I'm going to try my level best. She said her efforts would include restoring civil rights enforcement as one of the top priorities of the department, seeking to protect America's children from abuse and violence and establishing diversion programs to give nonviolent offenders a new start while incarcerating dangerous and career criminals. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said he welcomed the nomination and would schedule a hearing as expeditiously as possible. But committee sources said they did not expect a hearing before next month. Reno, who once swore I would never be a prosecutor because I thought they were more interested in securing convictions than in seeking justice, has been the elected chief prosecutor in Dade County since 1978. She supervises a 900-person office that handles more than 120,000 cases annually. Reno's start in the job was marred by riots that broke out after the 1980 acquittal of four police officers in the beating death of black insurance agent Arthur McDuffie. She has also been criticized for losing several high-profile public corruption cases and for failing to bring charges in other local scandals.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "But after her appointment to the position, she waged five successful campaigns for the job – a fact noted admiringly by Clinton yesterday -- and worked to cement good relations with the black and Hispanic communities in Miami. She pushed for a special court to handle drug cases, cracked down on parents who fail to pay child support and presided over the expansion of the county prosecutor's office into one of the largest in the country. Noting that Reno's phone number is listed – unusual for a prosecutor -- Clinton said, She has lived the kind of life in real contact with the toughest problems of this country that I think will serve her very well as the nation's chief law enforcement officer. Before becoming state attorney, Reno was a partner in a prestigious Miami firm that, she noted in a 1984 book on women lawyers, had first refused to hire her after she graduated from Harvard Law School in 1963 because she was a woman. Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Reno offered forthright answers that contrasted with Baird's reticence when Clinton nominated her to the position Dec. 24. She said she was personally opposed to the death penalty but probably asked for it as much as any prosecutor in the country and will advocate for it as the law of the land in particular situations.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "She described herself as pro-choice on abortion rights and – asked if she considers herself a feminist – said, My mother always told me to do my best, to think my best and to do right, and to consider myself a person. Women's rights groups expressed delight with the selection of a woman who Women's Legal Defense Fund President Judith L. Lichtman described as a stellar attorney with an extraordinary track record. The lesson of the agonizing nomination process, said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center, is that there are superb women as well as men who can serve the country with distinction and having someone like Janet Reno in charge of the Justice Department is a wonderful step forward. But the American Family Association of Florida, a conservative Christian group, said it would oppose Reno's nomination because of what it called her deplorable record on prosecuting pornography cases. Since Reno took office, said organization President David Caton, Dade County has become stomping grounds for pornographers. In turning to Reno, Clinton departed from the practice of most presidents who choose either close advisers or nationally known figures. Clinton said he settled on Reno – whose extensive criminal law background also distinguishes her – because he wanted someone with management as well as legal experience, and who had dealt with a wide range of real-world problems. He said he had known of Reno for some time because his brother-in-law Hugh Rodham is a public defender in the drug court that Reno established.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "But he said he did not pursue her as a possible candidate because of her lack of federal experience. But the more I dug into it and the more I talked to people about it and the more I realized that you couldn't be the state's attorney in Dade County for 15 years without having enormous exposure to a wide range of issues that the Justice Department deals with . . . , he said.

If the sibling is in college, the family's contribution range for the women's college would be $3,000 to $9,300 a year. In addition, the calculator tells this prospective student that she would be expected to borrow $1,800 a year and earn $2,100 through a work-study program. The rest of the college's $68,000 annual expense would be covered by grants and scholarships.", "label": 9}

It points them to the net price calculator to get more information. Levine said financial circumstances can be especially tricky for students from divorced families.

The calculator only asks about retirement savings to ensure that families don't include that sort of funding when they seek aid estimates.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Misperceptions about price matter hugely, Levine said. This whole issue is about social mobility, he said. Here you have opportunities where kids are qualified to go to high-level institutions, and don't because they don't understand the price. That's a huge failure.", "label": 9}

The vast majority of assessors are not malicious or careless; they are simply making judgment calls about how to utilize limited resources in tackling a big job, said Pete Sepp, the union's president. Homeowners shouldn't take it personally, but they shouldn't assume the government is right, either. Sepp says that when well-prepared homeowners take the time to appeal, most win at least a partial victory. Here's how to improve your chances of being one of the winners:", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "●Meet the deadline. Tax assessments in the District, Maryland and Virginia are mailed out January through March. (In some parts of the country, they arrive in the last quarter of the year.) Once you receive your assessment, you typically have just 30 to 120 days to file your appeal. Check the rules for your jurisdiction and make sure your paperwork is postmarked by the deadline.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "●Understand assessment ratios. Some jurisdictions tax your house based on 100 percent of its value, but others assign a lower assessment ratio, such as 60 percent. This means a house with a market value of $100,000 would have an assessed value of $60,000. If you see a number that's lower than your home's true value, check the assessment ratio before assuming you don't have a case. You can find that ratio on your actual tax assessment notice or on the assessor's office website.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "●Look for errors on your property work sheet. Contact your tax assessor's office and request the internal notes and data the assessor used when setting a value for your property. Different jurisdictions call this paperwork different things, including property work sheet and property card. What you're requesting are the internal notes and data the assessor used when setting a value for your property. Study these documents, checking for lot size, house age and dimensions, number of bedrooms and baths, most recent purchase price, and anything else that could affect your home's value. If you find mistakes that make your property seem more valuable than it is, that is strong ammunition. This is the tactic the Greens used when they pointed out that their house had two bedrooms, not three.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "●See if the comparables are really comparable. The government's internal notes will also include comparable properties the assessor used to help determine the value of your house. Look for reasons the properties the assessor chose are not appropriate. Are they bigger? Newer? Newly remodeled? Do they have watertight roofs, while your house needs a new one, as the Greens' did? Next, identify three to six alternative comparables that are more favorable to you. You can find them free using such websites as Redfin, Trulia and Zillow. Or you can consult a real estate agent or appraiser.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "[Grocery shopping in person or online: Which is best?]", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "●Escalate as needed. Some property tax disputes can be settled through informal discussions with the assessor's office. For example, Fairfax County, Va., encourages homeowners to call. More commonly, you will be asked to fill out forms and the entire process will be done on paper. If your initial appeal fails, most jurisdictions offer an in-person hearing as the next step. Tip: Attend somebody else's hearing first to get a feel for the process.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "●Hire help if you must. If you don't have time to follow the steps above, you can hire help. Some real estate lawyers take property tax appeals on a contingency basis, which means you don't pay unless you win. If you prevail, a typical fee is one-third to one-half of the first year's savings.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The Greens ended up appealing their property tax assessment several years in a row and won every single time. Fighting our tax assessment was less time-consuming than filling out my kids' summer camp forms, Alicia Green said. And for the time invested, you get money back instead of forking it over. The Greens estimate that they spent about five hours and saved at least $5,000 in property taxes over the seven years they lived in that house. We made a strong, truthful argument, and it was effective, Green said.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Sepp says the Greens got it right by sticking to nuts-and-bolts information about their property, rather than complaining that their assessment was unfair. A homeowner who marshals proper evidence, sticks to facts rather than make political statements and follows procedure is more likely to meet with success because they've made their own luck, Sepp said. You wouldn't go into traffic court to challenge a parking ticket by arguing the mayor is corrupt. Rather, you'd provide evidence you were parked there properly during nonpaying hours.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Another benefit of appealing your assessment: When you successfully lower your property tax rate, it resets from that lower rate for years to come. By the way, it did not affect the value of our house when we sold, Alicia Green said. I imagine people would wonder that.

{"sentence": "Insurers wanted the health insurance tax repealed. Drug companies wanted the prescription drug tax repealed. Medical device makers wanted to kill an excise tax. Big employers wanted to abolish the Cadillac tax, a 40 percent excise tax on high-cost employer health plans. With the exception of the Cadillac tax — which was previously delayed to 2020 and now will be been delayed to 2025 — they all got what they wanted.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "An analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that, over a decade, repealing the health insurer tax would cost $145 billion; repealing the prescription drug tax would cost $25 billion; repealing the medical device tax would cost $20 billion; delaying the Cadillac tax would cost $49 billion.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Still, companies are pushing for the Cadillac tax to be scrapped entirely, instead of the current delay.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The delay is better than current law, said James Gelfand, senior vice president of health policy at the ERISA Industry Committee, a lobbying group that represents large companies. Now is the chance, and this is the bill that must completely eradicate the Cadillac tax.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "2) A replacement for the individual mandate that will encourage healthy people to sign up for insurance", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Health insurers need both healthy and sick people to sign up for insurance to have a balanced risk pool. This was a major problem in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, where too many healthy people were willing to pay a fine rather than sign up for insurance.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Instead of a mandate and a fine if people don't sign up for insurance, the bill would create a continuous coverage requirement that would penalize people who have a gap in their coverage. Anyone who lets their insurance coverage lapse could experience a 30 percent premium hike the next time they sign up.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "One possibility is that people will be incentivized to avoid any gaps in coverage, to avoid that 30 percent premium surcharge. But here's another scenario: A young, healthy person lacks coverage. She goes to sign up, but she faces a penalty that would make her plan more expensive. Why not just wait until she really needs insurance, since she'll be paying the penalty either way? In contrast, sick people who need insurance are more likely to pay the penalty.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Molina argued the requirement could result in confusion and more gaming of the system — he questioned how it would even work logistically, with insurance companies researching whether people had been continuously covered or issuing some certificate that people had coverage ending at a certain date. And, he said, the premium hikes still wouldn't cover the cost of people who are really waiting until they are sick to sign up — on average, he said those members cost about twice as much as a normal member, not 30 percent more.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The bill would replace the premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies in the Affordable Care Act with a flat tax credit, based on age. Currently, only people who make between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty limit are eligible for tax credits that defray their premiums. The size of the credits are pegged to people's incomes and the cost of a benchmark plan in the marketplace where they're buying insurance. That helps account for the fact that the average premium can vary widely depending where a person is buying insurance.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The new tax credit would gradually peter out for people who make more than $75,000 a year or $150,000 for a couple, but it ignores the fact that care costs more in different geographical regions or that someone who makes $20,000 a year might be more strained in trying to buy an insurance plan with the same amount of financial help as someone who makes $74,000. The graph below shows how a flat tax credit would do little to defray the monthly cost of insurance in markets where health insurance is more expensive.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "4) Continued support for subsidies that help people pay for insurance in the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The insurance industry has been clear that it wants a stable transition, meaning that subsidies that help people pay for their insurance premiums shouldn't be abruptly yanked out from underneath them. The bill keeps in place those tax credits and cost-sharing reductions that help lower the out-of-pocket costs for people based on their income — until 2020.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Molina, however, said that since the money hasn't been appropriated yet, he fears that Congress could stop funding the cost-sharing reductions as early as May.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "With the possible lost of the cost-sharing reductions, I think insurers will probably raise their prices as much, if not more than they did this year, Molina said. I wouldn't be surprised if we see rate increases and more plans dropping out.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "5) More flexibility in the ability to design health coverage benefits", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Insurers requested fewer rules, regulations and red tape. The draft bill takes steps toward easing insurers' ability to design health coverage, but leaves in place the 10 categories of essential health benefits that must be covered.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Insurers currently charge more to people based on their age, but current rules limit the spread to three times the costs of the youngest group of insured people. The bill would allow them to charge five times as much to older people. It also does away with a requirement that plans offer products with a specific value — a provision that created bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans that were progressively more expensive.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In general, plans would like flexibility to design a product to meet the needs of their consumers in a particular market, and certainly getting rid of those tiers is one way to increase flexibility for plans, Carpenter said.", "label": 9}

Less than 20 percent of people with disabilities held a job in 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has been like this for decades.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Atwater said he created InReturn Strategies to tackle what's known as the disability employment gap. As one of roughly 400 deaf entrepreneurs in the United States, he knows how workers with disabilities can be overlooked and undervalued by employers.

{"sentence": "Here's how we did our research", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "We collected daily data from newspapers, NGO reports and so forth on the specific dates in which a democracy protest began and ended in every country around the world between 1989 and 2011. We then examined whether a protest beginning in one country made it more likely that a similar protest would begin in a neighboring country (i.e., one within 30 to 500 miles of its borders) within the next 30, 45, 90, 120 or 360 days.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "We found no evidence these protests spread. When a protest occurred in one country in this period, it did not significantly increase the likelihood of similar protests taking place in neighboring countries. This was true not just of democracy protests, whose primary demand is open and competitive elections, but also for other forms of anti-government protests, such as the yellow vest protests.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Why are protests unlikely to spread?", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Democracy protests do not tend to spread, we argue, because they are about domestic issues that are generally unrelated to what is happening in other countries. Democracy protests tend to arise when elections, economic crises and other events within the country focus the public's existing anger about political, social or economic grievances, prompting collective action.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In general, protests in neighboring countries do not provoke new discontent in other countries [remind citizens of their own discontent]; nor do they bring people together on behalf of existing [that] discontent. In fact, most democracy protests are small, short-lived, repressed and unsuccessful — and are thus poor models for protests in other countries.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Like democracy protests, the French yellow vest protests are not good models for protests in Egypt and other countries where fuel prices are high. That is because France is a Western democracy where freedom of speech is not only protected but also extolled. It is also known for its protest culture; its citizens and voters could reasonably expect their government to make concessions, as indeed happened.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Egypt, in contrast, is an authoritarian state known for being increasingly repressive toward dissenters. Last year, an Egyptian court sentenced 75 people to death for protesting the 2013 coup d'etat that brought the current president, Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, to power.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "So why do protests appear to trigger demonstrations in other countries?", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Neighboring countries tend to be similar in many ways. The domestic forces that set off protests in one country may well exist in its neighbors as well. What's more, it is much easier for academics and the news media to take note of protests that happen soon after one other than it is to track all the protests that were not followed by similar events in neighboring countries.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Between 1989 and 2011, 24 democracy protests began in countries within 45 days of a similar protest in countries within 30 miles of them. But 258 protests — more than 10 times as many — began even though there had not been a similar protest in a neighboring country within the previous 45 days. For instance, in May 2018, Brazilian truck drivers staged massive — and eventually successful — protests against increased fuel prices. Yet we have not seen similar protests in other Latin American countries.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Even if protests do not spread, their symbols and strategies might", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Although democracy protests and anti-government protests do not spread to other countries in general, their symbols, strategies and tactics can. By wearing yellow vests, activists outside France have been able to make their protests appear to be part of a larger movement, attracting more international and domestic media attention. The Egyptian government's decision to ban yellow vests may not be absurd after all.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "But many of these protesters have made demands, including anti-Muslim demands in Germany, that are very different from those seen in France. These non-French protests were often triggered by events within their own countries and sometimes even began before their French counterparts. In Bulgaria, the so-called yellow vest protests against fuel prices began a week before those in France; protesters only began wearing yellow vests after they had become iconic in France. In Iraq, protests against unemployment, corruption and poor public services had been going on for months before Iraqi protesters began sporting yellow vests last December.", "label": 9}

The only donor who gave more money than Trump to the campaign of the incumbent governor, it reported, was the governor's brother. While a deputy mayor also said that Trump could be very convincing when selling a project, a city council member told the Times that Trump runs with the same clique that continues to manipulate things behind the scenes in this city, including links to a Democratic Party machine in Brooklyn connected through his father.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Why re-litigate 40-year-old news articles and four-year-old news conferences? Because it's worth remembering that Trump at no time was prepared to manage the process of passing legislation through the House and the Senate. The current government shutdown, approaching three weeks in length, stemmed from dual failures on Trump's part: Most recently in an inability to cajole members of Congress to see his side on funding for a wall on the border with Mexico and, earlier, a failure to passing a funding mechanism for that wall during the two years when Republicans controlled the House and the Senate.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Trump will note (and has noted) that the existence of the filibuster makes passing legislation trickier than bare majorities might make it seem. And that's fair — but it also means that Trump at no point was able to use those zoning-board skills to persuade even eight Democrats to join his view of an issue.

When a reform effort came to the Senate under reconciliation rules that required only 50 votes, Trump could not persuade those easy-to-deal-with politicians to pass it, despite his party's majority.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "That Trump's team didn't advance the overhaul legislation is the least surprising part of this. At the same news conference in Iowa, he proudly proclaimed that he was reticent to put together position papers — both because voters don't really care about them (fair enough) and because they would tie his hands in negotiations. Part of it, too, was obviously that the specifics of drafting legislation never appealed to him. So he has continually left the details up to his colleagues on the Hill, then has had to advocate for things that he himself didn't develop. Pun intended.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "There are a lot of reasons that the current fight with Congress is unwinnable for the president. He chose to make a stand on his most politically divisive proposal precisely because it is so divisive and, therefore, so important to the most vocal part of his base. But it also gives his opponents even less incentive to side with him than they might otherwise have. He has been ineffective at making his case, in part because the case he's making is the same one he has made over the entire course of his political career. He is left flailing, with no obvious way out but to fold.", "label": 9}

Though the cans say the contents were brewed by Trouble Brewing in Rochester, N.Y., no American brewery with the name Trouble Brewing actually exists.

The Brewers Association, a national trade group for small brewers, defines craft brewery as being small (under 6 million barrels produced per year); independent (less than 25 percent owned or controlled by a non-craft brewer) and traditional (making traditional beers, not flavored malt beverages, alcoholic sodas or other products).

What we typically hear is that homeowners didn't get the sale price they wanted so they consider renting out the property for a while as a placeholder so they can wait for the market to bounce back.

{"sentence": "Third, a would-be seller should consider the soft costs of renting as well. For example, renting can put tremendous wear and tear on a property (both from acts and omissions from a tenant). Tenants typically do not take as good care of the property as does a homeowner. A lot of damage can happen to a home in a short time frame, especially for a single-family detached house.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "When the owner is done renting and ready to sell, it can be costly to get the property in the same condition as it was before the tenant moved in. The moment a house becomes an investment property, the resale market typically discounts the value of it as compared to an owner-occupied home.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Finally, if there is significant appreciation in the property, an owner may lose out on a valuable tax break. The U.S. tax code allows homeowners who have lived in a home at least two of the previous five years to exclude up to $250,000 of capital gains ($500,000 for a married couple) from their taxes. Homeowners who rent out their home for more than three years therefore will lose out on this valuable exemption. (Consult an accountant on this.)", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Once homeowners factor in all of these costs, the rental option often turns from a roughly break-even scenario to one that generates a deficit each month. This puts additional pressure on the capital appreciation required to make the rental option a sound choice. In other words, the capital appreciation has to more than compensate for the monthly deficit. In a flat or down market, the rental option can be financially devastating.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "In 1983, Biden pushed to raise the Social Security retirement age.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Sanders cites a newspaper clip from Jan. 11, 1983, that says, Biden suggested a gradual increase in the retirement age would help improve the Social Security system. This was not a controversial position at the time. Two months after these comments, large bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate agreed to the Social Security amendments of 1983, which included raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing payroll taxes to improve the solvency of the program.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The broad outlines of the plan was recommended by the National Commission on Social Security Reform and is believed to have strengthened the long-term health of Social Security. Sanders, in 1999, praised the 1983 law an example of bipartisan cooperation.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "We should remember that in 1982, Social Security was within a few months — a few months — of not being able to pay out all benefits owed to Americans, Sanders said. And then people came together and said of course we want to save Social Security. They worked together, and they did.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In 1984, Joe Biden first pushed to freeze funding for Social Security — which would end up cutting Social Security benefits.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In the mid-1980s, bipartisan alarm grew over soaring federal budget deficits under President Ronald Reagan. Biden, along with two Republican senators and another Democrat (Max Baucus of Montana), proposed a simple solution — a one-year freeze on all spending, including defense spending and social programs such as Social Security.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Biden pitched it as the last best chance to keep deficits from undermining the economic recovery and dropping the country into another recession. He also said it would avoid having to make other significant changes in Medicare and significant changes in Social Security generally.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The plan was rejected 33 to 65, though more Democrats than Republicans voted for it.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Whatever one may make of the proposal, it was not aimed at Social Security specifically but was part of an effort to reduce the budget deficit. The Washington Post reported the dramatic simplicity of the plan was its fatal flaw as conservatives rebelled at the deep cuts it would have made in Reagan's military buildup, liberals balked at the constraints it would have put on major domestic benefit programs such as Social Security and many moderates shuddered at both results.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In 1995, I was on the House floor fighting the GOP's efforts to cut Social Security. Five days later, Joe Biden gave a speech in the Senate bragging about his work with the GOP to try to freeze funding for Social Security.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Fast forward 10 years to another budget fight. Republicans had taken control of the House and Senate and were pressing for passage of a balanced-budget amendment. Biden did make a floor speech on Jan. 31, 1995, which referenced his 1984 effort to freeze all spending.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Again, Sanders frames this as an effort only about Social Security, but it was much broader — aimed at every part of government, including defense.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In the mid-1990s, Joe Biden was criticized by seniors' groups for supporting balanced budget amendments that would cut Social Security.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Sanders here cites a newspaper clip that says an array of liberal-leaning groups — not just senior groups — were angry at Biden for supporting an amendment to the constitution mandating a balanced budget. The fear was that such an amendment would force reductions in domestic spending.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Biden was one of 10 Democrats in the Senate who supported the amendment; 35 Democrats were opposed. But the amendment failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority for passage.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The amendment itself does not mention Social Security. Biden tried to pass an amendment exempting Social Security, but he did not get the necessary votes. Social Security at the time was running huge surpluses, helping to mask the full extent of the budget deficit.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "For the next 20 years or so, revenues from the Social Security Trust Fund will make it look like we have balanced the budget when in fact we have not, and after that the huge outlays from the trust fund will force drastic reductions in the rest of federal spending, or drastic reductions in Social Security, Biden said in his floor speech.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In 1996, Joe Biden floated the idea of reducing Social Security benefits through an early version of chained CPI.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Here, Sanders cites a newspaper clip of Biden in a debate with a Republican challenger. The solvency of Social Security was considered an urgent issue at the time, given the pending retirement of the baby boom generation, and Republicans promoted ideas such as allowing Americans to divert Social Security moneys into private investment accounts. Biden's challenger supported that idea. In the debate, Biden countered that there were less dramatic ways to find savings in Social Security such as reducing the interest rate to calculate cost of living benefits or boosting the retirement age by a year.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "A Chained CPI — Chained Consumer Price Index — is a different way of calculating increases in the cost of living. It assumes people adjust buying patterns when prices changes, and it results in a slightly lower rate of inflation. So benefits for programs such as Social Security grow at a slower rate — what Sanders calls a cut.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The Associated Press reported Sanders saying in 1996 that the aging population made it clear that we will have to make incremental adjustments in Social Security taxes and benefits — as Congress has done in the past.

{"sentence": "To protect Social Security, Biden said he would bring both parties to the table to keep the plan paying out. That would include discussing options such as upping the retirement age and raising the cap on income subject to the Social Security tax past the $97,500 it was in 2007. 'It ain't broke — it doesn't need privatization,' he said of Social Security. 'There's other ways to help savings.'", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Again, you can see Biden's comments mostly are intended to rebut Republican hopes for private Social Security accounts. Raising the cap on the amount of income subject to Social Security tax — currently $137,700 — was a common proposal by Democrats at that time.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In 2007, Joe Biden appeared on Meet the Press to say that Social Security and Medicare cuts should be 'on the table.'", "label": 9}

It's going to be 80 million in 15 years. Would you consider looking at those programs, age of eligibility … Biden: Absolutely. Russert: …cost of living, put it all on the table.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Biden went on to cite the bipartisan agreement leading to the 1983 Social Security amendments: That's the kind of leadership that is needed. Social Security's not the hard one to solve. Medicare, that is the gorilla in the room, and you've got to put all of it on the table.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "During the Obama administration, when the soaring federal deficit again was a major issue, President Barack Obama and then House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) discussed a grand bargain that would have raised the retirement age and changed the formula for calculating Social Security benefits, in addition to reductions to Medicare and Medicaid, in exchange for higher taxes on the wealthy. No deal was ever reached.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "During a Senate floor speech over the GOP plan for a balanced budget calling for reducing Medicare spending by $270 billion over seven years, Biden said, You guys want a balanced budget in 7 years, and you want CBO [Congressional Budget Office] numbers. I want a balanced budget, too, but I do not want to cut as much Medicare as you do. I do not want to cut as much as you do, and I do not want to give as big a tax break as you want.''", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Biden went on to say: So we can make a deal, make a deal. We will split the difference between the CBO figure of 2.4 and the OMB [Office of Management and Budget] figure of 2.6. Take 2.5 — that is $250 billion. And make another agreement. Agree I will go for a bigger cut in Medicare. I say we only need to do $89 billion. That is all we need — not $270 billion. I will split the difference with you on that.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "This was not an unusual position for a Democrat at the time. A few months later, President Bill Clinton unveiled a budget plan that would have cut Medicare by $124 billion over seven years, a much bigger reduction than suggested by Biden.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Sanders framed this as 40 years of working with Republicans to cut Social Security. But these statements came during periods when a growing budget deficit was a major concern in official Washington. Biden, like many mainstream politicians, thought action needed to be taken.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In some cases, Biden offered proposals intended to counter more extreme options offered by Republicans. At other times, Biden indicated a willingness to bargain with Republicans, though any deal resulting in spending reductions in entitlement programs was forever elusive. After 1983, the benefit cuts never happened.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In one case — 1983 — Sanders attacks Biden for supporting a deal that Sanders himself had praised. That's rich.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Also missing from this picture are the many votes Biden took to increase certain Social Security benefits or block GOP plans; the Biden campaign provides a list of nearly 50 votes from Biden's long Senate career.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Meanwhile, both parties now appear to have abandoned any pretense about caring about budget deficits. Biden's campaign platform calls for raising Social Security payroll taxes on wealthier Americans and boosting benefits for people who have been receiving Social Security payments for at least 20 years.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "The economic challenges posed by the virus are unique in that they are already hitting supply and demand. The former refers to the inability of workers to go to work, because of quarantines either at their jobs or their kids' schools, along with disruptions to the global flow of goods to retailers and factories. The latter refers to reduced spending at restaurants, movie theaters, stores, etc. Consider, for example, the many trips, vacations and conferences already being canceled. Add to that the chance that millions of workers without paid leave could lose paychecks, and you begin to get a sense of the sudden shock to commerce.", "label": 9}

While more than 70 percent of private-sector workers have some degree of paid sick leave, for workers in the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale, that share falls to 47 percent. Based on their low, often nonexistent, savings, such workers have little to fall back on if they're not getting paid.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Unemployment insurance is often the first line of defense in a downturn, and we should be sure that state systems are ready to respond quickly. Two important considerations: Some big state trust funds (New York, California and Texas) are running low, and state agencies need to know that employees who are available for work but locked out because of a quarantine are eligible for unemployment insurance.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "One fast way to administer help is for the government to send checks to low- and middle-income households, a measure that was last used in 2008, when the George W. Bush administration sent out about $100 billion in 2008 to about 70 million households, which got an average check of about $1,100 in today's dollars. Research found these checks to be particularly useful to low-income households.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "This intervention must be structured to reach low-income households without federal income-tax liabilities. (To be clear, these households do pay other federal taxes, most notably payroll taxes.) This is a huge limitation of the federal tax cuts under consideration by the Trump administration.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Something we really don't want is for sick workers who don't have paid leave to go to work, a known problem well before the coronavirus. Providing a generous tax break to employers (e.g. $800 per worker) to grant at least seven sick days a year to workers not covered would be a substantial incentive. In the same vein, we may also want to encourage employers to allow telecommuting, where possible. A modest credit for allowing telecommuting (e.g. $400) could increase the use of this option. An advantage of both these credits is that any changes are likely to be permanent.", "label": 9}

In fact, the consensus now among intelligence historians is that the information captured by the tunnel was valuable and that the KGB likely did not plant false information on the tapped lines.

But Senate Republicans continued to defend Trump even as he repeatedly sabotaged his own party. There was the pointless 2018-2019 shutdown over Trump's border wall (the longest shutdown in history) and the president's recent threat to veto the coronavirus spending bill, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, just before the Georgia runoff elections that would decide which party controlled the Senate. There was the Ukraine scandal, which forced the Senate to spend time debating Trump's use of foreign policy for personal gain, even if the GOP did use its majority to acquit him at his impeachment trial.

If Republicans stop recognizing results that they don't like, there is nothing to prevent Democrats from doing the same, tit-for-tat. Seven Republicans in the House of Representatives have warned that efforts to overturn the 2020 vote might erode the advantage that the electoral college gives to their party. GOP candidates need the college, since they have won the popular vote only once in the past 32 years.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Perhaps the authors of Wednesday's revolt already regret their role in goading the mob. Now that the Democrats have taken the Senate, they are likely to press for federal election reform, a proposition that's anathema to the right. As political scientist Sam Rosenfeld describes it, some Republicans understand that they benefit more in the long term from legal anti-democratic institutions than from dubiously legal anti-democratic actions, which are more set-piece theatrical statements than carefully planned strategies.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The challenge for people who want to protect democracy is twofold. First, they need to prevent repeat performances of this most recent theater. Drama is an inevitable part of democratic politics. Politicians will always seek to highlight some problem they care about in ways that grab the public's attention. Naked ambition of the sort Hawley and Cruz displayed is also an essential part of politics and can be productive when it is yoked to real political needs. It becomes a problem when ambition leads politicians to blur the boundaries between dramatic fiction and essential political facts, undermining the shared beliefs that hold democracy together.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Widespread delusion can have bitter consequences, as we saw Wednesday, when amateur dramatics led a misinformed audience to storm the stage. Cameron's mistakes meant that the country he led dropped out of Europe and is at greater risk of breaking apart. Cruz and Hawley's not only helped provoke a mob but could also make American democracy unworkable, as everyone starts challenging every result they don't like. Politicians can't rely on political institutions to save the country from the consequences of their playacting, because the institutions aren't outside the politicians, and the politicians aren't outside the institutions.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Finally, the republic's guardians should recognize that the fight to secure democracy isn't over just because the mob has been evicted from the Capitol. The processes that allow democracy to work (vote counting, redistricting, early voting, identification procedures and voter registration) seem very boring to the public in the years between major elections. But we can go back to enjoying the political performances — and shrugging when the players ham it up — only if everyone knows it's a play, and the machinery behind the curtain is strong.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who had to be drafted into her 2012 run for Senate, and unlike John Delaney, who jump-started a presidential campaign with no speculation or buzz, Harris has been seen as a potential president for most of her time in public life. As early as 2010, when she was a slight underdog in the race for California attorney general, Harris was described as a female Obama.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Each of those candidates comes with different strengths and weaknesses; each, like Harris, has been looked at as the future leader of a new Democratic coalition, as opposed to a candidate such as Joe Biden, who allies say could win back voters the party has lost. One way to read Harris's memoir, The Truths We Hold, is as a pitch to a Democratic base that has shifted since she wrote her first book, on her criminal justice record and agenda.", "label": 9}

There is no setback that she doesn't overcome, from a failed attempt to pass the bar (she passed it the second time) to an apparent defeat in her 2010 attorney general run (late-counted ballots gave her the win). Like Barack Obama, and like a younger cohort of first-generation American politicians, she describes a family of smart strivers who struggled so that she could succeed — and learn valuable lessons.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "But while this was a defining political moment for Harris, Feinstein appears in The Truths We Hold only once, in a fond memory Harris has of driving across the bridge from my home in Oakland to celebrate when Feinstein and Barbara Boxer became California's first female senators. The debates over the death penalty, which nearly cost her the 2010 race, come up only when Harris recalls how one strategist (never named) said a woman who is a minority who is anti-death penalty who is DA of wacky San Francisco could not win statewide office.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "To be fair, Harris has written a book (Smart on Crime) about her criminal justice record and agenda. The part of that she focuses the most on in The Truths We Hold is her Back on Track program, an innovation of the San Francisco's DA office that allowed first-time nonviolent drug offenders to get job training in lieu of jail time. The book's focus when addressing her six years as attorney general is a showdown with banks over what would become a $25 billion foreclosure settlement. The story of her phone call to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, is destined to be retold in Iowa and New Hampshire: I took off my earrings (the Oakland in me) and picked up the receiver.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "But fully half of The Truths We Hold covers Harris's time in the Senate, just two years in which Democrats won one epochal battle over health care (at GWU, Harris thanked the late, great John McCain), and sloughed through many more defeats.

{"sentence": "The effect of all that is to present Harris as a perfect fit for the Democrats of 2020, one who was early and right about much of what the party's base cares about, and who was in the mix opposing Trump on everything that mattered. The book and the tour, which has been dominated by friendly, encouraging interviews, offer less clarity about how Harris can navigate two incredibly different electoral constituencies.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Harris started her political career as a newsmaking opponent of capital punishment and is now accused by the left, pejoratively, of being a cop. That was never an issue in her California races; it will be an issue for plenty of Democratic voters in 2019.

For two weeks, as he considers whether to run for president again, Bernie Sanders has gotten questions about female former staffers who say they were harassed during his 2016 campaign. Sanders, who put out a statement reflecting previous stories about the staff issues, went further today. In between the rollout of a prescription drug bill and an appearance with furloughed federal workers, Sanders walked up to Senate microphones and delivered a three-minute response to the news of a $30,000 settlement between his former Iowa campaign manager and two staffers.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "When we talk about ending sexism, and ending all forms of discrimination, those beliefs cannot just be words, Sanders said. They must be based in day-to-day reality and the work that we do. And that was clearly not the case in the 2016 campaign. The allegations that I have heard speak to unacceptable behavior that must not be tolerated in any campaign or in any workplace.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Sanders, who said he hadn't known about the settlement, had previously said he was unaware of the other harassment allegations. Today's statement was informed by the response Sanders gave at the end of a recent CNN interview, in which he reiterated that he condemned harassment and added that he was a little bit busy running around the country and never heard of the allegations at the time.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Sanders, who resents what he sees as the tabloid approach of much political coverage, was pilloried for the busy quote; the senator, who tends to ignore shouted questions in the halls of the Senate, decided to handle the new story on its own, with a mea culpa, no spin and a small aside about how he had instituted strong anti-harassment policies during his 2018 Senate campaign.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "There is no good time to handle problems like these, but this is a particularly important month for Sanders. On Saturday, hundreds of house parties will be organized by supporters who want him to run for president again. By the end of January, at least three co-sponsors of Sanders's major legislation — Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker — are expected to be running. Sanders's supporters, in general, have praised his commitment to running a more diverse and sensitive campaign, if he runs again.", "label": 9}

Well, all of the backward-looking economic data says that we're nowhere near a recession — not when we've added an average of 254,000 jobs a month in the past three months, compared with the 100,000 or so we'd need to keep the unemployment rate from going up — while most of the forward-looking financial indicators say that one might not be that far away. In other words, for every bit of good news about today, such as the continued growth in manufacturing employment, there's a bit of bad news about the outlook for tomorrow, such as the big drop in manufacturing production. Which is why the Fed is justified in thinking that it'll need to raise rates a few times this year to keep inflation in check at the same time that markets are, maybe not equally justified, but still on firm ground in thinking that it's more likely that the Fed will end up cutting them.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "So what should the Fed do then? Well, in this case, the easy answer is the correct one. It should wait.

Or how much of the slowdown in the rest of the world will put a speed limit on our own economy. Or whether higher wages will continue to suck more people into the workforce, as they did last month, or are instead a sign that companies are starting to run out of workers.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The good news, then, is that — as Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome H. Powell took pains to emphasize on Friday —this is exactly what they intend to do. If things do indeed get bumpy over the next few months, the Fed is perfectly willing to put its rate-hiking plans on hold, and even stop its bond holdings from shrinking any further. Which are real possibilities. See, while it's easy to make fun of the stock market for, as the old saying goes, predicting nine out of the last five recessions, it's important to understand that part of the reason it has so many false positives is that it often prompts policymakers to act before things get worse. So both we and the Fed should take it seriously, especially when the much less erratic bond market is telling the same story. Indeed, the fact that long-term interest rates are very close to being lower than short-term interest rates is its way of saying that it thinks the Fed is going to have start cutting rates soon — which it would do only to fight a recession.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "And that brings us to the most important point of all: What makes a warning a warning is that it happens before things get bad. So yes, the economy is in very good shape right now, but so was it in 2006, the last time long-term rate fell below short-term ones. That didn't keep the economic storm clouds away 12 to 18 months later — that's usually how long it takes for a recession to hit after the yield curve inverts like that — and it won't this time either if we aren't careful.", "label": 9}
