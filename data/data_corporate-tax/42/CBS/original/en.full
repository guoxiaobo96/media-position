{"original": "Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz says he's considering running for president as an independent, telling 60 Minutes he might jump into the race without party backing."}
{"original": "I am seriously thinking of running for president, Schultz told correspondent Scott Pelley in an interview airing Sunday. I will run as a centrist independent, outside of the two-party system. We're living at a most fragile time, not only the fact that this president is not qualified to be the president, but the fact that both parties are consistently not doing what's necessary on behalf of the American people and are engaged, every single day, in revenge politics."}
{"original": "Schultz, who describes himself as a lifelong Democrat, said his potential decision to launch an independent bid for the White House, rather than seek the Democratic Party's nomination, is rooted in his belief that both major parties have embraced fringe elements and failed to address the country's growing debt."}
{"original": "I look at both parties. We see extremes on both sides. Well, we are sitting today with approximately $21.5 trillion of debt, which is a reckless example, not only of Republicans, but of Democrats, as well, as a reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility, he said."}
{"original": "Asked whether he believed an independent campaign would siphon crucial votes from the Democratic nominee and thereby help Mr. Trump win reelection, Schultz demurred and said his campaign, if launched, would attract a diverse group of voters."}
{"original": "I want to see the American people win. I want to see America win. I don't care if you're a Democrat, independent, libertarian, Republican, he said. Bring me your ideas. And I will be an independent person who will embrace those ideas. Because I am not, in any way, in bed with a party."}
{"original": "Schultz vowed to release his tax returns if he does launch a bid. The Starbucks mogul, who stepped back from his role at the coffee giant beginning in 2016, is worth around $3.3 billion."}
{"original": "During the interview, Schultz sharply criticized the president's first term in office, including the decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. He said he believes Mr. Trump is not qualified to occupy the Oval Office."}
{"original": "Not only the fact that this president is not qualified to be the president, but the fact that both parties are consistently not doing what's necessary on behalf of the American people and are engaged, every single day, in revenge politics, Schultz said, calling this a fragile time in America."}
{"original": "Schultz is one of several billionaires considering running for president. Michael Bloomberg, who may seek the Democratic nomination, is also mulling a presidential bid."}
{"original": "Tucked inside President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan is a seemingly radical notion that children should not grow up in poverty."}
{"original": "Congressional Democrats are now sketching out that vision more fully by proposing to temporarily raise the child tax credit, now at a maximum of $2,000, to as much as $3,600 per child annually. Their plan would also make the credit fully available to the poorest families, instead of restricting it based on the parents' tax liability."}
{"original": "The Democratic plan would likely mark the most significant step in the fight against child poverty since LBJ's Great Society, said Daniel Hemel, a law professor at the University of Chicago, who noted that a family with two school-age children and no income would get $6,000 under the proposal."}
{"original": "This one-off benefit is intended to help relieve millions of families hurt by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic which caused more than 50,000 Americans, including 18 million children, to experience hunger in 2020, according to the nonprofit Feeding America."}
{"original": "Researchers from Northwestern University estimate that food insecurity in America doubled overall at the start of the pandemic, and more than tripled in households with children. The researchers attribute approximately half of that increase to job losses."}
{"original": "Parents also have lost their access to child care, pushing them out of the labor force and hindering the economic recovery. Children have gone without the classroom time needed for social and academic progress. Nearly three million women have dropped out of the workforce in the past year."}
{"original": "When Lyndon Johnson became president in 1963, nearly 25% of children lived in poverty. The combination of Great Society programs that included nutrition aid and preschool funding helped slash the child poverty rate to 14% by 1969, according to the Census Bureau. The rate has since bounced up and down with the broader economy, but it has never fallen meaningfully below that 1969 level."}
{"original": "Biden has pitched his rescue plan as an immediate response to the pandemic, but the child tax credit expansion might end up seeding the kind of lasting change that tends to bring a political fight. Some conservatives say the plan would discourage parents from working and would not reduce poverty as a result. But liberals view it as an investment in children that needs to stay in place to ultimately improve people's lives and the economy."}
{"original": "This is a really bold idea, said C. Nicole Mason, CEO of the liberal Institute for Women's Policy Research. Things that we wouldn't have been talking about as possible a year before the pandemic are suddenly on the table — and this is one of those things."}
{"original": "In a Friday speech about his full COVID-19 relief proposal, Biden said the spending would ultimately lead to durable economic gains. His plan includes funding for school reopenings, child care and other programs to help the youngest Americans."}
{"original": "The simple truth is, if we make these investments now, with interest rates at historic lows, we'll generate more growth, higher incomes, a stronger economy and our nation's finances will be in a stronger position as well, Biden said."}
{"original": "Past economic research has shown that each dollar spent on health insurance programs for children led to a $1.78 return for the government, according to a 2020 paper by Harvard University economists Nathaniel Hendren and Ben Sprung-Keyser. The argument from many economists is that financial relief for children would produce similar benefits for decades to come."}
{"original": "But conservatives say the increased child tax credits could discourage poor people from seeking jobs. Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he believes the proposal would eventually undo the work requirements that were part of the 1996 overhaul of welfare, a reform that Biden voted for as a Delaware senator."}
{"original": "They're clearly using this COVID situation to try and permanently change the welfare state and permanently enlarge it, said Rector, stressing that needy families already have access to extensive anti-poverty programs."}
{"original": "As outlined by the House Ways and Means Committee, the expanded child tax credit would likely help about 20 million lower-income people. Families would receive up to $3,600 annually for each child under age 6 and as much as $3,000 for those up to age 17. The credit would start to phase out for individual parents earning more than $75,000 and couples making $150,000. Payments of the credit would be made monthly, even to families who owe no federal income taxes — a change from current policy."}
{"original": "The plan has shifted some of the politics around child poverty. Republican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah last week proposed his own plan to provide at least $3,000 per child to families, but the payments would be funded by cutting other government programs and tax credits for parents. It's unlikely that Democrats would back Romney's plan because it would cut other forms of aid to children, meaning it has not gained much political traction so far."}
{"original": "Researchers at Columbia University estimated that Biden's entire $1.9 trillion relief plan would slash the child poverty rate to less than 7% this year."}
{"original": "Supporters of the package also see a return to grappling with big ideas about poverty that has not occurred for decades. The child tax credit is possibly the start of a larger transformation in how the government addresses child poverty."}
{"original": "A one-year improvement is great, and it puts the architecture in place, said Michelle Dallafior, senior vice president for the advocacy group First Focus on Children. But we need to keep doing more and build something permanent. No child should live in poverty."}
{"original": "LONDON -- On June 2, 1953, the United Kingdom -- and the world -- turned on their new television sets to watch Queen Elizabeth's coronation. Those were the days before satellite television, and CBS News chartered a Mustang fighter jet to fly the freshly developed film reels to the U.S. in record speed."}
{"original": "Walter Cronkite was the first to broadcast the event in America from a makeshift studio, in a hangar at Boston's Logan Airport."}
{"original": "The images of pageantry and tradition -- and the young, 27-year-old queen at the center of it all -- were unlike any seen before."}
{"original": "Lady Anne Glenconnor walked alongside the queen as a maid of Honor."}
{"original": "It was like a production, she recalled. It was like making a film."}
{"original": "Queen Elizabeth II, surrounded by the bishop of Durham Lord Michael Ramsay (L) and the bishop of Bath and Wells Lord Harold Bradfield, receives homage and allegiance from her subjects during her coronation ceremony on June 2, 1953 in Westminster Abbey, London. Getty"}
{"original": "Elizabeth has spent the last 65 years getting used to horse drawn carriages and her five-pound bejeweled crown, which she once joked could break her neck."}
{"original": "At 92 years old, she is the oldest -- and longest -- reigning current monarch in the world, and she still keeps a busy schedule."}
{"original": "She has three engagements over the next 10 days so she's packing it in -- at 92 with no signs really of slowing down, said royal correspondent Roya Nikkhah."}
{"original": "Nikkhah said for a monarchy often seen as a bit stuffy, Elizabeth ushered in an era of change."}
{"original": "Under the queen's reign the monarch has started paying income tax for the first time, Nikkhah said. She heralded in the age of social media for the monarchy which was very much her doing. There have been leaps and strides in the monarchy under her watch."}
{"original": "There is perhaps no better example of the queen's leaps and strides than her evolving royal family. Elizabeth inherited a throne that once shamed her uncle for wanting to marry an American divorcee."}
{"original": "Last month's royal wedding of Prince Harry and American divorcee Meghan Markle was a celebration of love and diversity -- and a steady march forward along a path paved by the queen for more than six decades."}
{"original": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the many Democrats running for president in 2020, spoke at the Alejandro Tapia y Rivera Theater in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Tuesday evening, bringing her populist economic message the embattled American territory. Warren addressed the hardships Puerto Rico has endured in the past two years, particularly its debt crisis and the recovery in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria."}
{"original": "Puerto Rico has not been treated with respect, Warren said. Around 3,000 people died in the aftermath of Maria, and the federal government's response to hurricanes Harvey and Irma on the mainland was faster and more generous — in terms of resources and funds — than its assistance to Puerto Rico before and in the aftermath of Hurricane María, according to a newly released study. She called for the resignation or firing of FEMA Administrator Brock Long."}
{"original": "Warren also addressed reports that President Trump is mulling calling a national emergency and using disaster funding to pay for a border wall."}
{"original": "Back when he was running for office, Donald Trump promised that Mexico would pay for this wall. Now he thinks that the people of Puerto Rico who are struggling to get back on their feet should get stuck with the bill instead, Warren said, calling the wall dumb. Puerto Rico has suffered enough. We will not allow anyone to sabotage your recovery – not even the President of the United States."}
{"original": "She also said that she supports the creation of a commission to look at the federal government's response to Maria."}
{"original": "I've called for an independent, 9/11-style commission to understand how and why Washington's response to these hurricanes was so inadequate—and to make sure nothing like this ever, ever happens again, she said."}
{"original": "Warren also discussed Puerto Rico's $70 billion in federal debt and $50 billion in pension obligations. If Puerto Rico were a corporation or an American city, she said, it would be able to file for bankruptcy. However, an unelected oversight board was put in place by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act in 2016. This year, the board proposed cuts to almost one-third of the government budget in six years, which would affect subsidies to municipal governments and university tuition."}
{"original": "In response, Warren has proposed a Territorial Relief Act for Puerto Rico, and said she would support Marshall Plan-style investment in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."}
{"original": "Warren argued that Puerto Rico has not received enough respect, and that respect begins with allowing the territory to decide upon its relationship to the United States."}
{"original": "Respect for Puerto Rico means that you have the right to determine the nature of your association with the United States. Puerto Rico deserves self-determination on this question, and I will support the decision of the people of Puerto Rico, Warren said."}
{"original": "She also argued that her Anti-Corruption Act would clean up Washington, and by extension help Puerto Rico."}
{"original": "Washington works great for the Wall Street bankers who want bailouts, tax cuts, and no regulations, but not for the people right here in Puerto Rico, she said."}
{"original": "We believe that when we come together, we can build a government that reflects our best values, Warren said at the end of her speech. One based on respect. One where we dream big and fight hard. And when we do that, I know that we can make real change."}

{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on FACE THE NATION, across the county and around the world. The COVID-19 or coronavirus emergency goes from bad to much worse."}
{"original": "With one in four Americans under orders to stay home unless it's absolutely essential to go out, fear and uncertainty have become the new normal."}
{"original": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's now at one hundred and forty-eight foreign countries. Can you believe that?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: States are struggling to line up resources and equipment to ensure they can handle the now inevitable onslaught of new infections. In some places, testing is now limited to health care workers and those who are seriously ill. In New York State, the situation is dire."}
{"original": "ANDREW CUOMO: We are literally scouring the globe looking for medical supplies."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump is under pressure and under fire for continuing to send out confusing signals about the federal government's response."}
{"original": "PETER ALEXANDER: What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I say that you're a terrible reporter, that's what I say. I think that's a very nasty question and I think it's a very bad signal that you're putting out to the American people. The American people are looking for answers and they're looking for hope."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is the President spreading false hope by promoting drugs that have not been proven to be effective in treating coronavirus?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: May work, may not work. You know, smart guy. I feel good about it."}

{"original": "Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, former director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn will all join us. Finally, John Dickerson's perspective on leadership in times of crisis."}
{"original": "All that and more, is just ahead on FACE THE NATION."}
{"original": "Good morning. And welcome to FACE THE NATION. It has been another week of fear and frustration as the country and the world continue to try to cope with the coronavirus. Internationally the number of cases reached a new milestone Saturday and now stands at over three hundred thousand. There have been over thirteen thousand deaths. The rate at which it is spreading is truly alarming. The World Health Organization reported Friday that although it took three months to reach a hundred thousand cases worldwide, it took only twelve days to reach another one hundred thousand."}
{"original": "We begin with the situation here in the United States, where there are now at least twenty-six thousand reported cases of coronavirus and three hundred and forty people have died, an enormous increase from just one week ago. The U.S. borders to Mexico and Canada are closed to nonessential travel, and the State Department is advising people to avoid going anywhere abroad. And now, a quarter of the country is under mandatory stay-at-home orders, allowed to go out only for essential services. One of the states with that mandatory order is California. CBS News correspondent Jamie Yuccas reports from Los Angeles."}
{"original": "JAMIE YUCCAS (CBS News Correspondent/@jamieyuccas): California stay-at-home restrictions went into effect late last week, but for New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, tomorrow will be the first day when most of the close to forty million people in those states are being asked not to go to work. Governors in these hard-hit states are sending consistent messages when it comes to staying home."}
{"original": "GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM (D-California): Those young people that are still out there on the beaches thinking this is a party, time to grow up. You know, time to wake up. Time to-- to recognize it's not just about the old folks. It's about your impact on their lives. Don't be selfish."}
{"original": "PHIL MURPHY: We need you to just stay at home."}
{"original": "JAMIE YUCCAS: In Los Angeles, the Department of Public Health advised providers only to administer a test if a positive result would change treatment. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says his state is following these rules."}
{"original": "ANDREW CUOMO: If you have been exposed to someone positive, if you are showing symptoms, if you meet that protocol, you get a test."}
{"original": "JAMIE YUCCAS: But as more people get sick, places like Maryland activated more than two thousand National Guard troops to help with transporting patients, conducting temperature screenings at state facilities, and working with local hospitals to set up triage tents."}
{"original": "JAMIE YUCCAS: Here in California, the governor deployed the National Guard to assist food banks facing food shortages. The governor also says he's working with Apple CEO Tim Cook and tech titan Elon Musk to produce more masks and ventilators for health care providers. Margaret."}
{"original": "We go now to Capitol Hill where Congress is working on what is likely to be the largest economic rescue package in U.S. history. Chief congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes is there. Nancy, how are the negotiations going?"}
{"original": "NANCY CORDES (CBS News Chief Congressional Correspondent/@nancycordes): Well, Margaret, Republicans tell us that the negotiations have all but wrapped up on this massive package. Democrats say they still have some big sticking points. But everyone understands here that time is of the essence because every day businesses are laying more workers off. And one big piece of this package that has come together over the weekend is what some Democrats are describing as unemployment insurance on steroids, where if you have lost your job as a result of this crisis, the government would pay to keep you at your previous salary for perhaps as long as four months. Beyond that, they are still fine-tuning those one-time cash payments for American workers, about twelve hundred dollars for individuals who make up to seventy-five thousand dollars a year, plus an additional five hundred dollars for every child of those workers. Then there's a very robust small business piece, a three hundred fifty billion dollar package of loans and grants, Republicans estimating that that money could keep those businesses afloat for about six to seven weeks. All of these initiatives, plus the loans to the airlines, plus a big surge of funding for hospital gear, will cost, we're told, between 1.5 and two trillion dollars, and those numbers could go up. The four top congressional leaders will be sitting down this morning with the secretary of the treasury to hash all of this out one last time."}
{"original": "The goal, Margaret, is still to hold a final vote in the Senate tomorrow, and then send it to the House, hopefully to the President's desk by midweek."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be tracking that. Thank you, Nancy Cordes."}
{"original": "We turn now to London and CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer for a look at the latest around the world."}
{"original": "ELIZABETH PALMER: Margaret, I'm standing in the center of London. This is Trafalgar Square, and normally it would be mobbed, but as you can see, it's practically deserted. We've had more than five thousand cases of coronavirus in the U.K. so far and the infection is still spreading, but for reasons nobody really understands it's Italy that has, by far, the worst outbreak."}
{"original": "ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@elizapalmer): Doctors in northern Italy are fighting around the clock battle to save lives, and they're losing. Almost eight hundred patients died overnight from Friday to Saturday. And the bad news is there is no evidence the tide is turning."}
{"original": "MAN: I never felt so stressed in my life."}
{"original": "ELIZABETH PALMER: As military trucks transported coffins to the local crematorium outside Bergamo, epidemiologists warn that infection on this scale may engulf the whole of Europe. Spain, already hard hit with almost four hundred new deaths overnight, is getting ready. Health officials in Madrid, for example, are setting up a vast temporary hospital in a conference center. Here in Britain, there was a last Friday night hurrah at pubs before the government ordered them shut this weekend, along with restaurants. Everywhere, along with the anxiety, is extraordinary compassion. When coronavirus meant that the body of Betty Ryan was driven to the cemetery in the west of Ireland with neither funeral nor wake, most of the town turned out to say goodbye in a spontaneous guard of honor."}
{"original": "ELIZABETH PALMER: The other major center of the outbreak is Iran. It's got an infection rate and a death rate similar to Spain's and climbing. And now governments in Africa and India are bracing themselves with billions of citizens for at least a crisis and maybe, Margaret, a catastrophe."}
{"original": "NORAH O'DONNELL: Liz Palmer, with that important look at the pandemic, thank you."}
{"original": "Doctor Anthony Fauci is the director at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, and that is where he joins us from this morning. Doctor Fauci, thank you for making time for us. You just--"}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, MD (Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases): Good to be with you."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard that report from our Liz Palmer about Italy. Are we on the same trajectory as Italy?"}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: No, not necessarily at all. I mean, obviously, things are unpredictable. You can't make any definitive statement. But if you look at the dynamics of the outbreak in Italy, we don't know why they are suffering so terribly. But there is a possibility and-- and many of us believe that early on they did not shut out as well the input of infections that originated in China and came to different parts of the world. One of the things that we did very early and very aggressively, the President, you know, had put the travel restriction--"}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: --coming from-- from China to the United States and most recently from Europe to the United States because Europe is really the new China. Again, I don't know why this is happening there to such an extent, but it is conceivable that once you get so many of these spreads out, they spread exponentially and you can never keep up with this tsunami, and I think that's what unfortunately our colleagues and our dear friends in Italy are facing. They are very competent. It isn't that they don't know what they're doing."}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: I think they have a situation in which they've been so overwhelmed from the beginning that they can't play catch up. And in direct answer to your question, Margaret, it is may be, and I hope and I think it will be the case, that we will not be that way because we have from the beginning been able to put a bit of a clamp on it. We're going to get hit. There's no doubt about it. We see it in New York. New York is ter-- is terribly suffering. But the kinds of mitigation issues that are going on right now, the things that we're seeing in this country, this physical separation, at the same time as we're preventing an influx of cases coming in, I think that's going to go a long way to preventing us from becoming an Italy."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: This was an animal virus that jumped to a human."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Then it started spreading human to human. Is the virus mutating? Is it changing?"}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, this is an RNA virus, Margaret. And it always will mutate. The real question is so that people don't get confused. Viruses commute-- mutate with no substantial impact on its function. So I have no doubt it's mutating as all RNA viruses mutate. We have not seen thus far any type of change in the way it's acting, but we are keeping a very close eye on it because it is conceivable that it could mutate and change some of the ways that it performs. But we have not seen that yet, but we're not going to just not pay attention to it."}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: We're going to follow it closely."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's very important to highlight there. You know, one of the things that stood out this week in some of the briefings we heard from the White House, was this mentioned, particularly from your colleague, Ambassador Birx, that young people in Europe seemed to be affected in a way that was unexpected."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we heard from the CDC this week, twenty percent of the hospitalizations in this country were between the ages of twenty and forty-four. Why--"}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: You're absolutely-- yeah."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --are young people getting affected this way when it wasn't expected?"}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: You're-- you're absolutely correct. And you just nailed the very important critical issue that we're looking very closely at. You know, it looks like there's a big difference between that demography, as we call it, from China and what we're seeing in Europe. Now, we have to look at the young people who are getting seriously ill from the European cohort and make sure it isn't just driven by the fact that they have underlying conditions because we know that underlying conditions, all bets are off. No matter how young you are, if you have an underlying serious medical condition, you're going to potentially get into trouble. But if they don't have underlying conditions, that will be something we have to really examine as to why we're seeing it here, but we didn't see it in China. So we're going to look at that very closely."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned in particular New York and what may be coming there. The President has tweeted this morning that Ford, GM and Tesla have been given the go ahead to make ventilators. There's been this back and forth over whether the President actually has ordered companies or not to produce needed medical equipment. What have these companies agreed to do and when will medical professionals have what they need?"}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, I mean, as yesterday in the press conference that-- that I'm sure you heard, what the President was saying is that these companies are coming forth on their own. And I think that's an extraordinary spirit of the American spirit of not needing to be coaxed. They're stepping forward. They're making not only masks, but PPEs and now ventilators. So what we're going to be seeing, and-- and we're seeing it already, in the beginning, obviously, there was an issue with testing. The testing now-- a large number of tests are available now, out there because the private companies have gotten involved. The--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But like the mayor of New York has said this week that he was going to run out of medical equipment--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --in-- in a matter of two weeks."}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Right. That's true."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when will medical-- it is true he will run out?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will the federal government get him what he needs?"}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: True, true to both of them. Let me explain."}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: We were at-- at the task force meeting yesterday, and it was very clear that the issue in New York was right on the front burner. And the situation is now that the resources that are being marshaled are going to be clearly directed to those hotspots that need it most. And clearly, that's California, Washington State, and obviously, New York is the most hard hit. So not only is New York trying to get resources themselves, but we're going to be pouring it in from the federal government. So it would be a combination of local and federal. But it's very, very clear that they are a very high priority."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are the leading infectious disease expert in the U.S. government. You said this week that you differed from the President in his assessment that a combination of two drugs, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combined could have the outcome that he described to the public. They possibly could. Where-- who is the President listening to? And do you see a concern here that those drugs could become, you know, basically oversubscribed and there could be a shortage that could impact people who have persistent medical issues like lupus and need those?"}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Okay. So, Margaret, there's an issue here of where we're-- we're coming from. The President, as heard, as we all have heard, what are what I call anecdotal reports that certain drugs work. So what he was trying to do and express was the hope that if they might work, let's try and push their usage. I, on the other side, have said I'm not disagreeing with the fact anecdotally they might work but my job is to prove definitively from a scientific standpoint that they do work. So I was taking a purely medical, scientific standpoint and the President was trying to bring hope to the people."}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: I think there's this issue of trying to separate the two of us. There isn't fundamentally a difference there. He is coming from it from a hope layperson standpoint."}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: I'm coming from it from a scientific standpoint."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we wish you the best. Thank you very much, Doctor."}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Good-- good to be with you."}
{"original": "We go now to the former director of the National Economic Council under President Trump, Gary Cohn. He is back in the private sector now and he joins us this morning from Long Island. Good morning to you."}
{"original": "GARY COHN (Former National Economic Council Director/@Gary_D_Cohn): Good morning, Margaret."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have Congress negotiating the largest economic bailout package, relief package in history. And the Treasury secretary said this morning that if it doesn't work, they will go back and ask for more money in ten to twelve weeks."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: This doesn't sound like there is a timeline on the horizon. Can you give me a scale of what kind of economic pain is coming?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Margaret, a-- as we've all been talking about, the economic pain is enormous. You know, you think of all the workers that have been forced out of their jobs and-- and the economic activity that goes along with that. That is not going on and will not go on any time in the near future. So what Congress is trying to do, and I applaud what they're trying to do, both on the large businesses and the small business, is they're trying to do an income replacement plan. Keep as many people employed and on companies' payrolls as you can and allow them to keep living, allow them to buy their groceries, allow them to buy the drugs and medicine that they need to live their lifestyle, and simultaneously keep them on the books and records of companies. So when the economy does turn around, and it will turn around, people know where they work and they can go back to work immediately instead of going through the whole rehiring process. It would be a shame if we let people go, terminated them, put them on unemployment and then had to try and rehire them once we started the economy."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But despite that, there are expectations and estimates from banks like Bank of America that this week alone, three million people could file for unemployment-- ser-- unemployment, and that Goldman Sachs, your old firm, says that number is like two and a quarter million. These are massive numbers. What about those people? How do you provide some kind of support?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: So what the bill in Congress is doing, and-- and there's two parts to it. There's the Collins-Rubio piece for the businesses under five hundred employees. And there's the larger piece for businesses over five hundred employees. These are massive, and I mean massive, stimulus packages that are designed to allow companies to borrow money and the loans will be forgiven to keep their employees on the payroll. The people that applied for unemployment last week and that were terminated last week, they were terminated prior to these-- this legislation existing."}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Hopefully once this legislation gets passed, and hopefully it's today or tomorrow, and sooner is better, these people can go back on the books and records of their companies and they can get their payroll. They don't have to go on unemployment. What we're trying to do is keep everyone off unemployment, keep them on the books and records of their companies so they can return back to a normalized economy when it exists."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we just don't know when that is yet. Part of what it seems like is unaddressed at this point is what happens to all those people who count as-- as self-employed who-- who are contractors. People who can't necessarily say they're unemployed, but they don't have another paycheck coming. What about them?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Margaret, I think that you just hit on a very important topic. And-- and I've been talking a lot about this. You know, we've got people that work at big companies. We've got people that work at small companies. And then we've got this big piece of the economy that's either self-employed or contract labor. Think of people that work at stadiums and arenas. Think of people that work in catering businesses. Think of Uber drivers and Lyft drivers. They need to get compensated as well. What I would encourage in the legislation, hopefully this is in there, we go back to those companies that hired part time labor or hired labor as needed. And you go back and look at what you were paying them for the last month or the last two weeks and you go back and pay them that exact amount of money. And those companies can actually go to the two facilities that were created, borrow that money and be relieved of that debt and compensate their people as well."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: How long do you think the bailout that's being put together will-- will buy us before you see job cuts?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Well, what they're trying to do, and I applaud this, is not have job cuts. Allow businesses to keep all of their employees on--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: --the books and records and continue to pay them their salary. That would be the best--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We just don't know?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: --that would be the best outcome. We don't know. If there's any ambiguity, companies are going to act rationally and they're going to cut employees because there can-- they're going to constrain their most scarce capital, which is-- which is dollars. They're going to hoard dollars, which is the exact wrong thing we want them to do. So what Congress is trying to do right now is the appropriate measure in forcing money in-- into businesses and allowing them to keep all their employees on the books."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the-- the key economic players in this country, a member of the Federal Reserve, one of the presidents, Neel Kashkari told 60 MINUTES that they are seeing a freezing up of new financings for corporations. That sounds like when he's looking out there in the marketplace at credit markets, that there is a warning that this could be a financial crisis."}
{"original": "GARY COHN: So remember, the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States is the lender of last resort. And so far they have done an adequate job, but they have done many of the things they need to do. What the Fed needs to do now is they need to expend-- expand who can come to the Fed and borrow money and what securities they will take as collateral. So by expanding the collateral window into municipal bonds, bonds issued by states and local governments who are really feeling the crunch here, those are the people paying out some of the medical bills and some of the unemployment insurance and allowing corporate bonds to be pledged at the window as good collateral. We would reopen the corporate borrowing and allow corporates to continue some normal source of economic activity."}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Or? Or-- if we-- look, there is no or. We're in a time where we have to go do these things, we have to allow that collateral to be pledged. And I think the Fed will get there. They've been moving fairly-- they've been moving very fast--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: --on what they've been doing, they just have to continue to expand what they're doing."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Gary Cohn, thank you for joining us."}
{"original": "Important perspective. And we will be back with more FACE THE NATION. Be sure to tune in tonight to Scott Pelley's interview with Neel Kashkari. He helped pull the U.S. out of the 2008 recession. That's on 60 MINUTES."}

{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We turn now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He joins us from outside his home in Connecticut. Doctor, good to have you back with us."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Thanks."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been talking to Congress. You talked to the administration. And you've been clear that you believe there was a failure to plan in January for March. And you're saying now, in March, we need to be looking ahead and planning for May. Exactly what is it that all of us need to be planning for?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Well, right now, we're engaging in broad-based population-based mitigation techniques, things like stay at home orders, closing schools. These are population level techniques to try to break off chains of transmission. That's the right thing to do in cities like San Francisco and New York, where we see hotspots, where we see epidemic spread. Unfortunately, we're not engaging in those tactics across the whole country. There should be some form of mitigation across the whole country because we're all at risk. But we need to start thinking about how we transition away from that. Come April, come May, when the epidemic curve starts coming down, we can't just take our foot off the brake immediately. We need to start it-- start including and introducing what we call case-based interventions, trying to do mass screening and identify people who either are infected or who've been in close contact with people who've been infected and go towards more of an individual person approach rather than a population level approach. That planning needs to be underway right now. We need to know how we're going to slowly transition into another paradigm. It's not a question of either or. It's a question of substituting in other techniques that are less intrusive to-- for what we're doing now."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Doctor Fauci say there's no doubt we're going to get hit. He mentioned New York. There are some projections from New York hospitals that a peak could hit within the next twenty days. What is it that Americans need to be prepared for?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Well, I think that the scenes out of New York are going to be shocking. I think that the hospitals in the next two weeks are going to be at the brink of being overwhelmed and we're going to start to see places like Javits Convention Center and other facilities used to start to house people. They're going to start getting thousands of admissions coming into that city. And this was infection that started two weeks ago. The time to hospitalization is nine to twelve days. I think there's other cities that are at extreme risk. New Orleans is at very high risk and they're not taking appropriate measures. This is a sticky virus. We're learning that much more of the transmission probably happens from touching contaminated surfaces. So any city that has a mass transit system is probably at risk and needs to be taking very aggressive steps. Cities like Chicago, San Francisco, New York, Boston. You've seen San Francisco implement tough measures."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Illinois recently implemented tough measures. We need to continue that right now."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there an existing antiviral drug that is effective and-- in at least containing this or preventing someone from getting seriously ill?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: No, there's drugs that look promising, there's drugs that are in-- in proper trials. We really need to continue to conduct research to figure out what works. Right now, there is no drug that looks like it's proven so overwhelming in early stage clinical trials that we can say it's highly promising. There's drugs that suggest that they may have activity against this virus. But the other question is, when you introduce the drug, sometimes when you introduce an antiviral drug late in the course of the disease, after people are in the critical care unit and very sick, it may not provide a benefit. Sometimes you have to introduce an antiviral drug earlier. And that's how we treat the flu, for example, with drugs like Tamiflu. We introduce them earlier in the course of the illness and that's where they have the greatest benefit."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would agree with Doctor Fauci that there needs to be clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which the president said he thinks is already effective?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Absolutely, and that may not be the drug that ends up holding to his promise. The study that looked at that drug and showed activity was-- was a study that involved about twenty patients and only six in the arm that showed the benefit. And the benefit that they showed was that they decrease the amount of virus in their-- in their noses when you did nasal swabs in those patients. So it could very well be that the drug is reducing viral shedding, but having no impact on the clinical course of those patients. So the data on that is very preliminary. What we need to do is what we call a master protocol, where we basically test a lot of drugs at once. We randomize patients to different treatments so everyone gets a treatment if they need it and we figure out which is working the best. That's what we did with Ebola. We came up with some very--"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: --effective treatments against Ebola."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The-- the Trump administration announced this past week that the first trial through NIH of a vaccine was started out in Seattle. Given the timeline for this, do resources need to be refocused from a vaccine into some of the treatments that-- that you are talking about?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: I think absolutely. We could have a drug, a potential prophylactic drug that could prevent people from getting an infection or even treating infection as early as this summer, especially when you look at some of the approaches where companies are developing antibodies that directly target the virus. I think this is highly promising. We need to be putting a lot of resources into that. Senator Daines introduced a provision in Capitol Hill that may be included in the final package and what it would do is it would basically scale up manufacturing right away for the promising treatments that make it into the government's sanction trials. So that if one ends up working, we're ready to distribute it on a mass scale. You have literally millions of doses available. Now, what's going to happen is a lot of those drugs won't work and we're going to end up throwing away the drug that we manufactured. But I think that's a small price to pay for the benefit of having drug available, if in fact one proves that it's working."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: In other words, tax payers helping to subsidize some of this research immediately. When do you see us being able to plan about going back to normal life?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Well, I think it's going to be a slow transition. I think that the epidemic right now that's underway is probably going to peak sometime in April, probably late April and tail off into May and June and hopefully transmission will be broken off in July and August. We need to plan for what we're going to do in the fall to prevent another epidemic and outbreak. But life's never going to be perfectly normal till we get to a vaccine. We're always going to have to implement some measures, but they could be case based measures where we look at individuals and screened very aggressively for the virus and quarantine and isolate individual people rather than quarantining--"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: --mass populations. That's what we need to get to. That's going to be a transition but we can get there. There is light at the end of this tunnel."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Gottlieb, thank you."}
{"original": "And we want to go now to the president and CEO of the American Hospital Association for the latest on how hospitals are battling the pandemic. Richard Pollack joins us from downtown Washington this morning. Good morning to you."}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK (President & CEO of the American Hospital Association): Good morning. And let me just say at the outset, I just want to recognize the unbelievable work that's going on in our hospitals by the doctors, nurses, and other health care workers. Their dedication and their efforts are ones that we should all very much appreciate."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I think everyone in this country would agree with you on that point, sir. I want to ask you, though, about what we need to know and what Congress should be focused on getting to those medical workers."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is about a hundred-and-ten-billion promised in this emergency legislation. What does that get the doctors and the hospitals around the country? Is it enough to meet the need?"}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK: Yeah, it's a start, and it's a very good start. The American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and us, the Hospital Association, all said that we needed a minimum of a hundred billion dollars. And we're hopeful that that package will deliver us the assistance that's needed, the tools and resources that are needed, so that we can continue to respond to this crisis. This is an unprecedented situation in which we're entering uncharted waters. The congressional leadership on the Senate side, in particular, Senator-- Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer are very attentive to this matter."}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK: We're hoping to see legislation that provides us with assistance when it comes to increasing capacity--"}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK: --when it comes to paying for overtime, and very importantly, when it comes to helping us with cash flow to sustain our operations. We could see hospitals close in this situation as well because they just don't have the resources."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House and the American Academy of Surgeons has publicly called on Americans and hospitals to reschedule elective surgeries because they don't want to overwhelm hospitals, and they want to save equipment for those worst case scenarios. Do you now support that because I know you weren't supportive of that call for a while?"}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK: No, that's not quite right. We support guidelines that were put out by the federal government around the notion of elective surgery. And we have found that in most cases across the country that is the case. Sometimes there's a little confusion between what's considered elective surgery. There are things that are-- might be elective that are, in fact, lifesaving--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, so do you--"}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK: --like replacing a heart valve."}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK: But there is no question that--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you think though--"}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK: --we have stopped doing that in a lot of areas."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --on what you're saying is too nebulous? Do you think there need to be specific guidelines set out saying hospitals stop these kinds of elective surgeries, plastic surgery, for example, knee replacement?"}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK: They're already out there."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are those kinds of specifics-- well, state and districts is what you said should be able to make those calls. Do you want the federal government to provide more clarity on that?"}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK: Federal government has already done it. The Centers for Medicare and Medicare Service-- Medicare and Medicaid Services have put out guidelines. We support those guidelines."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So how do hospitals then determine who can get needed medical supplies, things like ventilators? Is it-- is there a process? Is there a guideline in this or is it luck of the draw?"}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK: In terms of ventilators, we-- we're going to need more. There is a supply. Many people have them, but there's a gap and we're going to need more. But the most immediate thing we need is personal protective equipment: the masks, the gowns, the goggles, that type of equipment to protect our health care heroes that are on the front lines. That is what is most essential now. If we don't protect our health care workers, the system will completely collapse. That's what's necessary. And that's why, in fact, we need to see the Defense Production Act employed in an aggressive manner. It's great that people are stepping up, but--"}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK: --we need to be more aggressive in getting those supplies to the front lines."}
{"original": "RICHARD J. POLLACK: They may be flowing, but we need more."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, no. And that is why I-- I asked Doctor Fauci about that. Thank you very much, Mister Pollack."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We now go to the chairman and CEO of FedEx Frederick Smith, who is in Memphis, Tennessee, this morning. Good to see you. Thank you for joining us."}
{"original": "FREDERICK W. SMITH (Chairman & CEO of FedEx): Good morning."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our latest reporting is that this bill Congress is still negotiating contains about eight billion dollars in rescue money for carriers. Will your company be seeking any part of that federal aid?"}
{"original": "FREDERICK W. SMITH: I don't think so at this point in time. It would only be available or needed by FedEx, and the all cargo industry if things really get bad and then only in the form of loan guarantees. Now the passenger carriers, which have a fifty-billion-dollar package, that's a different story. They're in very dire straits with significant lack of demand. That's not the situation with us. In certain cases, our business has actually increased because of this situation. In others, it's declined. So I doubt that we'll need it, but it's a good thing to have there so we don't have to shut down long-term projects like facility construction and purchase of airplanes and trucks and things of that nature."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Provide some certainty for your planning. But your CEO of one of your divisions, FedEx Express, signed onto a letter yesterday that was released. He signed alongside some of those passenger carrier CEOs and it urged Congress to swiftly pass this bill they're still negotiating or saying there will be mass furloughs, there will be mass layoffs. What size of-- of layoffs are we talking about? What is your company expecting?"}
{"original": "FREDERICK W. SMITH: Well, FedEx is not expecting any layoffs at all, quite the contrary. Our people are working very heavily on both the business-to-business side, moving things for hospitals and diagnostic labs, picking up specimens and getting them into the various locations where they can be tested. The passenger carriers, again, that's a completely different story. They have very little demand at the moment for their services. And if they don't get this fifty-million-dollar relief and I think that's mostly loan guarantees as well, they will begin massive layoffs. They have no option."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are for you, and in the cargo side, you are still able to function to deliver things around the world. But there are significant travel restrictions. What are you seeing in terms of supply lines staying open?"}
{"original": "FREDERICK W. SMITH: Well, we began to deal with this problem in our operations in China in January, and there we took extraordinary measures to protect our people and our pilots. Just last week, for instance, we flew two hundred and forty-six flights in and out of China. So we've been dealing with this for a long time. China is now actually back mostly in production. About ninety percent of their big factories are open. Their smaller businesses, less so, but about seventy percent. So with the shutdown of the passenger operations across the Pacific, we have significant backlogs coming into this country and a significant amount of traffic going back to China. More recently, the same thing's true across the Atlantic. Our--"}
{"original": "FREDERICK W. SMITH: --purple tail airplanes are carrying a lot of stuff both ways. Passenger planes, which carry a lot of cargo in the underbellies including some for us--"}
{"original": "FREDERICK W. SMITH: --they're all but gone from the market."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- but it sounds like you're saying trade can continue, though passenger travel is restricted. I-- I want to ask you about the safety of your employees as well here. I mean, there are reports that we saw in The New England Journal of Medicine recently saying that this virus can survive on different surfaces for different periods of time. On cardboard, it can survive for about twenty-four hours. How do you protect delivery workers who are literally going to Americans' front doors?"}
{"original": "FREDERICK W. SMITH: Well, we have massive efforts underway in all of our facilities to try to socially distance folks and their workstations. We're providing gloves and all kinds of antiseptic swabs and things of that nature. For people that are receiving packages, the CDC says not too much risk. But if you've got concerns, take a little alcohol and rub it across the package after it's left on your door, which is what we're doing. We suspended the requirement for signatures in certain cases. So I think that the risk is low and we're doing absolutely everything we can, cleaning our facilities prolifically. The place I'm talking to you from, one floor up, we had an employee last week that tested positive for it. We cleaned the building. We have lots of people working from home. So you just have to work through the issue using every measure at your disposal. We're moving a prolific amount--"}
{"original": "FREDERICK W. SMITH: --of hand sanitizer, for instance, in our freight company at the moment."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sure you are. Fred Smith, thank you for joining us and giving us your insight."}
{"original": "This crisis is having an enormous impact, as-- as you just heard, particularly in the airline industry, but that is the entire travel industry that is affected as well. And we're going to turn again this week to our CBS News transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave for more. He joins us from our newsroom. Kris, we were just talking about the bailout that-- bailout that Congress is putting forward. This is billions of dollars, not just for airlines but for retailers, for hotel companies. How much time does this buy them before we see layoffs?"}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE (CBS News Transportation Correspondent/@krisvancleave): Well, the airlines say if they get the package they want, they can avoid furloughs until at least the beginning of September. I can tell you, though, at least two regional airlines have already said they're shutting down because of the coronavirus and the drop in demand. Marriott Hotels has already started furloughing what it expects to be tens of thousands of workers, not only frontline workers but also amongst their corporate staff as Marriott has started to shutter some hotels temporarily because demand in the hotel industry. They're running at about twenty-five percent of what they should be typically. And the airlines are seeing passenger loads at twenty to thirty percent. It's just not a viable business without help."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's been this debate over whether the U.S. government and the U.S. taxpayers should essentially just hand over money in a grant to these airliners or whether it should be essentially a loan that could end up looking something like taking a stake as they did during the auto bailouts. What is it that the industry is actually asking for?"}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Sure. So the airlines are asking for a mix of immediate grants to keep their payrolls operational through at least the end of August. They're also asking for a package of loans and some tax changes, some tax benefits that would help them weather this. You know, an airline told me that, listen, they're going to operate about forty percent of the network they were operating just at the beginning of March. And they said we can't afford to be forty percent of an airline with a hundred percent of the payroll unless somebody steps up to fill in the gap. It's just not viable. What's in the Senate bill appears to be a package of loans and airlines and their labor unions are worried that that won't be sufficient to keep-- to avoid large scale furloughs in the airline industry. The hotels are already seeing that. So clearly there is a pressure to-- from the airline standpoint to get an influx of cash immediately. In exchange for that, they've said that they will-- will not furlough workers until at least September that they'll put limits on executive compensation, stock buybacks, and dividends, and certainly Congress can add other terms to that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So functionally what does that mean? Is their travel essentially going to be shutting down?"}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Well, we just today saw that Emirates, one of the larger global carriers is going to suspend all passenger travel later this month. U.S. air travel domestically. The President has said he wants to keep it-- it going domestically at least for absolutely essential travel. But the airlines, without any support, say they'll be out of money in the coming months. Already we've seen a dramatic decline. Some numbers for you, a year ago TSA screened 2.5 million travelers in a day. On Thursday, they screened fewer than six hundred thousand. At the beginning of the month, they were screening about 2.5, 2.3 million. You can see the drop off, seventy-six percent decline in travel."}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: That's very challenging, Margaret."}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: But the plan is to keep the planes flying for now."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: No doubt. Kris Van Cleave, thank you."}
{"original": "We'll be back in a moment."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: 60 MINUTES correspondent John Dickerson is our resident presidential historian. So we asked him for his thoughts this Sunday about leadership in times of crisis."}
{"original": "JOHN DICKERSON: As America struggles through quarantine, we're all improvising. Officials at the podium and parents at the kitchen table, as we shift to a social distance archipelago, each island six feet apart. This marching coronavirus is new but America has faced similar times--the Great Depression, World Wars, after 9/11. Each crisis has produced a leader, the names were different but there is a pattern."}
{"original": "PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."}
{"original": "JOHN DICKERSON: Franklin Roosevelt targeted fear in his inaugural address because while his programs would take time to kick in. The fight against fear could start right away and success in that fight would make future ones easier. We could use a little of that, every television seems tuned to the panic station. Seventy-five percent of us say we're worried, according to one poll. But Roosevelt didn't dismiss fear, he gave Americans a ladder over it, reminding them of all that previous generations of Americans had overcome and survived. After FDR's speech, one listener said, any man who can talk like that in times like these is worthy of every ounce of support a true American has. A leader helps tell us who we are, says Reagan's speechwriter Peggy Noonan. We leaned forward, hungry to hear, she says, now we will hear the thing we longed for. That's how leadership works. It's not just blowing a trumpet but sounding a call that people hear and respond to. It's the difference between a locker room speech and locker room talk. The best leaders trust the public and make them allies, says Amanda Ripley, who has studied disasters of all sorts and how to respond to them. The public performs extremely well when they are treated like grown-ups and told the truth. This is why Doctor Anthony Fauci has become a hero. People crave facts. Leaders know people don't panic when they are informed instead they are spurred to help."}
{"original": "President Eisenhower said leadership consists of nothing but taking responsibility including for everything that goes wrong, and giving your subordinates credit for everything that goes well. A leader taking responsibility, no matter what, shows that someone asking for sacrifice is also willing to sacrifice. Showing grace in that duty also puts a leader in worthy company with all the nurses, doctors and other Americans who show us every day that while the vaccine will come from the laboratory, the will to fight is already inside us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back."}

We'll be back next week to continue giving you the best information that we can. Today, we end with a view of isolation around the world and remind you we are all in this together. I'm Margaret Brennan."}

{"original": "A detailed accounting of the sales presented by prosecutors revealed that organizations paid Pugh $859,960 for orders of more than 132,100 copies. But only about 73,200 copies were printed. In their sentencing memorandum, prosecutors said Pugh's personal inventory of books never exceeded 8,216 copies, but she resold them repeatedly through the elaborate scheme."}
{"original": "The University of Maryland Medical System - one of the state's largest employers - was Pugh's biggest book customer. The system paid her a total of $500,000 for 100,000 copies that were meant to be distributed to schoolchildren, but about 60,000 of those books were sent to a city warehouse and a Pugh office where thousands were removed to give to other customers. Prosecutors say Pugh never delivered the other 40,000 books the health system purchased for city schools."}
{"original": "While serving in the state Senate, Pugh sat on a committee that funded the medical system. She also sat on the hospital network's board from 2001 until the scandal erupted in March. The former mayor returned the last $100,000 payment."}
{"original": "Other Pugh customers include CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield and Kaiser Permanente, which insure city employees. Some of their multiyear, multimillion-dollar contracts were awarded before Pugh took office, and some were awarded afterward, prosecutors said in a court filing."}
{"original": "While there is no evidence that Pugh attempted to extort or solicit bribes from any of the foregoing companies or organizations, the fact that she repeatedly and almost exclusively targeted them suggests that Pugh leveraged the power of her elected office to corruptly solicit money from companies and organizations that might be beholden to her, prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum."}
{"original": "The memorandum added that none of those who bought the books were even aware of their existence until Pugh mentioned them. Prosecutors said 93.6% of the book purchases, totaling $805,000, were bought by corporate buyers with an interest in obtaining or maintaining a government contract."}
{"original": "How early should you file your tax return? Filing your return as early as possible means you get your refund faster. But if you're not expecting a refund, you may want to wait. CPA Jonathan Medows breaks down factors to consider when you file your taxes."}
{"original": "Here's another financial matter to consider now that the U.S. has a new tax law: Do you know which is better for you -- a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) account, or a traditional IRA or traditional 401(k) account? As with many tax issues, there's no pat answer that applies to everybody. Rather, the answer falls into the it depends category."}
{"original": "That's because many rules and nuances for either type of account might apply to your situation, and one prime consideration is the new marginal tax rates that will apply starting in 2018."}
{"original": "To determine which type of IRA or 401(k) might work best for your situation, let's first review the key differences between the two types of accounts."}
{"original": "A brief review of the rules"}
{"original": "With a traditional IRA or 401(k) account, you reduce your current taxable income by the amount of your contribution, and you aren't taxed on your investment earnings while your savings grow. Years later, when you withdraw money from your savings during retirement, the amount of your withdrawal is counted as taxable income."}
{"original": "With a Roth IRA or 401(k) account, it's the other way around: You don't get a tax deduction for the amount of your contribution, but you also won't have to pay income tax on your contribution when you withdraw the money after you retire. Like a traditional IRA or 401(k) account, your investment earnings aren't taxed while your money grows."}
{"original": "However, unlike a traditional IRA or 401(k) account, you'll pay no taxes on your investment earnings at all if you've had your Roth IRA or 401(k) account for at least five years and withdraw your investment earnings after attaining age 59-1/2 (note that certain exceptions apply)."}
{"original": "Because of these key differences, one of the most important factors to consider when comparing the two types of IRAs and 401(k) accounts is whether you expect your current marginal income tax rate to be higher or lower than the marginal income tax rate that will apply after you retire and make withdrawals. The common argument for using a traditional IRA or 401(k) account is based on the assumption that you'll be in a lower tax bracket when you retire."}
{"original": "Note that if your current and future marginal tax brackets are equal, there's no difference mathematically between the two types of accounts in the amount of aftertax income you'll receive in retirement. In that case, the tax considerations shouldn't be a deciding factor for you."}
{"original": "The table below shows the new marginal tax rates in 2018 for single workers or married couples filing jointly."}
{"original": "Don't forget that the taxable income amounts are determined by deducting the standard deduction amounts, which have increased under the new law as follows:"}
{"original": "If you're age 65 or older, blind, or disabled, you can add $2,600 to your standard deduction if you're married and both spouses are over age 65, and $1,600 if you're single."}
{"original": "So how do you know if you'll be in a lower tax bracket when you retire compared to when you were working? It depends significantly on your taxable income before and after retirement."}
{"original": "One thing to keep in mind is that depending on the amount of your income from all sources, part or all of your Social Security income will be excluded from your taxable income. For the highest earners, at least 15 percent of your Social Security benefits will be excluded. As a result, many people will experience a significant drop in their taxable income in retirement, particularly if they have no significant pension from their employers and if their retirement savings are modest (which describes millions of older workers)."}
{"original": "Let's look at a few examples to see how the new tax rates might influence your decision to use Roth or traditional contributions."}
{"original": "Suppose you're working and currently paying taxes at the 12 percent marginal rate. This applies to single workers with taxable income between $9,526 and $38,700 ($18,551 to $75,300 for married filing jointly). The top ends of these ranges translate to gross incomes of $50,700 or $99,300, respectively, when you add the standard deduction for workers under age 65 to the taxable income amounts. In this situation, there's a good chance you'll be paying taxes at a 10 percent rate in retirement, not much of a drop from when you were working. As a result, there's not much advantage to using a traditional IRA because your marginal tax rate wouldn't drop very much."}
{"original": "Suppose you're working and currently paying taxes at the 22 percent marginal rate. This applies to single workers with taxable income between $38,701 and $82,500 ($75,301 to $151,900 for married filing jointly). In this situation, there's a good chance you'll be paying taxes at a 12 percent rate in retirement or lower, resulting in at least a 10 percent drop compared to when you were working. In this case, it would be advantageous to use a traditional IRA."}
{"original": "Suppose you're working and paying taxes at the 24 percent marginal rate. This applies to single workers under age 65 with taxable income between $82,501 and $157,500 ($151,901 to $234,350 for married filing jointly). In this case, if you experience a modest reduction in income when you're retired, you might be paying taxes at a 22 percent marginal rate, not much of a drop and not much of an incentive to use a traditional IRA. On the other hand, if you experience a significant drop in income in retirement, you might be paying taxes at a 12 percent or even 10 percent rate. In this case, it would be advantageous to contribute to a traditional IRA."}
{"original": "The logic that applies to workers in the 22 percent and 24 percent marginal tax brackets might also apply to workers currently paying taxes at the 32 percent and 35 percent brackets."}
{"original": "Roth IRAs aren't subject to the required minimum distribution (RMD) at age 70-1/2. Thus, if there isn't much of a tax savings for a traditional IRA or 401(k), you might consider using a Roth IRA or 401(k), which will give you more flexibility when you reach age 70-1/2. Note that Roth 401(k) accounts are subject to the RMD, but not if you roll your Roth 401(k) account to a Roth IRA."}
{"original": "In spite of all these considerations, some people might think the new tax rates are as low as they'll get and that they could increase under a future Congress. This could happen if the federal deficit increases rapidly or if Congress allows the new tax rates to expire after 2025, as the law now stipulates. This belief would make a good argument for contributing now to a Roth IRA or 401(k) account."}
{"original": "If you're still confused or don't know what your marginal income tax rates will be when you retire, consider a form of tax diversification: Split your contributions between the two types of IRAs or 401(k) accounts."}
{"original": "Whatever you do, don't let these rules deter you from making any contribution to an IRA or 401(k) account. No matter what choice you make, you'll be better off saving money for your future than spending it all today."}
{"original": "For many Americans, restaurants are destinations for the most special of occasions: birthdays, promotions, anniversaries and engagements. Amid a growing spread of coronavirus infections, they're also poised to take one of the biggest economic hits."}
{"original": "This week a handful of states — including California, Florida and New York — ordered restaurants close their doors and offer takeout and delivery options only. On Wednesday, Union Square Hospitality Group, Danny Meyers' restaurant empire, announced it was laying off roughly 2,000 people, about 80% of its staff."}
{"original": "CBS News spoke to restaurant owners and servers at some of New York's best restaurants about what guests can do to help their favorite establishments."}
{"original": "First and foremost it would be great if people would call their members of Congress! said Jordan Salcito, the director of wine special projects at Momofuku, David Chang's popular restaurant group. She's also the founder of Ramona, a canned spritz beverage."}
{"original": "Demanding that the restaurant industry is part of the upcoming federal stimulus package is the best way that people can make sure the establishments they love can weather the economic storm, Salcito said to CBS News."}
{"original": "Salcito also recommended restaurant-goers ask their representatives to suspend wine tariffs."}
{"original": "Wine purveyors are reeling from restaurant closures, especially the smallest importers who sell primarily or exclusively to restaurants, Salcito said."}
{"original": "After widespread closures were announced, some restaurants sent back wine that they no longer needed, while others are storing it without paying, Salcito said. To keep wine importers afloat, Salcito recommended doing away with the typical 25% tax on wine imports, a cost that would cripple small importers."}
{"original": "Simon Kim, the owner of Michelin-starred Cote, a Korean steakhouse in Manhattan, offered a script for people to use when calling their representatives"}
{"original": "The world of restaurants is a unique one and in order to keep a lot of these mom and pop places around we need help, Kim said to CBS News on Wednesday. Hundreds of thousands of people rely on the restaurant world for income and are facing bankruptcy, homelessness, and will be unable to feed their families."}
{"original": "Order takeout … and don't forget wine"}
{"original": "On Monday, Kim temporarily closed Cote, something he called an incredibly difficult situation, but a move that would allow his hourly employees to collect government-funded unemployment benefits."}
{"original": "To continue bringing in some revenue, Kim started offering something his restaurant had never done before: delivery."}
{"original": "Many restaurants have gone that route, offering gourmet meals to otherwise social-distancing food lovers."}
{"original": "If your local restaurant is going delivery or take-out, as best you can, try to spend money in those restaurants, said Kevin Garry, the owner and managing partner of Epicurean, the restaurant group behind L'Artusi, a buzzy Italian restaurant in downtown Manhattan."}
{"original": "Like Cote, L'Artusi had never done delivery before this week, and when we turned it on, we had an amazingly positive response, Garry said. The business has been so good that L'Artusi has been able to offer their kitchen employees close to a full schedule, said Garry."}
{"original": "In some states, guests can even include a bottle of wine in their takeout orders. In New York, the State Liquor Authority temporarily changed its rules earlier this week to allow restaurants to offer wine and liquor as part of their delivery options."}
{"original": "At Cote, Victoria James, the restaurant's beverage director, has created wine packages with handwritten tasting notes, an opportunity she called a new bonus in a dark time."}
{"original": "Tip as if you were eating out"}
{"original": "Sydney Werry, a Sommelier at Aldo Sohm. Sydney Werry"}
{"original": "Even though you may not be actually going out, it's important to tip as if you were. For the skeleton staffs that restaurants are maintaining, tips are a huge source of revenue."}
{"original": "If you're ordering take out, still tipping 20% is important because that helps the actual employees as well, not just the restaurant itself, said Sydney Werry, a Sommelier at Aldo Sohm, a wine bar in midtown Manhattan."}
{"original": "With the exception of delivery, L'Artusi closed its doors to guests this Monday, laying off all 70 of its front of house staff so they'd be eligible for unemployment benefits. But Garry said many of his former staffers haven't been able to apply because the website keeps crashing."}
{"original": "Once I heard that we got the idea to start a GoFundMe page, Garry said. That seemed like the best way knowing that restaurants have a lot of loyal followers, a lot of regulars. People that celebrate their birthdays and anniversaries with us."}
{"original": "The fund was a success. In less than 24 hours, Garry's fundraiser has collected nearly $20,000 for both L'Artusi and his other restaurant, Anfora. Garry said all of the funds will go directly to his staff."}
{"original": "Many other restaurants have done the same, offering virtual tip jars and other ways for guests to offer restaurant workers support."}
{"original": "Another option is donating to the Restaurant Workers' Community Foundation, a new nonprofit created by restaurant workers. The group is collecting donations to direct money to organizations leading on-the-ground efforts in the restaurant community as well as establish a relief fund for individual workers facing economic hardships or health crises as a direct result of COVID-19. The group will also be offering businesses zero-interest loans to help them reopen once coronavirus has passed."}
{"original": "Reopening a restaurant once it has closed is an expense that Garry estimated could cost tens of thousands of dollars between restocking the kitchen and restaffing."}
{"original": "It's not as simple as unlocking the doors and turning the lights back on, Garry said."}
{"original": "That's why buying gift cards is something that can help restaurants survive. Those funds also provide immediate relief for the staff at restaurants who've seen their revenue diminish overnight."}
{"original": "I cannot stress enough how helpful this is, and how we are so grateful for this support, Kim from Cote said."}
{"original": "When this is over, come back"}
{"original": "Even with such a grim picture ahead, Garry said he's hopeful that business will rebound once they're able to welcome guests again."}
{"original": "I'm a firm believer that the New York City restaurant community is going to come back out and pack places, spend a little more money on wine and tip well, Garry said. That's my hope."}
{"original": "Soon after COVID-19 was first identified in the United States, disparities in testing, cases, hospitalizations and mortality began to emerge. Inequities by race, ethnicity, geography, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and other factors were quickly evident."}
{"original": "So how does the U.S. ensure that more Americans have adequate access to a vaccine?"}
{"original": "Here's our Q&A with Dr. Richard Besser, former acting CDC director and president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation."}
{"original": "COVID-19 has only highlighted existing inequities in this country — lack of hospitals, food deserts, to name a few. With states in dire straits, what needs to happen on the federal level to address those needs?"}
{"original": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every community in the United States, but some populations have been hit significantly harder than others. Black, Latino, and Native Americans have all experienced rates of infection, hospitalization, and death that far exceed their proportion of the population. Just this week, new life expectancy numbers for the United States brought these disparities into stark focus: life expectancy during the first six months of 2020 declined by 2.7 years for Black Americans, 1.9 years for Latinos, and 0.8 years for Whites."}
{"original": "A key factor driving these disparities is a difference in the risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19: a greater proportion of people of color are frontline workers who must interact with others on a daily basis in risky settings in order to put food on the table and to pay the rent. But the reasons go deeper than that. People and communities of color entered this pandemic at a significant disadvantage due to historic and ongoing racism and discrimination. A greater proportion of people of color work in jobs that pay lower wages, lack sick leave and family medical leave and lack health insurance. In the United States, skin color still has an outsized impact on whether people have the resources to keep themselves, their families, and their communities safe from COVID-19."}
{"original": "Many of the decisions regarding the response to COVID-19 are ultimately made at the state or local level: whether to mandate masks or open schools; the size of gatherings that are allowed or the kinds of services that restaurants and bars can provide; and which groups should get priority for receiving vaccinations. But the federal government has a crucial role to play in making recommendations, providing additional resources, and creating incentives for states to align with the federal strategy. These tools can help to ensure that issues of equity are a central component of the response."}
{"original": "In addition, if we truly believe that everyone in America should have the ability to be protected as much as possible from COVID-19, Congress must come through with additional economic relief for those with low incomes and who have been hit hardest. Economic support is a public health intervention; it gives people the ability to follow public health guidance. This relief must include direct cash payments, extensions of supplemental federal unemployment insurance, increased rental support and extensions of eviction and foreclosure moratoriums, additional nutrition assistance, school funding, and paid sick and family leave for more workers. Without this kind of support, those who are at greatest risk of exposure will continue to be hit the hardest."}
{"original": "How does using age as a deciding factor for who gets access to a vaccine hurt communities of color or more vulnerable communities in this country?"}
{"original": "Vaccine recommendations from the CDC are developed by an independent advisory committee called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). It is composed of some of the world's leading scientists, infectious disease experts, and medical organizations. The group makes recommendations for all vaccines that are used in the United States."}
{"original": "When the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were approved for emergency use in late 2020, ACIP laid out a series of recommendations for who should be vaccinated first. These recommendations took into consideration the risk of exposure as well as the risk of having severe disease or dying if one got infected. The phased approach was also meant to ensure an equitable approach to vaccination. ACIP recommended that frontline healthcare workers and people who live in long-term nursing care facilities should be up first, followed by those over age 75 and essential workers. While the ACIP recommendations don't carry the force of law, typically states adhere to them."}
{"original": "Unfortunately, soon after vaccination started, states largely abandoned the ACIP guidance, with many moving to a rollout where anyone age 65 or above could get vaccinated after healthcare workers and long-term care residents and workers. As a result, few states have put an intentional focus on vaccinating all essential workers, a group with high risk of exposure and which accounts for a high proportion of cases among people of color."}
{"original": "While it is critically important to get people vaccinated quickly, our obsession with overall numbers, weekly averages, and speed makes it harder to ensure vaccines get to those at greatest risk. While rates of vaccination have risen steadily overall, we're not getting vaccines into enough of the right arms; data show that people of color are once again being left behind. We need to redouble our efforts to ensure that people most at risk of exposure to Covid-19 are prioritized for vaccination."}
{"original": "Technological barriers have also emerged as an issue with vaccine access. With the administration pushing vaccines to pharmacies, how can these companies better reach vulnerable communities to get them vaccinated?"}
{"original": "I am encouraged by the administration's recent move to ship vaccines directly to local pharmacies and federally qualified community health centers. While this must be coordinated with state entities, this approach will bring vaccines into the community to locations where people regularly receive vaccinations. This helps build trust."}
{"original": "Our goal must be to make it as easy as possible for people to get vaccinated. We can achieve that goal by doing many things: ensuring there are phone bank systems to allow those without computer access to register for appointments; providing free transportation so that people without cars can get to vaccination sites; and running vaccination clinics around the clock and on weekends so that people who work during the day can still get vaccinated. When states turn vaccine registration into a first-come, first-served process, as we are now seeing in many parts of the country, those with wealth, connections, and time to navigate a complex process have an inherent advantage. That's unfair and unwise. It is heartening to see efforts to reduce these inequities."}
{"original": "You're leading a discussion on the COVID vaccine on the federal level — what is top of your mind heading into the forum? What needs to happen right now to ensure more Americans, particularly those most in need, get an injection in the next few months?"}
{"original": "The National Forum on Covid-19 Vaccine, organized by the CDC, is bringing together government officials and those in the private and nonprofit sectors to support the implementation of a safe, effective, and equitable vaccine distribution process. I'll be moderating a panel that includes key federal leaders who are providing support and leadership for these efforts. We will talk about what is being done to speed up distribution and, just as importantly, what is being done to build trust and to ensure that vaccines are getting to those at greatest risk. Ensuring that we follow the public health roadmap for vaccine distribution and administration is crucial to saving as many lives as possible and getting us to the end of this pandemic as quickly as we can."}
{"original": "Over the next few weeks and months, it is absolutely critical that we make equity, accessibility, and coordination the hallmarks of our vaccine distribution effort. That should include:"}
{"original": "The federal government ensuring that all states have accurate and timely estimates of vaccine allocations, as well as providing states with additional resources to report vaccine data by race, ethnicity, occupation, and neighborhood."}
{"original": "States and communities making it easier for people who need vaccines the most to obtain them, especially those who cannot take time off of work to get vaccinated, those who do not have access to the Internet to make appointments online, and those who live in neighborhoods that lack healthcare providers."}
{"original": "Local health departments partnering with trusted community voices — faith leaders, community organizers, local medical practitioners — who can address people's concerns about getting vaccinated and help inspire more trust and confidence in the process."}
{"original": "People with low risk of exposure waiting their turn to be vaccinated until the United States has enough supply to make vaccines available to anyone who wants them."}
{"original": "You're a pediatrician and a parent. Do you feel comfortable with CDC's revised guidance to get back to in-person learning, even as COVID mutations present a clear risk of closure and infection, particularly in red zone areas of this country?"}
{"original": "The updated guidance from CDC is good news for our children, families, teachers and staff. It lays out a clear roadmap for getting children back into the classroom safely. If we commit to following this guidance, and Congress comes through with additional funding that is so desperately needed, we can reopen schools safely in all communities without compromising safety and the important battle to control community transmission."}
{"original": "In the early days of the pandemic, we closed schools out of an abundance of caution based on what science tells us about how flu is spread. The urgency of that moment called on such extreme measures to prevent community spread. Guided by science and data, we've learned since then that, when provided with the requisite resources, schools can bring both children and adults back into the buildings safely. In fact, rates of transmission in schools tend to be considerably lower than the communities in which they're located."}
{"original": "Substantial federal funding is urgently needed so that districts can hire staff for screening and testing, to upgrade ventilation systems, to properly clean buildings, to decompress classrooms to maintain social distancing, to secure enough personal protective equipment, and to implement testing where indicated. Teachers and school staff should also be included as essential frontline workers for the purposes of receiving COVID-19 vaccines, though many studies now show that this does not need to be a prerequisite for in-person learning. If we follow this roadmap, we can finally welcome millions of children back into the classroom where they belong."}
{"original": "Economists project the impacts of COVID learning loss on children could last decades, particularly for those kids in more vulnerable communities. What do we need to be doing, besides reopening K-8, to make sure these kids aren't worse for wear when they enter the workforce? How can we avoid a similar outcome with a future health crisis?"}
{"original": "Just as the pandemic is having a disparate impact on Black, Latino, and Native Americans, the failure to invest in our schools equitably has led to a disproportionate toll on the education attainment of Black and Brown children and of children in lower income neighborhoods. This neglect has been made even clearer during this pandemic, but our failure to invest in these schools predates COVID-19. More children in lower income communities are denied access to in-person learning, children with disabilities are denied the services they need to thrive, and working women are disproportionately losing their jobs by staying home to provide child care for children who are not in school. There will be long-term health and economic ramifications for these failures, including widening achievement gaps and potentially lower future earnings for these students."}
{"original": "The United States needs to fundamentally alter its approach to school funding. A system that relies primarily on property tax revenue is fundamentally inequitable and will keep current disparities permanently entrenched. Our approach needs to recognize the intrinsic connection between a good education and good health. More education is linked to higher-paying jobs, reduced risk of chronic diseases, and longer lifespans. The benefits go beyond academics and social connections. For millions of students, especially Black and Brown children, schools provide lifelines — healthy meals, a library, an internet connection — that might not be available for them anywhere else. Investing in these schools and these children should be priority No. 1."}
{"original": "Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens asked Congress on Tuesday to clear the path for his plan to boost use of wind and natural gas for U.S. energy needs."}
{"original": "Pickens has been on a $58 million publicity tour to promote his plan to erect wind turbines in the Midwest to generate electricity, replacing the 22 percent of U.S. power produced from natural gas. The freed up natural gas then could be used for transportation."}
{"original": "Testifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, Pickens said the government should begin building transmission lines for wind-generated power or provide the right of way on private land and extend tax credits so the private sector can build the lines."}
{"original": "If the government wanted to build a grid, I mean, do it, he said. But if they don't want to do it, I think the money is there to do it private, and so it's kind of like either do it or get out of the way, but give us the corridors to put it in and it'll be done. You could do this on a very, very fast track if you wanted."}
{"original": "Pickens suggested that Congress follow the lead of former President Eisenhower, who declared an emergency to build the interstate highway system in the 1950s and 1960s."}
{"original": "He warned that oil could cost $300 a barrel in 10 years as supplies drop, if the nation continues to drift on energy policy."}
{"original": "Pickens has leased hundreds of thousands of acres for a giant wind farm in West Texas, where he plans to erect 2,700 turbines and produce energy for urban areas such as Dallas and Fort Worth. He has run into some opposition from West Texas landowners who are unhappy with his efforts to obtain rights of way to build the wind farm and a pipeline for a separate water project."}
{"original": "Specifically, Pickens asked Congress to extend a 2005 law intended to speed up the creation of energy corridors, and to give him control over any transmission lines he builds for wind-generated power. All electric transmission lines are now regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission."}
{"original": "Pickens also called for a 10-year extension of a tax credit for energy producers. He estimated it would cost taxpayers $15 billion a year in production tax credits for 200,000 megawatts of wind power."}
{"original": "When you look at $700 billion dollars going out of country every year for purchase of oil, $15 billion is somewhat insignificant, he said."}
{"original": "Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., called Pickens' plan bold and said he hoped Pickens' testimony would infect people in a position in Washington to do something about it."}
{"original": "But the oilman's plan raised questions with Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, who asked if it would hurt the chemical industry, which relies on natural gas as raw material. He said the industry probably won't like seeing natural gas costs increase."}
{"original": "Pickens estimated it would cost about $500 billion to increase wind energy production from the 4,000 megawatts to be generated at his Texas wind farm to 200,000 megawatts, the amount needed to power 20 percent of U.S. energy needs. Transmission lines and the tax credit would add another $15 billion."}
{"original": "At that level, he said, You're approaching about one year's supply of oil that you're buying. But don't get the idea that replaces that oil, it doesn't. It will only replace 38 percent."}
{"original": "In addition to the hearing, Pickens also met privately Tuesday with Democratic and Republican members of Congress as well as Texas senators."}
{"original": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren plans to propose a wealth tax on Americans with more than $50 million in an effort to combat inequality in the United States, according to an academic adviser behind the tax. If implemented, the tax would raise $2.75 trillion over a 10-year period, according to a study he conducted."}
{"original": "The proposal would levy a 2 percent tax on individuals with more than $50 million in assets and 3 percent on those with more than $1 billion, according to Emmanuel Saez, an economist from the University of California Berkeley who did research on progressive wealth taxation for Warren. The intent of the tax is to narrow the gap between wealth growth at the top and wealth growth for the middle class, Saez wrote in an email Thursday to CBS News."}
{"original": "Democracies become oligarchies when wealth is too concentrated, Saez wrote. A progressive wealth tax is the most direct policy tool to curb the growing concentration of wealth in the United States."}
{"original": "But economists say that taxing assets as opposed to income would be an administrative challenge. High net-worth individuals tend to have their wealth tied up in difficult to value assets, like real estate and private companies, which would make it hard for government officials to determine what individuals owed, said Nicole Kaeding, the Director of Federal and Special Projects at the Tax Foundation, in a telephone interview with CBS News. On top of that, the types of people who would be subject to the tax would be the ones best positioned to avoid it, Kaeding said."}
{"original": "Individuals with that kind of net worth obviously would have the ability and the capacity to hire high-prices attorneys and accountants to help avoid paying a tax like that, Kaeding said."}
{"original": "Only four industrialized countries — France, Norway, Spain and Switzerland — currently levy a wealth tax on their citizens, according to Kaeding."}
{"original": "Saloni Sharma, a spokesperson for Warren, did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment."}
{"original": "Approximately 75,000 households, less than 0.1 percent of the country's population, would be impacted by the potential tax, according to the study by Saez and Gabriel Zucman, another Berkeley economist, that the pair sent to Warren on Jan. 18."}
{"original": "Combining progressive wealth taxation with policies to rebuild middle class wealth is exactly what the United States needs to ensure vibrant and equitable growth for the future, Saez wrote in an email."}

{"original": "Washington — The Senate on Monday failed for the second time to clear a key procedural hurdle to advance a massive legislative package designed to provide economic relief to American workers and industries battered by the coronavirus outbreak, as tensions boiled over among senators who vocalized their frustrations with one another over negotiations."}
{"original": "Senate Democrats blocked the yet-to-be-finalized stimulus package from advancing in a vote of 49 to 46, denying Republicans the 60 votes needed to move forward. Monday's action was yet another setback for senators following a failed party-line procedural vote Sunday."}
{"original": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned it could be several days before the Senate can proceed to a vote on the deal and called the failed procedural vote mindless obstruction."}
{"original": "The failure followed tense and heated exchanges on the Senate floor, with Republicans accusing Democrats of exploiting a crisis while time runs out to pull the economy back from the brink."}
{"original": "The country is burning, and your side wants to play political games, Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota said. It's time to get this done. The American people expect us to act."}
{"original": "McConnell urged the Senate to act with urgency as more states place stringent limitations on residents to limit the spread of the coronavirus, including by ordering businesses deemed nonessential to close."}
{"original": "This is not a juicy political opportunity. This is a national emergency, McConnell said during remarks on the Senate floor before the votes."}
{"original": "McConnell accused Democrats of making 11th-hour demands that derailed progress on the package, including tax credits for solar energy and wind energy and new emissions standards for airlines, which are set to benefit from the stimulus package."}
{"original": "Are you kidding me? the Kentucky Republican said, adding that Democrats decided their requests are more important than Americans' paychecks and the personal safety of doctors and nurses."}
{"original": "McConnell continued to place blame on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who joined discussions over the legislative package Sunday morning."}
{"original": "The speaker of the House flew back from San Francisco, and suddenly, the Senate's serious bipartisan process turned into this left-wing episode of 'Supermarket Sweep,' unrelated issues left and right, he said."}
{"original": "McConnell urged Democrats to unify with their Republican colleagues, warning the country doesn't have time for these political games."}
{"original": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, taking to the Senate floor after McConnell, cast a grim outlook for the second procedural vote, calling it irrelevant and saying negotiations are ongoing, just steps from the Senate chamber."}
{"original": "Democrats will not stop working with our Republican counterparts until we get the job done, he said."}
{"original": "GOP senators descended to the floor of the chamber to express their outrage over the hold-up and accused Democrats of delaying aid as families continue to hurt."}
{"original": "Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, angrily denounced her Democratic colleagues for not agreeing to move forward."}
{"original": "I cannot believe that the answer from our friends from the other side of the aisle is delay, delay, delay. No sense of urgency, she said. We don't have another day. We don't have another hour. We don't have another minute to delay acting."}

{"original": "Discussions on the nearly $2 trillion stimulus package — likely to be the largest in history — continued into Sunday night and the morning, and Schumer told reporters the goal was to craft a bipartisan compromise on Monday.

{"original": "It's unclear when a vote on final passage of the measure could take place, but McConnell had been pushing for the Senate to approve the stimulus package as early as Monday. The first two of three procedural votes set for Monday required 50 votes to pass, and the third vote required 60."}
{"original": "Further complicating negotiations was the announcement from Pelosi that she plans to introduce her own stimulus package Monday afternoon."}
{"original": "The Senate Republicans' bill, as presented, put corporations first, not workers and families, Pelosi said in a statement. Today, House Democrats will unveil a bill that takes responsibility for the health, wages and well-being of America's workers: the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act."}
{"original": "In the run-up to Sunday's failed procedural vote, Republican senators had expressed optimism about a bipartisan compromise, which includes cash payments of $1,200 to American workers making up to $75,000; $350 billion in loans and grants for small businesses; and $50 billion in loans for airlines."}
{"original": "But Democrats said the package lacked adequate funding for hospitals and health care workers and gave too much money to large corporations without oversight. All 47 Senate Democrats voted together in blocking the measure from advancing Sunday."}
{"original": "The failed vote incensed Senate Republicans, some of which took to the Senate floor to express their frustration."}
{"original": "Immediately following the vote, a visibly angry McConnell blamed Pelosi for upending progress on the deal and urged Democrats to step up to help American workers and businesses."}
{"original": "We're fiddling here, fiddling with the emotions of the American people, fiddling with the markets, fiddling with our healthcare, the American people expect us to act tomorrow, McConnell said Sunday. And I want everybody to fully understand if we aren't able to act tomorrow, it'll be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address this problem."}
{"original": "Adding to the uncertainty on Capitol Hill was the revelation that Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky had tested positive for the coronavirus and would be self-quarantining."}
{"original": "The announcement led two other GOP senators, Mike Lee and Mitt Romney, both of Utah, to self-quarantine after coming into contact with Paul. Senators Cory Gardner and Rick Scott of Florida were already self-quarantining after possible exposure to the virus, meaning five senators in total had to miss Sunday's vote."}
{"original": "The stimulus package under discussion in the Senate is the third part of a multi-pronged legislative response to the coronavirus. Earlier this month, Congress passed a $8.3 billion emergency supplemental package, and last week, President Trump signed into law a coronavirus relief bill that provides free testing and paid leave for certain workers."}
{"original": "Massive blackouts in the Southwest this week have thrown renewable energy into the spotlight. Some conservatives have tried to pin Texas' electricity grid failures on wind power, while industry analysts and environmentalists point to problems with natural gas and coal plants during the snowstorm as an argument for more, not less, renewable power."}
{"original": "Amid the finger-pointing, the market is offering its own answers. The U.S. added a record amount of wind and solar energy last year even as the coronavirus was crippling the economy, according to figures released Thursday by BloombergNEF and Business Council for Sustainable Energy."}
{"original": "Installations of wind and solar power soared 61% over the previous year, with 33.6 gigawatts added to the grid in 2020. That's enough energy to power roughly 11 million homes for a year and nearly 50% higher than the previous record, set in 2016."}
{"original": "Renewables had a pretty amazing year, Ethan Zindler, head of Americas at BloombergNEF, told reporters. The sheer size of the accomplishment is pretty remarkable."}
{"original": "The surge in clean power, coupled with a historic, if temporary, emissions drop, momentarily put the U.S. on track to achieving the goals it committed to under the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change, Zindler noted."}
{"original": "At the same time, developers continue to build natural-gas facilities, though at a much lower rate. Regulatory filings show that 38 gigawatts' worth of natural-gas plants, or slightly more than the total amount of renewable power added in 2020, could come online in the next five years."}
{"original": "However, considering historical trends, It is likely that many will be canceled and remove their filings before turning on, BloombergNEF noted."}
{"original": "Rushing to lock in low prices"}
{"original": "Part of the renewables surge is explained by the long build cycles for energy projects. Record numbers of developers started clean-power projects in 2019, rushing to take advantage of a solar tax credit that was set to expire in 2020. Congress has since extended the credit until 2022."}
{"original": "Another key factor is falling prices for large-scale renewable energy plants, which are now the cheapest source of new power even without subsidies, according to a Lazard analysis last year. Businesses are snapping up this cheap power, with corporate power-purchase agreements also hitting a record in 2020."}
{"original": "The interest in clean power is broad, with about two-thirds of the companies that signed up for solar power last year consisting of small businesses, according to Abigail Hopper, CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association."}
{"original": "This normalization is really important, she said. Customers want it, shareholders want it, employees want it. Those factors will continue to drive this marketplace."}
{"original": "Renewables accounted for 20% of U.S. electricity last year, with nuclear adding another 20%, according to BloombergNEF. Coal dropped to 19% of electricity production. Natural gas made up the largest share, at 41%."}
{"original": "While natural gas pollutes less than coal, it is a fossil fuel that drives global warming and contributes to other pollution. The surge in natural gas in the past decade creates a challenge for the Biden administration's stated goal to draw electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2035, said BloombergNEF's Zindler."}
{"original": "Clearly, gas has played a critical role in taking coal offline and decarbonizing up to this point, he said. But if you look at the next 10 to 15 years, there's questions about the role gas can continue to play in the system."}
{"original": "Despite the surge in the nation's clean-energy capacity, the industry has experienced significant layoffs. The sector shed about 450,000 jobs last year, largely in the areas of energy-efficiency and grid and storage. It was the first instance of job loss on record for the renewable energy sector."}
{"original": "After the economy largely shut down in 2020, large energy projects, utility companies and some manufacturing facilities were quickly deemed essential, and many re-hired their workers. But energy-efficiency projects, which might include weatherizing a building or upgrading its heating and cooling system, were slower to come back."}
{"original": "The hardest-hit sectors were the residential businesses and particularly energy efficiency. They still bear the brunt, said Lisa Jacobson, president of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy."}
{"original": "A coalition of clean-energy groups is calling for the Biden administration to prioritize the clean-energy sector in its economic recovery plans."}
{"original": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz left his company seven months ago which led many to wonder what the socially conscious executive was planning. To Schultz, Starbucks was never just a coffee shop. He saw his stores as meeting halls where customers came to chew over the great issues of the day. His activism is rooted in a rags-to-riches life. And tonight, Schultz reveals traumas he has never discussed publicly. At the age of 65, he is preparing for the greatest challenge of his life. Many believe that Schultz would run for president as a Democrat. His announcement tonight may come as a surprise."}
{"original": "I wanna see the American people win. I wanna see America win."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: I am seriously thinking of running for president. I will run as a centrist independent, outside of the two-party system we're living at a most-fragile time not only the fact that this president is not qualified to be the president, but the fact that both parties are consistently not doing what's necessary on behalf of the American people and are engaged, every single day, in revenge politics."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Why run as an Independent? Your views have always aligned with the Democratic Party."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: That's true. I've, you know, I've been a lifelong Democrat. I look at both parties-- we see extremes on both sides well, we are sitting, today, with approximately $21.5 trillion of debt, which is a reckless example, not only of Republicans, but of Democrats, as well, as a reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Do you worry that you're going to siphon votes away from the Democrats and, thereby, ensure that President Trump has a second term?"}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: I wanna see the American people win. I wanna see America win. I don't care if you're a Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, Republican. Bring me your ideas. And I will be an independent person, who will embrace those ideas. Because I am not, in any way, in bed with a party."}
{"original": "Correspondent Scott Pelley speaks with Howard Schultz"}
{"original": "We met with Howard Schultz this month in his adopted hometown of Seattle. It was here, in 1981 that he arrived as a stranger in the Pike Place Market to visit the original Starbucks, just a tiny store that sold coffee beans."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: You were selling coffee makers, living in New York, and this was one of your customers. Why did you come out here to visit them?"}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: The thing is, I had never heard of Starbucks. And they were buying a ton of these products. And I just thought I gotta come to Seattle and see who this company was."}
{"original": "How he created the phenomenon we know is a story longer than the line at Starbucks. Suffice to say Schultz got a job behind this counter. He installed an espresso machine. And in 1987, with borrowed money, he bought the shop."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: How many stores are there today?"}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: Almost 30,000 in 77 countries."}
{"original": "A sweet success with a few bitter notes. Starbucks almost went broke in the 2007 financial crisis."}
{"original": "And last year, a store manager set off a furor when she called police on African-American men who were just hanging out at a table. Schultz closed all the U.S. stores for hours of racial bias training. Race had been an issue even before, when Schultz asked employees to talk to customers about racial justice."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: We had a moral obligation as a company to discuss this."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: And, then, you were excoriated for having a coffee shop tell people what it thinks about humanity."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: The execution was flawed. And who owns that execution? I do because I was the one who was pushing us to not play it safe."}
{"original": "But from the beginning his 350,000 employees caught a break with Schultz's social agenda."}
{"original": "They enjoy health insurance, tuition aid and stock."}
{"original": "Schultz likes to say he created the company his impoverished parents never had the chance to work for."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: When I read statistics that says that over 40 percent of the American people don't have $400 in the bank and only a crisis away from bankruptcy, or that five and a half million kids in America, many of whom are African American and Latino, are not in school and not in work and don't have a chance, and one out of six people in America are food insecure, this is what I think about."}
{"original": "Those grim numbers describe his own childhood."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: This place has never left me. I think it has defined my character, my vulnerability"}
{"original": "Schultz took us back in time to his boyhood home,"}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: And this is the way up to the seventh floor."}
{"original": "A Brooklyn, New York, public housing project. His family was already poor when his father was injured on the job. With no insurance, they were destitute. And bitterness led to violence."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Your father beat you-- with his fists."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: There were moments where there was physical abuse, yes."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: He beat you up, when you were taking a shower. And you ended up crumpled on the floor of the shower, watching your blood go down the drain. At that moment, you thought what?"}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: I was 15. I was disrespectful to my mother. He came home and-- beat me to a pulp. I couldn't go to school for a couple days. I was angry, upset."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Did you hate him?"}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: I'm sure there were moments when I did. And then there were glorious moments of being in the right-field bleachers at Yankee Stadium with him. There is a level of hate that does emerge. But it didn't stay."}
{"original": "His journey is mapped in a new autobiography titled From the Ground Up."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: If your father was the darkness, your mother was the light."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: She was. And my self-esteem came from my mother. And I could say that if-- if my mother was here, if my mother-- for her, it would just be the greatest moment of her life, to think. Because one of the things that is, has been so hard for me is that both my parents didn't-- did not see my success at Starbucks. maybe I'm here because of her."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Well, let me see if I can find out where you are on some of the issues that are pressing in the country. Immigration."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: The country first and foremost is based on humanity, fairness, goodness, we have been for 200-plus years a country of immigrants. And for the 11 million people here unauthorized, there should be a fair and equitable way for them to get in line, pay the taxes, pay a fee, and become citizens of the United States."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: Tremendous mistake, again, by President Trump, to leave the Paris Climate Accord."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Every American deserves the right to have access to quality health care. But what the Democrats are proposing is something that is as false as the wall. And that is free health care for all, which the country cannot afford."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: The 2018 tax cut."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: I would not have given a free ride to business, from 35 percent or 37 percent to 21 percent. It would've been more modest. But I would've significantly addressed the people who need tax relief the most, which is the people I talked about earlier, who don't have $400 in the bank."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Many people are going to ask what does the coffee entrepreneur know about being commander in chief?"}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: I have a long history of recognizing, I'm not the smartest person in the room, that in order to make great decisions about complex problems, I have to recruit and attract people who are smarter than me and more experienced, more skilled, and we've got to create an understanding that we need a creative debate in the room to make these kind of decisions."}
{"original": "His world view is shaped by his experience as a global CEO."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: Is it in our national interest to have a fight with Mexico, Canada, the EU, China, NATO? Is it in our interest? Give me a break. No, it's not in our interest. These are our friends. These are our allies. We are much better, as a country, being part of the world order."}
{"original": "Schultz formed his alliance with his wife Sheri when they were married more than 36 years ago. Today, they have a son and a daughter, two grandchildren and another on the way. Sheri schultz oversees the family's $200 million charity that links disadvantaged youth and veterans to jobs."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: This is a long, rocky road, running for president. Is this something you wanna do?"}
{"original": "Sheri Schultz: Well, it, it wasn't in my plan, my long-term life plan for sure."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Did he tell you or did he ask you?"}
{"original": "Sheri Schultz: No, he asked. He came to the family. We knew it was serious--"}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: I'm still-- I'm still asking."}
{"original": "Sheri Schultz: He's still asking and many family meetings."}
{"original": "He's still asking himself whether to run. But he has assembled a campaign team and he's done the homework."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Can you get on the ballot in all 50 states?"}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: If I decide to run for president, not only will I be on the ballot of every state, all 50 states, but we'll be on the ballot in every county, in every district, that we have done that work."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Would the stores be part of this? Is there going to be a Schultz 2020 button on every green apron across the country?"}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: Uh, no there would be a complete separation between me and the company."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: What we know is that no independent has ever come close to winning."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: What we know, factually, is that over 40 percent of the electorate is either a registered Independent or currently affiliates themselves as an Independent. Because the American people are exhausted. Their trust has been broken. And they are looking for a better choice."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: What effect do you think being Jewish would have on your campaign?"}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: I have great faith in the goodness and kindness of the American people. We elected an African-American president. I'm old enough to remember in 1960 when John F. Kennedy was running and there was an outcry of hate that no one Catholic should be president. I am Jewish, I have faith in God. I am not running as a Jew if I decide to run for president I'm running as an American who happens to be Jewish."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Your net worth is something close to $3.5 billion and Forbes magazine would tell you that that's more money than Donald Trump has. Are you willing to spend what it takes to win?"}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: Well, I'll say it this way we'll be fully resourced to do what's necessary."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Winning could cost $300 million, $500 million. Do those numbers change your mind?"}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Would you release your tax returns?"}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Well, Donald Trump said that."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: I will. We can do it today, if you want Scott."}
{"original": "Decades ago, housewares salesman Howard Schultz fell for the traditions of Seattle's Pike Place Market. Some traditions slimier than others. Now he's challenging tradition, asking whether Americans want to toss old politics into fresh hands."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: You know it's 'on' after this interview. President Trump is gonna be tweeting by about 8:00 Eastern Time."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz: You know, I'm –"}

{"original": "Recessions are like natural disasters: They're inevitable, but smart preparation may reduce the impact on you."}
{"original": "The U.S. economy has grown steadily since emerging from the Great Recession in June 2009, but expansions can't continue forever, and this one is already the second-longest on record. Only the expansion from March 1991 to March 2001 lasted longer."}
{"original": "Recessions occur when growth stops and the economy starts to shrink. They vary in severity and length, but often jobs disappear, incomes decline and lenders make it harder to qualify for credit."}
{"original": "Knowing what may be coming can help you fortify your finances to withstand a possible slowdown. Here are some steps to consider."}
{"original": "The classic 50/30/20 budget suggests limiting your must-have expenses to 50 percent of your after-tax income, with 30 percent allocated to wants and 20 percent to debt payment and savings. Must-haves include shelter, transportation, food, utilities, insurance and minimum loan payments."}
{"original": "Limiting essential expenses ensures you have room to pay off the past, save for the future and have a little fun. Capping them also helps during bad economic times, when you may need to sharply reduce your spending because of job loss or reduced hours."}
{"original": "Lenders often get pickier during recessions. They may freeze lines of credit, close credit card accounts and make new loans harder to get."}
{"original": "People with good credit scores tend to fare better when lenders get choosy. Lenders need to stay in business, after all, so when delinquencies and defaults rise they want to cultivate customers who are most likely to pay them back."}
{"original": "Because high scores suggest you'll pay as agreed, protecting your scores is essential. That means paying all your bills on time, using only a small amount of your credit limits, keeping old credit card accounts open and being selective about opening new accounts."}
{"original": "Ideally, everyone would have an emergency fund equal to at least three months' worth of expenses. But most people don't have nearly that much saved, and building up such a stash can take years."}
{"original": "In the meantime, it's smart to set up access to additional credit that you can tap if you lose your job or face other financial setbacks. If you own your home, you may be able to set up a home equity line of credit or replace your current line with one that has a higher limit. Having a few credit cards can help as well."}
{"original": "The key to the strategy is to keep these lines open and unused. (You'll need to make a few small charges to keep the credit cards active, but you should pay the balances in full each month.) If you have credit card debt, focus on paying that down since you'll free up available credit and save money on interest."}
{"original": "But don't rush to pay off student loans or mortgages, especially if you have higher-rate debt or a paltry emergency fund. Your extra principal payments typically won't reduce your required monthly payment, and you can't get that money back if you need cash in an emergency. Although being debt-free is a good goal, in a recession it can be more important to have financial flexibility."}
{"original": "If your stock market investments include money you'll need in the next five years, now is the time to move it to a lower-risk investment such as a short-term bond fund or cash."}
{"original": "You should be able to leave any stock market investments alone for at least five years and preferably 10, so your portfolio has time to recover from downturns."}
{"original": "Now is also a good time to rebalance your portfolio to your target mix of stocks, bonds and cash. The long bull market means that you may have too much money in stocks, which leaves you more vulnerable to drops. If you're not in the habit of rebalancing at least once a year, consider using a target-date retirement fund, a lifestyle fund or a robo-adviser, which all take care of that chore automatically."}
{"original": "There won't be tax consequences for these moves if you're investing inside a tax-deferred account, such as an IRA or 401(k). Before making moves in a taxable account, consult a tax pro."}
{"original": "All of these steps make sense regardless of what happens with the economy. Taking them now can help you better handle whatever comes next."}

{"original": "President Trump signed a bill Friday night to reopen the federal government for three weeks, officially ending the record-long partial government shutdown that began on December 22 and left hundreds of thousands of federal employees without pay."}
{"original": "Nine out of 15 federal departments were closed during those 35 days, as well as dozens of agencies."}
{"original": "Our dedicated public servants should never, never have to go through this again, Sen. Chuck Schumer said Friday, after President Trump announced he would sign legislation to reopen the government for three weeks. We will do everything we can to make sure they won't have to, and this past month has proven just how vital government services are to the American people, whether it's our food safety, our airports, our national parks, our economy, our national security and so much else."}

{"original": "The FDA initially did not do routine inspections of domestic food-processing facilities. It recalled workers to restart inspections of what are considered high-risk foods in mid-January after the routine inspections were briefly halted due to the shutdown."}
{"original": "The Smithsonian museums and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., shut their doors on January 2. The National Zoo also closed, although animals were still cared for by zoo workers."}
{"original": "Both the Smithsonian museums and the zoo are set to reopen on Tuesday, January 29."}
{"original": "Many national parks also closed, but several remained opened during the shutdown, albeit without services. Sanitary conditions rapidly deteriorated at many of the nation's parks, with restroom toilets overflowing and trash piling up."}
{"original": "The National Park Service said in a statement that it is preparing to resume regular operations nationwide though the schedule for individual parks may vary depending on staff size and complexity of operations. Independence National Historical Park, including the Liberty Bell Center, in Philadelphia has already opened."}

{"original": "Immigration courts closed, forcing judges to indefinitely postpone hearings scheduled months in advance."}
{"original": "E-Verify, the government immigration system and database employers use to check and confirm employees are eligible to work in the United States, was out of service during the shutdown. It typically takes just a few seconds for E-Verify to compare an employee's records against DHS and Social Security records. A few hundred E-Verify employees were allowed to return to work this week, although they were temporarily assigned to non-E-Verify related tasks during the shutdown."}
{"original": "Agencies including the NSF, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Parks Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and NOAA had to stop most of their work during the shutdown."}
{"original": "Large-scale instruments like NASA's Stratoscopheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy – the flying telescope – had to stop operations. Eventually bringing such instrumentation back up to speed requires over a week. NASA managers and engineers working on the agency's high-priority commercial crew program remained on the job without pay, continuing preparations for the first unpiloted launch of SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft on a long-awaited test flight in February"}
{"original": "Some airlines who took delivery of new aircraft in December and January forced to park those new planes as they have to receive Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) certification to carry passengers, and the people who certify the aircraft are furloughed. That does not impact an airlines' operations, but it did cost them revenue to have planes sitting unused, CBS News' Kris Van Cleave reported."}
{"original": "The National Transportation Safety Board has been unable to investigate the 97 major accidents that have occurred since the shutdown began. They resume service on Monday."}
{"original": "Mail was still delivered. Social Security checks were still going out to recipients, and Medicare and Medicaid are unaffected by the partial shutdown."}
{"original": "While TSA officers were working without pay, screeners working at the 22 airports that have private contractors handling airport security continued to get paid during the shutdown."}
{"original": "On January 7, the White House promised that tax refunds would not be affected by the shutdown, and later that day, the IRS confirmed it will begin to process tax returns for refunds on January 28. However, the IRS recalled thousands of workers later in January specifically to work processing on refunds."}
{"original": "The National Hurricane Center website continued to be updated and maintained because its information is needed for the protection of life and property."}
{"original": "Special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation continued because it does not depend on a congressional appropriation for its funding. Trump associate Roger Stone was indicted and arrested as part of the investigation on Friday, the last day of the shutdown."}
{"original": "Nutrition benefits issued through the USDA, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), were available through January and February. Child nutrition programs, like School Lunch and School Breakfast, were guaranteed to keep operating into February."}

{"original": "The Associated Press reported that despite the IRS continuing to process tax returns, the absences of large contingents of recalled workers during the shutdown could still lead to delayed tax returns."}
{"original": "The shutdown particularly affected the aviation industry. Flights in and out New York City's LaGuardia airport were delayed on Friday morning due to government shutdown-related staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, according to a notice issued by the Federal Aviation Administration."}
{"original": "Financial hardship due to the government shutdown has prompted some federal airport workers to call out of work causing some passenger interruptions. On Friday morning, an American Airlines flight out of Monroe, Louisiana, bound for Dallas with 26 passengers was canceled due to a TSA officer shortage in Monroe, according to an airline's spokesperson."}
{"original": "About 7.6 percent of the TSA workforce had an unscheduled absence on Thursday, up from 3 percent a year ago, according to the federal agency. Earlier this week, the TSA requested 250 screening officers volunteers to make up for the call outs."}
{"original": "The union for flight attendants expressed concern about the impact of the shutdown. This is exactly what AFA and other aviation unions have been warning would happen, wrote Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, in a statement. The aviation system depends on the safety professionals who make it run. They have been doing unbelievably heroic work even as they are betrayed by the government that employs them."}
{"original": "Air traffic controllers also sounded the alarm, saying in a statement that flying could be less safe with more air traffic controllers taking unscheduled absences due to financial difficulties. Air traffic controllers are required to report fit for duty every shift. It is a very high threshold of fitness demanded by the seriousness of the job, the statement said. This shutdown has caused a tremendous amount of added stress for them on top of what is already a difficult and stressful job."}
{"original": "The FBI Agents Association also warned this week that the shutdown was not only hurting individual FBI employees and their families, but hampering key operations. Some of those affected operations, according to a series of statements the association released Tuesday, included efforts to thwart the same criminal enterprises Mr. Trump claims the shutdown is meant to defeat in the long run."}
{"original": "Federal workers and their families were particularly affected. Several food banks opened around the country to assist federal employees who could not afford to buy groceries. In Washington, D.C., one pop-up kitchen providing free meals to affected workers is run by the non-profit organization World Central Kitchen, which was founded by celebrity chef José Andrés."}
{"original": "Americans who rely on certain services from the federal government were also impacted by the shutdown, such as people who relied on federal assistance to pay their rent."}

{"original": "When will federal workers be paid?"}
{"original": "It's unclear when federal employees will be receiving their paychecks, despite Mr. Trump's assurances. A senior administration official said Friday, Recognizing the urgency of getting federal employees paid quickly, the administration is taking steps to ensure they receive pay as soon as possible. Since specific payroll issues vary by agency, employees can find more information about paycheck details by reaching out to their agency."}

{"original": "KATIE COURIC: Yesterday you said in front of the DNC Winter Meeting, just in case there's any confusion out there, I'm not going to walk away from health care. But specifically, how are you going to move forward?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well what I've been doing is consulting closely with the leaders in the House, the leaders in the Senate on the Democratic side. And I want to consult closely with our Republican colleagues. So they're going to be coming in to the White House next week."}
{"original": "And what I want to do is to ask them to put their ideas on the table. And then after the recess, which will be a few weeks away, I want to come back and have a large meeting with Republicans and Democrats to go through systematically all the best ideas that are out there and move it forward."}
{"original": "But part of the reason that people need to understand why we can't back off on this: the major insurer-- one of the major insurers in California just announced that in the individual market they're increasing their premiums by 39 percent. That's a portrait of the future, if we don't do something now. It's going to keep on beating down families, small businesses, large businesses. It's going to be a huge drain on the economy. We're gonna have to do something about it and I think we can."}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: So you're inviting Republicans here to the White House. Does that mean, Mr. President, you're willing to start at square one?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well I think that-- what I want to do is to look at the Republican ideas that are out there. And I would want to be very specific. How do you guys want to lower costs? How do you guys intend to reform the insurance market, so people with preexisting conditions for example can get health care? How do you want to make sure that the 30 million people who don't have health insurance can get it? What are your ideas specifically?"}
{"original": "And if we can go step by step through a series of these issues and arrive at some agreements then procedurally, there's no reason why we can't do it a lot faster than the process took last year."}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: You say that jobs are your top priority this year. In retrospect, do you wish you had waited on health care until the economy grew stronger?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, because keep in mind jobs were my number one priority last year. That's why we passed the Recovery Act to make sure that, not only do we put 300 billion dollars worth of tax cuts into people's pockets so that there was demand and businesses had customers. That's why we provided over 200 billion dollars in assistance to states so they wouldn't have to lay off teachers and cops and firefighters and that all supported maintaining the jobs that we had. That's why we moved forward on infrastructure and clean energy and a lot of job creation."}
{"original": "And it, having taken those steps very quickly at the front and at the beginning of the year it was important for us also to start looking at these issues that middle class families have been struggling with for decades now. And do I wish we could have done it faster? That it hadn't been so painfully slow through the legislative process? Absolutely. But it was the right thing to do then. It continues to be the right thing."}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: Speaking of the legislative process, when it comes to health care, people watch the sausage being made and quite frankly it made them pretty sick to their stomachs. Your White House was in the middle of all these negotiations all these special deals that were given to certain senators--"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I'm not-- that that's probably not a right characterization."}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: But what you were aware of them?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: What is absolutely true is that getting something passed through Congress with 535 members is hard."}
{"original": "It's especially hard in something as big as health care. It's going to be true when we try to get the financial reform so that we don't have the same kind of too big to fail bailout nonsense that we had last year. Each of these issues are huge complicated issues, there are tons of special interests and lobbyists out there, and each legislator-- they think they're doing what's best for their-- for their state or for their district."}
{"original": "And you know what we have to do is just make sure that it is a much more clear and transparent process. I've got to push Congress on that. We've got to make sure that we're watching out for that. But the end product, the actual agreements that were come to on health care are ones that I'm absolutely convinced benefit millions of people all across the country."}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: But did some of these special deals, Mr. President--"}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: --sort of get it passed at all costs, turn your stomach too?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: They did not help. They frustrate me. But you know this is a democracy. Look I would have loved nothing better than to simply come up with some very elegant, academically approved approach to health care and didn't have any kinds of legislative fingerprints on it. And just go ahead and have that passed. But that's not how it works in our democracy unfortunately."}
{"original": "What we end up having to do is to do a lot of negotiations with a lot of different people, many of whom have their best constituents-- their constituents' best interests at heart. But cumulatively, what ends up happening is it ends up looking like each individual senator, each individual legislator is just looking out for their own thing and don't have the larger public interest at heart. My job is to make sure that we stay focused on that larger vision, of how do we lower costs for Americans over the long term?"}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: A lot of people, including Democrats, wrote to me saying you campaigned on a slogan of Change You Can Believe In. But their lives and the ways of Washington, they wrote, haven't changed at all. What would you say to that?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well it's not true that they haven't changed at all. Let's just take, we're sitting in the White House here. Every single person who comes into the White House now is posted on a website so you know every visitor to the White House. That's never happened in the history of the Republic. We are eliminating lobbyists from boards and commissions that have significant power throughout Washington. That hasn't happened in a previous administration. There's more transparency on something like the Recovery Act and how taxpayer dollars are being spent than there's ever been on a project of this size and scale. So here in the White House actually, we have instituted a whole range of changes that give people a lot more confidence in what we're doing. We haven't done as much as needs to be done. So for example, on earmarks, yes. What people consider to be pork projects. What we've said is, members of Congress if you're going to introduce a project that benefits your district, you should post it on the Internet so people can see it before you vote on it. And we'll put it on a centralized web site. But all these things take time. I mean you know you're not going to transform a culture in Washington, or anywhere else over the course of a year. You just got to keep on chipping away at it. And that's what we've tried to do."}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: Chris from Falls Church Virginia writes, Mr. President I lost my house two years ago and I've been out of work for a year. Can the federal government really stimulate the economy enough to start creating new jobs anytime soon? Without getting into too much policy speak, what would you say to Chris?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: I'd say to Chris, I know how tough it's been. I'd say that we are seeing the corner turned on the economy growing again."}
{"original": "Last year at this time the economy had contracted, had shrunk by 6 percent. We know now that last quarter it had grown by 6 percent. That's a good sign that companies are starting to pick up hiring again because they see the opportunities to go out there and make money. It's not happening as fast as we like and that's why there's still some things we can do in terms of tax credits for small businesses taking some of that TARP money that's been repaid and giving it to community banks so that they can lend it to small businesses. Giving job credits to small businesses for hiring potentially a million small businesses out there could get five thousand dollars for each employee they hire this year."}
{"original": "All those things, I think, are moving us in the right direction and my hope is is that for folks who are unemployed they're going to start seeing a concrete improvement in their own lives, in the next few months."}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: A cab driver told us to tell you he is scared to death of the deficit. And Congress couldn't even establish a bipartisan commission to study the deficit, because Republicans were afraid it would raise taxes and Democrats were afraid it would cut spending. You can understand why people are not only afraid, but so frustrated?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well it's important to remember that, actually the majority of Democrats did vote to set up this commission. What happened was you had seven Republicans who had been co-sponsors of the bill who decided not to vote for it--"}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: But some Democrats didn't support it, correct?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well no of course. But-- But-- but think about this. You got seven Republicans who were co-sponsors of the bill. It was their idea. And when I said, yes, let's do it, suddenly they decided to say no. That's indicative of a lot of posturing and on this issue and what I think the American people want is just an honest assessment of the situation."}
{"original": "Now, the honest assessment is this. We had a big structural deficit even before the recession. The recession made it much worse. We're not going to solve this overnight and we don't want to either raise taxes or drastically slash government spending while the economy is still fragile. If Democrats and Republicans come together in a sensible way, putting everything on the table. Not-- not trying to position themselves politically ahead of time, then there's no reason why we can't start putting in place some serious measures that will start driving the deficit down long term."}
{"original": "The biggest thing? The most important thing that we can do on deficits? And I would say this to your cab driver and everybody else, is to get a health reform package passed. The package that we've put together, the Congressional Budget Office says will cut the deficit by a trillion dollars. Even in Washington that's real money. If we can start bending the cost curve on health care, that's the most important thing we can do to deal with the deficits long term."}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: Have you ruled out trying confessed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York City?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: I have not ruled it out but I think it's important for us to take into account the practical, logistical issues involved. I mean if you've got a city that is saying no. And a police department that's saying no. And a mayor that's saying no. That makes it difficult. But, I think that the most important thing for the public to understand is we're not handling any of these cases any different than the Bush administration handled them, all through 9/11, in that they prosecuted 190 folks in these article three courts. Got convictions and those folks are in maximum security prisons right now. And there have been no escapes. And it-- it is a virtue of our system that we should be proud of."}
{"original": "Now what I've also said is that, you know it's important for us to recognize that when we're dealing with al-Qaeda operatives that-- they may have national security intelligence that we need. And it's important to make sure that the processes and procedures we approach with respect to these folks are not identical to the ones that we would use if we're apprehending the local drug dealer. And that's why we've put in place some very particular ways of dealing with these issues that ensure our security but also still uphold our due process."}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: Are you talking about reading them the Miranda rights? Their Miranda rights? In other words, like, Abdulmutallab who was read his Miranda rights? A lot of people are very upset about that because he was giving information to the FBI. Then his rights were read to him and he clammed up."}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well that's actually not what happened. What happened was he clammed up. And after we had obtained actionable intelligence from him, that's when the FBI -- the FBI folks on the ground then read him his Miranda rights."}
{"original": "But keep in mind Richard Reid was read his Miranda rights five minutes after he was arrested. Under the previous administration, some of the same critics of our approach have been employing this policy for years. I--"}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: Having said that should the practice of reading suspected terrorists their Miranda rights be reviewed?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: Absolutely, everything should be reviewed. And what we've done is we've said let's have the best interrogators around."}
{"original": "Some of those by the way are going to be FBI officials some of them are going to be police officers who are very good at their jobs. Some of them are going to be national security experts. Let's put together teams that are in charge of the interrogation process. Because we want to make sure, priority number one, when these kinds of events happen, have we gotten all the information we need to ensure that there's not going to be any additional attacks?"}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: But you have not ruled out New York City as a venue."}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: We have not ruled out anything. We will make a definitive judgment based on consultations with all the relevant authorities."}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: All right. And finally a Super Bowl question--"}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: --I know you have said that you are rooting for the Saints a bit. You're impressed by what Drew Brees has done for New Orleans. But I'm going to let you show off your sports knowledge for a moment. Who do you think will win? And why?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know I think the Colts probably had to be favored, mainly because they've got perhaps the best quarterback in history. I mean Peyton Manning is unbelievable. And, you know they've got a team that has complete confidence in him. Everybody knows the system. There's enormous continuity with that team. So they are tough."}
{"original": "I do have a soft spot in my heart for New Orleans, mainly because of what the city has gone through over these last several years. And I just know how much that team means to them. And-- and I got to know Drew Brees from when we shot a commercial for having kids get more active and get off the couch and he's just a class act. Terrific guy. Wonderful family. But I would say that the Colts have to be favored. Now one other factor that I have to confess here is that when my Bears went to the Super Bowl, several years ago, it was the Indianapolis Colts that beat him. So, I probably still have--"}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: Ah, got an axe to grind."}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: A little bit of an axe to grind."}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: And you'd like to issue an executive order, I understand, mandating a close game?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT OBAMA: Mandating a close game. We had a great game last year. And I'm hopeful that we've got the same kind of game we had with the Cardinals and the Steelers."}
{"original": "KATIE COURIC: All right. President Obama, again thanks so much for talking with us. Appreciate it."}
{"original": "Detroit - Tesla made about 9,300 more vehicles than it delivered last year, raising concerns among industry analysts that inventory is growing as demand for the company's electric cars may be starting to wane."}
{"original": "If demand falls, they said, Tesla will enter a new phase of its business. Like other automakers, it will have to either cut production or reduce prices to raise sales. A drop in demand could also curtail earnings and jeopardize CEO Elon Musk's promise to post sustained quarterly profits."}
{"original": "On Wednesday, Tesla did cut prices, knocking $2,000 off each of its three models. The company said the reductions will help customers deal with the loss of a $7,500 federal tax credit, which dropped to $3,750 this month for Tesla buyers and will gradually go to zero by the end of 2019."}
{"original": "They have for a long time had more demand than supply, Gartner analyst Michael Ramsey said. It's becoming apparent that that dynamic is changing."}
{"original": "Tesla reported that it produced 254,530 cars and SUVs last year and delivered 245,240."}
{"original": "The company's deliveries for the full year matched Wall Street estimates, but its figures for the fourth quarter didn't reach expectations. Tesla said it delivered 90,700 vehicles from October through December. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected 92,000."}
{"original": "Investors saw that news as a negative and sold off Tesla shares on Wednesday. The stock price fell nearly 7 percent, closing at $310.12. In Thursday morning premarket trading, the shares were lower by another 1.3 percent."}
{"original": "Jeff Schuster, a senior vice president at the forecasting firm LMC Automotive, said demand for Tesla's lower-priced Model 3 has been artificially high for the past six months as the company overcame production problems at its Fremont, California, factory."}
{"original": "You've had these inflated months because of delayed deliveries, Schuster said. We're probably getting to that point where we're getting to equilibrium and consumers aren't necessarily waiting for vehicles."}
{"original": "Last year, Tesla reported that about 420,000 buyers had put down $1,000 deposits to join the Model 3 waiting list."}
{"original": "LMC predicts that Tesla U.S. sales will rise in 2019 because it's the Model 3's first full year on the market. It anticipates sales to then fall by about 10,000 in 2020."}
{"original": "Losing the tax credit will hit those who have been holding out for the $35,000 version of the Model 3, Schuster said. At present, Tesla is selling only versions that cost more than $45,000. Under federal law, buyers get the full tax credit until a manufacturer reaches 200,000 in sales since the start of 2010. Tesla hit 200,000 in July, but the full credit continued for vehicles delivered by Dec. 31. It was cut in half on Jan. 1 and will go away by the end of the year."}
{"original": "You've had your early adopters, those early followers have already come in to buy, Schuster said. Now you're trying to appeal to the mainstream market. I think that will have an impact on overall demand."}
{"original": "At the same time, inventory appears to be swelling. The company parked hundreds of cars at lots and Tesla stores all over the country at the end of last year, which could indicate excess stock. Tesla wouldn't give inventory numbers but said it has lower stocks than its two biggest competitors, BMW and Mercedes."}
{"original": "The Associated Press found one lot on the north side of Chicago where Tesla was storing dozens of vehicles in late December, and Mark Spiegel, a hedge fund manager who bets against Tesla stock, said other lots were full across the country."}
{"original": "Tesla said it sometimes stores vehicles on lots as they're being shipped to company dealerships across the nation. The lot in Chicago has fewer cars on it today, the company said. Our inventory levels remain the smallest in the automotive industry, the company said Wednesday."}
{"original": "Tesla also said Model 3 sales should grow worldwide as it expands distribution and begins to offer leases. Deliveries in Europe and China will start in February, and a right-hand-drive version is coming later in the year, the company said."}
{"original": "In addition, inventory dropped in the fourth quarter as Tesla delivered a few thousand vehicles more than produced."}
{"original": "Tesla said it had about 3,000 vehicles in transit to customers at year's end. But even with that number, Schuster said production still exceeded deliveries, which doesn't fit Tesla's business model of building cars when customers order them. However, said Schuster, even at 9,300, Tesla's inventory is smaller than other automakers that have to stock dealerships."}
{"original": "FRANKFURT, Germany - A group of investigative journalists on Monday published the names of thousands of offshore companies at the heart of a massive trove of data on the finances of the rich and powerful that has become known as the Panama Papers."}
{"original": "The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists made data on 200,000 entities available on its website."}
{"original": "They contain basic corporate information about companies, trusts and foundations set up in 21 jurisdictions including Hong Kong and the U.S. state of Nevada. The data was obtained from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which said it was hacked."}
{"original": "Users can search the data and see the networks involving the offshore companies, including, where available, Mossack Fonseca's internal records of the true owners."}
{"original": "Information and documents on bank accounts, phone numbers and emails have been removed from the database."}
{"original": "The ICIJ said it was putting the information online in the public interest as a careful release of basic corporate information as it builds on an earlier database of offshore entities."}
{"original": "Setting up an offshore company is not by itself illegal or evidence of illegal conduct, and Mossack Fonseca said it observed rules requiring it to identify its clients."}
{"original": "The ICIJ prefaced the data dump by noting that the appearance of particular persons and companies on the list doesn't imply wrongdoing."}
{"original": "But anti-poverty campaigners say shell companies can be used by the wealthy and powerful to shield money from taxation, or to launder the gains from bribery, embezzlement and other forms of corruption. The Group of 20 most powerful economies has agreed that individual governments should make sure authorities can tell who really owns companies, but implementation in national law has lagged."}
{"original": "The data cache, first leaked to Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily, showed offshore holdings of 12 current and former world leaders. Reports based on the documents quickly led to the resignation of Iceland's Prime Minister David Gunnlaugson after it was revealed he and his wife had set up a company in the British Virgin Islands that had holdings in Iceland's failed banks."}
{"original": "British Prime Minister David Cameron, who had campaigned for financial transparency, faced questions about shares he once held in an offshore trust set up by his father. The ICIJ reported that associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin moved some $2 billion through such companies. Putin's spokesman dismissed the report."}
{"original": "Hundreds of economists urged world leaders Monday to end the era of tax havens, arguing they only benefit rich individuals and multinational corporations and serve to increase inequality."}
{"original": "The 300 economists, in a letter coordinated by activist group Oxfam, say poorer countries are hit hardest by tax dodging."}
{"original": "As the Panama Papers and other recent exposés have revealed, the secrecy provided by tax havens fuels corruption and undermines countries' ability to collect their fair share of taxes, the letter said. While all countries are hit by tax dodging, poor countries are proportionately the biggest losers, missing out on at least $170 (billion) of taxes annually as a result."}
{"original": "The letter comes days before an anti-corruption summit in London, featuring politicians from 40 countries as well as representatives from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Many of the companies that featured in the Panama Papers were incorporated in British Overseas Territories and the British Virgin Islands."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON -- Got a question for the IRS about your taxes? The agency is pushing you to fire up your computer rather than give them a call."}
{"original": "The IRS may soon dramatically scale back telephone and face-to-face service as part of a plan that would focus more on online accounts for the 150 million individual taxpayers and 11 million businesses seeking help and information, the agency's official watchdog warned."}
{"original": "In an annual report to Congress, National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson said the IRS should be more open about its plans and that service cutbacks may mean an increasing number of people may have to turn to tax preparers and software such as TurboTax to file their returns."}
{"original": "That would increase tax compliance costs for millions of filers."}
{"original": "Implicit in the plan -- and explicit in internal discussion -- is an intention on the part of the IRS to substantially reduce telephone and face-to-face interaction with taxpayers, Olson's report says. The key unanswered question is by how much. ... It is incumbent upon the IRS to be much more specific about how much personal taxpayer assistance it expects to provide."}
{"original": "The IRS fired back in a statement, saying Olson's report doesn't paint an accurate picture. It said taxpayers want new options to interact with the agency and that moving more communications online would free up resources for traditional services."}
{"original": "The IRS remains fully committed to personal service to taxpayers, and the IRS believes increasing the availability of self-service interaction frees up in-person resources for taxpayers who truly need them, including those who are not comfortable online or don't have personal access to a computer, the statement said."}
{"original": "Taxpayers currently make more than 100 million calls a year to the IRS and more than 5 million visits to the agency's walk-in assistance centers."}
{"original": "Olson said millions of taxpayers don't go on the Internet and millions more are reluctant to share sensitive information online, as envisioned by an IRS plan for its future operations that's been under development for a year-and-a-half."}
{"original": "The agency has scaled back taxpayer services as it has put in place budget cuts imposed by Republicans in Congress. As a result, many calls to IRS information centers go unanswered and those who do get through get answers to only the simplest questions. The agency also no longer helps low-income taxpayers file their returns and it conducts fewer audits."}
{"original": "After adjusting for inflation, Congress has cut the agency's budget by about 19 percent since 2010. Last month, Congress finally gave the agency a budget boost, including $290 million in additional money for taxpayer assistance."}
{"original": "Olson said that the evolving IRS plan has many positive components, such as new online taxpayer accounts that would speed information to taxpayers and handle many of their interactions with the agency. That is likely to reduce demand for overburdened telephone and face-to-face interactions with the agency."}
{"original": "Still, Olson said, many people seeking help from the IRS don't have cookie cutter problems that can be handled online. For instance, last year more than 9 million filers experienced refund delays or received IRS notices after submitting their returns proposing to adjust tax payments."}
{"original": "Olson's warnings stem from limited public pronouncements about the agency's planning and internal IRS discussions. She said the IRS should make its plans public."}
{"original": "We believe it is critical that the IRS share its plans in detail ... and then engage in a dialogue about the extent to which it intends to curtail or eliminate various categories of telephone service and face-to-face service, whether it will provide sufficient support for taxpayers, the report said. And whether it has an adequate 'Plan B' if taxpayer demand for telephone and face-to-face service remains higher than the IRS anticipates."}
{"original": "Americans who aren't required to file taxes and are concerned about getting their government stimulus check quickly can now visit a new web portal set up by the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service that lets people enter their bank direct-deposit information. The federal payments — $1,200 for most taxpayers who earn less than $75,000 annually — are expected to hit bank accounts early next week."}
{"original": "The portal — available here — is free to use and is designed for people who haven't filed their taxes in 2018 or 2019, which means they haven't provided their bank account information to the IRS. The agency plans to first send the money to Americans via direct deposit, while others may face a wait of weeks or even months for paper checks to arrive in the mail."}
{"original": "The IRS plans to launch another site later this month for taxpayers who filed their tax returns in 2018 or 2019 but didn't provide their banking information on their return, the agency said Friday."}
{"original": "The 'Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here' web portal is a tool for Americans who are not required to file tax returns to make sure they receive their payment as quickly and safely as possible, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement."}
{"original": "The stimulus payments are part of a $2.2 trillion federal relief package aimed at offering Americans financial support as the coronavirus shutters businesses across the country. With economic growth in free fall, nearly 17 million workers have lost their jobs over the last month."}
{"original": "The Treasury Department said earlier this month that Americans on Social Security will not be required to file a simple tax return to receive a stimulus check from the U.S. government. The announcement reversed an earlier statement from the Internal Revenue Service that participants in the federal retirement program would need to file such a return to get the funds."}
{"original": "About 15 million people, including millions of seniors on Social Security, aren't required to file tax returns."}
{"original": "Most Americans don't need to do anything to receive a stimulus payment because the IRS is relying on 2018 and 2019 tax returns to find household income — which determines how much people receive — and direct-deposit information for bank accounts."}
{"original": "With the threat of tariffs and counter-tariffs between Washington and Beijing looming, Chinese buyers are canceling orders for U.S. soybeans, a trend that could deal a blow to American farmers if it continues."}
{"original": "At the same time, farmers in China are being encouraged to plant more soy, apparently to help make up for any shortfall from the United States."}
{"original": "Beijing has included soybeans on a list of $50 billion of U.S. exports on which it has said it would impose 25 percent tariffs if the United States follows through on its threats to impose the same level of tariffs on the same value of Chinese goods. The U.S. tariffs could kick in later this month; China would likely retaliate soon after."}
{"original": "It can take a month or longer for soybean shipments to travel from the U.S. to China. Any soybeans en route to China now could be hit by the tariff by the time they arrive."}
{"original": "The Chinese aren't willing to buy U.S. soybeans with a 25 percent tax hanging over their head, said Dan Basse, president of AgResource, an agricultural research and advisory firm. You just don't want the risk."}
{"original": "Basse said that it has been roughly three weeks since China has made any major soybean purchases, an unusually long delay."}
{"original": "Some Chinese buyers might be showing support for their government in the trade dispute by turning away U.S. soybeans, Basse said. The dispute may also make it seem too risky to buy from the United States over the long run."}
{"original": "The United States could lose the reliable supplier label that we've had these many years, Basse said."}
{"original": "Data from the U.S. government data show that sales of soybeans have fallen from about 255,000 metric tons in the first week of April, when the trade dispute began, to just 7,900 in the week that ended April 26. Cancellations have also jumped, to more than 140,000 metric tons in the week ending April 26. In the same week last year, there were no canceled sales at all."}
{"original": "Some analysts argue that the shifts aren't yet particularly significant. China buys most of its soybeans from the United States in the late summer and fall, and then switches to South American sources, mainly Brazil and Argentina, in the spring. So the current market activity doesn't necessarily reflect the pattern that would occur during the main buying season."}
{"original": "These numbers we're talking about are pretty minor, said John Baize, an economist for the U.S. Soybean Export Council."}
{"original": "The U.S. ships about 35 million metric tons of soybeans to China a year, Baize said. China usually imports about 100 million tons a year and can't import enough from other countries, he said, to abandon the United States as a source."}
{"original": "Where's China going to buy its beans? Baize asked."}
{"original": "That may be true in the short run. But Basse suggests that Brazil has enough land that could be used for soybean cultivation that it could soon mostly replace the United States as a supplier to China."}
{"original": "And if the Chinese market were to be closed to U.S. farmers, they might be able to sell some portion of their soybeans to other markets. Baize said that huge multinational companies, such as Cargill and ADM, might, for example, sell more U.S. soybeans toEurope, where they wouldn't face any tariffs, though this likely wouldn't make up for the loss of the Chinese market."}
{"original": "At the same time, China is looking more to its own farmers. Since China announced its potential tariffs on U.S. soy in April, the government has encouraged farmers to cultivate more soybeans. Beginning this month, Chinese farmers say, Beijing reduced corn subsidies and raised annual soybean subsidies from 2550 yuan ($400) per hectare to 3000 yuan ($470) or more per hectare in major soybean-producing provinces in northeast China."}
{"original": "An adjustment had already been planned to help draw down China's substantial corn stockpiles, so the change wasn't necessarily aimed at U.S. soy growers, analysts say."}
{"original": "But the subsidy adjustment did come with political undertones. Officials in major soybean-producing provinces were describing the promotion of local soybeans as the most important political task in agricultural production at present. Heilongjiang in northeast China announced a pilot project to plant soybeans on 100,000 new hectares, with an extra 2,250 yuan ($353) subsidy per hectare."}
{"original": "The moves are prompting farmers like Liu Cong to focus more on growing soy. Liu says he used most of his land to grow corn last year but this year is planting more soybeans. This is encouraging for farmers, he said in a phone interview. We're more motivated."}
{"original": "Zhang Xiaoping, China director for the U.S. Soybean Export Council, says that Chinese buyers have been canceling soybean purchases of last year's U.S. soybean harvest because of the threat of tariffs."}
{"original": "The buyers literally stopped buying from the U.S., Zhang said. Exporters cannot find any buyers in China."}
{"original": "Howard Stern is in hot water after his radio show aired a conversation between a woman and an IRS agent."}
{"original": "The woman, Judith Barrigas, is suing Stern for revealing her tax information on air, per The Hollywood Reporter."}
{"original": "The strange incident took place in 2015, when an IRS agent, Jimmy Forsythe, called the Howard Stern Show and was put on hold. He then took a call from Barrigas and talked to her for 45 minutes about her tax case. During Forsythe's conversation with Barrigas, a staffer on Stern overheard and decided to air the conversation live on satellite radio."}
{"original": "Barrigas filed a complaint on Monday in Massachusetts federal court, which reads, While on the phone with Agent Forsythe, Mrs. Barrigas suddenly began to receive a barrage of text messages and phone calls from unknown callers/individuals. The text messages were informing Mrs. Barrigas that her personal information and phone number was being aired live on 'The Stern Show.'"}
{"original": "Her lawsuit states that the the phone call can still be found on the internet and is an outrageous violation of privacy that has negatively affected her career and physical health. According to the suit, Forsythe was put on administrative leave."}
{"original": "Barrigas is suing both the government, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, for unlawfully disclosing her tax return, and Stern and his show for negligence and invasion of privacy."}
{"original": "Foxconn Technology Group said Wednesday its planned $10 billion Wisconsin campus will now be a research hub, not a blue-collar manufacturing center, as originally promised, while insisting it remains committed to creating 13,000 jobs at the state-subsidized site."}
{"original": "The much-touted facility was heralded by President Donald Trump and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker as proof that they were returning manufacturing to the Midwest and the United States. Foxconn, a major supplier to Apple, is the world's largest contract maker of electronics and China's largest private employer."}
{"original": "Already, the company's hiring pace is slowing down in Wisconsin. Foxconn fell short of its employment goal in 2018, hiring 80 fewer people than the 260 it promised and missing a $9.5 million state tax credit. It initially projected hiring 5,200 people by 2020, but is on track to hire just 1,000, according to Reuters."}
{"original": "In a statement Wednesday, Foxconn said it remains committed to the project, the creation of 13,000 jobs and to our long-term investment in Wisconsin. But because the global market environment that existed when the project was first announced in 2017 has shifted, this has necessitated the adjustment of plans for all projects, including Wisconsin."}
{"original": "Louis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn CEO Terry Gou, told Reuters in a story published Wednesday that its plans to build liquid crystal display panel screens are being scaled back and possibly shelved."}
{"original": "In terms of TV, we have no place in the U.S., Woo told Reuters. We can't compete. Woo also said a factory would not be built in Wisconsin: You can't use a factory to view our Wisconsin investment."}
{"original": "Instead, Woo said Foxconn wants to create a technology hub that would largely consist of research facilities along with packaging and assembly operations. Woo said about three-quarters of the jobs created will be in research and development and design, rather than blue-collar manufacturing jobs."}
{"original": "Foxconn said in its statement that it was broadening its base of investment in Wisconsin to ensure the company and workforce will be positioned for long-term success. That includes focusing on research and development in advanced industrial internet technologies and producing high-tech applications and solutions for industries such as education, medical and health care, entertainment and sports, security and management of municipal services, Foxconn said."}
{"original": "The Taiwan-based company billed the massive 20 million-square-foot campus as its first North American manufacturing site for the next generation of liquid crystal display panels to be used in a wide variety of products, including large-screen TVs, self-driving cars, notebooks and other monitors."}
{"original": "Wisconsin state and local governments promised roughly $4 billion to Foxconn, the largest incentive in state history and the biggest promised by a state to a foreign corporation in U.S. history. Foxconn was required to invest $10 billion and create 13,000 jobs to get the full incentives."}
{"original": "A spokeswoman for Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat who was critical of Foxconn in the campaign against Walker, did not immediately return a message seeking comment. A spokesman for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, which brokered the deal with Foxconn, also did not immediately return a message. Neither did Wisconsin Republican legislative leaders who pushed the Foxconn project."}
{"original": "Democratic critics, including Evers, said the incentives promised to Foxconn were too rich and questioned whether the company would ever fulfill its job creation and investment promises. They also said the massive plant that was relying on water from nearby Lake Michigan posed serious environmental risks ."}
{"original": "Every step of the way Foxconn has overpromised and under-delivered, said Democratic Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz in a statement. This news is devastating for the taxpayers of Wisconsin. We were promised manufacturing jobs. We were promised state of the art LCD production. We were promised a game-changing economic opportunity for our state. And now, it appears Foxconn is living up to their failed track record in the U.S. — leaving another state and community high and dry."}
{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden outlined his COVID-19 relief proposal in Wilmington, Delaware, on Thursday. The massive stimulus bill is expected to cost roughly $1.9 trillion to fund vaccinations and provide immediate, direct relief to working families and communities bearing the brunt of the crisis."}
{"original": "A crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight, and there's no time to waste. We have to act and we have to act now, Mr. Biden said."}
{"original": "The president-elect said his plan is two-pronged — a rescue plan, which he outlined Thursday night, and a recovery plan, which he will outline after he's in office. The vice president claims his rescue plan will lift millions of out poverty. Mr. Biden was expected to announce his vaccine rollout plan Thursday night too, but said he will do so soon."}
{"original": "Included in Mr. Biden's relief plan are the following things:"}
{"original": "$1,400 checks to American adults (on top of the $600 Congress already passed)"}
{"original": "Boosting child tax credit to $3,000 per child and $3,600 for children under 6"}
{"original": "Implementing a $15 federal minimum wage"}
{"original": "$25 billion for child care centers"}
{"original": "Expanded paid sick, family and medical leave"}
{"original": "The relief push will also include $160 billion for a national vaccination program, funding to expand COVID-19 testing, $170 billion for schools, $15 billion for the hardest-hit 1 million small businesses and $20 billion for the hardest-hit public transit agencies, among other things."}
{"original": "U.S. President-elect Joe Biden speaks as he lays out his plan for combating the coronavirus and jump-starting the nation's economy at the Queen theater January 14, 2021 in Wilmington, Delaware. Alex Wong / Getty Images"}
{"original": "I know what I just described does not come cheaply, the president-elect said, adding that failure to do so will cost us dearly."}
{"original": "Mr. Biden took no questions from reporters after his speech."}
{"original": "The package is likely to pass Congress, as Democrats control the House and, once the Georgia Senate election results are certified, there will be a 50-50 party split in the Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking any ties. Some elements of the legislation, like the $1,400 stimulus checks, already have bipartisan support, but lobbying from congressional members and special interests could affect the package's overall price tag."}
{"original": "Mr. Biden is also taking steps to accelerate the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines once he takes office. The Trump administration pledged to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of 2020. However, two weeks into the new year, only over 10 million people have received their first dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID Data Tracker."}
{"original": "Last week, eight Democratic governors sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Army General Gustave Perna, who is in charge of overseeing vaccine distribution for Operation Warp Speed, requesting that they accelerate the distribution of vaccines and not hold back doses in reserves while awaiting further shipments. On Tuesday, Azar announced several major changes to the federal government's vaccine distribution plan, including its decision to release a large supply of doses it had been withholding to ensure that vaccinated Americans got their second dose."}
{"original": "Azar said the change was made possible because manufacturing capabilities are now in place to meet demand. We now have a consistent pace of production, we can now ship all of the doses that had been held in physical reserve, with second doses being supplied by doses coming off of manufacturing lines with quality control, the secretary said. Going forward, each week, doses available will be released to first cover the second doses and then cover additional first vaccinations."}
{"original": "Mr. Biden has set a goal to vaccinate 100 million people during his first 100 days as president. I'm absolutely convinced that in 100 days, we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better, the president-elect said last month."}
{"original": "Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and member of Biden's coronavirus advisory board, told CBS This Morning on Tuesday that he'd view it as an aspirational goal."}
{"original": "I'd call it an aspirational goal and one I think we must strive for, Osterholm said. We know right now that every day we don't have vaccine in people's arms, people are getting sick and dying. And so, I think every effort must be made to do that, and the team is behind him in every way they can to help make it a reality."}
{"original": "Washington — Judge Merrick Garland, President Biden's nominee for attorney general, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of his confirmation hearing on Monday, vowing to restore the Justice Department's independence and pursue prosecutions of those who participated in the January 6 attack on the Capitol."}
{"original": "It is a fitting time to reaffirm that the role of the attorney general is to serve the rule of law and to ensure equal justice under the law, Garland said in his opening statement. If I am confirmed as attorney general, it will be the culmination of a career I have dedicated to ensuring that the laws of our country are fairly and faithfully enforced, and that the rights of all Americans are protected."}
{"original": "A judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Garland made his debut before senators as the Justice Department emerges from a period during which it was thrust into the center of politically charged investigations involving former President Donald Trump's allies and dogged by accusations of politicization."}
{"original": "Garland appears poised to be confirmed by a wide bipartisan margin, as senators on both sides of the aisle praised his record of public service and commitment to the rule of law."}
{"original": "Emphasizing his commitment to maintaining the independence of the Justice Department and shielding it from political pressures, primarily from the White House, Garland pledged to fend off any effort by anyone to make prosecutions or investigations partisan or political in any way."}
{"original": "I am not the president's lawyer, he said. I am the United States' lawyer."}
{"original": "In an exchange with Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, Garland grew emotional discussing his motivation for accepting the nomination for attorney general as he reflected on the experiences of his grandparents who fled anti-Semitism and persecution in the early 1900s for the U.S."}
{"original": "This country took us in, protected us, he said, becoming choked up. I feel an obligation to the country to pay back. This is the highest, best use of my own set of skills to pay back."}
{"original": "If confirmed, Garland will take the helm of the Justice Department as it pursues investigations into and prosecutions of rioters who breached the U.S. Capitol in the violent insurrection January 6."}
{"original": "The judge told lawmakers that battling extremist attacks on our democratic institutions remains central to the Justice Department's mission. He condemned the deadly assault on the Capitol, calling it a heinous attack that sought to disrupt a cornerstone of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power into a newly elected government."}
{"original": "I don't believe this is necessarily a one-off, Garland said about the attack."}
{"original": "Garland would also assume the post of attorney general as the department continues to oversee several politically sensitive probes, including one involving Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden's son whose tax affairs are under scrutiny, as well as the ongoing examination from special counsel John Durham into the origins of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election."}
{"original": "Garland told senators he has not discussed Hunter Biden's case with the president and reiterated Mr. Biden's public commitment to leave decisions about investigations and prosecutions to the Justice Department."}
{"original": "That was the reason that I was willing to take on this job, he said."}
{"original": "As attorney general, Garland committed the Justice Department to fully participating in congressional investigations into Mr. Trump's zero tolerance immigration policy, which led to separations of migrant families apprehended at the border. The department's inspector general found former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his aides were the driving force in the prior administration's policy."}
{"original": "I think that the policy was shameful, Garland said. I can't imagine anything worse than tearing parents from their children, and we will provide all the cooperation that we possibly can."}
{"original": "Garland has received support for his nomination from a bevy of civil rights organizations and law enforcement groups. When pressed on whether he supports calls from progressives to strip police of their funding following the deaths of unarmed Black men and women at the hands of law enforcement, the judge said, President Biden has said he does not support defunding the police and nor do I. Instead, Garland said he believes more resources should be given to police departments to gain support of communities and ensure resources are available for mental health services."}
{"original": "Garland's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee comes five years after he was nominated to the Supreme Court by former President Barack Obama following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. But Republicans declined to take up Garland's nomination and he never received a confirmation hearing before the Judiciary panel, as GOP senators argued the vacancy arose too close to the 2016 presidential election."}
{"original": "If the Senate approves Garland as the nation's top law enforcement officer, it would open up a seat on the powerful D.C. Circuit for Mr. Biden to fill. Garland, appointed to the court by former President Bill Clinton in 1997, served as its chief judge until February 2020. Garland is also no stranger to the Justice Department, having served as a federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., as well as deputy assistant attorney general for the criminal division, and as principal associate deputy attorney general."}
{"original": "The Judiciary Committee will hear from outside witnesses Tuesday, the second day of the confirmation hearing. Committee Chairman Dick Durbin told reporters he expects the Senate to vote on Garland's nomination next week."}

{"original": "Hours after the Utah Legislature opens its 2019 session on Monday, concerned supporters of a voter-approved measure to fully expand Medicaid were expected to rally to ask lawmakers not to change the law. Changes could delay the expected April 1 rollout for months or years, leaving people without health care they have been counting on, said Stacy Stanford with the Utah Health Policy Project."}
{"original": "They're excited, and they're desperate, Stanford said. She estimates the Monday afternoon rally could draw hundreds of people."}
{"original": "State leaders have said they plan to implement Medicaid expansion, but want to make changes to control costs."}
{"original": "A proposal by Republican Sen. Allen Christensen of North Ogden would cap enrollment and include a work requirement, changes that would require a potentially lengthy approval process from the federal government."}
{"original": "For expansion supporters, that would amount to a repeal, Stanford said."}
{"original": "Christensen has said a sales tax increase included in the ballot measure won't cover the full cost. Advocates say it will cover the program for at least two years, and any negotiations about funding could happen after the program is rolled out."}
{"original": "The sales tax increase is expected to generate $90 million that will combine with $800 million in federal money."}
{"original": "Advocates got the issue on the ballot after the GOP-dominated legislature refused to fully expand Medicaid under President Barack Obama's signature health care law, citing cost concerns."}
{"original": "The plan approved by voters provides health care coverage to an estimated 150,000 low-income Utah residents."}
{"original": "Utah is one of three Republican-leaning states where full Medicaid expansion won the vote in November after years of resistance from state lawmakers."}
{"original": "In Idaho, Gov. Brad Little has also voiced the possibility of a work requirement or work training. In Nebraska, though, the rollout is on track, despite some lingering concern from lawmakers."}
{"original": "Shakira is one of the world's biggest music stars, a crossover phenomenon with hits in both Spanish and English. She's won three Grammys, 11 Latin Grammys and amassed a $350 million fortune. Now, at 42, she's about to hit another high note: performing at the halftime show at this year's Super Bowl with Jennifer Lopez. It's a remarkable journey for a woman who was cut from her elementary school choir in Colombia — her classmates said she sounded like a goat. Shakira now lives in Spain. We went to see her there and found an artist bristling with restless energy and drive that sometimes torture her, but always propel her, lifting her to one of the biggest stages in the world: the Super Bowl in Miami."}
{"original": "Two months before kickoff, Shakira lit up center court at the Davis Cup tennis tournament in Madrid with the kind of full throated, hip thrusting performance that has electrified audiences for more than two decades."}
{"original": "This was her first live performance in more than a year ... a warm up for the Super Bowl and a showcase for the distinctive music and eye-catching moves that have catapulted her to one-name international pop star status."}
{"original": "Shakira fills huge stadiums around the world, her devotees cry out - sometimes just plain cry — to hear hits like, Hips Don't Lie."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: I've seen you running around. You go from guitar to drums, and the dancing and the singing. It just looks like you're having so much fun. Are you?"}
{"original": "Shakira: Oh yeah. I have a blast on stage. I feel that that's my turf. It's a comfortable place for me."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: Do you feel the music?"}
{"original": "Shakira: I listen to music through my body. Even when I'm mixing songs in the recording studio, if I don't move, I know that there's something wrong. I say, Do you see them moving? Do you see my hips moving? It's not working. (LAUGH) Hips don't lie."}

{"original": "Shakira: It's the way I move, baby. (LAUGHTER)"}
{"original": "When it comes to her moves and her music, Shakira leaves nothing to chance. The Davis Cup performance in November was just eight minutes. She spent a full month rehearsing."}
{"original": "When we dropped in, we saw an artist in constant motion and total control. She fine tunes the fine points of every performance, no detail is too small. Whether working on the choreography critiquing the dancers or directing the timing of the show."}
{"original": "They used to call James Brown the hardest working man in show business. It seemed to us Shakira is vying for that title. In the studio and on the stage, Shakira strives for perfection."}
{"original": "Shakira: I can really be hard on myself wanting it to be 100% perfect but I know perfection doesn't exist but it's a lesson I haven't quite learned yet. If it were up to me I wouldn't be celebrating any of my performances."}
{"original": "Shakira: None of them, no. There's always something that I wish would have been done differently and I coulda done better."}

{"original": "Shakira: Such a therapeutic, yeah, cathartic vehicle, you know, for me to express my thoughts and my angst. Sometimes I'm just restless, and I don't know what it is. And I think it's— what I just need is a piece of paper and a pen or my computer, and just start writing. And then being able to put music to those words. It's something really beautiful, I guess. (LAUGH)"}
{"original": "Her distinctive sound is a blend of the music and colors of home, the coastal Colombian city of Barranquilla, a melting pot of cultures: indigenous, European, African, Middle Eastern."}

{"original": "Shakira: There are songs that make you feel like a dog biting your own tail. You never—"}
{"original": "(LAUGH) you never figure it out. And there are songs that are so easy that just come to you. Songs like Waka Waka, for example."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: That came to you easily?"}
{"original": "Shakira: The music and the lyrics came to me at the same time. (SINGS LYRICS) You're a good soldier, choosing your battles, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, back in the saddle. I'm, like, I need a paper, and a pen. A paper and a pen, someone. Run."}

{"original": "Anything's possible should be the mantra of Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll. At 10, she entered a singing contest and won. At 13, she signed her first record deal. Five years later, she was one of the biggest rockeras - rock stars - in Latin America."}
{"original": "But she craved a broader audience. So, she learned English, studied the lyrics of Bob Dylan and the poetry of Walt Whitman and at age 24 was blasting up the U.S. charts with a new look and a new song: Wherever, Whenever."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: What made you believe you could make it in the United States?"}
{"original": "Shakira: Destiny? I had no doubt in my mind. I had visions of what was gonna happen to me since a very early age."}
{"original": "It was a steady rise until 2018, when she ran afoul of Spanish authorities over when she took up residence and how much tax she owes. She's paid about $16 million while she fights the assessment. It's a staggering sum that would have been unimaginable to a young Shakira. When she was seven, her father's jewelry business went bankrupt. The family went from middle class to poor overnight."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: What impact did that have on you?"}
{"original": "Shakira: Oh, a tremendous impact it was really important to me to vindicate my family's financial situation and social status. And to a point that it became— an obsession to me. A healthy obsession, I— I would say. You know to succeed in life. To bring my dad and my mom out of that precarious situation. I think that I would not be the same person if my dad hadn't had that financial setback."}
{"original": "Her father scraped together the money to keep his bookish daughter in Catholic school. At 18, with money from her first hit album, she started a foundation to educate disadvantaged children."}

{"original": "Shakira: I know that was on my to-do list, so, February 3rd, I'm gonna go, Check."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: You said you like your music to say something? What would be the message that you will send in your Super Bowl performance?"}
{"original": "Shakira: I think the message is gonna be Listen, I'm a woman. I'm a Latina. It wasn't easy for me to get to where I am. And being at the Super Bowl is the proof that everything is possible.

{"original": "Financial markets tumbled amid mounting investor concern about the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, which health officials officially declared a pandemic. The Dow slipped into bear territory, meaning it has fallen more than 20% from its all-time high in February."}
{"original": "The Dow plunged 1,465 points, or 5.7%, to 23,553 on Wednesday. The broad-based S&P 500-stock index fell 4.9%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sank 4.7%. The declines erased Tuesday's sharp gains, when investors boosted stocks in hopes of a proposed stimulus package from the Trump administration."}
{"original": "The World Health Organization on Wednesday said the coronavirus spreading around the globe can now be characterized as a pandemic. WHO Director Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the WHO is deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity of the outbreak."}
{"original": "Economists are warning of a possible recession in 2020 due to the virus, causing investors to flee stocks for less risky assets like bonds and gold. The stock market has suffered through three weeks of volatile trading as investors assess the widening impact of the coronavirus, which has spread to 1,000 cases in the U.S. as of Wednesday."}
{"original": "U.S. recession risks are on the rise, Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics told investors. Exacerbating the ongoing supply and demand shocks that have rippled through the global economy are widespread fear and financial market panic — with the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia further amplifying market stress."}
{"original": "At least 32 people in the U.S. have died of the disease caused by the virus, known as COVID-19, and there are cases in 37 states and Washington, D.C. There have now been than 120,000 cases worldwide and more than 4,300 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The vast majority of cases are mild, and almost half of those infected have already recovered."}
{"original": "Universities including MIT and Harvard are closing their campuses, while a growing number of businesses are banning employees from traveling and asking them to work from home. Many Americans are also postponing or canceling travel plans, which is hurting industries such as airlines and hotels."}
{"original": "Both the real economy and the financial economy are exhibiting acute signs of stress, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research note. Supply chains have been disrupted and final demand has declined for many industries. Travel is contracting sharply as both individuals and businesses restrict movement."}
{"original": "That's likely to lead to a collapse of corporate earnings growth in the second and third quarters of 2020, the investment bank predicted. But profits should begin to grow again in the fourth quarter as businesses regain their footing, they added."}
{"original": "The record-long bull market, which just marked its 11th anniversary, may be at its end given the sharp decline in equities since the disease began spreading in the U.S. last month. The question is whether COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, will lead to a short economic downturn followed by a swift recovery, or a prolonged slump, Goldman said."}
{"original": "Uncertainty around the impact the virus is having and will have on business and consumer spending is heightened and explains the dramatic asset volatility in recent weeks, the analysts noted."}
{"original": "For now, investors are eager for President Donald Trump and Congress to deliver a dose of fiscal stimulus that could bolster businesses impacted by the coronavirus. While it's unclear what the package might include, the government could offer benefits such as Small Business Administration disaster loans, a temporary payroll tax cut and a new paid medical leave policy, according to Height Securities."}
{"original": "The Treasury Department may also delay the April 15 deadline for filing taxes."}
{"original": "Facing increased cases of the virus, potential social distancing measures and adverse financial market reactions, pressure on the White House and Congress to act is significant, Height Securities analysts said in a research note. We believe that Congress understands if cannot afford not to send a signal of support to impacted workers, industries, and the markets."}
{"original": "The 116th Congress was sworn into office this past week, even as the government remained in a partial shutdown. A record number of women have been elected to the House of Representatives. So far, one newcomer is getting most of the attention, from both the left and from the right. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is 29 years old. She'd never run for elective office before and was working as a waitress and bartender when she launched her campaign. She unseated one of the most powerful Democrats in the House in the primary."}
{"original": "Like Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez is a Democratic Socialist. She believes in universal healthcare, tuition-free public college, and massive government investment to combat climate change. She's been described as both an inspiring and idealistic insurgent, and as a naïve and ill-informed newcomer — as the future of the Democratic party, and as a potential obstacle to its success. Few rookie members of Congress have put such bold ideas on the national agenda and stirred up so much controversy before they were sworn in."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: There are people that say that you don't understand how the game is played."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I think it's really great for people to keep thinking that. (LAUGHTER)"}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: You want folks to underestimate you?"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Absolutely. That's how I won my primary. (LAUGHTER)"}
{"original": "Winning that primary shocked the Democratic establishment, and in November, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress."}
{"original": "Just a few days later, as soon as she got to Washington, she paid a visit to climate change activists who were occupying her party leader Nancy Pelosi's office. She was the only newly elected member of Congress who decided to drop by during the sit-in, and she called on Pelosi to create a select committee on climate change without any members of Congress who accept money from the fossil fuel industry."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: Nancy Pelosi is incredibly powerful."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: She absolutely is. And—"}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: And you're occupying her office."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Oh my goodness, I could have thrown up that morning. (LAUGH) I was so nervous. But— I kept kind of just coming back to the idea that what they're fighting for wasn't wrong. And I— I had also sat down with— with Leader Pelosi beforehand and she told me her story. She came from activism. And I knew that she would absolutely understand how advocacy can change the needle on really important issues."}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez and her allies managed to get more than 40 members of Congress to support the climate committee."}
{"original": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to create it, but it's not nearly what Ocasio-Cortez had in mind. Pelosi granted the committee limited powers and did not ban members who take money from the fossil fuel industry."}
{"original": "I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country."}
{"original": "For Ocasio-Cortez, it was an early lesson in congressional politics. And another one came when she defied Pelosi and voted against the speaker's new House rules, but was not joined by many other progressive Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez told us she's determined to keep fighting for what's being called a Green New Deal — a highly ambitious, some would say unrealistic, proposal that would convert the entire U.S. Economy to renewable sources of energy in just 12 years, while guaranteeing every American a job at a fair wage."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: You're talking about zero carbon emissions— no use of fossil fuels within 12 years."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: That is the goal. It's ambitious. And..."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: How is that possible? Are you talking about everybody having to drive an electric car?"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now. What is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent possible?"}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: This would require, though, raising taxes."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: There's an element where— yeah. There— people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: Do you have a specific on the tax rate?"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: You know, it— you look at our tax rates back in the '60s and when you have a progressive tax rate system. Your tax rate, you know, let's say, from zero to $75,000 may be ten percent or 15 percent, et cetera. But once you get to, like, the tippy tops— on your 10 millionth dollar— sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: What you are talking about, just big picture, is a radical agenda — compared to the way politics is done right now."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Well, I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country. Abraham Lincoln made the radical decision to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. Franklin Delano Roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like Social Security."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: Do you call yourself a radical?"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. You know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical."}
{"original": "She doesn't seem to be viewed as a radical by her constituents in New York 14 – the racially diverse, liberal, and reliably Democratic congressional district that includes parts of Queens and the Bronx. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx. Her parents had met in Puerto Rico. Her father owned a small architectural business. Her mother cleaned houses to help make ends meet. By the time she was ready for preschool, her parents had made a downpayment on a small house in the Westchester suburbs. It was 30 miles and a world away from her extended family still living in the bronx."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: What was it that— that brought your parents here?"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Schools. Yeah. My—my mom wanted to make sure that I had— a solid chance and a solid education."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: Did you feel like you were living in two different worlds? 'Cause you were spending a lot of time in the Bronx with your family—"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. And just growing up that way and with my cousins, who were all my age too, feeling like we all had kind of different opportunities, depending on where we were physically located."}
{"original": "She did well in school, and with the help of scholarships, loans and financial aid, attended Boston University. But in her sophomore year, her father died of cancer."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: We were really working on the classic American dream. And overnight it was all taken away. My mom was back to cleaning homes and driving school buses to keep a roof over our heads."}
{"original": "She moved back to the Bronx after graduating college and spent the next few years working as a community organizer and advocate for children's literacy. In May of 2017, the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her boyfriend became her makeshift campaign headquarters as she launched a seemingly improbable run for Congress. She was working as a waitress and bartender at the time. Like many members of her generation, she says, she had student loans to pay and no health insurance."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I really understood the frustration that working people had across the political spectrum. When anybody is saying, The economy is going great. We are at record levels. There's a frustration that says, Well, the economy's good for who?"}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: I mean unemployment is at record lows."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I don't think that that tells the whole story. When you can't provide for your kids working a full-time job, working two full-time jobs. When you can't have healthcare. That is not — that is not dignified."}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez is sworn in as a U.S. Congresswoman"}
{"original": "A group of Bernie Sanders supporters who now call themselves Justice Democrats encouraged Ocasio-Cortez to run for office and gave her training and support. She built a grass-roots coalition that took on the Democratic machine by going door to door arguing that she could represent the district better than a ten-term incumbent who spent most of his time in Washington."}
{"original": "Her victory made national news, and she soon had a higher media profile than many veteran lawmakers. Some saw in her primary victory a craving for change within the Democratic Party. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi drew a more limited conclusion:"}
{"original": "Nancy Pelosi at press conference: They made a choice in one district, so let's not get yourself carried away"}
{"original": "But President Trump rarely missed a chance to suggest that all Democrats were socialists who'd lead the country to ruin."}
{"original": "President Trump at rally in Nevada: Venezuela, Venezuela how does that sound? You like Venezuela?"}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: When people hear the word socialism, they think Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela. Is that what you have in mind?"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Of course (LAUGH) not. What we have in mind— and what of my— and my policies most closely re— resemble what we see in the U.K., in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: How are you going to pay for all of this?"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No one asks how we're gonna pay for this Space Force. No one asked how we paid for a $2 trillion tax cut. We only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, healthcare and education. How do we pay for it? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this Space Force. For all of these— ambitious policies."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: There are Democrats, obviously, who are worried about your affect on the party. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, said about left-leaning Democrats, If the next two years is just a race to offer increasingly unrealistic proposals, it'll be difficult for us to make a credible case we should be allowed to govern again."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: What makes it unrealistic?"}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: How to pay for it."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: We pay more per capita in health care and education for lower outcomes than many other nations. And so for me, what's unrealistic is— is what we're living in right now."}
{"original": "Since the election, some conservative media outlets have focused on Ocasio-Cortez with an intensity unusual for a rookie member of Congress."}
{"original": "The president certainly didn't invent racism. But he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things."}
{"original": "She's been accused of being dishonest about the true cost of her proposals and the tax burden they would impose on the middle class. She's also been criticized for making factual mistakes."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: One of the criticisms of you is that— that your math is fuzzy. The Washington Post recently awarded you four Pinocchios—"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Oh my goodness—"}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: —for misstating some statistics about Pentagon spending?"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: If people want to really blow up one figure here or one word there, I would argue that they're missing the forest for the trees. I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: But being factually correct is important—"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's absolutely important. And whenever I make a mistake. I say, Okay, this was clumsy. and then I restate what my point was. But it's— it's not the same thing as— as the president lying about immigrants. It's not the same thing, at all."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: You don't talk about President Trump very much."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No. Because I think he's a symptom of a problem."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: What do you mean?"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The president certainly didn't invent racism. But he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: Do you believe President Trump is a racist?"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. Yeah. No question."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: How can you say that?"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: (CHUCKLE) When you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy. When you look at how he reacted to the Charlottesville incident, where neo-Nazis murdered a woman, versus how he manufactures crises like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders, it's— it's night and day."}
{"original": "In response, the deputy White House press secretary said, Cong. Ocasio-Cortez's sheer ignorance on the matter can't cover the fact that President Trump supported and passed historic criminal justice reform… and ... has repeatedly condemned racism and bigotry in all forms."}
{"original": "One of the few things Ocasio-Cortez has in common with the president is an active and often combative presence on social media. When a conservative writer tweeted this photo of her, saying, That jacket and coat don't look like a girl who struggles, she called him out for what she said was misogyny."}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Would you be taking a creep shot of Steny Hoyer's behind and sharing it around? Why is there more comfort in doing that to me than there is in doing it to— any other member of Congress?"}
{"original": "Eliminating the influence of corporate money in politics is another one of Ocasio-Cortez's signature issues. Most of her campaign funds came from small donations of $200 or less. She did accept some money from labor unions, but she refuses to take any contributions from corporate political action committees. She's angered some of her colleagues in the House by encouraging primary challenges of Democrats who accept corporate money or oppose progressive policies."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: These are politically dangerous tactics that you're using..."}
{"original": "Anderson Cooper: Do you believe it?"}
{"original": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's absolutely risky. it requires risk to try something new, but also we— we know so much of— of what we've tried in the past hasn't worked, either."}

{"original": "Freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez backs the idea of a Green New Deal for the U.S., a plan popular in progressive policy circles under which the federal government would pour billions of dollars into renewable energy. How would the New York Democrat help fund such a costly program? Raise taxes on the rich to their highest level since 1980, just before Ronald Reagan started hacking rates."}
{"original": "The top tax on the wealthy should rise to as high as 70 percent, Ocasio-Cortez told 60 Minutes on Sunday. That approach stands in stark contrast to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which gave the lion's share of benefits from reducing federal income tax rates to top earners and corporations. Not surprisingly, conservatives are bashing Ocasio-Cortez' ideas. Americans for Tax Reform founder Grover Norquist wrote on Fox News that her soaking the rich plan is the opening shot in a renewed war against middle class taxpayers."}
{"original": "Raising the so-called marginal tax rate on the rich would mark a return to the more progressive tax structure of the 1950s and 1960s -- under Presidents Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, for instance, the rate on those in the top bracket topped 90 percent."}
{"original": "Here's what you should know about Ocasio-Cortez's plan and how higher tax rates would work."}
{"original": "It's about higher marginal rates -- not a flat rate"}
{"original": "Rep. Steve Scalise, R.-Louisiana, tweeted that Ocasio-Cortez's approach would lead to the government taking away 70% of your income. Yet that comment misleadingly suggests that every dollar earned by taxpayers would be docked at a flat 70 percent -- that isn't what Ocasio-Cortez is proposing."}
{"original": "Republicans: Let Americans keep more of their own hard-earned money"}
{"original": "Democrats: Take away 70% of your income and give it to leftist fantasy programs https://t.co/NxJPSCqvrt — Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) January 5, 2019"}
{"original": "Her plan focuses on marginal tax rates, a progressive tax system that's the basis of the U.S. tax code. It works by taxing the lowest amount of income at the lowest tax rate, and then increasing it gradually as a person's income rises. The goal is to tax lower earners at lower rates, while assessing higher rates on wealthier Americans."}
{"original": "Sometimes lost in the criticism of Ocasio-Cortez' plan is the fact that higher marginal rates are paid only on each dollar earned above a particular tax bracket. For instance, single Americans now pay at a rate of 10 percent on earnings up to $9,525, while any earnings between $9,526 and $38,700 are taxed at 12 percent."}
{"original": "Currently, the top rate for single taxpayers kicks in at 37 percent for every dollar earned over $500,000 in annual income."}
{"original": "Jacking up the top tax rate likely wouldn't impact you"}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez doesn't favor imposing a 70 percent tax on the merely rich. Rather, that rate would be for people with annual income of at least $10 million or so. That's why it's not likely to hit your wallet -- only the top 0.1 percent of income earners are likely to come close to that, as this group enjoys average adjusted gross income of $7.3 million. And only 140,000 tax filers make this much money, compared with nearly 70 million who make up the bottom 50 percent of earners."}
{"original": "The economy still grew when tax rates were high"}
{"original": "The U.S. economy boomed in the '50s and '60s when, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the top rate ranged between 70 percent and 92 percent. Of course, no time periods in economic history are directly comparable. In the post-World War II era, for instance, the baby boom drove massive spending on the housing market and productivity was much higher than it is today."}
{"original": "But the point is that higher top marginal tax rates don't appear to cause lower economic growth."}
{"original": "Other developed countries have high tax rates"}
{"original": "Several advanced economies around the world have top tax rates approaching what Ocasio-Cortez favors, and by many measures they enjoy higher standards of living than the U.S."}
{"original": "What we have in mind ... and my policies most closely resemble what we see in the U.K., in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden, she told 60 Minutes."}
{"original": "Sweden has a top rate of 70 percent, Matt Bruenig, founder of People's Policy Project, a left-leaning advocacy group wrote in Jacobin magazine. Sweden is ranked No. 11 by the Social Progress Imperative, which looks at the capacity for a country to meet basic human needs. The U.S. ranks No. 25, just below Portugal."}
{"original": "A threat to the profit motive?"}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez's plan echoes findings by economists including Nobel laureate Peter Diamond and Berkeley professor Emmanuel Saez, who estimated that the ideal marginal tax rate should be 73 percent. Most other economists (including many conservative and pro-business experts) agree that a fair and productive society includes some form of progressive tax system, even if they vary in their calculations of what that should be."}
{"original": "But what about the argument that high tax rates dissuade people from working? After all, if Uncle Sam is going to take most of your income, why bother working at all? But that may be looking at the wrong question. Higher taxes on every dollar earned above $10 million isn't likely to lower multimillionaires' drive to remain rich (though it could arguably encourage them to seek ways to avoid taxes)."}
{"original": "Perhaps a more relevant question: Whether the tax system could encourage people to enter lower-paying yet socially useful jobs, such as teaching or scientific research. One study found that a radical policy of imposing taxes according to professions -- such as providing tax breaks to teachers while imposing higher taxes on hedge fund managers -- could grow the economy dramatically, its authors wrote in the Harvard Business Review."}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez didn't address such ideas, but her goal in taxing the extremely rich at higher levels is to guarantee a job for every American at a fair wage. When you can't provide for your kids working a full-time job, working two full-time jobs. When you can't have health care. That is not -- that is not dignified, Ocasio-Cortez said."}
{"original": "With U.S. auto sales barreling along at or near record levels just about every month lately, what could go wrong? Well, people could stop buying new vehicles. Or to some observers something even more worrying could happen: Americans might stop paying back their auto loans."}
{"original": "And here, the statistics are concerning. Fitch Ratings reports that the number of consumers who had fallen seriously delinquent -- 90 days or more behind -- on their car payments hit a 20-year high in February. But they fell in March. Good news, right?"}
{"original": "Actually, Fitch warns that the reprieve won't last because of the growth in subprime auto lending, that is, loans made to buyers with the lowest credit quality. You remember what happened to all those subprime home loans several years ago? Well, that's why some on Wall Street are wondering if the auto sector is headed for carmageddon."}
{"original": "Fitch did an analysis of loans that were bundled into asset-backed securities (ABS) to be resold to investors and found that those serious delinquencies slipped to 4.15 percent last month from 5.16 percent in February. The ratings agency said the drop-off was due to several factors, including borrowers using tax refunds to pay off debts along with seasonal trends typically seen in Fitch's Auto ABS Indices."}
{"original": "Pressure from weaker underwriting standards in 2013-2015 transactions will continue to negatively affect the indices in 2016 irrespective of seasonal trends, Fitch said. Increased lending to borrowers with weak or limited credit history will move delinquency and loss frequency levels higher."}
{"original": "That's why subprime loans are so worrisome. According to data from Experian, 10.7 percent of all new car loans of went to subprime borrowers as of the fourth quarter of 2015, the latest data that's available. The rate in the year-earlier period was 10.08 percent."}
{"original": "Average credit scores for new loans are about 711, a decrease from their peak of 736 in 2009. Wells Fargo (WFC) estimates that the default rate rose to 12.3 percent in January, the highest since 2010, from 11.3 percent in December."}
{"original": "Even so, some auto industry analysts, such as Charles Chesbrough of IHS Auto, remain bullish on the sector. He expects to sales hit a record 17.8 million this year compared with 17.5 million last year."}
{"original": "There is some concern that delinquencies are up, he said. However, some of the increase may be explained by the fact there is more subprime lending, and these borrowers always have more delinquencies than higher-tiered buyers."}
{"original": "A robust job market, cheap gas and low interest rates will fuel demand for vehicles and negate concerns that the auto market might implode like housing did a few years ago in the run-up to the Great Recession, according to Chesbrough."}
{"original": "Still, lenders aren't only willing to make loans to less creditworthy borrowers, they're also extending loan payback periods far beyond the typical 48 months. J.D. Power & Associates shows in the most recent quarter that loans of 72 months or longer accounted for more than 33 percent of sales, continuing the growth seen over the past few years."}
{"original": "As of the most recent quarter, 31.3 percent of all car owners owe more on their cars than the cars are worth, also referred to as being underwater or having negative equity. This may make it difficult for consumers to trade in cars when they go back into the market in a few years. It's something to be monitored, said Deidre Borrego, a senior vice president at J.D. Power."}
{"original": "And if they default on their current auto loan, good luck trying to get another one."}
{"original": "Last year, California set the most ambitious energy goal in the nation: reaching 100 percent renewable energy in just over 25 years. This year, as many as 13 other states are rearing to join it."}
{"original": "While the federal government seeks to roll back climate-change regulation, state politicians -- many, though not all, Democrats with newfound majorities -- are signaling they won't wait for the feds to reverse course again."}
{"original": "Despite the fact that this isn't going to happen on the federal level, there are places around the country, in a lot of the most populated states, where people want this, said Mark Morgenstein, a spokesman for Environment America."}
{"original": "Environment America has launched a campaign calling out nine states to become 100 percent renewable by 2050. Several other states are already on their way toward reaching that goal. Together, they represent 42 percent of the U.S. population and more than a quarter of its economic output."}
{"original": "The push for state legislation comes as renewable energy is growing overall, spurred by consumer demand and favorable economics. By 2050, if no new laws are passed, 31 percent of U.S. electricity will come from renewable sources, according to the Energy Information Administration."}

{"original": "Massachusetts, by many measures the bluest state in the U.S., started work last year on the country's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm and plans to double its wind generation in the next two years. Lawmakers in both houses of the legislature have introduced bills to make the state's power 100 percent renewable by 2045."}
{"original": "New Jersey has taken a series of aggressive climate steps since the 2017 election of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. The state adopted a goal last year of 50 percent renewable electricity and is in the process of creating an Energy Master Plan, which environmentalists hope will push renewables further."}
{"original": "Washington came close to becoming the first state to tax carbon last year. A bill introduced this year aims to eliminate coal within six years, require 80 percent clean utilities five years after that and make all electricity carbon-free."}
{"original": "Washington has a leg up as the nation's top producer of hydroelectric power, which accounts for two-thirds of all electricity generated in the state. Last year's wildfires across the Northwest also mean the state is deeply familiar with the effects of climate change."}
{"original": "Former coal producers: Pennsylvania and Illinois"}
{"original": "Pennsylvania is the fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the country (after Texas, California and Florida). The state's economy, until a few decades ago, relied largely on coal. In recent years, it has become a lead generator of natural gas, a coal replacement that still creates carbon emissions, but on a smaller scale."}
{"original": "That's why its recent about-face on clean energy is notable. Last year, a Republican legislator led a bill to put the state on a path to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050. Another Republican is set to introduce it sometime this month, according to PennEnvironment, a state environmental group. The group is hopeful this will be the year it passes."}
{"original": "We're not California. We're not Hawaii, said David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment. When you have a purple state that Trump won, where the general assembly is dominated by conservative Republicans, it's significant and shows that other states with a history of fossil fuel production can lead the way."}
{"original": "Illinois' statehouse is far bluer than Pennsylvania's, but the state is just as dependent on coal. The country's sixth most populated state, it still gets nearly two-thirds of its energy from fossil fuels."}
{"original": "But the new Democratic governor, J.B. Pritzker, has signaled a change in direction. Last week he signed on to the U.S. Climate Alliance, a pact that commits the 18 states in it to the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which the U.S. exited in 2017. Pritzker also campaigned on a goal of 100 percent clean energy."}
{"original": "Solid blue states: Colorado, Maine, New Mexico, New York"}
{"original": "All four of these states have newly elected Democratic trifectas, in which the party controls both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion -- and they're pushing for an energy overhaul."}
{"original": "In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis has set the most ambitious target of any state -- going to 100 percent renewable energy by 2040, a full five years earlier than California and Hawaii. A recent study found that consumers would save $250 million if the state achieves that goal. Colorado's largest utilty, Xcel Energy, last month promised to go carbon-free by 2050, a move it a said was motivated by customers who are asking for it."}
{"original": "Consumers look to their utilities to be good citizens, and that includes protection of the climate, said Andrew Heath, senior director of the utilities practice at J.D. Power. When utilities announce they're shifting to renewable energy -- whether it's a response to law or on their own initiative -- it's met favorably, he added."}
{"original": "Maine is already the top wind-power producer in New England, and new Gov. Janet Mills offers the strongest contrast with her Republican predecessor. Former Gov. Paul LePage routinely drew criticism for his anti-environment moves, including quashing bipartisan pro-solar legislation and putting a moratorium on new wind turbine development."}
{"original": "On her inauguration, Mills set a goal to have 80 percent of the state's electricity come from renewable energy sources. Another Maine legislator is already leading the push for a Green New Deal in Maine, which would make the state's energy entirely renewable by 2030."}
{"original": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called for 100 percent clean energy by 2040, a plan that would require boosting the state's solar, wind, hydroelectric and nuclear resources. The state legislature, which is Democrat-controlled for the first time in 10 years, must approve his plan by April 1."}
{"original": "And New Mexico is eyeing a goal of 80 percent renewable electricity by 2040, which Environment America calls a first step to being 100 percent renewable."}
{"original": "Great Lakes states: Michigan and Minnesota"}
{"original": "Both these states have Republican-controlled legislatures and Democratic governors, and they have a higher-than-average reliance on coal (getting 36 percent and 41 percent of all electricity from it, respectively). Minnesota environmental groups, in addition to pushing for 100-percent renewability by 2030, are seeking a moratorium on new pipelines in the state. Those in Michigan have set 2050 as the target date."}
{"original": "Both states have a higher-than-average reliance on nuclear power (as do others on this list, like Pennsylvania and Illinois), which is excluded from the planned legislation -- and that could be a problem when it comes to emissions."}
{"original": "Nuclear power has divided environmentalists because, while it emits no carbon, it isn't renewable and has the potential to cause massive devastation. Many clean-energy groups favor phasing out nuclear, but doing so makes it harder to reduce emissions."}
{"original": "What we're starting to see is [renewable-energy requirements] are increasing market pressure on nuclear power plants, and the emissions increase from the loss of those plants offsets the gain in renewable energy, said Whitney Herndon, a senior analyst at Rhodium."}
{"original": "She added: In order to get the emissions benefit, you really want an increase in renewables, plus keeping the existing nuclear power there."}
{"original": "In 2018, you may resolve to save more , spend less or budget better . Whatever your money goal, the one common key to your success is shopping smart. That means knowing the best time to buy just about anything."}
{"original": "To help you out, we've created a purchase calendar to help you plan your shopping for the year."}
{"original": "With a fresh page on the calendar comes a fresh start for sales. These products are discounted in January :"}
{"original": "—BEDDING AND LINENS. Department stores hold bedding and linen white sales in January with deep discounts on sheets and towels."}
{"original": "—FITNESS EQUIPMENT. Retailers know you want to get in shape. Expect fitness equipment and apparel sales to abound at sporting goods stores."}
{"original": "—TVs AND ELECTRONICS. Just before the Super Bowl, retailers normally discount their selections of HDTVs and other home-theater essentials."}
{"original": "It's the month of love and gift-giving, but February might be a better time to buy major items for yourself than trinkets for your loved one. Options include:"}
{"original": "—TVs. TV sales spill over from January into February. Aside from Black Friday, this is one of the prime times to buy a new TV."}
{"original": "—WINTER PRODUCTS. With winter winding down, stores will be looking to unload their inventories of cold-weather products. Look for sales on apparel and winter sporting accessories."}
{"original": "—HOME GOODS. Presidents Day is Feb. 19 this year. Expect retailers to have home and apparel sales on that Monday and the weekend preceding the holiday."}
{"original": "There aren't any major shopping holidays in March, but that doesn't mean sales are lacking. Look for sales on these products:"}
{"original": "—GOLF CLUBS. Expect to find discounts on golf clubs in preparation for summer. Whenever consumer demand is down, prices usually are, too."}
{"original": "—GRILLS. Buy your summer grilling necessities in March to avoid the spike in prices that will come when summer arrives."}
{"original": "—ST. PATRICK'S DAY ESSENTIALS. St. Patrick's Day is March 17. Around that time, online retailers and department stores usually discount their selection of green-themed clothing, party supplies and jewelry."}
{"original": "April has its fair share of spring deals and discounts, including:"}
{"original": "—VACUUMS. Buying a vacuum isn't the most exciting purchase, but it'll be less painful if you take advantage of a spring cleaning sale. Look for these at department stores as well as manufacturers like Dyson."}
{"original": "—JEWELRY. The general rule is to avoid buying jewelry close to major holidays. Try to get a good deal when jewelers have a slower period and may be more motivated to make sales."}
{"original": "—FREEBIES. Year after year, retailers and restaurants try to lighten the burden of tax day with discounts and freebies. Keep an eye out for these around mid-April. Tax day this year is April 17."}
{"original": "April showers bring May flowers — and sales blossom then, too. Here's a look at some products to consider buying this month:"}
{"original": "—SPRING CLEANING NECESSITIES. Before summer arrives, act on spring cleaning discounts on vacuums and mops."}
{"original": "—SMALL KITCHEN APPLIANCES. Use May discounts as a perfect opportunity to buy small kitchen appliances, such as coffee makers and blenders. These products normally are included in Memorial Day sales."}
{"original": "—FURNITURE. Three of the biggest blowout shopping days are Black Friday, Labor Day and Memorial Day. This year, Memorial Day is May 28. Look for plenty of furniture and home-decor discounts from big-box stores."}
{"original": "June may be one of the shorter months of the year, but its supply of shopping events isn't lacking. Smart purchases include these products:"}
{"original": "—LINGERIE. Stock up on undergarments in June. That's when Victoria's Secret has been known to host its famed Semi-Annual Sale. The sale usually occurs in December also."}
{"original": "—GYM MEMBERSHIPS. Consider buying a gym membership during the summer, and don't forget to negotiate to get the best possible deal. Gyms may be more eager for sign-ups at this time."}
{"original": "—GIFTS FOR DAD. You don't have to buy dad's gift at full price. Expect Father's Day deals this month, especially the closer you get to the holiday on June 17."}
{"original": "The temperature usually rises in July, but the prices of certain products drop. Consider buying these items this month:"}
{"original": "—APPAREL. If you don't want to wait for end-of-summer sales, buy clothes in midsummer. You'll likely find a better price than you would at the start of the season."}
{"original": "—PATRIOTIC ITEMS. Retailers like a reason to celebrate. In the days leading up to the Fourth of July, there is usually an abundance of sales on red, white and blue products (and products that are all three colors), as well as on sporting goods, jewelry and furniture."}
{"original": "—PERSONAL ELECTRONICS. Black Friday is a big deal day that falls in November, but many retailers have begun hosting Black Friday in July sales, including Best Buy and Amazon. Expect discounts in nearly every product category."}
{"original": "Close out summer by buying summer products? That's right. Look for end-of-season clearance sales in August:"}
{"original": "—BACK-TO-SCHOOL SUPPLIES. The start of school marks the need to buy small items such as pencils and expensive ones like laptops. Generally, the closer to the start of the school year you buy, the better your chances of getting a good price."}
{"original": "—LAWN MOWERS. Ride out the end of summer with a big deal on lawn mowers and other seasonal outdoor equipment."}
{"original": "—SWIMSUITS. There may not be many swimming days left by the time August rolls around, but that's exactly why swimsuit clearance sales will crest. Buy your swimsuits now to stock up for next year."}
{"original": "With deals on items as varied as electronics and back-to-school supplies, September is a surprising month for good buys. Pick up reasonable prices in these departments:"}
{"original": "—MATTRESSES. Year after year, September is the time for mattress sales. Expect these from department stores and mattress centers, usually as a part of Labor Day deals."}
{"original": "—IPHONES. Apple has been known to announce its new iPhone installments at the company's annual keynote in September. Usually, the unveiling is followed by a drop in prices on the current phones in anticipation of the new models."}
{"original": "—APPLIANCES. This year, Labor Day falls on Sept. 3. Expect a series of blowout deals in the week leading up to the holiday, including promotions on appliances big and small."}
{"original": "Don't let the cost of shopping spook you during the Halloween season. There will be plenty of deals on these product categories in October:"}
{"original": "—OUTDOOR FURNITURE. People generally spend less time outdoors when the temperature drops. Expect deals on patio furniture and outdoor living products when summer ends."}
{"original": "—JEANS. Fall inventory arrives in stores in August and September, but you'll pay top dollar unless you wait a few weeks. October is a great time to buy a new pair of jeans."}
{"original": "—CANDY. The closer you get to Oct. 31, the better your chance at snagging a discounted bag of candy for your trick-or-treaters."}
{"original": "November is the month for Black Friday sales, which means some of the most popular tech products fall to their lowest prices:"}
{"original": "—TABLETS AND LAPTOPS. Electronics take center stage during Black Friday sales. Look for discounts on smartphones and activity trackers, too."}
{"original": "—GAMING SYSTEMS. Black Friday is the best time to buy a discounted gaming console or gaming system bundle like Xbox or PlayStation."}
{"original": "—HOME APPLIANCES. Reserve your major home appliance purchase — refrigerator, washer, dryer, dishwasher, etc. — for Black Friday deals. Often, sales on these can be found throughout the month."}
{"original": "The end of the year is just the beginning for discounts in some product categories. Look for sale prices on these products in December:"}
{"original": "—TOYS. Since toys are a popular Christmas gift, stores generally host big toy sales as the holiday season draws to a close."}
{"original": "—CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS. Beginning the day after Christmas, shop sales for deep discounts — often upward of 50 percent — on decorations, wrapping paper, ornaments, artificial trees and similar seasonal fixings."}
{"original": "—CARS. The end of December is an ideal time to buy a car. That's when dealerships are looking to meet end-of-year sales quotas."}

{"original": "NerdWallet: What to buy (and skip) in January"}
{"original": "Roughly 1 in 5 Americans in a live-in relationship keeps a checking, savings or credit card account hidden from their spouse or partner. That adds up to 29 million people whose financial secrets could plague their love lives, according to a CreditCards.com report."}
{"original": "Secret accounts are most common among millennials, 28 percent of whom are currently hiding bank or credit cards from their live-in partners, the study shows."}
{"original": "More than half of the people surveyed likened keeping financial secrets to physical infidelity, qualifying it as at least equal in severity to physical cheating."}
{"original": "I think it's very damaging from a trust standpoint and also from a dollars and cents standpoint, said CreditCard.com industry analyst Ted Rossman. If a secret account includes credit card debt, that's a meaningful chunk out of the household budget."}
{"original": "Be upfront about separate spending, freedom funds"}
{"original": "Rossman added there's nothing wrong with couples keeping their finances separate, but it's important to be upfront about it. Communication about money is so important in a relationship, he explained. It's hard enough to reach big financial goals when you're on the same page. It's really almost impossible when you're not on the same page."}
{"original": "In the best-case scenario, someone might keep a pool of money secret in order to surprise their spouse with a vacation, or anniversary present. On the other end of the spectrum, a husband or wife could be using the secret account to finance an affair. Someone would have a credit card they use to go to hotels, travel, and buy them gifts, Rosman said."}
{"original": "So-called freedom funds are common, too, among people who aren't sure their relationships will last. They will say, This is mine if this relationship doesn't work out, that's what I will take to try to start over,'  Rossman said."}
{"original": "Digital banking tools vs. the dangers of household mail"}
{"original": "San Francisco financial planner Sarah Behr says financial deception is symptomatic of deeper fissures in a relationship."}
{"original": "You don't feel like your goals are aligned and either one or both people don't necessarily feel like they can be candid, she said. Being secretive about debt or other issues gets at the core of trust in the same way infidelity can when you find out that someone has been spending a lot without telling you, or created some mess you are both on the hook for."}
{"original": "She said her first marriage crumbled after her then-husband repeatedly misspent funds — on mountain bikes and fly fishing equipment -- that the couple agreed they would not put towards recreation and leisure. I lost trust in his ability to spend wisely, she said."}
{"original": "Digital banking tools have made it increasingly easy to hide this kind of spending. One thing to watch out for, though, is a partner who intercepts household mail."}
{"original": "Some things are required by law to go snail mail so you would have to get to the mailbox and make sure you cut it off and then suppress everything to paperless billing, Behr said."}
{"original": "Credit checks before wedding bells ring"}
{"original": "Other financial advisers suggest credit and background checks of your romantic partner before tying the knot."}
{"original": "If you are married you would be liable for anything the other person has, including tax debt, credit card debt and student loans, said New York City financial planner Brian Walls. They could rack up credit card debt without the other one knowing. They could do some damage."}
{"original": "There's no right or wrong way for a couple to manage their finances, but secrecy is corrosive and damaging when it comes to money."}
{"original": "If someone finds out about their partner's account when they are trusting they are on the same page, it would create a really big rift in that trust going forward if someone is doing stuff behind their back, said Dallas certified financial planner Katie Brewer."}
{"original": "The best way for a couple to manage their finance is whatever way allows them to stay married, she added."}
{"original": "Stocks suffered a second straight day of punishing losses, briefly shutting down markets amid growing concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus. The Dow closed down 2,353 points, a 10% loss for the day. That marked the biggest single-day percentage decline for the index since the infamous Black Monday crash on October 10, 1987, when stocks tumbled 23%."}
{"original": "Investor were pummeled early on Thursday when the S&P 500 fell 8% only minutes after markets opened, temporarily halting activity. The index has three circuit breakers that kick in when stocks decline by 7%, 13% or 20% in a single trading session. It's the second trading halt this week, following a rout on Monday. The measures were first adopted after the 1987 crash, and until this week hadn't been tripped since 1997."}
{"original": "We're starting to get a sense of how dire the impact on the economy is going to be, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, alluding to efforts to contain the virus. Each day the news doesn't get better, it gets worse. It's now has hit Main Street to a more significant degree."}
{"original": "Although stocks briefly revived in the afternoon when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York moved to provide more short-term funding to lenders, markets quickly thudded lower. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell more than 9%."}
{"original": "Both the Dow and S&P 500 are now in a bear market, meaning both indexes have fallen more than 20% below their peak last month. That has brought the record-long bull run that started in 2009 after the Great Recession to a screeching halt."}
{"original": "The plunge also suggests investors found little comfort in President Donald Trump's pledge in a Wednesday night speech to offer help to businesses and consumers, according to Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco."}
{"original": "Markets reacted negatively to what was perceived as a solemn but confused speech that placed blame on other nations, omitted to focus on immediate actions to relieve the most affected individuals, and lacked in concrete fiscal and health measures to address the economic and financial impact of the virus, he told investors in a research note."}
{"original": "The ban on travel from Europe to the U.S. for the next 30 days will deliver a massive hit to the travel and tourism industries in the U.S., Daco said. About 10 million visitors come from Europe to visit the U.S. each month."}
{"original": "Travel stocks fell sharply on Thursday, with American Airlines tumbling 17%, Delta shedding 21% and United Airlines sliding 25%. Hotel chain Marriott declined 6%, while travel-booking site Expedia lost 15%."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump's fiscal approach to blunting the impact of the coronavirus is also raising questions on Wall Street. Part of his plan is a recommendation that the Treasury delay the April 15 tax filing deadline, which would provide relief to taxpayers who owe the IRS."}
{"original": "A tax deadline delay may not help the workers who most need relief, given that taxpayers who typically owe the IRS are higher-income households, Daco pointed out. About 80% of taxes owed to the IRS stem from workers who earn more than $100,000 per year, while 50% are owed by people who earn more than $250,000."}
{"original": "There's also concern that a delay in the April 15 tax deadline could result in a delay in tax refunds, which many low- and middle-income taxpayers count on, according to Height Securities."}
{"original": "There is a concern among tax policy experts we have spoken with that a delay in tax filings could also delay the issuance of tax refund checks, which represent a significant source of income for many Americans, Height Securities noted."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump's measures failed to mention some of the remedies that investors believe could provide targeted relief to those most hurt by the disease, Daco said."}
{"original": "Financial markets were disappointed by the absence of concrete measures targeted at the most affected populations including paid sick leave, enhanced unemployment insurance, free coronavirus testing, enhanced supplemental assistance programs, and support for health care workers, he noted."}
{"original": "The Associated Press contributed to this report."}
{"original": "As workers in their 50s and 60s transition into their retirement years, they face several important planning decisions. But which ones will have the most impact on their finances?"}
{"original": "You might think that finding the very best investments or minimizing taxes are really important. However, those would be the wrong answers for many middle-income workers."}
{"original": "Instead, check out a new study by the Stanford Center on Longevity (SCL), in collaboration with the Society of Actuaries (SOA). It demonstrates that the most important decisions for older, middle-income workers are:"}
{"original": "Deciding when to leave the paid workforce and whether to work part time for a period until full retirement."}
{"original": "Deciding when to start Social Security benefits, which most workers can maximize by delaying."}
{"original": "Determining whether to use retirement savings to enable delaying Social Security benefits (if you retire before you start your Social Security benefits)."}
{"original": "Managing and reducing living expenses, specifically housing, transportation and medical costs."}
{"original": "Deciding whether to move or deploy home equity to help finance retirement, given that many workers have more net wealth in their home equity compared to retirement savings."}
{"original": "For the purposes of this list, middle-income workers are people with less than $1 million in retirement savings, which defines millions of older workers."}
{"original": "Two other recent studies confirm the conclusions from this one. United Income recently measured the financial impact of various retirement planning decisions. According to Matt Fellowes, one of the study's authors and CEO and co-founder of United Income, the three most important ones are (in order):"}
{"original": "Selecting your retirement date. Deciding on the asset allocation for your retirement savings. Deciding when to claim Social Security benefits."}
{"original": "Said Fellowes: The mistake that many retirees make is investing too conservatively without recognizing Social Security and other sources of guaranteed retirement income. They're leaving a lot of retirement income on the table by not investing a significant portion of their savings in equities."}
{"original": "The United Income study found that making more effective decisions in these areas had the potential to generate seven times more wealth than reducing investment costs by 100 basis points (which is the same as increasing the net rate of return on savings by 1 percent per year)."}
{"original": "Fellowes observed that the study's priority order applies more to affluent investors. For middle-income workers, deciding when to claim Social Security benefits would rank first."}
{"original": "The SCL/SOA report confirms Fellowes' observations. SCL/SOA estimates that if a middle-income retiree optimizes Social Security income, it will deliver approximately two-thirds to more than 80 percent of total retirement income. Since Social Security benefits are protected against stock market crashes, that can help justify investing up to 100 percent of a worker's retirement savings in the stock market."}
{"original": "However, many retirees may be reluctant to devote such a high proportion of their savings to stocks, so a typical target-date or balanced fund could also work well."}
{"original": "A third recent research paper titled The Power of Working Longer specifically estimated the financial impact of not retiring as soon as possible. One analysis found that delaying retirement by three to six months had the same impact on your retirement standard of living as saving an additional 1 percent of salary for 30 years."}
{"original": "Another key observation of the SCL/SOA report was that many middle-income retirees will be in very low income tax brackets when they retire, for two reasons. First, part or all of any Social Security benefits they receive will be excluded from taxable income. Second, many retirees will have modest incomes to supplement Social Security, so their total taxable income will be quite low."}
{"original": "As a result, strategies to minimize income taxes should take a back seat to the key financial decisions listed above. This conclusion is based on the tax rates that applied in 2017 and will be even more applicable under the new tax law."}
{"original": "These studies can help you decide how best to focus your time and energy to make the biggest impact on your standard of living in retirement. When you reach your 70s and 80s in good financial shape, you'll be glad you spent the time now making careful planning decisions."}
{"original": "A year ago, Lauri Deason said her career as a screenwriter and producer was nearing a breakthrough. She and her husband, who own their own production company, were on the verge of signing a deal to create a series of films. She had recently finished graduate school and was teaching film to college students."}
{"original": "I was really right there, on the summit, and as I was planting the flag, here comes COVID, she recalled."}
{"original": "As the pandemic swept across the country, the deal fell through and Deason's freelance clients dried up. Because her family's income essentially evaporated within weeks, her husband returned to work in his prior career in aviation, where he's picked up work as a pilot for charter flights and delivering everything from COVID-19 tests to mail. While that's helped them regain some income, it's also placed most of the household duties on Deason, such as helping their 10-year-old daughter with remote schooling."}
{"original": "I'm more educated than he is; I have a master's degree, she reflected. But he can still make more than I can. The economics fall on him, the rest falls on me."}
{"original": "Deason, who lives in Glendale, California, is just one of millions of women whose careers have been upended since the pandemic shut down the economy a year ago. And for many women, this year's International Women's Day on March 8 may come with a sense of disappointment and irony, given the day is meant to celebrate women's achievement and the narrowing of the gender gap."}
{"original": "Just months before the pandemic hit, women had crossed a major threshold as they had become the majority of job holders in the U.S. Women in the workforce helped boost household income and also fueled the economic expansion before the pandemic. Since then, millions of women have suffered a big reversal, with nearly 3 million American women leaving the workforce, partly due to layoffs in industries that traditionally employ women, but also because of sudden demands of caretaking."}
{"original": "I remember last year being much more of a celebratory day, said AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. Monday will be a more somber day, especially on the economic side."}
{"original": "The economic pain felt by women in the past year doesn't only have implications for those individuals and their households, but the entire nation, economists have warned. If women don't return to the workforce at the rate they were employed prior to the pandemic, U.S. GDP and income would be permanently lower, the Congressional Research Service cautioned in a December research report."}
{"original": "In a statement on Monday, President Joe Biden said he is ordering the creation of the White House Gender Policy Council to ensure that every domestic and foreign policy we pursue rests on a foundation of dignity and equity for women. He added, Around the world, we are seeing decades of women's economic gains erased by this pandemic."}
{"original": "The pandemic's hit to women's careers has been hardest on women of color and low-earning women, partly because they hold a greater share of service jobs that felt a deeper impact from the pandemic, such as retail or hospitality jobs."}
{"original": "In the United States, there's a clear gender story here, but in the aggregate, it's not about white women, noted Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, in a blog post. Black and Hispanic women experienced the most significant and disproportionate job losses in the pandemic recession."}
{"original": "Vice President Kamala Harris last month described the millions of women who have left the workforce as a national emergency. The Biden administration, for its part, has included some measures that may help some women regain their economic footing, such as an expanded Child Tax Credit that would provide $3,600 for children under 6 and $3,000 for those between 6 to 17."}
{"original": "The pandemic has thrown a spotlight on long-running structural issues, ranging from lower earnings for women of color to a lack of affordable childcare across the nation. But it would be a mistake to consider these issues as problems that only impact women, said Jennifer Barrett, chief education officer at financial services company Acorns and the author of the forthcoming book Think Like a Breadwinner, which is geared toward women who want to build wealth and income."}
{"original": "But the impact of the pandemic has also been felt keenly by one group of women: Those with school-age children. With most schools switching to remote learning, parents found themselves taking on hands-on roles as educators and tech support specialists for their children. Many of those duties fell to mothers, with some reshaping their lives to handle the heavier childcare load."}
{"original": "One of those is Antonia Flynn, a voice actor, who has temporarily moved from California to her parent's home in Pennsylvania with her two children, ages 6 and 9. Because her husband, who works in television production, is often away for long periods, she needed additional backup from her parents in order to continue working on voice projects because her children are still in remote school."}
{"original": "When the pandemic wasn't going on it was hard enough to keep the home fires burning, Flynn noted. Now, cut to they are doing school at home, so basically I had to come here. It's still a juggling act, but, she added, easier than trying to juggle work and remote schooling without backup."}
{"original": "Positives could emerge from the pandemic, such as greater support for paid family leave and subsidized childcare, as well as more honest discussions between men and women about the division of household duties, experts say."}
{"original": "I truly believe that we have this opportunity right now to have these discussions to start to shift the way we think about caregiving as being uniquely suited for women, but something that everyone should and can do, Barrett noted."}
{"original": "The potential upside was stressed by veteran feminist and journalist Gloria Steinem, who spoke to CBS News about International Women's Day."}
{"original": "Studies show women have suffered more anxiety, depression and trauma during this pandemic, because we have more responsibility for others and are brought up to be more empathetic, Steinem said. On the other hand, men have been more at home with families this year, so let's hope this narrows the empathy gap."}
{"original": "Elisa Pupko, who runs a children's theatrical arts program in Brooklyn, New York, called Treasure Trunk Theater, said the pandemic has shifted her family's dynamics, with her, her husband and 3-year-old daughter spending more time together at home. For many families, Pupko added, that's opened men's eyes to how much work goes into childcare and housework."}
{"original": "If we allow ourselves to be the default parent, it's not healthy for the whole family, Pupko said. I've learned to let him know, 'Can you load the dishwasher – I have to work after dinner, because I haven't had a chance to work all day."}
{"original": "Less willing to ask for a raise"}
{"original": "The pandemic has also impacted women's behavior within the workforce, with new research from the Indeed Hiring Lab finding that women are less willing to ask for a raise than men during the crisis."}
{"original": "Certainly there has been tremendous progress in workplace equity, specially compared with the 1950s and 1960s, said Konkel of Indeed. There may be the feeling, 'I don't want to be difficult right now. Everyone is struggling, so I don't want to rock the boat, she said of the greater share of women who aren't comfortable asking for a pay hike."}
{"original": "But that could pose long-term threats to women's financial stability and ability to retire comfortably, since a missed raise could snowball into lower lifetime earnings, she noted. One potential upside, she added, is that 8 in 10 women say they're comfortable with asking for workplace flexibility, compared with 7 in 10 women prior to the pandemic."}
{"original": "Flexibility will be key to watch in the coming months or years, Konkel added. Is everyone offered flexibility or is it a select few and will that create more labor market inequalities?"}
{"original": "As for Deason, the screenwriter and producer, she said she's optimistic even though there are tough days."}
{"original": "With COVID and what has happened, that big reversal, it really feels like the end for so many women, she said. The end of my dreams, the end of equality, the reversal of everything we were fighting for."}
{"original": "But she views the crisis in screenplay terms and that women are at the point in the film where it looks like all hope is lost. Added Deason, It's not the end of the story. It's only the end if we let go of our goals."}

{"original": "The Dow closed at a record high Wednesday as investors shrugged off turmoil in Washington, D.C., that saw protesters swarm the Capitol."}
{"original": "The rally lost some momentum in afternoon trading after the U.S. Capitol building went into lockdown as supporters of President Donald Trump broke through barricades and entered the building following clashes with police. Both houses of Congress abruptly went into recess, interrupting debate over the Electoral College vote that gave Joe Biden the presidency. Earlier, Mr. Trump riled up the crowd with his baseless claims of election fraud."}
{"original": "The S&P 500 added 0.6% to finish just short of a new high at 3,748, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.6%."}
{"original": "North American equities extended gains on Wednesday despite chaos in Washington, D.C., as protestors stormed the Capitol, delaying the count of electoral ballots following a strong performance for Democrats in Georgia,'' TD Securities analysts said in a note to investors after the close of trading Wednesday."}
{"original": "Small-company stocks did especially well as investors ploughed money into businesses that would be winners if Democrats can pump even more financial stimulus into the economy amid rising expectations that the GOP may lose control of Washington."}
{"original": "The moves on Wall Street masked even bigger shifts happening underneath the surface as investors jockey to find the winners and losers of a Senate, White House and House of Representatives that may all soon be under Democratic control. The yield on the 10-year Treasury topped 1% for the first time since March, for example."}
{"original": "Stocks of companies that would profit from increased spending on infrastructure were also helping to lead the market. United Rentals, whose catalog includes forklifts and light towers for construction sites, jumped 9% for one of the bigger gains in the S&P 500. Vulcan Materials, which sells asphalt and other construction materials, rose 8.2%."}
{"original": "More fiscal support forthcoming likely means a stronger economic recovery and markets are pricing that in, said Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco. Today is the recovery trade."}
{"original": "This is just a market taking into account the likely outcomes from what happened in the election, said Andrew Mies, chief investment officer at investment advisory firm 6 Meridien. You have the recognition that the Democratic agenda is probably much more mainstream than people feared."}
{"original": "A report on Wednesday underscored how fragile the economy is because of the worsening pandemic. Payroll processor ADP said private employers cut 123,000 more jobs last month than they added. It was much worse than economists' expectations for job growth, and it was the weakest such report since April. The Labor Department's more comprehensive report on jobs growth is due on Friday."}
{"original": "The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks nevertheless surged 3.3%, much more than the rest of the market. Another round of stimulus for the economy could benefit smaller companies in particular because they tend to have smaller financial cushions to survive long-term downturns."}
{"original": "Big spending plans for the economy could trigger not only stronger growth for the economy in the future but also heavier borrowing by the U.S. government and maybe even inflation. Those factors are helping to push up Treasury yields, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.04% from 0.94% late Tuesday."}
{"original": "On the other end of the market was Big Tech. A Democratic controlled D.C. could mean tougher regulations are on the way for the group, which already has been facing increased scrutiny. Apple, the most valuable stock on Wall Street, said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that its board regularly reviews the company's antitrust risks."}
{"original": "Democratic control of Washington could also lead to higher tax rates for businesses, which would crimp profits and add downward pressure on stocks broadly."}
{"original": "Analysts caution that no big changes may ultimately come from Washington given how slim the Democratic majority may be. If the party ultimately wins the second runoff for a Georgia Senate seat, they would have a 50-50 split in the Senate with Democratic Vice President-elect Kamala Harris providing a tie-breaking vote."}
{"original": "Investors that have concerns today should probably check some of those concerns, Levitt said. The first year of this administration is going to be about providing as much support as possible to an economic recovery."}
{"original": "You've been hearing plenty of people claim that April 18 is the last day you can file your tax returns without being late. But that's not true."}
{"original": "That day is actually Oct. 16."}
{"original": "If you want to file by that later date, you'll have to notify the IRS by filing a request for a filing extension using Form 4868. But you do have only until April 18 to file a 4868. Doing so on time means you'll have an additional six months to file your federal return. Filing for a federal extension doesn't automatically extend state tax filing deadlines, so you'll also have to ask for a state extension as well."}
{"original": "Filing an extension is free. You can file by logging onto the IRS Free File service, and most states also have this feature available on their websites."}
{"original": "If you're among the millions who still haven't submitted a return by now, it's better to file for an extension instead of rushing to get it done by April 18. Here are a few reasons why:"}
{"original": "A return filed in a rush now is likely to include errors or be missing some information. For many taxpayers, it's better to file an extension, especially if you need more time to do a thorough job preparing your tax return."}
{"original": "If you need extra time to gather information, such as a missing 1099 for nonemployee compensation you earned last year."}
{"original": "If your brokerage firm typically sends corrected 1099s that include revised amounts for dividends, interest, foreign taxes paid and proceeds from investment sales. In that case, you'll need some extra time to review the corrected form 1099 before entering it on your return."}
{"original": "If you own a business or have invested in one (such as a partnership or S corporation). You typically don't receive the K-1, which reports your income from these activities, until after April, so you'll need more time to prepare a complete tax return."}
{"original": "If you have your return prepared by a tax professional and it hasn't been completed by now, do yourself and your preparer a favor and ask him or her to file an application for an automatic extension. Your tax pro is swamped right now and will surely appreciate having more time to finish and review your return when things are less hectic and stressful."}
{"original": "If you're overseas and don't plan to return to the U.S. until after April, you're best served to file an extension. And if you're in the military overseas, IRS rules give you an automatic two-month extension that you don't even need to file for. If you still need more time, then you must file an application for extension just as civilians must do."}
{"original": "And if you're a military member deployed in a combat zone, you're allowed an automatic extension equal to 180 days, plus the time spent in the combat zone and additional time spent if hospitalized due to injuries sustained in a combat zone."}
{"original": "If you've bought or sold a home, changed jobs, started a business and exercised stock options, among other things, you may need more time to gather the information you'll need to file."}
{"original": "Finally, if you just want to procrastinate. You don't need a reason to file for an extension. When you do, you're automatically granted an additional six months to file, no questions asked."}
{"original": "Note, however: Filing an extension gives you more time to file, but it doesn't give you more time to pay any taxes you owe. You must fork over any 2016 tax you owe when you file the application for extension. If you don't, the IRS can charge you additional late fees, penalties and interest on the unpaid amount."}
{"original": "To avoid these, you'll need to estimate the 2016 tax you owe and submit a payment with the Form 4868. And you must pay (from withholding, estimated payments and what you pay with the extension) at least 90 percent of what you owe for 2016, or pay an amount equal to 100 percent of your 2015 tax liability (110 percent for taxpayers with prior-year adjusted gross income greater than $150,000)."}
{"original": "Finally, don't worry that filing for an extension makes your return a target for an IRS audit -- it doesn't. But remember, the general rule for audits is up to three years after the date of filing. If you wait an additional six months to file your return, the IRS has an additional six months to audit it."}
{"original": "A top trade adviser to President Trump, Peter Navarro, is calling on Congress to stay in Washington to solve problems associated with coronavirus fears. It's not yet known what President Trump will say about economic measures the administration will propose to ease the economic damage wrought by COVID-19."}
{"original": "The president has talked with Republicans on Capitol Hill about a payroll tax holiday, but that idea has not been enthusiastically received by either Republicans or Democrats. Navarro, however, blamed Democrats, and attributed their refusal to entertain a payroll tax cut to playing politics. Navarro confirmed that the president wants to see a temporary 0% payroll tax rate. Those familiar with the proposal say that the payroll tax cut would be anywhere from three months to the end of the year. It would not be permanent."}
{"original": "Temporarily eliminating the payroll tax for both workers and employers through the end of the year offers one of the clearest paths to a highly effective fiscal stimulus, as we head toward that inevitable light at the end of the coronavirus tunnel, Navarro said in a statement. A payroll tax cut provides a hefty 7.65% raise for blue-collar and middle-income workers, while allowing particularly small and medium-sized businesses to effectively manage any short term cash flow problems that may arise in a time of heightened uncertainty."}
{"original": "He pointed out that it would be equivalent to an extra week's pay every three-month period for these workers. Navarro claimed that if enacted in full and promptly, the positive GDP growth impacts of the payroll tax cut has the potential to completely offset any of the negative growth effects of COVID-19."}
{"original": "But such a move would be extremely costly and will add to rising deficits. Asked how the administration would make up for the lost revenue from a payroll tax holiday, Navarro called it a rounding error when considered in the context of the cost to the economy of slower growth or disruption. When pressed further, he responded, If you don't do anything, and you lose all that growth, you lose a ton of revenue."}
{"original": "Navarro added, It's odd that the Democrats are pushing back on one of the most pro-worker tax cuts that you can design. If they're pushing back, it's just politics. They don't care about the people, it's just politics."}
{"original": "He responded dismissively to the House proposal that is expected to be voted on Thursday. He said there wasn't much new in it beyond increases to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The administration, he added, has already supported free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave for hourly workers, and are expanding unemployment insurance. The Trump administration is also proposing small-business loan initiatives."}
{"original": "They're doing all this important small stuff, but are pushing back on the single most important thing that could help American workers and ensure that we don't lose any growth, Navarro said of the Democrats. If you put this in you complete offset any negative growth effects from the virus."}
{"original": "Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his entire Cabinet resigned Friday to take political responsibility for a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters. In a nationally televised speech, Rutte said he had informed King Willem-Alexander of his decision and pledged that his government would continue work to compensate affected parents as quickly as possible and to battle the coronavirus."}

{"original": "We are of one mind that if the whole system has failed, we all must take responsibility, and that has led to the conclusion that I have just offered the king, the resignation of the entire Cabinet, Rutte said."}
{"original": "The move was seen as largely symbolic; Rutte's government will remain in office in a caretaker mode until a new coalition is formed after a March 17 election in the Netherlands."}
{"original": "The resignation brings to an end a decade in office for Rutte, although his party is expected to win the election, putting him first in line to begin talks to form the next government. If he succeeds in forming a new coalition, Rutte would most likely again become prime minister."}
{"original": "The Netherlands is the third European country thrown into political uncertainty this week in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. In Estonia, the government resigned over a corruption scandal, while Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte's governing coalition is at risk of collapse after a small partner party withdrew its support."}
{"original": "Rutte said earlier this week that his government would be able to keep taking tough policy decisions in the battle against the coronavirus even if it were in caretaker mode. The Netherlands is in a tough lockdown until at least Feb. 9, and the government is considering imposing an overnight curfew amid fears about new, more contagious variants of the virus."}
{"original": "To the Netherlands I say: Our struggle against the coronavirus will continue, Rutte said."}
{"original": "On Thursday, the leader of the Dutch opposition Labor Party stepped down because he was minister of social affairs in a governing coalition led by Rutte when the country's tax office implemented a tough policy of tracking down fraud with child welfare."}
{"original": "Lodewijk Asscher's decision put further pressure on Rutte ahead of Friday's Cabinet meeting. Ministers were to decide on their reaction to a scathing report issued last month, titled Unprecedented Injustice, that said the tax office policies violated fundamental principles of the rule of law. The report also criticized the government for the way it provided information to parliament about the scandal."}
{"original": "Many wrongfully accused parents were plunged into debt when tax officials demanded repayment of payments. The government has in the past apologized for the tax office's methods and in March earmarked 500 million euros ($607 million) to compensate more than 20,000 parents."}
{"original": "One of those parents waited near parliament as the Cabinet met and said she wanted it to resign."}
{"original": "It's important for me because it is the government acknowledging, 'We have made a mistake and we are taking responsibility,' because it's quite something what happened to us, Janet Ramesar told The Associated Press."}
{"original": "Rutte plans to lead his conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy into the March election, and polls suggest it will win the most seats. That would put Rutte, who has been in office for a decade at the head of three different coalitions, first in line to attempt to form the next ruling coalition."}
{"original": "Deputy Prime Minister Kajsa Ollongren, who serves as interior minister, said as she entered Friday's meeting that it is very important to be accountable and also to show responsibility in the political sense, and we are going to talk about that in the Council of Ministers today."}
{"original": "Washington — Republican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah released a proposal on Thursday aimed at providing direct payments monthly to parents, with the goal of attracting bipartisan support for a plan aimed at significantly reducing child poverty in the U.S."}
{"original": "Under Romney's plan, named the Family Security Act, families with children would receive a monthly cash benefit of hundreds of dollars per child. Families with children up to five years old would receive $4,200 per year per child in $350 monthly payments, and families with children ages 6 to 17 would receive $3,000 per year per child, or $250 per month. Romney's proposal caps the monthly amount for a family to $1,250, and expecting parents can apply for the benefit four months before the child's due date."}
{"original": "American families are facing greater financial strain, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, and marriage and birth rates are at an all-time low, Romney said in a statement. This proposal offers a path toward greater security for America's families by consolidating the many complicated programs to create a monthly cash benefit for them, without adding to the deficit."}
{"original": "Individual taxpayers making up to $200,000 and couples making up to $400,000 would be eligible for the payments, with payments phasing out above those income levels."}
{"original": "A summary of the $254 billion proposal specifies that it would be deficit-neutral by eliminating other areas of spending, including the State and Local Tax Deduction and the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which will likely draw opposition from Democrats."}
{"original": "Romney is expected to file the plan as an amendment to the budget resolution currently under consideration in the Senate on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the senator's plan."}
{"original": "According to an analysis by the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank, Romney's proposal would cut child poverty in the U.S. by up to a third, and deep child poverty by half."}
{"original": "Ron Klain, President Biden's chief of staff, weighed in on the proposal, tweeting that he is looking forward to see what @Senator Romney will propose here — an encouraging sign that bipartisan action to reduce child poverty is possible."}
{"original": "A Romney aide said the Utah senator's office has communicated with officials in the Biden administration and is willing to work with them."}
{"original": "The Biden administration $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package calls for increasing the child tax credit to $3,600 for children up to age 6, and $3,000 per child up to age 17. The White House is also supportive for an additional $1 billion for states to help TANF recipients due to the COVID-19 pandemic."}
{"original": "WOLFSBURG, Germany- Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal will cost the German automaker at least $18.2 billion (16.2 billion euro)."}
{"original": "VW said Friday that's the one-time hit the company will take to its 2015 earnings, more than double the 6.7 billion euros it had previously set aside to reflect the cost of the scandal. The announcement came ahead of a news conference at its Wolfsburg headquarters that follows the outlines of a deal with U.S. environmental authorities."}
{"original": "The company said yesterday it had reached a settlement with the Department of Justice to repurchase nearly 500,000 cars in the U.S. that were equipped with software that let the cars cheat on emissions tests."}
{"original": "Volkswagen said will post an after-tax loss of 1.36 billion euros for 2015 and a net loss of 5.5 billion euros. That represents the biggest loss in the company's history."}
{"original": "Volkswagen CEO Matthias Mueller said as he released the headline earnings numbers that the company remains fundamentally healthy and that he is convinced that Volkswagen has what it takes to overcome its challenges."}
{"original": "VW had delayed its earnings announcement until it could get a better estimate of the costs involved. Analysts say the total costs in fines, legal judgments and lost sales will be significantly higher."}
{"original": "Volkswagen also said it will not be able to release results of an internal probe of its emissions scandal this month as expected. The company now says the probe conducted by U.S. law firm Jones Day could be completed by year end."}
{"original": "On advice of the company's attorneys, management and directors, the company said a disclosure of interim results of the investigation at this point in time would present unacceptable risks for Volkswagen and, therefore, cannot take place now."}
{"original": "The revelation last September from U.S. environmental authorities that VW had been cheating on emissions test rocked one of the most venerable brand names in the auto industry and cost it its chief executive as well as a host of goodwill."}
{"original": "It's also raised questions over the practices of others. Japanese company Mitsubishi Motors and Italy's FIAT alsohave questions to answer."}
{"original": "Still, Germany's car companies appearto be having the most trouble at the moment."}
{"original": "On Friday, Germany's transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said five German automakers agreed to recall atotal of 630,000 diesel vehicles in Europe following an investigation into their emissions levels. He identified the companies concerned as Mercedes, Opeland Volkswagen and its subsidiaries Audi and Porsche."}
{"original": "The move followed a probe of 53 models by Germany's Federal Motor Transport Authority that was sparked by revelations last year about Volkswagen's emissions test cheating. VW's cars could tell when they were on the test stand and turned up the emissions controls, then turned them off in real-world driving to improve performance and mileage."}
{"original": "Dobrindt said none of the newly scrutinized models were found to have rigged engine control software devices of the kind used by Volkswagen, but that they displayed elevated levels of nitrogen oxide in both laboratory and real-world tests."}
{"original": "Some models used technology to switch off the vehicles' emissions treatment systems at certain temperatures to protect the engine, he said."}
{"original": "In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Donald Trump declared that ordinary workers have seen a blue-collar boom during his tenure. That's partly true. But his suggestion that the bottom 50% of income-earners are faring better financially than the top 1% does not hold up to scrutiny."}
{"original": "The average wealth of a worker making the median wage or less has risen by a total of $4,000 in the three years since Mr. Trump took office. The average wealth increase for those in the top 1%? That's up $2.2 million."}
{"original": "Another claim from Mr. Trump in the State of the Union: Wages for lower paid workers have risen 16% since his election. That's true. But most of that increase owes to other factors, including a move by many states to hike their minimum wage."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump's speech depicted the economy as firing on all cylinders, especially for working-class Americans. That description is off the mark for the manufacturing sector, historically a key source of employment for less-educated workers."}
{"original": "After booming in 2018, manufacturers narrowly avoided a recession last year, hurt by Mr. Trump's trade fights with China and other countries. Since he entered office in 2017, the number of manufacturing jobs also has expanded more slowly than the broader labor market. The result: Manufacturers today account for a slightly smaller share of employment than they did in 2016."}
{"original": "Those jobs are also paying less. A decade ago, the average manufacturing job paid $1 an hour more than jobs overall. Today, those same jobs tend to pays less that most other kinds of work, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump is right to say the wealth of lower-income Americans is rising. And it's rising faster than under Barack Obama, when the wealth of the bottom half was essentially flat for the entirety of his two terms in office. But it's still not rising as fast as the wealth of the top 1%, who got a much bigger boost from Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts than average Americans did."}
{"original": "When Mr. Trump was elected a little over three years ago, the top 1% had a collective net worth of $22.5 trillion. That's risen 21% to $27.3 trillion, according to the most recent Federal Reserve data. Meanwhile, the lower 40% of wage earners saw their combined net worth rise 12%, to $6.5 trillion from $5.8 trillion."}
{"original": "But even that gain is smaller than it seems, said Gabriel Zucman, a University of California at Berkeley economist who is one of the leading researchers on wealth inequality. He said the net wealth of the bottom half of wage earners in America is actually close to zero because of debt, making any apparent increase appear larger than it really is."}
{"original": "Pay hikes — thanks largely to individual U.S. states"}
{"original": "Average pay around the U.S. is rising faster today than when President Trump took office three years ago, though it is slower than its peak in February 2019, when hourly earnings grew 3.4% on a year-over-year basis."}
{"original": "For lower-wage workers, the good news is they are capturing much of those gains after decades of muted wage growth. Since 2015, the lowest-paid quarter of workers has seen a higher percentage increase in pay than the top 25%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta."}
{"original": "Some research has found that this increase is partly driven by states increasing their minimum wages. States that raised their minimum wage between 2013 and 2018 saw pay for their lowest-paid workers grow more than 50% faster than those that didn't, according to an analysis from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. The trend continued in 2019, said Elise Gould, senior economist at EPI."}
{"original": "Year after year, we've seen states increase their minimum wage, either through indexing [for inflation] or legislation, and we have seen faster wage growth at the bottom in those states that have increased their minimum, she said."}
{"original": "Nearly half of U.S. states and many cities are boosting their minimum wage this year. Meanwhile, the federal minimum wage has remained at $7.25 since 2009 — the longest stretch without a hike in baseline pay. The House of Representatives in July voted to raise the minimum wage to $15, but the bill has stalled in the Senate, and Mr. Trump has not addressed the issue."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump likes to point to the stock market as a sign of the economy's health. He has done well on that account, presiding over a 43% increase in the S&P 500-stock index in the three years since his inauguration — better than George W. Bush for a similar period, but behind the blue-chip stock index's performance under both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama."}
{"original": "Still, a hot stock market doesn't mean all workers are doing better. Richer Americans hold a far greater portion of the nation's wealth, with the top 10% of income earners owning nearly 85% of the value of all stocks."}
{"original": "People who own shares have definitely done well, but most middle-class workers, they can't afford to put away an appreciable amount for their retirement, said Paul Sonn, director of the National Employment Law Project Action Fund."}
{"original": "Despite the modest economic growth, the longest expansion in U.S. history, which started in 2009, shows few signs of winding down 11 years later. Perhaps even more important, data suggest a broader swath of Americans are benefiting: More people have come off the sidelines and found jobs. As a result, the proportion of Americans in their prime working years (ages 25 through 54) who are employed is now higher than before the Great Recession."}
{"original": "Another boon is that the moderate growth has meant that, at least so far, the economy isn't showing evident signs of excess akin to the housing bubble that led to the 2008 financial meltdown."}
{"original": "This expansion has been slow and steady, but it could run for a few more years, Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody's Analytics, told the Associated Press. There's no reason that it needs to die. Sometimes slow and steady does win the race."}
{"original": "With the IRS processing tax refunds more slowly in the wake of a partial government shutdown, many Americans are asking where their money is."}
{"original": "Luckily, there's an app for that. Taxpayers who are getting a refund can check on its status is via the tax agency's Where's my refund? page. (Most tax software companies will direct questions to that same page.)"}
{"original": "To check, you must have your taxpayer ID number (often your Social Security number), your filing status and the exact amount of your refund. It works only if you've already filed your tax return and have waited 24 hours after electronic filing."}
{"original": "The curious taxpayer would also need to consent to being tracked. Clicking on the tracking tool creates a pop-up that says, in part, Use of this system constitutes consent to monitoring, interception, recording, reading, copying or capturing by authorized personnel of all activities. There is no right to privacy in this system."}
{"original": "An IRS spokesman didn't immediately comment on the reasons for the tracking or how the gathered information would be used. A separate privacy policy page notes that the IRS doesn't attempt to identify individual users unless we suspect illegal behavior."}
{"original": "Certain tax credits mean waiting longer"}
{"original": "The refund timeline for the many Americans who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit is somewhat easier to establish. No matter how early they filed their return, no refunds will be deposited until Feb. 27. They'll be available to track via the refund tracker starting on Feb. 23, the IRS said."}
{"original": "Overall, the agency issues 90 percent of refunds within 21 days, it said."}
{"original": "Projections from November -- calculated long before the record-long partial shutdown -- show that the IRS expected to issue the most refunds between Feb. 15 and 21."}
{"original": "It's still uncertain how many people will get refunds this year. A study this summer from the Government Accountability Office projected that about 4.6 million more taxpayers than usual would owe on their tax returns this year."}
{"original": "Washington — Americans who are eligible to receive one-time payments from the federal government as part of a massive coronavirus economic relief package will see that money deposited into their bank accounts within three weeks, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday."}
{"original": "We expect that within three weeks, that people who have direct deposit with information with us will see those direct deposits into their bank accounts, and we will create a web-based system for people where we don't have their direct deposit, they can upload it so that they can get the money immediately as opposed to checks in the mail, Mnuchin said on Face the Nation."}
{"original": "As part of the $2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress last week, Americans who make up to $75,000 will receive $1,200 checks, plus $500 per dependent child. The amount gradually decreases for incomes up to $99,000, at which point the payments cut off."}
{"original": "Income levels will be based off of 2019 income tax returns for those who have already filed. Returns for 2018 will be used for those who haven't."}
{"original": "The rescue package, which is designed to help American families hurting because of the coronavirus and inject money into the U.S. economy, was signed into law Friday after receiving bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress."}
{"original": "In addition to providing direct payments to Americans, the legislation also allocates $500 billion for ailing industries that have seen business drastically decline as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Among those that stand to benefit from the measure are the airlines, which are set to receive $25 billion in grants."}
{"original": "Some have called the $500 billion fund a bailout for large corporations, and a lack of oversight in the initial economic relief package proposed in the Senate was a sticking point for congressional Democrats. To address those concerns, the legislation creates an oversight board and inspector general to oversee the distribution of loans to large companies, although President Trump indicated when he signed the bill that he might not comply with those provisions."}
{"original": "Mnuchin rebuffed the characterization of the funds as a bailout and said the American people will be made whole after the public health crisis subsides and the U.S. economy reopens."}
{"original": "We're not bailing out any companies or any industries, he said. Any loans that we make, the taxpayer will be fully compensated for. As the president said, we'll look at each one of these situations. Some of them are very good companies that just need liquidity and will get loans. Some of these companies may need more significant help and we may be taking warrants or equity as well as that."}
{"original": "The economic stimulus package passed last week is the third phase of a multi-pronged effort to ease the pain of the coronavirus and ensure states and the federal government are prepared to address the crisis. In addition to the estimated $2 trillion package passed last week, which is the largest measure in American history, Mr. Trump has signed two other relief bills."}
{"original": "Mnuchin did not rule out a fourth measure."}
{"original": "If for whatever reason this takes longer than we think, we will go back to Congress and get more support for the American economy, but I hope that's not needed, he said."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump has indicated he is eager to reopen the U.S. economy, which has been brought to a halt as restaurants, theaters and bars are shuttered, schools are closed, and concerts and sporting events canceled. The president has suggested that a reboot could come by Easter Sunday on April 12, though public health experts aren't as confident and continue to urge Americans to stay in their homes and limit their activities to those that only are essential."}
{"original": "The labor market has also taken a substantial hit, with weekly jobless claims hitting a record 3.3 million."}
{"original": "But Mnuchin said he believes the stimulus program will be enormously successful in stabilizing the U.S. economy and providing assistance for those who lost their jobs or can't work because of the coronavirus."}
{"original": "This money is going to go into the economy very quickly. It is going to help American workers very, very quickly, he said. I don't know how long it's going to take to kill this virus. I do know we will kill this virus, and when we do, I have great confidence that the U.S. economy will come roaring back."}
{"original": "You've heard this before: Failing to plan is planning to fail. This couldn't be more true than when it comes to retirement. Simply put, planning increases the chances that you'll have a successful retirement. And planning is much better than winging it, which so many people do."}
{"original": "According to a recent survey conducted by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies (TCRS), more than one-third (37 percent) of workers don't have any strategy for their retirement. These people are truly winging it."}
{"original": "The study also found that almost half (47 percent) of all workers have a strategy, but it's not written down. Such a plan is better than nothing, but most likely it'll be incomplete."}
{"original": "Fewer than one in five workers (16 percent) have a written plan, which is ideal. Research in behavioral economics shows that having a written strategy increases a person's commitment to carrying out the plan."}
{"original": "So what should go into a successful retirement strategy? The TCRS study provides a handy checklist of factors to consider. Here's the list (the percentage beside each factor shows the prevalence of workers who include the factor in their plan):"}
{"original": "Social Security and Medicare (55 percent)"}
{"original": "Total retirement savings and income needs (49 percent)"}
{"original": "A retirement budget that includes basic living expenses (48 percent)"}
{"original": "A plan to help ensure your savings last throughout your retirement (40 percent)"}
{"original": "Contingency plans for retiring sooner than expected and savings shortfalls (14 percent)"}
{"original": "The reality is, a robust retirement strategy for an older worker should consider all these factors. The only possible exception: Estate planning might not be important for some people because they may not have heirs they want to leave money to, or they don't have enough savings for a meaningful legacy."}
{"original": "In particular, the last item -- contingency planning -- is particularly critical for older workers. Various surveys show that roughly half of all current retirees stopped working sooner than they expected, often due to a health crisis or layoff. A contingency plan to address an unplanned retirement could include identifying backup bridge jobs; knowing how you might immediately reduce your living expenses, including downsizing or reducing auto expenses; and making sure you could continue your health insurance."}
{"original": "Here's one important retirement planning item that's often overlooked and not on the TCRS list: Planning for much more additional time with your spouse or partner, if you're married or living with someone. Plan for the activities that you'll do together as well as the time you'll spend apart."}
{"original": "While it's important to spend time together, it's also essential to nurture your own identity and to agree on the appropriate balance with your partner. It's also a smart idea to make sure your spouse or partner understands all the important factors in your retirement plan."}
{"original": "One final thought: Working with a retirement adviser is a good way to increase the odds of retirement success, yet only 39 percent of workers in the TCRS survey report that they worked with an adviser. If you decide to do so, you'll want to find an adviser who's skilled at planning retirement income and is compensated without conflicts so he or she has your best interests at heart."}
{"original": "It will take some time and effort to develop a robust retirement strategy that works for you. And while nobody said that being retired for 20 to 30 years or more would be easy, it should be worth the effort, considering what's at stake."}

{"original": "Alaska Governor Bill Walker. CBS News"}
{"original": "Even if they closed every public school and jail in the state, and laid off every state employee, it still wouldn't fill the hole, the governor said."}
{"original": "The problem is oil. The price per barrel has fallen off a cliff, from a high of $107 in 2014 to as low as $26 earlier this year. Oil and gas revenue funds up to 90 percent of state spending, the money pays for every bridge, road, and school."}
{"original": "We've had this roller-coaster of an economy because we've hooked our horses to one commodity -- oil -- and we rode it up and down, Walker said. This is the day of reckoning."}
{"original": "Walker wants state lawmakers to impose Alaska's first income tax in 35 years, and cut the annual check each resident gets for their share of oil revenue. Oil companies would pay more too."}
{"original": "If taxes go up, credits go down, there'll be less production, said Kara Moriarty."}

{"original": "If you have an IRA and were age 70 or older before July 2016, you have only a few days left to take an important action: You must begin to take the so-called required minimum distributions (RMDs) from it no later than April 1."}
{"original": "The problem is that April 1 falls on a Saturday this year. Unlike the deadline for filing your tax returns, which is extended to April 18 (because April 15 also falls on a Saturday in 2017), the RMD's April 1 deadline isn't extended. So this year you'll need to take your IRA distribution by Friday March 31."}
{"original": "Some advisers recommend that you sell shares of stocks, bonds or mutual funds now because it'll take a few days for the proceeds from a sale to be available as cash that you'll need to make the distribution from your IRA. This advice seems to imply (and most people believe) that RMDs must be made only in cash. Buts that's not the case."}
{"original": "You can actually take any distribution, not just an RMD, from your IRA in either cash or in kind. This means you can distribute the actual shares of stock or mutual funds from an IRA and use it to satisfy your RMD."}
{"original": "The advantages of using an in-kind distribution of shares of investments is that doing so allows you to keep the amount of the distribution fully invested. If the shares of a specific stock are down, or you believe the stock is undervalued, you might want to hold onto the shares and distribute them, instead of selling them to take a cash withdrawal."}
{"original": "Of course, the market value of the shares on the date they were distributed from the IRA would be taxed as ordinary income (same for cash distributions). But any gain on the shares after the date of the distribution would be taxed at the capital gains rate."}
{"original": "Another advantage of taking an in-kind distribution from an IRA is that you don't have to sell the position in your IRA and then use the distributed cash to buy it back in another account. Avoiding these round-trip transactions will save the cost of a commission that would have been charged for each trade."}
{"original": "In the case of shares of a mutual fund that charges a front-end load or a redemption fee, you'll avoid those charges as well when you take an in-kind distribution. Finally, if the mutual fund you own is closed to new investors, you may want to distribute the shares in-kind instead of selling them in the IRA to raise cash for the RMD."}
{"original": "The downside of taking IRA distributions in-kind is that if the position involved typically experiences significant price swings, you'll have to distribute a few extra shares to ensure that the value of the shares at the time of the distribution was sufficient to meet the RMD amount. Failure to distribute the RMD by the deadline can result in a harsh 50 percent excise tax on the amount of the distribution that's late or insufficient."}
{"original": "Finally, a special rule allows people who continue to work to put off distributions from their employer-sponsored retirement plans."}
{"original": "If you're still working (even part-time), have a balance in a plan such as a 401(k) or 403(b) and aren't an owner of the business that maintains the plan (a 5 percent owner), you can wait to start withdrawals from that plan until the later of April 1 following the year in which you reach age 70-1/2 or the year you retire. This special rule doesn't apply to an IRA."}

{"original": "He said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has protected President Obama in the past and insisted that's something Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will change when the Republicans take over in January."}
{"original": "Any of the real tough issues have never made it to the president's desk because they went to the Senate to die, Christie said, and I think that won't happen now."}
{"original": "Among Christie's expectations include tax reform and a national energy policy."}
{"original": "Of all the results this election, Christie was most impressed by Maine's re-election of Gov. Paul LePage."}
{"original": "Paul LePage is just one of the most decent, honorable people I've ever met -- wears his heart on his sleeve, loves his state, has an amazing personal story, he said."}

{"original": "PARIS -- Thousands of protesters marched under tight security in eastern Paris on Saturday after French labor unions, left-wing political parties and civil rights groups called for floods of people to oppose the pro-business policies of President Emmanuel Macron.

{"original": "Police said they detained 39 people in Paris before and after the march started, including 26 were put into custody. Most of them were preemptively taken in for questioning after officers searched their bags and found equipment that could be used to cause damage or to hide their faces."}
{"original": "A few others, mainly youths dressed in black with their faces covered, were detained on the sidelines of the main protest for breaking a window at a business or damaging bus shelters. Police used tear gas canisters to push them back. Seven officers were slightly injured mainly by thrown debris."}
{"original": "Unions, opposition parties and other groups were particularly denouncing a Macron-led overhaul of labor rules that would reduce worker protections and laws increasing police powers."}
{"original": "They allege that Macron supports tax reform that favors France's wealthiest and is working to tear down public services. They also oppose a government plan making it harder for students to attend the public universities of their choice, more restrictive immigration laws and police methods in underprivileged neighborhoods that protesters consider repressive."}

{"original": "The odds of being audited by the IRS are shrinking -- and that's especially good news for wealthy taxpayers."}
{"original": "About 934,000 returns were audited during Fiscal Year 2017, the lowest number since 2003, according to new IRS data."}
{"original": "Among households with income above $1 million, just 4.37 percent faced audits. That's less than half the 9.55 percent rate in 2015, and the lowest audit rate for millionaires since the IRS first began tracking it in 2004."}
{"original": "The audit rate for taxpayers earning $200,000 or less fell to 0.59 percent, the lowest level since 2002."}
{"original": "The main reason for the decline: The IRS's budget and staff levels have been under pressure for years."}
{"original": "The IRS is also auditing fewer companies and nonprofit organizations. The audit rate for businesses with assets of $250 million tumbled to 15.2 percent in the most recent fiscal quarter, less than half the 33.8 percent rate in 2013. Less than 1 percent of all tax-exempt organizations were audited in 2017."}
{"original": "Look, we have a voluntary tax system. It relies on people's goodwill and it relies to some degree on their fear of being audited, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Institute, in an interview with CBS."}
{"original": "The tax legislation passed in December creates new burdens for the IRS, especially by encouraging some businesses to change their reporting structure."}
{"original": "It creates more opportunities for people to claim business deductions than they might have before, said Gleckman. I don't quite know how the service is going to keep track of them."}
{"original": "Moreover, Gleckman thinks the rules are so badly written than even taxpayers with the best of intentions will mess-up because they don't understand how to comply."}
{"original": "Taxpayers seeking help from the IRS often have difficulties finding it because its staff has shrunk by 20,000 over the past 8 years. The agency's proposed budget is a 1.7 percent increase from last year, but still less than the budget in 2012."}
{"original": "This is an unsustainable situation for the agency that brings in 93 percent of the nation's revenue, and it will worsen with additional cuts proposed in the Administration's 2019 budget, said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union."}
{"original": "An IRS spokesman declined to comment."}
{"original": "White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday President Trump is proposing a 20 percent tax on imports, particularly on products and services from Mexico, so that revenues could be used to pay for the construction of Mr. Trump's proposed wall along the U.S. southern border."}
{"original": "Spicer told reporters Thursday that the administration is considering using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries that we have a trade deficit from, like Mexico. The proposal is meant to raise the billions of dollars from Mexico needed to cover the cost of the border wall, a promise Mr. Trump has made since his days on the campaign trail."}
{"original": "Right now our country's policy is to tax exports and let imports flow freely in, which is ridiculous, Spicer said. But if you tax that $50 billion at 20 percent of imports -- which is by the way a practice that 160 other countries do...By doing that, we can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. That's really going to provide the funding."}
{"original": "Later in the afternoon, however, Spicer and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters that the proposal was in fact just one of several options the White House was considering, including a border tax in the range of 5 - 20 percent. It is part of a buffet of options, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters, according to CBS News' Margaret Brennan. He said this is one of the many ways that the border wall could be funded."}
{"original": "While Mr. Trump has publicly said he had already figured out how to pay for the wall, Spicer said he's now willing to work with Congress to find a way to do it. That includes making it a part of comprehensive tax reform like that being proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. White House officials said the proposed border tax would essentially be a way to derive payment from Mexico."}
{"original": "When pressed as to whether this now meant that the Mexican government would not have to write a check to the U.S. to repay it for construction of the wall, Spicer stipulated that the president had never said that was going to happen. He made the point that there were multiple ways for Mexico – either via its corporations or other entities – to help fund the construction."}
{"original": "The border adjustment act that Ryan has proposed would include a tax on goods produced outside the country for sale inside the U.S. In short it would incentivize corporations to produce their goods in the U.S. and sell them here instead of seeking a cheaper labor source outside the country. Ryan's argument is that the corporate tax rate would be lowered to offset that increase in cost of doing business. He also argues that it would strengthen the dollar."}
{"original": "In 2015, the U.S. suffered a $58.4 billion trade deficit with Mexico, its third largest trading partner."}

{"original": "The bill by Democratic state Sen. Nancy Skinner passed out of its first committee hearing on Wednesday, keeping it alive a head of a Jan. 31 deadline to pass the Senate. State officials estimate the legislation could bring in up to $4.1 billion, which its supporters say could help defray the costs of providing public assistance to thes state's low-paid workers."}
{"original": "The proposal would only apply to companies that post at least $10 million of taxable income from business conducted in California. That would apply to about 2,000 companies nationwide, including the Walt Disney Co., headquartered in Burbank. The bill has gained support from heiress Abigail Disney, granddaughter of Disney co-founder Roy Disney — who has been advocating for higher wages for the company's workers."}
{"original": "It is absolutely ridiculous for corporations to be making record profits while many of their employees are in working poverty, Disney said in a statement."}
{"original": "She also told lawmakers that workers at Disney are paid so poorly that they rely on food banks, sleep in cars or live so close to the bone that even a small problem could send them into a death spiral."}
{"original": "Her comments about the company's workers stem from a visit she made to some Disney Land employees at an offsite union office in Anaheim."}
{"original": "The goal of the bill is to incentivize large corporations to stop overpaying their CEOs and give workers a fair share, Sen. Skinner said in a statement."}
{"original": "The proposal would increase the typical 8.84% business tax rate to 14.84% on companies where the ratio of top executive pay to the average worker is greater than 300%. Companies with a pay ratio of 200% to 300% would pay a tax rate of 13.85%, and so on."}

{"original": "California would not be the first government in the U.S. to try this, but would be the the largest. In 2016, city officials in Portland, Oregon, approved a 10% tax on publicly traded companies that pay their CEOs 100 to 250 times the average worker."}
{"original": "Some lawmakers signaled they want some changes before the bill comes for a vote in the Senate."}

{"original": "Take Chicago and San Luis Obispo, California, a town known for vineyards and spas. Children growing up in San Luis Obispo were likely to see higher social mobility, earning about $5,300 more annually as an adult than their counterpart in Chicago."}
{"original": "But since those kids have grown up, real estate prices have diverged drastically between the two locations. Home values jumped 154 percent in San Luis Obispo county since the late 1990s, while home prices in Chicago have only increased by about 30 percent."}
{"original": "Detroit is the most affordable real estate market in the U.S. for homebuyers, according to Zillow. AP"}
{"original": "That trends holds true when examining home prices for towns that have offered high levels of social mobility to children, Zillow found. The average home value for locations with high social mobility has jumped almost 140 percent since the late 1990s, while cities with few socioeconomic opportunities have seen home values rise only 51 percent."}
{"original": "This research shows that it's harder than ever for kids who grew up in the country's lowest income households to live in the places where they're most likely to succeed, said Zillow chief economist Svenja Gudell in a statement. We already knew that high rents and growing housing costs were hitting low-income people hardest, and it's clear the housing affordability crisis on the coasts is a barrier to their upward social mobility."}
{"original": "The research backs up recent findings from The Pew Charitable Trusts about the financial stranglehold many American families are facing since the recession ended. Many low- and middle-income households are feeling the strain as housing, food and transportation costs have risen while income has stagnated."}
{"original": "Rent has been a particularly thorny issue, with tight inventory for affordable housing driving up prices in many cities. Americans in the bottom third of the income distribution spend about 40 percent of their income on housing, while poorer renters on average spend half of their pre-tax earnings on rent, Pew found."}
{"original": "Less slack in a household budget -- or the money left over after essential bills are paid -- means that family is less able to build capital, such as savings for college or for enriching activities that their wealthier cohort can afford."}
{"original": "Top job markets such as the San Francisco area and New York now require renters to fork over more than 40 percent of the median income, while Los Angeles rents eat up about half of a typical worker's income, Zillow found."}
{"original": "Generally, cities on the coasts have the highest housing cost burdens, according to a separate study from SmartAsset. The most affordable locations are cities in the Midwest and Western states, it found. Interestingly, the city with highest cost burden is Newark, New Jersey, a city known for its high poverty and crime rates. Almost one-quarter of households in that city, which is located only a few miles from Manhattan, pay least half of their income in housing costs, SmartAsset said."}

{"original": "At 6 feet 2 inches, President Trump towers over Michael Bloomberg, the diminutive 5-foot-7-inch former three-term mayor of New York City. Mr. Trump has taunted Bloomberg on Twitter, referring to him as mini and questioning his chances to become the Democratic nominee in the 2020 election."}
{"original": "Mini Mike Bloomberg doesn't get on the Democrat Debate Stage because he doesn't want to - he is a terrible debater and speaker. If he did, he would go down in the polls even more (if that is possible!), Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter Friday."}
{"original": "He wrote a second tweet on Friday referring to Bloomberg's numerous ads against the president airing on TV."}
{"original": "Mini Mike Bloomberg ads are purposely wrong - A vanity project for him to get into the game. Nobody in many years has done for the USA what I have done for the USA, including the greatest economy in history, rebuilding our military, biggest ever tax & regulation cuts, & 2nd A! Mr. Trump wrote."}
{"original": "Although Mr. Trump occasionally tweets about Democratic presidential candidates, Bloomberg in particular seems to have nettled the president. Like Mr. Trump, Bloomberg is a billionaire from New York, but his fortune is considerably larger; Bloomberg's net worth is $60 billion, according to Forbes' real time net worth tracker, as of January 17. Forbes pegs Mr. Trump's net worth at just over $3 billion on the same day."}
{"original": "Bloomberg shot back at Mr. Trump on Twitter, saying that the president was the expert on vanity projects."}
{"original": "Friday was not the first time Mr. Trump has tweeted angrily about Bloomberg. On Monday, he reiterated that Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising."}
{"original": "The tit-for-tat appeared to continue in an escalation of spending over Super Bowl campaign ads. Earlier this month, the Bloomberg campaign purchased a 60-second ad to air nationally during the Super Bowl, the highest-watched television event of the year, costing roughly $10 million to be aired once."}
{"original": "The ad was purchased in part to counter what was expected to be a 30-second national spot purchased by the Trump campaign. However, a senior Trump campaign official then confirmed to CBS News that the campaign would be spending $10 million on 60 seconds of airtime during the Super Bowl."}
{"original": "But the enmity between the two existed before the 2020 election, and hit a boiling point after Bloomberg's speech at the 2016 Democratic Convention, when Bloomberg belittled Mr. Trump's fortune."}
{"original": "Throughout his career, Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry shareholders, and contractors who feel cheated, and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off. Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's run his business. God help us, Bloomberg said in the speech. I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!...Truth be told, the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump responded in kind on Twitter, although he had not yet formulated the mini epithet."}
{"original": "Little Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster! Mr. Trump wrote."}
{"original": "Bloomberg will not be on the ballot in the Iowa caucus or New Hampshire primary, choosing instead to focus on more delegate-rich states that will have their contests in March. Bloomberg is spending millions to bolster this untested strategy, but it's unclear if it will be enough to successfully challenge top-tier candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders."}
{"original": "Regardless of who wins the Democratic nomination, Bloomberg has promised to devote a significant chunk of his considerable wealth to taking down Mr. Trump."}
{"original": "But if he does win the presidency, unlike his predecessor, Bloomberg's Twitter account will go silent. In every stump speech, Bloomberg commits to voters that he will not tweet from the White House."}
{"original": "Victories by the two Democrats in Georgia's Senate runoff elections could mean a third stimulus check for Americans this spring, according to analysts. That would provide crucial financial support for households that this month are receiving $600 payments directed by the most recent relief bill — an effort that has been criticized by both Democrats and some Republicans as doing too little to help families that are struggling through the coronavirus pandemic."}
{"original": "CBS News projects that Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock have defeated incumbent Republican senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. The surprise outcome will result in a 50-50 split between Senate Democrats and Republicans, giving Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tiebreaking vote. That will ease passage of another stimulus relief bill, which President-elect Joe Biden has previously said he supports, according to political and financial analysts."}
{"original": "Another so-called Economic Impact Payment would come on the heels of the most recent relief measure, a $900 billion bill that President Donald Trump delayed and criticized the $600 payments as ridiculously low. Democrats and some Republicans had supported lifting the checks to $2,000 per person, but the effort failed due to opposition from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell."}
{"original": "A big question is whether lawmakers might push for $2,000 or $1,400 cash payments, with the latter representing the difference between the $600 checks and the quashed effort to boost them to $2,000 in the most recent bill. On January 10, Mr. Biden tweeted that $600 is is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table."}
{"original": "We need $2,000 stimulus checks, he added."}
{"original": "$600 is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table. We need $2,000 stimulus checks. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 11, 2021"}
{"original": "We expect growing anticipation that Democrats will pursue additional stimulus, with a $2,000 check (or at least the remaining $1,400) as a leading item, Ed Mills, an analyst with investment bank Raymond James, said in a report following the Georgia election."}
{"original": "Biden: Latest aid a down payment"}
{"original": "Mr. Biden has described the $900 billion stimulus bill passed last month as a down payment on a more comprehensive relief package. That could translate into a new package ranging from $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion, according to Heights Securities analyst Hunter Hammond."}
{"original": "The debate over $2,000 isn't some abstract debate in Washington. It's about real lives. Hardworking Americans need help, and they need it now. Georgia — you have the power to make it happen. Vote. pic.twitter.com/yFBBk1YAEm — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 5, 2021"}
{"original": "A sweetened stimulus package would likely come in March, Hammond and Mills predict. That's because the most recent relief measure extended unemployment programs until mid-March, which puts pressure on Congress to act on additional financial support by that cutoff to continue jobless benefits for millions of unemployed Americans."}
{"original": "Democrats are likely to push for a new round of checks worth $2,000, Hammond predicted, noting that both Mr. Biden, as well as Warnock and Ossoff, had campaigned on the issue. While stumping for the candidates ahead of this week's vote, Mr. Biden said their election would help get $2,000 checks out the door immediately, to help people who are in real trouble."}
{"original": "Even with previous stimulus aid, 8 million Americans have slipped into poverty during the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of others are experiencing a range of hardships, from food insecurity to trouble paying their bills, after the crisis upended the economy."}
{"original": "The $600 checks issued by the Treasury Department last month may last the neediest Americans no more than six weeks, according to financial-services app Earnin. The firm found that people who had been living paycheck to paycheck and who got the initial $1,200 checks last year spent their money within one week."}
{"original": "Some economists say much more funding is needed beyond the recent $900 billion package to help the economy until coronavirus vaccines are widely distributed, which may not be until this summer or fall."}
{"original": "As much as $3 trillion could be needed to ensure a swift economic recovery, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The left-leaning think tank noted that the most recent stimulus package omitted funding for state and local governments, which have seen a plunge in tax revenue due to the crisis."}
{"original": "Although the stimulus checks are helping households weather the crisis, most economists view other relief measures as more effective — especially programs that target people who are currently suffering a financial hit, such as unemployment benefits. That's because the cash payments are distributed to almost every middle- and low-income household, regardless of whether they have been impacted financially by the crisis."}
{"original": "Checks are generally less potent in supporting spending than unemployment benefits, wrote Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco in a recent research report. He added that the $900 billion relief bill will likely fall short of what is needed to prevent a rough winter."}
{"original": "A new government report projects that the budget deficit for 2019 will be close to $900 billion (4.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)) and predicts that economic growth will slow as the effects of President Trump's tax cut on business investment begin to drop off. The Congressional Budget Office suggests in the Budget and Economic Outlook it released Monday that economic growth will decline sharply in the fourth quarter this year."}
{"original": "The CBO's economic projections were finished before the partial government shutdown, but it estimated that as a result of the shutdown, real GDP was 0.1 percent lower in the fourth quarter of 2018, and it will be lower in the first quarter of 2019 by 0.2 percent or $8 billion. The CBO estimated that the shutdown delayed $18 billion in federal discretionary spending. Most of the lost output is expected to be recovered as the year goes on, although CBO estimates that about $3 billion in GDP will permanently be lost as a result of the shutdown."}
{"original": "The shutdown dampened economic activity, according to the CBO, primarily due to the loss of furloughed federal workers' contribution to GDP, the delay in federal spending on goods and services, and the reduction in aggregate demand. President Trump on Friday agreed to end the shutdown for three weeks pending debate over funding of the border wall. The president, however, appeared less than optimistic about reaching a deal on border security, telling the Wall Street Journal that he puts the odds at less than 50-50 that lawmakers will make the deadline."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump's economic chief Larry Kudlow meanwhile told reporters at Monday's White House press briefing that he won't acknowledge CBO's estimate of economic damage caused by the shutdown, adding that there's no permanent damage to the U.S. economy."}
{"original": "Here are some of the highlights from the report:"}
{"original": "Beginning in 2022, deficit spending is expected to exceed $1 trillion each year. The savings for 2019 -- some $75 billion -- is a result of an anticipated decrease in emergency spending"}
{"original": "The large deficits are projected to result in national debt that reaches 93 percent of GDP in 2029, which the CBO points out will be its highest level since just after World War II. By 2049, the national debt is expected to be about 150 percent of GDP, far higher than it has ever been, the CBO says."}
{"original": "Revenues are expected to increase to 18.3 percent of GDP by the end of the decade (from 16.5 percent in 2019), but that's a function of the expected expiration of the 2017 individual tax cuts."}
{"original": "Real GDP is forecast to grow by 2.3 percent in 2019, a 0.8 percent slowdown from the 3.1 percent growth in 2018, as the the effects of the 2017 Tax Act fade."}
{"original": "The report lands in a divided Washington, where neither Mr. Trump nor Democrats controlling the House are expected to make curbing the deficit a priority."}
{"original": "PALMA DE MALLORCA, Spain - Spain's Princess Cristina testified Thursday at her tax fraud trial that her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, handled all bill payments for the couple and she didn't know why some costs for their lavish lifestyle including an African safari and more than 1,000 euros ($1,100) for wine were charged to a credit card for a company they co-owned."}
{"original": "The princess spent about 20 minutes answering questions from her lawyer aimed at distancing her from involvement with Aizoon, the real estate consulting company he ran from an office inside the Barcelona mansion they lived in for years with their four children but were forced to sell as their legal troubles mounted."}
{"original": "Asked by her lawyer why she never talked with her husband about what the company did, Cristina responded that they weren't issues that interested me. At that time my children were very small and we were very busy."}
{"original": "He was in charge of the family expenses. I didn't get involved in that, she added."}
{"original": "The case centers on accusations that Urdangarin used his former title of Duke of Palma to embezzle about 6 million euros ($6.6 million) in public funds for the nonprofit Noos Institute he ran with a partner that put on sport conferences. Seventeen people are charged, including Urdangarin and the princess."}
{"original": "Money went from Noos to Aizoon, which Urdangarin and the princess testified was set up to receive his income. A three-judge panel hearing the case will weigh whether the couple criminally abused Aizoon, described in court papers as a front company that may have funded luxury vacations and parties at the couple's modernist mansion along with other expenses."}
{"original": "Immediately after taking the stand, Cristina invoked her right to answer only questions posed by her own lawyer and sat silently and listened, but didn't respond to questions posed by a lawyer for the group that leveled the tax fraud charges."}
{"original": "Under Spanish law, groups like the Manos Limpias (Clean Hands) organization involved in the princess' trial can pursue criminal charges against people when authorities decide not to do so. Prosecutors had recommended not charging the princess, saying she should face an administrative fine at most."}
{"original": "The Manos Limpias lawyer, Virginia Lopez Negrete, told the princess she would have asked her about Aizoon and for explanations about personal and business expenses."}
{"original": "Cristina's much-anticipated appearance came after Urdangarin wrapped up three days of testimony and was unable to explain in court how personal expenses like the safari trip and the wine were billed to the Aizoon credit card."}
{"original": "But Urdangarin, a former Olympic handball medalist-turned-entrepreneur, insisted he never knew he might have been doing anything questionable."}
{"original": "Cristina faces two counts of tax fraud, each carrying a maximum jail sentence of four years. She is the first member of Spain's royal family to face criminal charges since the monarchy was restored in 1975. Urdangarin faces stiffer charges and a possible jail sentence of nearly 20 years."}
{"original": "Urdangarin testified that his wife never used the Aizoon credit but that he and other people did, passing the bills to his secretary at the firm."}
{"original": "An investigative judge found that the couple never reported as income personal expenses billed to the company, but Urdangarin testified he relied on the advice of others for determining which expenses should be charged to Aizoon."}
{"original": "I have never been aware of committing any tax offense because I had my advisers who told me everything was correct, Urdangarin said."}
{"original": "The expenses charged to Aizoon cited in court included 15,797 euros ($17,174) for the Africa safari, 6,672 euros for a coaching course for Cristina and 1,357 euros for wine."}
{"original": "Urdangarin said he had made Cristina a co-director of Aizoon because he wanted her to be part of the business project but also insisted she didn't have anything to do with the company's activities."}
{"original": "Urdangarin testified Wednesday that palace officials who worked for former King Juan Carlos oversaw the princess' tax filings and had detailed knowledge of his business operations."}
{"original": "Cristina is the sister of King Felipe VI, who took power in 2014 after his father abdicated."}
{"original": "Legal experts say Cristina's defense relies on her convincing the judges that she knew nothing about her husband's business activities."}
{"original": "Testimony by the defendants ended Thursday night but the judges are expected to hear months more testimony from other witnesses and experts."}
{"original": "Cristina won't have to appear in court again until there is a verdict, which isn't expected until sometime over the summer."}
{"original": "Preparing your tax returns may not be the most enjoyable effort -- and that has companies trying to leverage that sentiment with the increasingly common tax day freebie."}
{"original": "Dozens of national and local businesses are rolling out discounts and deals on April 17, this year's deadline for filing federal tax returns. Their goal is to offer benefits to help stressed-out taxpayers, said Carson Yarbrough, savings expert at Offers.com."}
{"original": "To be sure, the deals are geared to ultimately help the businesses by building their brands through earning goodwill from customers. And if a customer happens to pick up a few other items while stopping in for a tax day freebie, all the better."}
{"original": "The bulk of these deals are only offered on the official day, April 17, but a few deals started early and some extend past Tuesday, Yarbrough said. Some of the deals are general freebies, while other restaurants and retailers are offering discount prices, reflecting the 'stats and numbers' reminiscent of Tax Season -- like Boston Market's deal for a $10.40 meal special, playing up the Form 1040 reference."}
{"original": "Here are some of the best tax day freebies:"}
{"original": "The fast-food chain is giving away sausage biscuit sandwiches from 7 a.m. until 10 a.m. on Tuesday. The key: Customers need to say the password Made from Scratch to get the deal, according to a spokesman. It's the first time Hardee's has offered a tax day deal."}
{"original": "The bagel chain is offering its Big Bagel Bundle for $10.40 on Tuesday. The bundle includes 13 bagels and two tubs of cream cheese, which the company says is a savings of about $3.50 from the regular price."}
{"original": "The chain most known for its sandwiches is offering free small original sandwich when you purchase of chips and a medium drink."}
{"original": "The sandwich chain is offering another 1040 special -- a discount of 10.40 percent from any purchase, including catering, on Tuesday. The company said customers who download its loyalty app will also receive a free four-inch sub sandwich."}
{"original": "It may not be an exclusive tax day freebee, but the dollarita -- a margarita that costs one dollar -- is back this month. The promotion began on April 1 and is available only for dine-in customers."}
{"original": "Online food ordering service Bite Squad is offering 7.5 percent off orders on Tuesday. To get the discount, use the code TAXDAY18 when ordering."}
{"original": "West Coast burger chain Farmer Boys is offering meal deals for $10.40 on Tuesday. The special includes either two double cheeseburgers for $10.40 or two breakfast burritos for the same amount. No coupon is needed, and the offer is valid all day."}
{"original": "Chuck E. Cheese is providing a buy one, get one free offer on cheese pizzas from April 17 to 19, citing the tax deadline as a stressful time for families. For every large pizza ordered, the chain will provide one large cheese pizza for free."}
{"original": "The pizza chain is offering another deal on a pie. On Tuesday, the chain will sell 16-inch traditional pizzas for $10.40. Gimaldi's has locations in 13 states including California and Texas."}
{"original": "The sandwich shot is offering a free medium sub when you buy a full-priced large or medium sub, chips and a drink. The deal is good from tax day through April 19 with this coupon."}
{"original": "Noodles & Co. will offer $4 off orders of $10 or more through Wednesday. The deal is for online orders only, and customers should use the tax code TAXDAY18."}
{"original": "Tony Roma's will give a coupon for a free Kickin' Shrimp -- fried shrimp in a cream sauce -- when customers order an entree on Tuesday."}
{"original": "If you've ever had to write a check to Uncle Sam in April, you've likely become a fan of finding ways to cut your tax bill -- and that may have you wondering whether you qualify for any tax credits."}
{"original": "Tax credits are the gold nuggets of the tax world. Qualifying for one feels better than finding $100 in your pants pocket. Here's a brief look at how some of the most common ones work -- maybe you'll find some cash here, too."}
{"original": "First, be sure you know the difference between a tax deduction and a tax credit. A tax deduction is a dollar amount the IRS allows you to subtract from your adjusted gross income (AGI), making your taxable income lower. The lower your taxable income, the lower your tax bill."}
{"original": "That's pretty great, but tax credits are even better. They're dollar-for-dollar reductions in your actual tax bill. A few credits are even refundable, which means that if you owe $250 in taxes but qualify for a $1,000 credit, you'll get a check for $750. (Most tax credits, however, aren't refundable.)"}
{"original": "Either way, as a simplified example, a $10,000 tax credit makes a much bigger dent in your tax bill than a $10,000 tax deduction does."}
{"original": "Some of the most popular tax credits fall into one of three big categories. These are just summaries; tax credits have lots of rules, so it's a good idea to consult a tax professional. Your state may offer a variety of tax credits as well."}
{"original": "No. 1 -- People with kids"}
{"original": "Child tax credit. This could get you up to $1,000 per kid. The higher your income, the less you'll qualify for. If you are married and filing jointly for 2016, the IRS docks the credit once your modified AGI hits $110,000."}
{"original": "Child and dependent care credit. Generally, it's 20 percent to 35 percent of up to $3,000 of day care and similar costs for a child under 13, an incapacitated spouse or parent, or another dependent so you can work -- and up to $6,000 of expenses for two or more dependents."}
{"original": "The percentage is income-based: Families with AGIs of $15,000 or less can get a credit of 35 percent of their expenses, but that shrinks by one percentage point for every extra $2,000 of income. The rate is 20 percent for AGIs of more than $43,000. Payments made out of a dependent-care flexible spending account or other tax-advantaged program at work may reduce your credit."}
{"original": "Earned income credit. This credit will get you between $3,373 and $6,269 in tax year 2016 and between $3,400 and $6,318 in 2017 depending on how many kids you have, your marital status and how much you make. If your AGI is less than $54,000, it's something to look into, though if you had more than around $3,400 of investment income, dividends, capital gains and a few other things in 2016 ($3,450 in 2017), you won't qualify."}
{"original": "Note: You can get up to $506 in 2016 and $510 in 2017 from the earned income credit even if you don't have kids, though only if your income is less than $14,880 in 2016 if you're single ($15,010 in 2017) or $20,430 if you're filing jointly ($20,600 in 2017)."}
{"original": "Adoption credit. For the 2016 tax year, this covers up to $13,460 of adoption costs per child. The credit begins to phase out at $201,920 of income, and people with AGIs higher than $241,920 don't qualify. The adoption has to be final before you can take the credit. Also, you can't take the credit if you're adopting your spouse's child. People who adopt special-needs children can get up to the full $13,460 even if their actual expenses were less."}
{"original": "No. 2 -- People investing in an education or retirement"}
{"original": "The saver's credit: This runs 10 percent to 50 percent of up to $2,000 in contributions to an IRA, 401(k), 403(b) or certain other retirement plans ($4,000 if filing jointly) for 2016. The percentage depends on your filing status and income, but generally it's something to look at if your AGI is less than $61,500."}
{"original": "American Opportunity credit: This credit runs up to $2,500 per student for tuition, activity fees, books, supplies and equipment during the first four years of college. The student must be enrolled at least half-time and can't have any felony drug convictions. This credit phases out with income, so you may not qualify if your AGI is higher than $90,000 as a single filer or $180,000 as a joint filer. Parents can take the credit if they qualify and claim the student as a dependent on their return."}
{"original": "Lifetime Learning credit: With this credit, you can get up to $2,000 for tuition, activity fees, books, supplies and equipment for undergraduate, graduate or even nondegree courses at accredited institutions. Unlike the American Opportunity credit, there's no workload requirement. The $2,000 limit is per return, not per student, so the most you can get back is $2,000 regardless of how many students you pay expenses for."}
{"original": "This credit also phases out with income, so you may not qualify in 2016 if your modified AGI is higher than $65,000 as a single filer or $131,000 as a joint filer. If you take this credit, you can't take the American Opportunity credit, and vice versa."}
{"original": "No. 3 -- People who made big-ticket green purchases"}
{"original": "Residential energy tax credits: This one is actually two separate credits. One gets you up to $500 for things that make your home more energy-efficient, such as advanced air-circulating fans and energy-efficient water heaters, furnaces, insulation, doors, windows or other items. The other gets you up to 30% of the cost of solar electric or water equipment, fuel cells, residential wind equipment and geothermal heat pumps. You can include the cost of labor, but you can't include equipment for your pool or hot tub."}
{"original": "Plug-in electric-drive motor vehicle credit: You could get up to $7,500 for buying a plug-in electric vehicle. The IRS requires that the car have at least four wheels and be propelled to a significant extent by a rechargeable battery with a capacity of at least four kilowatt hours. The minimum credit is $2,500 but rises depending on battery capacity. You must buy the car new; used cars don't count."}

{"original": "Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., introduced a bill on Friday to decriminalize marijuana and allow for it to be taxed and regulated. The bill is titled S. 420, in a reference to marijuana culture."}
{"original": "The proposal, identical to a bill in the House, aims to ease the longstanding conflict between states where cannabis is legal in some form and the U.S. government, which categorizes marijuana as a dangerous illegal drug, similar to LSD or heroin. The American Civil Liberties Union estimates that around half of all drug arrests are for marijuana possession."}
{"original": "Many politicians have framed legalization as a criminal justice issue, as African Americans are more likely to be arrested on marijuana-related charges than whites."}
{"original": "The federal prohibition of marijuana is wrong, plain and simple, Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement. Too many lives have been wasted, and too many economic opportunities have been missed."}
{"original": "It remains unclear if Wyden's bill would have a chance at clearing the Republican-controlled Senate."}
{"original": "The Democratic majority in the House appears more open to considering proposals to ease federal restrictions on marijuana. The chamber has set a hearing next week on a bill intended to make banking services more widely available for pot companies."}
{"original": "A proposal similar to Wyden's previously languished in the Senate and House. However, Rep. Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat carrying the current bill in the House, said voters have elected the most pro-cannabis Congress in American history."}
{"original": "It's tough to see how things will shake out, but there is a very serious chance cannabis policy reform will move in the Senate, said Morgan Fox of the National Cannabis Industry Association."}
{"original": "Most Americans live in states where pot can be legally purchased for medical or recreational use, and the move to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana came as the issue has played into the emerging 2020 presidential campaign."}
{"original": "The proposal would take marijuana off the federal controlled substances list and remove federal criminal penalties for individuals and businesses acting in compliance with state marijuana laws. The bill would allow marijuana to be taxed and regulated like alcohol, and reduce barriers for legal marijuana businesses to get access to banking."}
{"original": "The bill is part of a three-bill package: A second would impose a tax on marijuana products similar to federal excise taxes on alcohol, while a third would allow state-legal marijuana businesses to claim tax deductions and credits."}
{"original": "Justin Strekal, political director of the pro-legalization group NORML, said in a statement that the proposal is another sign of the growing public support for ending our failed war on cannabis consumers."}

{"original": "The following is a transcript of an interview with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow that aired Sunday, March 15, 2020, on Face the Nation."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're going to turn now to the director of the White House National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow. Good to have you here."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: American lives changed dramatically. There is an economic impact to all of this. People are worried about paychecks and the like. I want ask you specifically about the bill that the House has passed that would provide paid leave and other assurances. When do you expect the Senate to vote and for the president to actually sign it into law?"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: Well, it would be a big help. It may not be a perfect bill, but it gets done. Essentially what we want it to get done, take care of individuals, people on hourly wages, families, kids home. If your spouse is home. A lot of people may have to stay home in the weeks ahead, we want them to get paid."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the Senate already scheduling a vote? And will it be on the president's desk within days?"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: Well, I think the Senate is going to work on it tomorrow. I hate to predict that legislative calendar, but I think there is an urgency to this, something we've pushed from the very beginning. You know, again, it's about- it's about helping families and middle income and blue collar type folks. They should not be penalized financially. And we don't want to force them to go outdoors when they should be indoors. So I think this would be a big plus. And yes, I think the Senate will get it done pretty rapidly."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Some big corporations already have paid leave policies."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this bill doesn't apply to--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you have 500 employees and above, you're not impacted by this bill. Why? How do you guarantee that the people who fall into these categories will still be able to take leave, go home and put food on their table and afford to do what the government is telling them to do?"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: Fall into which categories, MARGARET, the lower category?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have- if you're 50 employees or less, you can have a hardship exemption--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --if you're 500 or more employees this doesn't--"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: You qualify for- if you're 500 or less--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you're in that middle range you're impacted--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you're above that you're not required--"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: And that includes self- that includes self-employed people also. It's very important. Well, look, the last word on that, we don't know yet. I mean, if larger companies get into trouble, we will be looking at the possibilities using the full powers of the federal government, which are quite substantial during an emergency declaration like this. We will be look to helping any individuals who might get left behind or might have a danger of getting left behind. You know, in this bill, free testing, I think is a very big thing. And I also think the food stamp additions particularly if kids have come home because the schools are closed down. So we will- we have lots of ways and means to make sure nobody falls through the cracks here."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president speaking to grocers today I saw on the schedule. If you go into a lot of grocery stores, there are empty shelves right now. What is the supply line like? Can you guarantee people that they will be able to stay home and feed themselves?"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: Well, I'm going to say yes. Knowing there may be some exceptions to this. I've now- I've read about some situations where this is a difficulty, but most of our supply lines are working pretty well in the domestic United States. If I may make a point. I mean, there's a huge economic challenge here. Do not get me wrong, a huge economic challenge. On the other hand, most of America is still working. There was a good story in the journal yesterday about this. Factories are not shutting down across the country, at least not yet."}
{"original": "KUDLOW: The employment story, which may become more tenuous in the weeks ahead. I understand that. Nonetheless, a lot of CEOs I talked to, they're doing everything they can. I just talked to somebody, a CEO of a big car company not to lay off anybody. So, I--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have projections on possible layoffs? What is the White House preparing for?"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: I'm not going to put numbers out this morning. I would just say--"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: We're- we're looking at everything right now as best we can. You know, so much of this, because of the unusual nature of this virus, so much of this is new. It's very hard to model stuff--"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: --you don't have much experience with. We're going to- my view, we go day by day, fact by fact, report by report, phone call by phone call. But I do want to make this point: across the board in order to assist, I call it fiscal assistance, in order to assist individuals and families and small business, we've put on the board 400 billion dollars already, and that includes the paid family leave that you're talking about before."}
{"original": "KUDLOW: It also includes small business assistance."}
{"original": "KUDLOW: Very large significant sum. It also includes deferred tax payments with no interest penalties."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the travel related industries?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you looking at a bailout--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --for airlines? Like loan guarantees?"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: Before I get to the bailout, I also want to mention some other important areas here. President is going to- by executive order I reckon, we will defer the interest on student loans for the rest of the year. Also because of the mishmash between Saudi Arabia and Russia, we want to put our energy people out of business. They never will. We are purchasing--"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: --75 million barrels from the Strategic--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you said- I just want to clarify, you did use the word bailout."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is- well, what is it that you were preparing to do for the travel related industries? Is it loan guarantees? Can airlines plan on that?"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: It could be. Look, we're talking to the airlines. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is deeply involved. We talk every day."}
{"original": "KUDLOW: We're gonna go up to the hill this week. We will have a number of new proposals with respect to the airlines."}
{"original": "KUDLOW: We've got issues on cruise ships. We've got issues on the whole leisure story. But I just feel, look, this is a story that will be very challenging in the short run."}
{"original": "KUDLOW: But, MARGARET, this is not a story of years. This is a story of weeks and months."}
{"original": "KUDLOW: We come in- strong economy by all accounts."}
{"original": "KUDLOW: And I think by the end of this year, we will be back to a strong economy. But we're taking these fiscal assistance measures just to make sure. And please,--"}
{"original": "KUDLOW: --I don't want to leave out, the president strongly supports the payroll tax holiday."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, which is not his bill."}
{"original": "KUDLOW: Which would be enormous benefit—"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we'll talk. Okay."}
{"original": "KUDLOW: --to the middle class and blue collar workers."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll have to see."}
{"original": "KUDLOW: It would be an enormous benefit."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll look for you to put that to Congress. It's not in the current bill. We have to leave it there."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we come back, the CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, will join us."}
{"original": "The IRS began accepting 2019 tax returns Monday, January 27."}
{"original": "Refunds are the biggest paycheck of the year for almost half of taxpayers, who often use them to pay bills or add to an emergency fund."}
{"original": "The tax agency says most refunds will be paid within three weeks of filing."}
{"original": "Whether it brings dread or anticipation, the tax season is officially opened. The IRS began accepting 2019 tax returns on January 27 for the 2019 tax year, with more than 150 million taxpayers expected to file this year."}
{"original": "The biggest question on taxpayers' minds may be how long they'll have to wait for their refunds. Last year, the IRS issued refunds for about 70% of the roughly 155 million tax returns that were filed through December 27. The average refund check last year was $2,869, or about 1.4% less than in 2018."}
{"original": "Even if refunds are shrinking, they represent the largest paycheck each year for about 44% of taxpayers, according to a December survey from Credit Karma. Its study found that taxpayers look forward to their refunds to manage their finances, such as paying bills or socking away money into an emergency fund. That might help explain why taxpayers eagerly anticipate their annual refund checks."}
{"original": "So how long does the typical taxpayer need to wait for their refund check after filing? Within about 21 calendar days, according to the IRS. However, the tax agency notes that it can take longer to receive your refund, typically because the IRS needs more time to process the return in case of errors or other problems."}
{"original": "After filing your tax return, you can check your refund status at this IRS website."}
{"original": "However, it's important to note that taxpayers who file paper returns won't be able to see their refund status until four weeks after they mailed the return, the IRS says. For taxpayers relying on electronic filing, they'll be able to see their refund status after 24 hours of filing, the agency adds."}
{"original": "Tax refunds might be welcome relief to your bank account, but it's important to remember that you've essentially given an interest-free loan to the U.S. government by overpaying your taxes. Consumers can adjust their withholding by revising their W-4 forms with their employers to ensure they aren't overpaying the taxman throughout the year."}
{"original": "Several million people stand to save hundreds of dollars in health insurance costs, or more, under the Democratic coronavirus relief legislation on track to pass Congress."}
{"original": "Winners include those covered by Obamacare or just now signing up, self-employed people who buy their own insurance and don't currently get federal help, laid-off workers struggling to retain employer coverage, and most anyone collecting unemployment. Also, potentially many more could benefit if about a dozen states accept a Medicaid deal in the legislation."}
{"original": "Taken together, the components of the coronavirus bill represent the biggest expansion of federal help for health insurance since the Obama-era Affordable Care Act more than 10 years ago. Obamacare not only survived President Donald Trump's repeated attempts to tear it down but will now get a shot of new life."}
{"original": "Consider a couple of examples: A hypothetical 45-year-old making $58,000 now gets no aid under the ACA. With the bill, they'd be entitled to a $1,250 tax credit, or 20% off their premiums, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A 64-year-old making $19,300 already gets generous subsidies that reduce premiums to $800 a year. But with the bill, that person would pay no premiums for a standard plan."}
{"original": "Because health insurance is so complicated, consumers are going to have to do their homework to figure out if there's something in the bill for them. And health care benefits are not like stimulus checks that can be blasted out. Experts say there will be a lag as government agencies, insurers and employers unpack the bill's provisions."}
{"original": "There's also a political twist. Since most of the health care aid is keyed to the pandemic and expires by the end of 2022, that will let Democrats set up election-year votes to make new benefits permanent, or build them out even more."}
{"original": "There was always a hope that we were going to be able to return and build on where we started in 2009-2010, and we finally got to a place where it was possible, said Judy Solomon of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Her organization advocates on behalf of low-income people and was an early supporter of the health care law."}
{"original": "We had this massive fight that went on for 10 years, said blogger Robert Laszewski, who followed Obamacare for an industry audience. Over the weekend, it's like it's been erased."}
{"original": "The COVID-19 bill follows President Joe Biden's strategy of building on the health law to move the U.S. toward coverage for all. It's still unclear how big a dent the legislation will make in the number of uninsured people, which has risen to an estimated 33 million or more."}
{"original": "A major health care item in the bill will depend on some Republican-led states going along. States mainly in the South have refused to expand their Medicaid programs to low-income adults under the ACA. The legislation offers them a temporary infusion of billions of dollars to reconsider. If those states, including Texas, Florida and Georgia, were to do that, Biden would be closer to his coverage goal."}
{"original": "Even if the hold-outs spurn the offer, the legislation provides plenty of other benefits."}
{"original": "The biggest winners will be the more than 11 million people already enrolled in Obamacare as well as those who are now shopping for HealthCare.gov coverage. Biden has opened up a special sign-up period through May 15."}
{"original": "The bill would change the formulas for health insurance tax credits to make them more generous for most people, and also allow a wider number of individuals to qualify. That makes coverage more attractive for people who are considering whether to buy and more affordable for those who already have it, mainly low-to-moderate income working people."}
{"original": "Insurers are hoping that the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will be able to quickly update HealthCare.gov software, allowing the companies to promote lower premiums and attract more consumers while the current sign-up window remains open. The industry also wants the agency to automatically adjust what existing customers are paying, sparing millions the headache of having to go back and reapply."}
{"original": "In a politically significant change, the bill would provide health insurance tax credits to people with solid middle-class incomes who don't now qualify for help with their premiums. That's a demographic that includes many self-employed people and business owners who were hit with higher premiums as a result of the ACA, but cut out of the benefits. Their complaints fueled Republican opposition to the health law. These are the people Trump was responding to, said Laszewski."}
{"original": "Another inducement is aimed at people who have lost jobs. Those who collect unemployment this year, if even for one week, would qualify for the most generous ACA tax credits as well as its biggest reductions in copays and deductibles."}
{"original": "Other people who lose their jobs may want to keep their employer coverage. A federal law known as COBRA allows that, but the employee has to pay the full premium, often a prohibitive expense. The bill would provide a temporary 100% subsidy."}
{"original": "Republicans cite the health insurance provisions as an example of coronavirus overreach by Democrats. Policy consultant Brian Blase, a former health care adviser in the Trump White House, said most of the additional subsidies for coverage will merely substitute for what private households would have otherwise paid. If made permanent, he predicts that over time the sweeter tax credits will have the unintended consequence of enticing small businesses to stop offering coverage to their workers."}
{"original": "This subsidy expansion largely replaces private spending with government spending. Blase said."}
{"original": "Edward Gallagher served nearly two decades in the United States military in relative obscurity. That all changed when President Donald Trump used his powers as Commander-in-Chief to aid the Navy SEAL."}
{"original": "The veteran warfighter, with four combat tours across Afghanistan and Iraq, was facing a court martial on charges stemming from his final deployment. The most serious was an accusation of premeditated murder for stabbing and killing an ISIS fighter in 2017."}
{"original": "This week on 60 Minutes, contributor and CBS News national security correspondent David Martin spoke with Gallagher in his first television interview about the day that changed his life."}
{"original": "Gallagher was arrested in September 2018. The formal charges brought against Gallagher at his court martial read:"}
{"original": "Article 80 - attempted murder, two specifications"}
{"original": "Article 92 - violation of a lawful general order, one specification"}
{"original": "Article 118 - premeditated murder, one specification"}
{"original": "Article 134 – violation of conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline and service discrediting, three specifications"}
{"original": "The general court martial jury was comprised of seven members of the military. If found guilty of murder, Gallagher faced the possibility of life in prison."}
{"original": "Awaiting the trial, Gallagher spent 201 days in the brig until President Trump intervened and ordered the Bronze Star recipient to less restrictive confinement in recognition of his prior service to the nation."}
{"original": "In honor of his past service to our Country, Navy Seal #EddieGallagher will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court. Process should move quickly! @foxandfriends @RepRalphNorman — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2019"}
{"original": "The trial began on June 17, 2019 and lasted for 10 days. After eight hours of deliberation, the jury acquitted Gallagher on all but one of the charges after another member of the SEAL Team 7 platoon testified, under an immunity agreement, to being the murderer."}
{"original": "The lone guilty verdict came for taking a photo with the dead ISIS fighter. It carried a maximum sentence of four months in the brig. Gallagher walked free for time served, and he credits President Trump's actions for his freedom."}
{"original": "Eddie Gallagher with the dead ISIS prisoner he was accused of killing."}
{"original": "If the president hadn't intervened in any way? No, I believe I'd be in prison for life, Gallagher told 60 Minutes. I was able to get out of the brig and actually properly defend myself."}
{"original": "Gallagher's defense lawyers were paid for, in part, by the non-profit Navy SEALs Fund. The financial assistance helped Gallagher afford the services of his defense team, including Timothy Parlatore, Bernard Kerik and Marc Mukasey."}
{"original": "Parlatore is a Naval Academy graduate turned lawyer who was brought into the case by Kerik. Kerik is a former New York City police commissioner who pled guilty to felony tax fraud and lying to White House officials in 2009. The President granted Kerik clemency in February. Mukasey also represents the Trump organization, most notably in a case brought by the Manhattan District Attorney seeking the President's tax returns."}
{"original": "Mukasey says the President's actions did not affect the outcome of the Gallagher trial."}
{"original": "We tried a real murder case … [with] prosecutors that, as far as I could tell, were apolitical, and defense lawyers that were apolitical, Mukasey remarked to 60 Minutes. It was fought on the field of legal battle. And that's where it was won and lost."}
{"original": "In an interview with Mukasey, correspondent David Martin pressed him on his connections to the President and whether Trump played a role in the case."}
{"original": "David Martin: Did you talk to the president about this case?"}
{"original": "Marc Mukasey: I don't disclose who I talk to with respect to clients. He congratulated me after the verdict."}
{"original": "David Martin: Well? So you did talk to the president about this case?"}
{"original": "Marc Mukasey: Not during its pendency."}
{"original": "David Martin: But after the verdict, you talked to him about this case."}
{"original": "Marc Mukasey: That's all I'm gonna say."}
{"original": "David Martin: Well, that is a yes, right?"}
{"original": "Marc Mukasey: That's all I'm going to say. Many people congratulated me."}
{"original": "Congratulations to Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher, his wonderful wife Andrea, and his entire family. You have been through much together. Glad I could help! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019"}
{"original": "But the Gallagher case was far from over. The court martial found Gallagher guilty of conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline for posing with a dead ISIS fighter. He was demoted a rank. Additionally, the Navy moved to assemble a Naval Special Warfare review board to determine whether Gallagher was permitted to retain his Trident pin, a symbol of the elite status of Navy SEAL team members."}
{"original": "The President intervened again on behalf of Gallagher, this time using his power as Commander-in-Chief to restore the Navy SEAL's rank and ensure he kept his Trident pin."}
{"original": "In an effort to allow the Navy to follow its standard procedure, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer contacted the White House directly, requesting that the President not interfere in the matter. The appeal was rebuffed and cost Spencer his job for going behind the back of Secretary of Defense Mark Esper."}
{"original": "On his final day at the Pentagon, Richard Spencer spoke with David Martin and said that the President's actions send a message to the troops that they can get away with things. Spencer suggested matters of discipline be handled internally by senior enlisted members of the military who serve on review boards."}
{"original": "You have to have good order and discipline; it's the backbone of what we do, Spencer told Martin in his only television interview after he was fired. The Trident review process with the senior enlisted reviewing fellow senior enlisted is critical. The senior enlisted of our military are the backbone of our military. They are the girder of good order and discipline. They can handle this."}
{"original": "The now-retired 40-year-old Gallagher remains a staunch supporter of the President and recently visited Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, FL."}
{"original": "I have not been personally asked to campaign for his reelection from him, Gallagher told 60 Minutes. But if he asks me, if he wants me to help out in any way, yes. I would. He helped save my life."}
{"original": "The video above was produced by Will Croxton, Keith Zubrow, and Brit McCandless Farmer. It was edited by Will Croxton."}
{"original": "At the launch of tax season, a coalition of consumer groups is issuing a sobering warning to taxpayers: Hot dog vendors and hair stylists are regulated more strictly than paid tax preparers in many states. That can allow preparers to charge exorbitant fees for inaccurate -- even fraudulent -- returns that can ultimately cost consumers thousands of dollars."}
{"original": "Errors on tax forms put consumers at risk of fines and lost refunds, yet few states have taken action to ensure that paid tax preparers are licensed, trained and disclose what are often high and unpredictable fees, said Tom Feltner, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, in a statement."}
{"original": "Indeed, studies of tax return accuracy have shown an astounding number of errors. A 2014 mystery shopper test by the Government Accountability Office found that only 11 percent of the returns studied were accurate. A 2015 study by the National Consumer Law Center uncovered errors in 93 percent of the returns reviewed."}
{"original": "Calling for increased state regulation of the industry, representatives of 10 consumer groups said Wednesday that a survey of more than 1,000 adults found widespread support for licensing, testing and uniform disclosures in the tax preparation industry."}
{"original": "Only four states -- California, Oregon, Maryland and New York -- require tax preparers to be licensed and tested for a basic level of competence. However, the consumer groups found in a new poll that eight in 10 consumers support requiring tax preparers to be licensed and able to pass a test indicating that they have the knowledge and training to complete returns accurately. Nearly one in nine thought tax preparers ought to disclose their fees upfront, instead of revealing them after the fact, which is all too common in the industry."}
{"original": "It's not surprising that American consumers have the common sense to know that tax preparers should be held to some standards -- what's surprising is that Congress has not come to the same conclusion, said Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center."}
{"original": "In the absence of federal legislation, the consumer groups said that states should act."}
{"original": "State legislatures have the authority to implement common sense protections for taxpayers, said Michael Best, senior policy advocate with the Consumer Federation of America. The coalition is urging state legislatures to pass a model law drawn up by the National Consumer Law Center that requires up-front fee disclosures, licensing, testing and continuing education for paid preparers."}
{"original": "But for this tax season, at least, consumers are on their own. How can you protect yourself from an incompetent or dishonest preparer?"}
{"original": "First, know that while few states require licensing, any preparer that has the title of enrolled agent, certified public accountant or that is also a tax attorney must conform with standards set up by their professional organizations, which already demand licensing, testing and continuing education. Ask if your preparer has one of these professional designations and inquire about his or her fees -- both how they're calculated and for an estimate of what your return will cost."}
{"original": "Can't afford a highly trained professional? Anyone earning less than $62,000 in 2015 can have their federal return prepared for free online via the Internal Revenue Service's Free File Alliance. State returns can also often be completed online for free at your state taxing authority's website. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance programs and Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs will also provide free in-person preparation for poor and elderly individuals. You can find VITA and TCE programs on the IRS website by plugging in your zip code."}
{"original": "In absence of state regulation, don't assume that anyone who hangs out a shingle offering tax preparation can be trusted, the consumer groups warn. Consumers, not their paid preparers, are on the hook for the accuracy of their tax returns. And the penalty for mistakes can be severe. If you claim the Earned Income Tax Credit when you're not eligible, for instance, you can lose the right to claim that credit for up to 10 years."}
{"original": "You wouldn't give your Social Security number to your stylist or your bank account information to a hot dog vendor, said Ali Mickelson, director of tax and legislative policy for the Colorado Fiscal Institute. Yet these people are more regulated than tax preparers who are entrusted with your most sensitive financial information."}
{"original": "Added Linda Sherry, national priorities director for Consumer Action: The thought that consumers pay good money for bad advice is appalling. New consumer protections must be adopted to ensure that taxpayers can rely on the advice they are paying for."}
{"original": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew urged Congress on Friday to pass legislation by March to help ease Puerto Rico's economic crisis before it's too late."}
{"original": "Lew made the request in a letter to U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, as he announced an upcoming trip to the island to meet with government officials and business leaders to talk about the financial situation."}
{"original": "Although there are many ways this crisis could escalate further, it is clear that Puerto Rico is already in the midst of an economic collapse, Lew wrote. It is time for Congress to act to provide order to a chaotic and worsening situation."}
{"original": "Puerto Rico is struggling with $72 billion in public debt that the governor has said is unpayable and needs restructuring. The island recently defaulted on $37 million in interest on bonds and faces its first lawsuit over how it has diverted funds to meet certain bond payments. Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla has already warned that Puerto Rico doesn't have money for upcoming bond payments including $400 million due in May."}
{"original": "Lew is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with officials and community leaders to talk about the proposal that President Barack Obama's administration presented Congress to create a territorial bankruptcy regime that would allow Puerto Rico's government to restructure its debt and impose new oversight on finances and expand Medicaid benefits, among other things."}
{"original": "Puerto Rico does not have access to any local or federal bankruptcy laws. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court recently announced it would hear an appeal on a ruling that barred Puerto Rico from giving municipalities the power to declare bankruptcy."}
{"original": "Ryan spokeswoman Ash Lee Strong said the speaker has ordered the House committees of jurisdiction to work with the Puerto Rican government, review options and report back by the end of the first quarter. Ryan has pledged the House will come up this year with a responsible solution for Puerto Rico's debt problems. Meanwhile, Garcia praised Lew's letter."}
{"original": "We thank Secretary Lew for reminding Congressional leaders that they can still prevent this humanitarian crisis from spinning out of control, he said."}
{"original": "Republican leaders including Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, have demanded to see audited financial statements from Puerto Rico, but they have not materialized. Jesus Manuel Ortiz, public affairs secretary for the Puerto Rican government, said Friday that the statements are nearly ready and would be produced soon, although he didn't specify a date."}
{"original": "Puerto Rico is struggling with an increasingly dwindling cash flow that has threatened to cut off gasoline and electricity to certain public and private institutions. Almost 10 percent of Puerto Rico's population has left since 2006 and hundreds of businesses have closed, with Walmart (WMT) announcing Friday that it would shutter seven supermarkets on the island as part of a global restructuring."}
{"original": "Lew noted in the letter that Puerto Rico has not had access to the municipal bond market for more than two years and ran out of funding sources commonly used to finance government operations more than six months ago."}
{"original": "More recently, Puerto Rico has resorted to a series of onerous and unsustainable emergency liquidity measures, including selling assets from already depleted pension funds; borrowing from the workers compensation and other insurance funds; and withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in tax refunds, he wrote."}
{"original": "Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, said he expects to meet with Lew and stress that immediate measures are needed to avoid what he said would be enormous government defaults."}
{"original": "NEW YORKBernie Sanders doled out some of his harshest criticism yet for chief rival Hillary Clinton and delivered a warning to Wall Street Tuesday: If you do not end your greed, we will end it for you."}
{"original": "In a speech at midtown Manhattan's Town Hall Theatre, Sanders argued to approximately 1800 supporters Clinton is wrong on Wall Street reform and that establishment politicians like her should cut it out."}
{"original": "Secretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry, he said. I disagree."}
{"original": "Clinton has proposed a substantial annual risk fee that would be levied on too-big-to-fail institutions -- companies with over $50 billion in assets, and a tax on high-frequency trading. She would also give more power to regulators to break up big non-bank financial institutions if necessary. But she does not call outright for the breakup of such companies."}
{"original": "Sanders based his criticism of Clinton on her view of Glass-Steagall, a 1933 measure that walled off commercial banking from investment banking. Bill Clinton signed its repeal in 1999."}
{"original": "My opponent, Secretary Clinton, says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits, Sanders said. Secretary Clinton is wrong."}
{"original": "A staple of Sanders' campaign platform is combating shadow banks and similar institutions. The senator proposed that within 100 days of becoming president, he would require his secretary of the Treasury to establish a Too-Big-to-Fail list of commercial banks, shadow banks, and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout."}

{"original": "A day before Tuesday's speech, Clinton's campaign took a preemptive strike against Sanders' proposals. Hillary For America Chief Financial Officer, Gary Gensler, issued a statement calling for Sanders to offer more comprehensive plans and to in fact endorse Clinton's, which he said will rein in risky behavior within the shadow banking sector."}
{"original": "Unfortunately, Senator Sanders has so far taken a hands-off approach to some of the riskiest institutions and activities in our economy, which were among the biggest culprits during the 2008 crisis, Gensler said."}
{"original": "Sanders' communications director Michael Briggs responded Monday in kind to the Clinton campaign's pre-buttal."}
{"original": "Sen. Sanders won't be taking advice on how to regulate Wall Street from a former Goldman Sachs partner and a former Treasury Department official who helped Wall Street rig the system, Briggs said, referring to Gensler, who also served as head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission."}
{"original": "In addition to aggressive regulation, Sanders promised to punish big bankers linked to the financial crisis."}

{"original": "The Senate voted Monday evening to confirm Janet Yellen as treasury secretary with bipartisan support. The final breakdown of the vote was 84 yeas to 15 nays. Yellen is the first woman to lead the department in its more than 230-year history."}
{"original": "I look forward to working with her to get our economy back on track and Americans back to work, Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden tweeted immediately following the vote."}
{"original": "As we face an economic crisis brought on by COVID-19, we will need steady, proven leadership at the Treasury Department, said Republican Senator Susan Collins in a statement after voting for Yellen. A highly respected economist, Dr. Yellen served first as vice chair and then chair of the Federal Reserve. She has served under Democratic and Republican presidents and during periods of economic crisis and economic growth."}
{"original": "All 15 votes against Yellen's confirmation came from Republicans lawmakers. Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, one of those who voted against Yellen, said in a statement that Yellen backs policies proposed by President Biden I cannot support."}
{"original": "She seems too eager to raise taxes on the American people, her energy policies are job killers, and her willingness to unilaterally double the federal minimum wage with little regard for its impact on jobs is frightening, Cramer continued."}

{"original": "Her nomination was advanced by the Senate Finance Committee Friday with unanimous support, 26 to 0, and both Democrats and Republicans praised her after the committee vote. I think this is a great way to start the new year, with a unanimous vote on behalf of someone who I believe may in fact be the most competent, qualified secretary of the treasury we have ever had, said committee member Senator Debbie Stabenow."}
{"original": "Ranking member Senator Ron Wyden called Yellen an NBA All-Star when it comes to clearing the Senate nomination process, noting Yellen has been previously confirmed four times for economic positions by the Senate."}
{"original": "Yellen's first order of business will be helping to lead the U.S. out of an ongoing economic crisis stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, which has left more than 10 million people unemployed and millions more struggling to make ends meet."}
{"original": "She is the first person ever who will have served as treasury secretary, Federal Reserve Board chair, and chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers."}
{"original": "Republicans also acknowledged Yellen extensive background in the economic sector and President Biden's right to pick his own Cabinet members."}
{"original": "There's no doubt about the qualifications of Dr. Yellen, said Chairman Chuck Grassley before voting for Yellen. That's not to say however that I do not have concerns, but they're policy concerns. I do not support some of what I believe will be some of Dr. Yellen's political agenda."}
{"original": "Other Republican members of the committee took a similar approach, both lavishing praise but also raising possible concerns ahead."}
{"original": "I believe Janet Yellen is highly qualified. As it was said earlier, maybe one of the most qualified to serve, said Ohio Senator Rob Portman. I am encouraged by my conversation with her about fiscal sanity where she said she would be a voice for fiscal sanity within the administration at a time when we have unprecedented levels of deficit and the largest debt."}
{"original": "I have strong disagreements with Dr. Yellen on a number of her positions, particularly in the tax policy arena, but she has committed to us that she will work with us on these issues and the concerns that we have, said Idaho Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican. And I think a strong vote on our side to support her today is an indication that we want to engage."}
{"original": "Before becoming the first woman to lead the Treasury Department, Yellen was also the first woman to serve as Federal Reserve Board Chair. She is the third member of President Biden's Cabinet to be confirmed by the Senate following Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Defense Secretary retired General Lloyd Austin."}

{"original": "LOS ANGELES -- Johnny Depp's former business managers countersued the actor Tuesday, claiming his lavish lifestyle that cost more than $2 million a month to maintain caused his recent financial troubles and that the star ignored their repeated warnings."}
{"original": "The countersuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by The Management Group comes about two weeks after Depp sued the company alleging it grossly mismanaged his earnings."}
{"original": "The lawsuit said Depp paid more than $75 million to buy and maintain 14 homes, including a French chateau and a chain of islands in the Bahamas."}
{"original": "Depp also spent heavily to buy a 150-foot yacht, fly on private jets and cultivate collections of fine art and Hollywood memorabilia requiring 12 storage facilities to maintain, the lawsuit said."}
{"original": "Depp was repeatedly warned by the company that his spending was out of control but ignored his former advisors' advice to control his spending, the lawsuit said."}
{"original": "Depp, and Depp alone, is fully responsible for any financial turmoil he finds himself in today, the lawsuit stated."}
{"original": "Depp sued The Management Group on Jan. 13 seeking more than $25 million he contends was mismanaged. His lawsuit also alleged the company failed to file Depp's taxes on time, costing him $5.7 million in penalties."}
{"original": "Tuesday's countersuit said Depp's tax returns were always filed on time, and taxes were paid when the star had money available to pay them."}
{"original": "The company handled his finances from 1999 until early 2016, an especially lucrative period in the actor's career."}
{"original": "During that time, Depp launched the blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and other big-budget releases, including Alice in Wonderland and the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."}
{"original": "Depp's attorneys did not immediately respond to email and phone messages seeking comment."}
{"original": "The countersuit seeks a judge's ruling that Depp is to blame for his financial troubles, and $560,000 in fees The Management Group said it is owed."}

{"original": "U.S. equities drifted lower on Friday as buyer exhaustion set in after an exciting week."}
{"original": "Cooling investors' ardor were mixed tech earnings, lingering disappointment with President Donald Trump's tax proposal from Wednesday, a lack of progress on health insurance reform and worries about a potential government shutdown. But above all, investors were unhappy with a very weak initial reading of first-quarter U.S. GDP. Growth came in at just 0.7 percent as consumer spending posted its weakest result since the end of 2009."}
{"original": "But the stock market's losses were really quite modest, with Nasdaq even pushing to a new intraday high at the open. Wall Street, it seems, tried to focus on the silver linings in the report ahead of another busy week of economic reports and a Federal Reserve moneary policy decision on Wednesday."}
{"original": "The GDP report sure wasn't pretty: Growth slowed from the 2.1 percent pace set in 2016's fourth quarter to its worst pace in three years (chart below). Personal consumption increased just 0.3 percent following a 3.5 percent expansion in the previous quarter, which is exceedingly odd given off-the-charts survey-based measures of consumer confidence in recent months. Inventories were a drag."}
{"original": "Bright spots included nonresidential fixed investments (businesses are ramping up spending, especially in the mining sector) and residential investment, which increased at a 13.7 percent seasonally adjusted annualized rate for its second straight quarter of very strong gains. The export gap also narrowed, slightly."}
{"original": "Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, doesn't believe the weak first-quarter performance will keep the Fed from hiking rates again in June. Aside from the silver linings outlined above, he noted a tendency for weakness in first quarters that seasonal adjustments haven't fully accommodated. Since 2011, the average growth rate for the quarter is just 0.9 percent vs. 2.4 percent in each of the other three."}
{"original": "Another likely drag was unseasonably warm weather, which reduced consumer spending for utilities."}
{"original": "Overall, IHS Markit expects full-year 2017 GDP growth to come in around 2.5 percent, led by the double-digit gain in residential investment, the best growth in five quarters."}

{"original": "Washington — President Trump announced he and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin are working on a big and bold legislative package to address the coronavirus crisis. That includes looking at sending checks to Americans immediately, Mnuchin announced during a White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing Tuesday morning."}
{"original": "Mnuchin said the goal would be to get checks to Americans in two weeks to help workers cope with the economic effects of the crisis. The president wouldn't say exactly how much those checks might be — Republican Senators Tom Cotton and Mitt Romney have suggested $1,000 per adult."}
{"original": "We're going big, the president told reporters in the White House Briefing Room."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump has also pushed a payroll tax, but Mnuchin acknowledged that could take months to help average Americans. Sources with knowledge of the proposal told CBS News earlier Tuesday that the administration's proposal would total at least $850 billion."}
{"original": "We'll have a pretty good idea by the end of the day what we'll be doing, the president told reporters, before Mnuchin left the White House to meet with senators on Capitol Hill."}
{"original": "Mnuchin also announced that Americans who owe a payment to the IRS can defer up to $1 million per individual, and up to $10 million per corporation."}

{"original": "The Trump administration on Thursday unveiled a new rule intended to curtail what the administration calls birth tourism. It would give the government more power to deny certain visas to women if officials have reason to believe they intend to travel to the U.S. for the primary purpose of giving birth to a child in the country to obtain U.S. citizenship for the child."}
{"original": "According to the State Department rule in the Federal Register, pregnant women who are traveling to the U.S. for medical treatment have to provide their treatment arrangements and demonstrate their ability to pay for the treatment and any other associated costs."}
{"original": "The practice of traveling to the U.S. to give birth is fundamentally legal, although there are scattered cases of authorities arresting operators of birth tourism agencies for visa fraud or tax evasion. Women are often honest about their intentions when applying for visas and even show signed contracts with doctors and hospitals."}
{"original": "The State Department does not believe that visiting the United States for the primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for a child, by giving birth in the United States — an activity commonly referred to as 'birth tourism' — is a legitimate activity for pleasure or of a recreational nature, according to the new rule, which goes into effect Friday."}
{"original": "Since his presidential campaign began, President Trump has railed against what he called anchor babies and birthright citizenship, the guarantee under the Constitution that anyone born in the U.S. is considered a citizen. He has threatened to end the practice, but scholars and members of his administration have said it's not so easy to do."}
{"original": "Regulating tourist visas for pregnant women is one way to get at the issue, but it raises privacy concerns about how officers would determine whether a woman is pregnant and whether a woman could get turned away by border officers who suspect she may be pregnant just by looking at her."}
{"original": "Consular officers do not have the right to ask during visa interviews whether a woman is pregnant or intends to become so. But they would still have to determine whether a visa applicant would be coming to the U.S. primarily to give birth."}
{"original": "This will not be a question that officers are asking to all female applicants. They were expressly told they should not be including this as a question to ask all female applicants, a senior State Department official told reporters Thursday during a briefing on the rule. They should only bring it up as a topic if they are an specific and 'articulable' reason to believe an applicant is planing to give birth in the United States."}
{"original": "When asked, the official declined to say whether consular officers are allowed to inquire about a woman's pregnancy status based on visual cues but said it was part of the interview process. Visa applicants are asked what the stated purpose of travel is, and if the applicant says that the purpose is medical, that answer would prompt questions about what kind of treatment is being sought, and whether the applicant is pregnant."}
{"original": "Ultimately, the State Department rule may be somewhat toothless, as it applies to the visa application process, since it's based on the condition of the woman at the time of the visa application, and citizens of many countries are issued multi-entry visas for a 10-year period. This means that a woman with a valid tourist visa could become pregnant at any point in that period and decide to travel to the U.S."}
{"original": "Birth tourism has been a lucrative business in both the U.S. and abroad for years. Companies take out advertisements and charge up to $80,000 to facilitate the practice, offering hotel rooms and medical care. Many of the women travel from Russia and China to give birth in the U.S."}
{"original": "But the U.S. has been cracking down on the practice, targeting businesses that bring hundreds of pregnant women into the U.S."}
{"original": "It's not yet clear how the rule could affect the way pregnant visa holders are treated at the U.S. border. During a briefing with reporters Thursday, Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Matthew Albence, in fielding questions about the new rule mentioned the federal prosecution on visa fraud charges of Chinese nationals who were running a birth tourism business. We will certainly continue to vigorously prosecute and investigate those cases that fall underneath our purview, he said."}
{"original": "A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told CBS News that the new rule doesn't affect the agency's regulations regarding admissibility of foreign travelers, and it does not otherwise modify the standards enforced by CBP officials at ports of entry. CBP also referred further requests for more information about the rule to the State Department."}
{"original": "It's not known exactly how many foreign women travel to the U.S. specifically to give birth. The Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for stricter immigration laws, estimated that in 2012 about 36,000 foreign-born women gave birth in the U.S. and then left the country. The senior State Department official estimated that thousands have engaged in this practice and claimed that embassies have reported an uptick in the number of women who say outright that their purpose of travel is to have a baby in the U.S."}
{"original": "This rule will help eliminate the criminal activity associated with the birth tourism industry, according to the rules. The recent federal indictments describe birth tourism schemes in which foreign nationals applied for visitor visas to come to the United States and lied to consular officers about the duration of their trips, where they would stay, and their purpose of travel."}

{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We think we've worked out that technical issue in Texas and can go now to Betsy Price, who is the mayor of Fort Worth. Good morning to you, Madam Mayor."}
{"original": "FORT WORTH MAYOR BETSY PRICE: Good morning, MARGARET. Let's hope we got this worked out. It's a perfect storm, no pun intended."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm- I'm glad we're talking now. Republicans have been in charge of Texas and the energy system by default for years now. After this week's blackouts, what do you think needs to change? Do you trust the state to manage the grid?"}
{"original": "MAYOR PRICE: Well, I think the citizens are depending on their local leaders to insist that we get answers and we're going to demand those answers of the state because the state runs the power grid and we're the ones who dealt with the issues on the ground. So, yeah, they're going to have to come up with solid answers and solutions."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe the state needs to maintain control? I mean, I- I was looking into this and the majority of the ERCOT board, the energy grid operator, the people on the board don't even live in the state of Texas. Are they in touch at all with what's going on? I mean, what's the problem here?"}
{"original": "MAYOR PRICE: I certainly hope they're in touch, but it doesn't appear that way. And I think that's what surprised more people than anything is that they are not Texans who have not been living here. Most people didn't realize that, including myself. I didn't realize that. And of course, now you've had the perfect storm, a state-wide storm that's tested our system. And we just have to- we went through this 10 years ago. I know Mayor Turner said that and the solutions were put on the table. But at the time, when Texas was coming out of an economic downturn and they just didn't want to spend the money to do it. Now, our economy is strong even with COVID and we're going to have to do that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The governor has said lawmakers should make sure that Texans themselves don't have to pay for this. But I mean, let's be honest, the bills got to go somewhere. Who do you expect to pay for it?"}
{"original": "MAYOR PRICE: Well we expect the state to step up and pay it, but of course, the state is taxpayers."}
{"original": "MAYOR PRICE: You and I fund government and that's where it comes from. But the state does have a big rainy day fund and they do have access to a sales tax and things that everybody shares a piece of. They're just going to have to take a real hard look at this and see what piece gets passed back directly to consumers and what piece they pick up on it."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would not support any kind of request to the federal government for increased aid to pick up the bill for this?"}
{"original": "MAYOR PRICE: I think that we will go to the feds. It will probably be a partner on this. We'll just have to work through it and see. Right now, for me at the local level, we're focused on getting water and power back to our citizens first and foremost. We're not playing politics here. We're in public service. And we got to get power, water and food delivered to our citizens. But we're going to demand answers as we go along with this process."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need more federal resources right now? I know President Biden has had this major disaster declaration. What do you need?"}
{"original": "MAYOR PRICE: Well, FEMA has been very good about stepping up, providing water and some of the services. The state's provided some of the State Guard to help us for our services. What we're going to need most, it will appear, is probably grants to help people who have broken pipes, whose homes are flooded. My own home is flooded, and I'll have insurance to help with that, but many people don't. And so at some point, we're going to have to have additional plumbers and resources, but there's going to have to be dollars follow that to help these folks who don't have the ability to pay this themselves."}
{"original": "MAYOR PRICE: And that's going to have to come through the federal government."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you can restart vaccinations when?"}
{"original": "MAYOR PRICE: We believe we'll restart vaccinations probably tomorrow. At the very latest Tuesday morning early."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Mayor Price, thank you for your time and good luck to you. We'll be right back."}

{"original": "For LuLaRoe founder DeAnne Stidham, business is very much a family affair. After all, three companies founded by her relatives compete against Stidham's LuLaRoe, a multilevel marketer (MLM) best known for its line of colorful leggings."}
{"original": "In the months after LuLaRoe was incorporated in January 2013, Dot Dot Smile was founded by Stidham's daughter Nicole Thompson; Stidham's twin sister Dianne Ingram launched Honey & Lace; and her niece Buffy Bandley started Agnes & Dora. Dot Dot Smile specializes in children's clothes, while Honey & Lace and Agnes & Dora both offer leggings and other fashions for women."}
{"original": "Stidham started LuLaRoe, which now reportedly has more than $1 billion in sales, at her kitchen table a year before it was originally incorporated. Some of her relatives also didn't need to travel far to get launched. Thompson started Dot Dot Smile in her family room, while Bandley founded Agnes & Dora in her garage. All the MLMs say they were surprised by the overwhelming demand for their products."}
{"original": "MLM participants can earn money by both selling products and by attracting new members to join their sales teams. It's a business model that has been around for decades and includes multibillion-dollar firms such as Amway, Herbalife (HLF) and Avon (AVP). LuLaRoe isn't included in Direct Selling News' Global 100 ratings of the top MLM companies, which requires outside verification of their sales data. Companies not on the list either declined to cooperate with the trade publication or failed to respond to requests to do so."}
{"original": "Like many industries, the MLM industry is fairly incestual, said William Keep, dean of the College of New Jersey's School of Business who tracks the industry. Family members often get involved in the same MLM, and there are numerous examples of founders or high-level distributors in one MLM going on to create another. That family members would own multiple MLMs is not surprising at all."}
{"original": "LuLaRoe sales representatives, who aren't employees, had sold a line of children's clothing under the brand name Dot Dot Smile until last summer. Dot Dot Smile, which like LuLaRoe is based in Corona, California, officially registered as a limited liability company in May 2016. LuLaRoe now sells children's clothing under its own name."}
{"original": "Ultimately, the decision was made that our business was best served by Independent Fashion Retailers selling LuLaRoe products exclusively, according to LuLaRoe."}
{"original": "Dot Dot Smile has listed its entire catalog as sold out for at least the past several weeks. The company, though, is operational and even is advertising for workers at its warehouse. According to several videos posted on YouTube by Dot Dot Smile consultants in the past two months, Dot Dot Smile is actively looking for more consultants and currently claims to have a waiting list for people to join because demand for its fashions far exceeded its supplies."}
{"original": "The big thing we are waiting for is inventory, said YouTube poster Chelsey Bennett. They were expecting inventory for maybe 150 merchandisers, not thousands. We are in the thousands now. They were not prepared"}
{"original": "Poster Michelle Schaeffer assured her listeners that the initial investment in Dot Dot Smile was about $800, definitely a lot more doable than LuLaRoe, which requires new representatives to spend at least $5,000 in their initial order. That figure is considered high for the MLM industry."}
{"original": "Neither Bennett nor Schaeffer responded to emails seeking comment for this story."}
{"original": "Some former LuLaRoe consultants are now selling Dot Dot Smile's, Honey & Lace's and Agnes & Dora's lines, saying they're being treated better by the companies. Experts, though, have long argued that the vast majority of distributors in MLMs lose money."}
{"original": "They feel they're 'different' -- and I guess that remains to be seen, said Christina Hinks, a former LuLaRoe consultant and a blogger who's often critical of the company. They're all so new and launched within months of each other, which I find to be suspect."}
{"original": "Agnes & Dora got its name from a book Bandley's late grandmother Maurine Startup wrote in the 1960s called The Secret Power of Femininity, which argues that women have two sides to their personality: the confident Agnes and the playful fun-loving Dora. Startup was also the mother of DeAnnne Stidham and Dianne Ingram. Bandley's mother is Stidham's and Ingram's sister Cheryl Worsley, according to genealogy records."}
{"original": "LuLaRoe has no relationship with any other apparel companies, and it declined to comment on whether it considers the other MLMs to be competitors. Dot Dot Smile, Honey & Lace and Agnes & Dora didn't return calls seeking comment."}
{"original": "As for relations with the other MLMs, LuLaRoe in a statement said, DeAnne and her husband, Mark Stidham (LuLaRoe's CEO), are part of an extended family with a long tradition of entrepreneurship."}
{"original": "Current and former LuLaRoe sales representatives have accused the company of overstating the potential rewards and understating the costs of selling its line. Two lawsuits have been filed accusing LuLaRoe of knowingly selling defective merchandise, while another legal challenge accuses the multilevel marketer of charging sales tax in states that don't collect it on clothing sales."}
{"original": "LuLaRoe also is accused of stealing a lion design from a Hungarian artist. It has denied wrongdoing in all the legal cases."}
{"original": "LuLaRoe has been trying to burnish its public image in recent weeks. Last month, it announced it would make it easier for customers to get refunds for defective merchandise. The company also began addressing the backlog of complaints lodged with the Better Business Bureau that the company had ignored for months. BBB, however, continues to give LuLaRoe a failing grade of F because it hasn't responded to all the issues."}
{"original": "As the coronavirus pandemic has forced millions of women out of the workforce, including many affected by a lack of childcare at home, efforts to support moms are gaining traction. Now a group of prominent men are throwing their support behind a push to help them."}
{"original": "On Thursday, 50 men signed a letter in the Washington Post calling on Congress to support the so-called Marshall Plan for Moms. The group, many of whom are fathers, includes basketball player Steph Curry, actors Don Cheadle and Colin Farrell, basketball coach Doc Rivers, former NFL star Victor Cruz and New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang. They're pushing for direct payments for mothers, paid parental leave, affordable child care and pay equity."}
{"original": "Their full-page push comes as lawmakers have been campaigning for several pieces of legislation that promote parent-friendly policies like paid leave and child tax credits. The Marshall Plan for Moms — a reference to a program that helped rebuild Europe after World War II — calls for investments for moms who have been crushed under the burden of unpaid labor at home. It also includes provisions to help safely reopen schools full time and ensure women will have jobs when they can go back to work."}
{"original": "When more than 30 years of progress for women in the workforce can be erased in 9 months, the underlying system is broken, the letter, displayed as a full-page ad, reads. It's time to create a new structure that works for women, that respects and values their labor. Men have a role to play."}
{"original": "More than 2 million women have exited the workforce since the coronavirus pandemic began, according to the National Women's Law Center. Vice President Kamala Harris recently called the situation a national emergency. And a new working paper by the Federal Reserve of San Francisco suggests if mothers experienced recovery similar to women without children, approximately 700,000 more women would have been in the workforce in December."}
{"original": "Mothers are facing the brunt of this pandemic, and it is on all of us to step up and ensure that we are providing them with the relief and compensation they deserve, said Craigslist founder Craig Newmark, who signed the letter. His Craig Newmark Philanthropies is also throwing financial support behind the effort."}
{"original": "Last month, a group of 50 prominent women backed the plan with a letter in the New York Times calling for leaders to help moms slammed by the pandemic. Led by Girls Who Code founder and CEO Reshma Saujani, advocates included Eva Longoria, Julianne Moore, Charlize Theron, activist Tarana Burke and Bumble founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd."}
{"original": "This is a national crisis that requires bold solutions — we can't afford anything less, said Saujani."}
{"original": "Two weeks ago, Democratic New York Congresswoman Grace Meng introduced the Marshall Plan for Moms in the House. The legislation calls for measures to help mothers severely impacted by the coronavirus, including paid leave, investments to make sure child care programs do not close permanently and can reopen, expanded unemployment benefits and strengthened tax credits, and more."}
{"original": "Moms throughout America are screaming out for help, Meng said in a statement at the time."}
{"original": "Democrats in the House are on track to pass a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill by the end of the week. The legislation includes multiple components to help reopen schools and support people economically such as provide $1,400 checks, temporarily expand the child tax credit to $3,000 with monthly installments and increase supplemental unemployment benefits to $400."}
{"original": "Democrats have also introduced legislation to make the expanded child tax credits permanent. At the same time, Republican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah recently unveiled his own proposal for monthly checks, but the effort to provide continued payments for children has not gone without criticism from some of his own GOP colleagues."}
{"original": "In a Wednesday hearing in Washington, D.C., Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell avoided talking directly about the coronavirus relief package, leaving policy decisions to Congress, but took the unusual step of discussing affordable childcare."}
{"original": "I will say, many other countries, our peers, our competitors, advanced democracy economies have a more built up function for childcare and they wind up having substantially higher labor force participation among women, Powell said. We used to lead the world in female labor force participation a quarter century ago, and we no longer do — and it may just be that those policies have put us behind."}
{"original": "Low numbers of homes for sale have made the current housing market very competitive. For prospective buyers, this has meant it is more important than ever to be in the strongest position possible when making an offer."}
{"original": "Unfortunately, the market isn't always the only barrier to home ownership. Nearly one in 10 borrowers gets denied for a mortgage, according to recent analysis by LendingTree. We pinpointed the biggest reasons mortgage applications were denied."}
{"original": "Here are five things that can torpedo your mortgage application."}
{"original": "A poor credit history is the overarching reason that can lead to your mortgage loan being denied. In our study, one in four denied borrowers (26%) were turned down because of their credit history. The good news is that you are continually updating your credit history and can take steps to improve it if there are disadvantageous items."}
{"original": "Review your credit report on Annualcreditreport.com or through a monitoring service like My LendingTree to ensure it is accurate. Work to address any adverse records before applying for the loan."}
{"original": "2. Cutting it too close on debt-to-income"}
{"original": "A lot of the trouble from the financial crisis was because borrowers were put into homes they could not pay for on a sustainable basis. As a result, mortgages since then have adhered very strictly to income requirements. Stretching to buy your dream home is not advisable. Lenders are unlikely to approve borrowers whose debt-to-income ratios exceed 36%. DTI is your total monthly debt obligations divided by your gross monthly income. It was the cause of 26% of mortgage denials in our study."}
{"original": "3. Taking out new credit before closing"}
{"original": "Most borrowers know to avoid applying for new accounts in the run-up to their mortgage application. That advice still applies once you are approved and are on the way to closing on a home. The length of time between initial application and closing is about 45 to 60 days. Lenders will check your credit again just prior to closing, and material changes could affect the cost of the loan or even lead to an approval being reversed. Avoid new applications for other credit during this time."}
{"original": "4. The property is not worth the price"}
{"original": "The lending decision evaluates two things: the borrower and the property, which is the collateral the lender will receive in the event the borrower defaults. In our analysis, collateral was the third-leading cause of mortgage denials, indicating the home was not worth enough to justify the financing requested. Make sure you have a look at the property and have a trusted home inspector look it over, too."}
{"original": "5. Sloppiness and lack of documentation"}
{"original": "The days of loans with little to no documentation are long gone. Make sure everything in your application, from your tax records to your employment history, is accurate and you have documentation. Be proactive and gather all the typical documentation you'll need before you apply, so you aren't denied a loan or delayed in closing."}

{"original": "About 50 percent of all tax filers pay a pro to prepare and file their tax returns. Even IRS Commissioner John Koskinen is in that boat. He has said he hires an accounting firm and pays a few thousand dollars to get his taxes done."}
{"original": "If you're among this group, especially if it's for the first time, how do you know how much should it cost?"}
{"original": "Most tax preparers base their charges on the complexity of your tax situation and the completeness of your information. In fact, many say they'll charge extra when a client is poorly organized and has incomplete records of their income and deductions."}
{"original": "Preparers can also charge in a variety of ways, such as a set fee for each form and schedule required or an hourly rate for the time spent preparing your return. That hourly rate can be based on the actual time they spend on your returns or on IRS guidelines for estimated times to complete certain forms."}
{"original": "Regardless of how you're charged, it's always best to provide the tax pro all of your information for review and ask for a firm estimate of the cost before you agree to go forward. This is especially needed if it's the first time you're working with this person."}
{"original": "How can you know what you're paying (or being quoted) compared to what others are being charged?"}
{"original": "Here's some good information. The National Society of Accountants asks its members about the fees they charge, and according to its 2016-2017 fee survey, the average fee to prepare and file a simple Form 1040 (with no itemized deductions) and a state tax return is $176. Add a Schedule A (itemized deductions) to that mix and the fee is $273."}
{"original": "The average fee for a Form 1040, Schedule A (itemized deductions), a Schedule C (profit or loss from business) and a state tax return is $457."}
{"original": "The survey also covered fees for several other forms such as:"}
{"original": "Schedule D (capital gains and losses): $124"}
{"original": "Schedule E (supplemental income, typically from rental real estate): $135"}
{"original": "The survey found that fees vary by region, with higher charges in more metropolitan areas. For example, a 1040, Schedule A and state return is about $333 in New England and $329 in states on the West Coast. In Alabama, Kentucky and Mississippi, they averaged about $210."}
{"original": "The survey proved that being well organized and having complete information can save you money. Nearly three-quarters of the preparers said they charge an additional fee averaging $117 for clients with disorganized or incomplete information."}
{"original": "When you hire a tax professional, also ask what the policy is for responding to an audit. The average fee for preparing a reply to an IRS letter or notification (commonly called a correspondence audit) is $128. The average hourly fee for representing a taxpayer at an IRS in-person, or field, audit is $150."}
{"original": "Tax prep pros can also offer other services. They can inform you of the tax-saving strategies unique to your situation or profession. They can help you organize and plan for next year's taxes by suggesting what records to keep and what financial moves to make this year. They can also help with estimating quarterly tax payments."}
{"original": "The bottom line: Make sure the preparer you chose to work with offers services that meet your needs."}
{"original": "David Duke, a one-time Ku Klux Klan leader and state legislator who took his call for white survival overseas during an investigation of his activities, pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges of mail fraud and filing a false tax return."}
{"original": "He faces up to 15 months in prison and $10,000 in fines. Sentencing was set for March 19."}
{"original": "The plea, the same day an indictment was filed, came only two days after his lawyer said Duke had returned to Louisiana after three years out of the country to negotiate with prosecutors."}
{"original": "Duke was accused of filing a false 1998 tax return. The mail fraud charge accuses Duke of obtaining a substantial sum of money through mail solicitations and misusing the money."}
{"original": "Prosecutors were not available immediately to detail the charges."}
{"original": "Duke's attorney, Jim McPherson, said Monday that the Justice Department had been examining Duke for possible income tax violations involving the $100,000 sale of a list of Duke supporters to Gov. Mike Foster in 1995."}
{"original": "Duke had just started a speaking tour in Russia in January 2000 when federal agents raided his home in Mandeville, La. A search warrant, based on testimony from confidential informants, alleged that Duke took hundreds of thousands of dollars he solicited from supporters and gambled the money away at casinos."}
{"original": "Until his return late last week, Duke had been lecturing and speaking in Russia and other European countries in what became a crusade for white survival against Jews and non-Europeans."}
{"original": "Duke won a Louisiana House seat in 1988 and lost runoffs for the U.S. Senate in 1990 and governor in 1991, while claiming to have jettisoned his racist views."}
{"original": "He came in third in a 1999 congressional race in the New Orleans area."}
{"original": "For the fifth year in a row, IRS audits of individual tax returns have declined. In 2010, the chances of having your return selected for audit was one in 90. In 2016, that fell to one in 143, the lowest since 2003."}
{"original": "Audits have tumbled even for higher-income taxpayers. Last year the IRS audited just 5.8 percent of the returns that included income over $1 million, down from 9.6 percent in 2015."}
{"original": "The reason for shrinkage in audits -- a primary IRS enforcement tool -- is that the agency is too short-staffed. Over the past several years, Congress has been freezing and cutting the IRS's budget in the wake of the agency's abusive targeting of political groups. This occurred at a time when the agency's workload climbed due to tax code changes and a surge in fraud and identity theft."}
{"original": "The result has been a perfect storm of controversy, external attacks and increased workload, so something had to give."}
{"original": "Incoming Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin voiced his concern about the decline in resources at the IRS and said he'll make a case to President Trump that increased spending on tax enforcement could yield more in taxes collected. Past estimates have shown that for every dollar the IRS spends on audits, it collects $4 to $6 in tax revenue."}
{"original": "So while the chances of having your tax return audited may be low now, it could go back up as the problem gets more attention. And as always, the chances of an audit can increase substantially depending on your income level, types of income, amount of deductions, your income-earning activities and changes you've made since your last tax return."}
{"original": "One of the newer areas getting closer IRS scrutiny is tax returns that include income from a business that accepts credit and debit card payments. Gross and monthly totals received from these cards are reported to the IRS by banks and other settlement entities that process the transactions. So it's important to make sure these amounts are reported accurately on business tax returns."}
{"original": "Individuals who report investment gains from the sale of stocks or mutual funds should be careful to correctly report the cost basis and proceeds from each sale. That's because brokerage firms are now reporting the cost basis of sold investments to the IRS, and if you report this incorrectly, your tax return is more likely to be selected for audit."}
{"original": "The IRS also employs software that creates a score for all tax returns based on some specific items. When the total score on your return exceeds the national average set by the IRS, you'll get singled for a possible audit. The exact items and scoring convention is closely guarded, but here are some of the items believed to be included:"}
{"original": "Large amounts of income not subject to tax withholding."}
{"original": "Unusually large amounts of deductions claimed than seem unreasonable when compared to your income."}
{"original": "A large number of dependent exemptions claimed in conflict with reported SSNs, tax withholding allowances, etc."}
{"original": "Large deductions for charitable contributions, casualty losses, home office expenses and travel and entertainment expenses."}
{"original": "Indicating a change of address when not reporting a sale of your residence and not changing your home-related deductions."}
{"original": "One of the easiest ways to reduce your chances of an audit is to double-check the information on your tax return. That's because the IRS runs returns through a process that compares the information you report from your bank, your employer, etc. on forms W-2, 1099, etc. versus the same information on the versions of the forms it receives."}
{"original": "If you omit an item from your tax return, it'll be picked up and trigger a computer-generated notice that includes a recalculation of your tax and the additional interest and penalties you may owe."}
{"original": "And remember: An IRS audit isn't something to be feared. If you've kept complete and accurate records of all deductions and reported all your income, you needn't worry. In fact, in about 25 percent of audits, the IRS either makes no changes or issues a refund."}
{"original": "U.S. airlines are asking the federal government for grants, loans and tax relief that could easily top $50 billion to help them recover from a sharp downturn in travel due to the new coronavirus."}
{"original": "Airlines for America, the trade group representing the carriers, disclosed its request for financial help on Monday, just as more airlines around the world were announcing ever-deeper cuts in service and, in some cases, layoffs."}
{"original": "The trade group is asking for $29 billion in federal grants, with $25 billion for passenger airlines and $4 billion for cargo carriers. The airlines are also seeking up to $29 billion in low-interest loans or loan guarantees, and they want federal excise taxes on fuel, cargo and airline tickets to be suspended through the end of next year."}
{"original": "That package would easily surpass the $5 billion in grants and up to $10 billion in loan guarantees that Congress approved after the terror attacks of September 2001, which temporarily grounded all U.S. flights and led to a long slump in domestic travel."}
{"original": "U.S. airlines are coming off a decade marked by record profits. Since January, however, they have been reducing flights, starting with the suspension of flights to mainland China, where the virus outbreak began. The downward spiral in travel has picked up speed in recent days, prompting airlines to announce a succession of increasingly dramatic measures."}
{"original": "Since Friday, United, American and Delta have all announced deeper cuts in flying than they were contemplating just a few days earlier."}
{"original": "Some airlines including United have borrowed recently to shore up their available funds while they are taking in less revenue. Airlines for America said that in its worst-case scenario, the airlines could run out of money in the second half of this year — even sooner if credit card companies withhold cash from sales of airline tickets."}
{"original": "The trade group's members include the six largest U.S. passenger airlines: Delta, American, United, Southwest, Alaska and JetBlue. Cargo carriers FedEx and UPS are also members."}
{"original": "Around the globe, airline bookings are plummeting and cancellations soaring as governments restrict travel and people fear being enclosed in an airplane for several hours during a pandemic that has already sickened about 170,000 people and killed more than 6,500."}
{"original": "Late Sunday night, United Airlines announced that it would slash 50% of its flying capacity in April and May and warned that the cuts could extend into the peak summer travel season. Even with thousands fewer flights every week, the airline expects its planes to be only 20% to 30% full at best, and March revenue will be down by $1.5 billion."}
{"original": "The bad news is that it's getting worse, CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby said in a letter to United's roughly 96,000 workers. We expect both the number of customers and revenue to decline sharply in the days and weeks ahead."}
{"original": "American Airlines on Monday suspended about 75% of its long-haul international flights through at least May 6 and began grounding about 135 planes. It will cut passenger-carrying capacity in the U.S. by 20% in April and 30% in May."}
{"original": "Airlines are talking to unions about taking cuts in pay or hours, and some are cutting executive and management salaries."}
{"original": "Newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is giving climate change a prominent role in her talks with her counterparts around the world, signaling a significant shift by the Biden administration to prioritize addressing climate change not just from the White House but also at the agency."}
{"original": "Yellen has spoken to the finance ministers of Italy, Japan, Canada, Mexico, France, Germany and the United Kingdom since being sworn in less than a week ago, according to statements provided by the Treasury Department regarding those talks. In all of those calls, forcefully addressing the threat of climate change has been discussed as one of Yellen's top priorities and tackling climate change has been a topic of conversation, according to those statements."}
{"original": "Yellen's early focus on climate change with other finance leaders comes after she told senators during her confirmation hearing last month she would appoint someone at a senior level within the Treasury Department to address efforts on climate change and create a hub within her department focused on the risks climate change poses to the financial system and tax policy-related incentives."}
{"original": "Her remarks came in response to a question posed by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. The Rhode Island Democrat cited warnings that climate change will lead to a crash in the value of coastal properties as well as concerns about the so-called carbon bubble – or massive investments in the fossil fuel sector."}
{"original": "I think we need to seriously look at assessing the risks to the financial system from climate change, Yellen said during the hearing, in which she also called climate change an existential threat."}
{"original": "Yellen acknowledged climate change and the policies implemented to address it could have a major impact on the value of assets and credit risks within the financial system."}
{"original": "I think everyone understands that the State Department has an important role, the EPA has an important role, but the Treasury actually is really influential in global discussions around finance and climate, said Joe Thwaites, an associate in the Sustainable Finance Center of the nonprofit research organization the World Resources Institute. Thwaites said the administration's whole-of-government approach has been well received."}
{"original": "Prior to her nomination last year, Yellen co-chaired a working group on climate change and finance for Group of 30, an international organization comprised of academics, economic officials and bank leaders, which released a report calling for immediate action to put the world economy on a path toward a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. The working group recommended governments to come up with strategies including implementing carbon pricing as well as invest in low-carbon infrastructure."}
{"original": "In a dramatic shift from the Trump administration, President Joe Biden is making tackling climate change a central component of his agenda. Just hours after being sworn in, he signed an order recommitting the United States to the Paris Climate Agreement, which the Trump administration had announced in 2019 the U.S. would exit. Last week, Mr. Biden also signed a series of executive actions aimed at combating climate change."}
{"original": "That's something that in the campaign, Biden said he wanted to see the end of fossil fuel subsidies globally by the end of his first term, so the Treasury Department will play a key role in that domestically, but also as it engages internationally, said Thwaites. There's this recognition that it's not just about turning off the faucet of dirty energy flows, but also to ramp up clean energy financing."}
{"original": "Ending the use of fossil fuels and building renewable energy is the mission of the international organization 350. The group is closely monitoring where Yellen and the Treasury Department go with fossil fuel financing."}
{"original": "Our hope for Janet Yellen and her communication internationally is that she is a leader in generating discourse of the effect of the finance community on the climate, said Brett Fleishman, head of 350.org Finance Campaigns. But he argued she needs to walk the walk at home as well."}
{"original": "Is her rhetoric signaling positive change? Absolutely, said Fleishman. Now we just need to see some of those general statements about climate being an urgent priority and guiding policy, if that all turns into the kind of action driving the just transition."}
{"original": "On his way out the door, President Trump pardoned 74 people, including his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and commuted the sentences of 70 others. The White House announced the last-minute flurry of pardons and commutations early on Wednesday, Mr. Trump's last day in office."}
{"original": "No members of the president's family — including Mr. Trump himself — were on the list. There was considerable speculation in the waning days of his term over whether he would issue pre-emptive pardons for himself, any of his children or son-in-law Jared Kushner."}
{"original": "Also missing from the list — Rudy Giuliani — Mr. Trump's personal attorney, who led legal efforts to prove false claims that Mr. Trump won the presidential election over Joe Biden."}
{"original": "Among others getting pardons were former top GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and rapper Lil Wayne."}
{"original": "Bannon was indicted in August for allegedly defrauding donors out of hundreds of thousands of dollars with a fundraising campaign to build a wall along the southern border, known as the We build the wall campaign. The scheme raised $25 million, and Bannon was accused of taking $1 million to cover personal expenses and pay another person accused in the scheme."}

{"original": "In announcing his pardon, the White House said Bannon has been an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen."}
{"original": "But Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, took to Twitter to swipe at the move, saying, Steve Bannon is getting a pardon from Trump after defrauding Trump's own supporters into paying for a wall that Trump promised Mexico would pay for. And if that all sounds crazy, that's because it is. Thank God we have only 12 more hours of this den of thieves."}
{"original": "Broidy, the RNC's former deputy finance chair, was charged in October for his alleged role in a covert scheme to lobby the Justice Department and Trump administration on behalf of undisclosed foreign entities. Broidy resigned as the GOP's top fundraiser in 2018 after admitting to paying off a Playboy Playmate."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump also pardoned rapper Dwayne Michael Carter Jr, also known as Lil Wayne. Carter pleaded guilty in December to a federal gun charge."}
{"original": "In the final hour of his presidency, the president also granted a full pardon to Albert J. Pirro, Jr., the ex-husband of Trump-friendly Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. He was convicted on conspiracy and tax evasion charges."}
{"original": "The president commuted the sentence of Kwame Kilpatrick, the former Detroit mayor who has served approximately 7 years of a 28 year sentence for racketeering and bribery. This commutation is strongly supported by prominent members of the Detroit community, Alveda King, Alice Johnson, Diamond and Silk, Pastor Paula White, Peter Karmanos, Representative Sherry Gay-Dagnogo of the Michigan House of Representatives, Representative Karen Whitsett of the Michigan House of Representatives, and more than 30 faith leaders, the White House said."}
{"original": "Kilpatrick, once seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, received one of the longest sentences for corruption ever given to a major U.S. politician."}
{"original": "New York Attorney General Letitia James issued a statement blasting Mr. Trump's actions, saying in part, The 143 pardons and commutations, issued in the twilight hours of the Trump Administration, perfectly sum up what this lame-duck president has always been about: favoritism towards those who show absolute loyalty to Donald Trump."}
{"original": "Prior to the late blitz, Mr. Trump had granted 70 pardons, the majority of them in December, according to Justice Department records."}
{"original": "He waited until after the November election to issue some of his most controversial pardons, including for former campaign manager Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner's convict father Charles Kushner, and longtime Trump ally Roger Stone."}
{"original": "By the time President Obama had left office, he had pardoned 212 people; 189 were pardoned by President George W. Bush; and 396 received a pardon from President Clinton, according to the Justice Department."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump isn't the first president to issue highly controversial pardons. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon, and Mr. Clinton granted clemency to friends and supporters."}
{"original": "The president's pardon powers are virtually unlimited when it comes to federal crimes. The presidential pardon power allows the president to pardon anyone charged with or convicted of a federal crime — it does not apply to state crimes. Article II of the Constitution states that the president shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment."}

{"original": "Most people believe they'll always pay more income tax every year. And it sure feels like that's the case, which is understandable given that from your mid-20s, taxable income generally increases annually for most workers. And higher income typically means paying more income tax."}
{"original": "But studies of who's paying how much in income tax show the share of U.S. households that paid federal income tax peaks at around age 50, at nearly 80 percent. By age 65, that drops to about 50 percent. By the time most people settle into retirement, they're paying less income tax. Here are a few reasons."}
{"original": "First, most people will have lower income in retirement. The standard rule has been that you can afford to retire on about 70 percent to 80 percent of your working income, given reduced living expenses."}
{"original": "Older Americans also get a lot of tax breaks. These include increased deductions, higher amounts that can be contributed to tax-advantaged retirement accounts and penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts."}
{"original": "One big tax savings for retirees is that they no longer pay the Social Security (FICA) tax. That's because income from pensions, withdrawals from retirement accounts, dividends and interest income or Social Security retirement benefits aren't categorized as income from earnings and therefore are exempt from Social Security wage taxes."}
{"original": "Speaking of Social Security benefits, this income is tax-free for many people, and for most it's only partly taxable, depending on a special definition of income."}
{"original": "Finally, many people who pay state income taxes will find that many states give special breaks to residents who receive specific types of income in retirement. Many states don't tax retirement benefits received from Social Security. And many exempt pension income and withdrawals from 401(k) plans and IRAs. For example, each New York resident can receive up to $20,000 annually from retirement plans and IRAs free of state income tax."}
{"original": "If you underpaid your taxes last year, you can breathe (a little) easier. The IRS said it would penalize fewer people, as long as they paid most of the taxes they should have."}
{"original": "The U.S.' tax collector said on Wednesday it would waive penalties for some taxpayers who owe taxes for the 2018 filing year. Anyone who paid at least 85 percent of the tax they owe will not pay a penalty, the IRS said. The typical threshold is 90 percent."}
{"original": "Only about one-fifth of tax filers owe in any given year, according to IRS data. But that's likely to be higher this year thanks in part to the tax cuts that started in 2018. The IRS warned in December that the number of taxpayers who owe tax, and in some cases a penalty, is likely to be larger than in recent years, and many of them are likely to be people who have always gotten refunds."}
{"original": "Following the tax cuts, many businesses adjusted the amount of tax they withheld from workers' paychecks. So people who may have been expecting a big check come tax time may find out they've already received their tax cut, in the form of a slightly higher take-home number on their paychecks."}
{"original": "Though the federal government is entering its fourth week of a partial shutdown, tax filing season is set to open Jan. 28, the IRS has said. About 46,000 IRS employees were called back to work on Tuesday, without pay."}
{"original": "Beijing — China's economic growth hit a three-decade low in 2018, adding to pressure on Beijing to beef up stimulus measures and settle a tariff war with Washington."}
{"original": "Growth slowed to 6.6 percent from 2017's 6.9 percent as both the world's appetite for China's exports and domestic consumer spending weakened, official data showed Monday."}
{"original": "Forecasters said they expect Beijing to try to shore up growth by making credit cheaper, raising government spending and adopting measures to encourage sales of autos and consumer goods."}
{"original": "Communist leaders want to steer China toward slower, more self-sustaining growth driven by consumer spending instead of trade and investment. But the slowdown has been sharper than expected, prompting Beijing to boost spending on construction of roads and bridges and to order banks to lend more, especially to the entrepreneurs who generate most of China's new jobs and wealth."}
{"original": "Downward pressure on the economy is increasing, the commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics, Ning Jizhe, said at a news conference. He cited import controls, volatile financial markets and declining investment spending as factors."}
{"original": "Still, Ning insisted China can resist shocks, saying the long-term trend of stability will not change."}
{"original": "Economic growth in 2018 was the lowest since 1990's 3.9 percent following the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square."}
{"original": "Growth in the last quarter of 2018 dipped to 6.4 percent — the lowest quarterly level since the 2008 global crisis — from the previous quarter's 6.5 percent."}
{"original": "The government is expected to implement more fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to support economic growth, Yanjun Lin of IHS Markit said in a report."}
{"original": "Growth in investment, retail spending and factory activity all declined, though analysts pointed to a flicker of improvement in manufacturing in December. It grew by 5.7 percent over a year earlier, up 0.3 percentage points from November."}
{"original": "Production of plastics, metals and specialized industrial machinery accelerated, suggesting warming expectations for a pick-up in investment, Chaoping Zhu of J.P. Morgan Asset Management said in a report."}
{"original": "The trade dispute with the U.S. is proving costly. Exports held up through most of 2018 despite President Donald Trump's tariff hikes on Chinese imports in a fight over Beijing's technology ambitions. But they contracted in December as the penalties began to depress U.S. demand."}
{"original": "The two sides have imposed tariff hikes of up to 25 percent on tens of billions of dollars of each other's goods in the fight over U.S. complaints that Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Washington wants China to roll back plans for state-led industry development that its trading partners say violate its market-opening obligations."}
{"original": "The trade dispute, and reports of job losses and tumbling sales of autos and real estate, have unnerved Chinese consumers that Beijing is counting on to drive growth. As pocketbooks snap shut, the downturn could worsen."}
{"original": "China's top trade envoy, Vice Premier Liu He, is due to visit Washington for talks Jan. 30-31."}
{"original": "Business groups and economists said a decision by Liu and his American counterpart, Robert Lighthizer, to get directly involved would suggest earlier talks by lower-level officials made progress."}
{"original": "Trump said Saturday that trade relations with China were going very well and a deal could very well happen."}
{"original": "Forecasters expect Chinese growth to bottom out this year as Beijing's stimulus efforts gain traction. However, they have pushed back the time frame for that due to weakening exports."}
{"original": "Public works spending is shaping up to be the engine for 2019, Iris Pang of ING said in a report. However, non-infrastructure business activities will be dismal this year. And debt will grow."}
{"original": "A meeting of Communist Party leaders in December promised tax cuts, better access to bank lending for entrepreneurs and other steps to help the private sector."}
{"original": "Chinese leaders have been warning that any recovery would be L-shaped, meaning that companies and investors shouldn't expect growth to rebound to the previous decade's double-digit levels."}
{"original": "Forecasters expect growth to decline further this year to 6.3 percent or lower."}
{"original": "China's economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilizes in the second half of the year on the back of expanded policy stimulus, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report."}

{"original": "The Washington nonprofit's board of trustees unanimously asked for and received the resignation of Jim DeMint at a meeting Tuesday. The board chairman said in a pull-no-punches statement afterward that significant and worsening management issues led to the ouster."}

{"original": "Rep. Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican, called DeMint's ouster a tragedy."}
{"original": "He's just kind of an ideal person who understood the think-tank world and understands the timing and the strategy along with policy, Brat said. And to lose that, it's incomprehensible. I don't get it. At all. I don't get it."}

{"original": "Kay Cole James said it was purely about management, organizational and structural issues — not philosophical differences with DeMint."}

{"original": "The last known surviving boyhood home of Malcolm X has officially been added to the National Register of Historic Places.

{"original": "With the new designation, the house will be considered in all federal planning, may qualify for federal grants and will be eligible for tax provisions to rehabilitate the building."}
{"original": "In this March 29, 2016, photo, signs call attention to the house where Malcolm X spent part of his childhood in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. Bill Sikes/AP"}
{"original": "Malcolm and his sister moved into the house in 1941 when Little-Collins gained guardianship of Malcolm, who rose to be a prominent Black leader who was a spokesman for the Nation of Islam during the 1950s and '60s. He was known for encouraging people to fight against racism with whatever means were necessary."}
{"original": "After Malcolm was shot and killed in 1965, Little-Collins never returned to the house, according to the National Trust, although she maintained ownership of it until her death in 1996. Her son, Rodnell Collins, has since owned the historic building."}
{"original": "Nobody has lived in the two-and-a-half-story house, located at 72 Dale Street, for more than 30 years, according to the National Trust, and Collins is working on redeveloping the building so that it can be used as living space for graduate students who are studying African American history, social justice or civil rights."}
{"original": "Transforming the historic residence where Malcolm X spent his formative years into graduate student housing would provide an innovative model for sites across the country, the National Trust says on its website. The rehabilitation would not only restore an important part of American history, but transform an underutilized structure into an active and vibrant part of the surrounding community."}
{"original": "The house was added to the National Register on February 12 for its local and national significance, according to the National Park Service."}
{"original": "The Malcolm X–Ella Little Collins House in Boston, MA, was listed in the National Register on February 12, 2021, at the... Posted by National Register of Historic Places - NPS on Thursday, February 18, 2021"}
{"original": "Along with its connection to Malcolm X and Little-Collins, the National Register for Historic Places said the property is significant for its demonstrated potential to provide information about 18th-century farm practices within the landscape context for Roxbury and for its later 19th-century development as a streetcar suburb of Boston."}
{"original": "In 2016, the city of Boston conducted an archaeological dig at the site of the home and found kitchenware, ceramics and other items that dated back to the 1700s. They also uncovered jewelry and toys from the 1970s."}
{"original": "Paying taxes can be stressful in the best of times, but 2020 worsened the fear and loathing for millions of Americans. The coronavirus pandemic shuttered local IRS offices where taxpayers can ordinarily seek help, while most people who tried to phone the agency were unable to get someone on the phone."}
{"original": "The IRS received more than 100 million calls last year, but only 1 in 4 callers got through to an IRS employee, according to a recent report from the National Taxpayer Advocate, a part of the agency that represents the public interest in dealing with the agency."}
{"original": "Put differently, IRS employees did not answer more than 75 million telephone calls from taxpayers seeking help in complying with their tax obligations, Taxpayer Advocate Erin M. Collins wrote in her first annual report to Congress. The IRS 'answered' 23 million calls by routing them for automated responses, while 39 million taxpayers simply hung up."}
{"original": "The main factor behind the IRS' slack response: the agency's long-standing staffing problems, with the report finding that the IRS had about 20% fewer employees in 2020 than a decade earlier due to cuts in funding. Years of understaffing came to a head last year as the pandemic upended tax season, with the regular April filing deadline delayed because of the crisis."}
{"original": "Consumers also had plenty of questions about their stimulus checks, the federal coronavirus relief payments, that went unanswered. For the week of April 18 alone, 600,000 calls were placed to the IRS that went unanswered, the report found."}
{"original": "The IRS needs more resources to hire employees and more resources to modernize its information technology, Collins wrote."}
{"original": "Although phone lines were reopened by late June, taxpayers still faced long wait times to reach an IRS representative, the Taxpayer Advocate found. Improved customer service is not an option; it is a requirement. Americans deserve best in class service and top-quality tax administration, the report said."}
{"original": "Millions 2020 tax returns still unprocessed"}
{"original": "Millions of taxpayers also experienced delays in receiving tax refunds, according to the report. Last year's problems were due partly to the pandemic, with the agency unable to process about 16 million paper tax returns in a timely fashion due to office closures."}
{"original": "Paper tax returns and correspondence from taxpayers sat unopened in trailers for months, many taxpayers did not receive timely refunds [and] taxpayers could not get through to the IRS by phone, Collins noted."}
{"original": "These problems are ongoing, with the Taxpayer Advocate noting that more than 7 million individual returns remained unprocessed at the end of 2020. The IRS is urging consumers to file their 2020 tax returns electronically this year to ensure faster processing."}
{"original": "Even so, it's likely these problems will continue into 2021, Collins predicted. The challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic will continue through the 2021 filing season and possibly for months longer, affecting both the IRS and taxpayers, she wrote."}
{"original": "Audits of tax returns, which have fallen sharply in recent years, also declined due to the pandemic. Taxpayers are half as likely to be audited by the IRS as they were a decade ago, researchers have found."}
{"original": "Madison, Wis.— Foxconn Technology Group will proceed with plans to build a government-subsidized plant in Wisconsin to make liquid crystal display screens after its chairman spoke with President Donald Trump."}
{"original": "The news capped a week of reversals about the Taiwanese company's plans in the state. Foxconn drew headlines in 2017 when it said the company would invest $10 billion in Wisconsin and hire 13,000 people to build a factory to make screens for televisions and other devices. State leaders offered nearly $4 billion in tax incentives to help seal the deal."}
{"original": "Last year Foxconn said it would reduce the scale of the factory from what is known as a Gen 10 factory to Gen 6. But this week, Foxconn executive Louis Woo seemed to move away from a factory altogether, saying the company couldn't compete in the TV screen market and would not be making LCD panels in Wisconsin."}
{"original": "On Friday, in yet another twist, Foxconn said that, after discussions with the White House and a personal conversation between Mr. Trump and Foxconn chairman Terry Gou, it will proceed with the smaller manufacturing facility."}
{"original": "Trump tweeted that the development was great news."}
{"original": "Great news on Foxconn in Wisconsin after my conversation with Terry Gou! https://t.co/2wtuCdl7TX — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 1, 2019"}
{"original": "Woo told Reuters earlier this week that about three-quarters of workers in Wisconsin would be in research and development, not manufacturing, and that the facility would be more of a research hub."}
{"original": "A Foxconn spokeswoman had no immediate comment about what its plans to build the Gen 6 factory would mean for the makeup of the workforce."}
{"original": "The difference between a Gen 10 and Gen 6 plant has to do with the size of the original glass used to make screens. The larger plant, which had been part of Foxconn's initial plans, would have used glass more than three-times as large as what the smaller facility will use. The Gen 6 plant can make screens ranging in size from a smart-phone to a 75-inch television, while the larger plant would have allowed for devices as large as 9.5 feet by 11 feet."}
{"original": "Foxconn, the world's largest electronics company, said Friday the campus would house both an advanced manufacturing facility and a center of technology innovation for the region."}
{"original": "Local Wisconsin government and economic development officials where the Foxconn campus is located praised the news, saying construction of the Gen 6 factory will coincide with construction of other related buildings over the next 18 months."}
{"original": "Wisconsin promised nearly $4 billion in state and local tax incentives to Foxconn if it invested $10 billion and created 13,000 jobs for the project, which Trump heralded last year as the eighth wonder of the world."}
{"original": "But Foxconn's repeated changes to its plans led critics of the project this week to accuse Foxconn of a bait and switch."}
{"original": "The original deal was struck by then-Gov. Scott Walker and Mr. Trump. Wisconsin's current governor, Democrat Tony Evers, was a critic of the project during the campaign but has said this week he's working closely with Foxconn on the project."}
{"original": "Foxconn earlier this week cited a changing global market as requiring a move away from making LCD panels in Wisconsin. Apple is Foxconn's main manufacturing customer, and it has forecast a drop in revenue from the Chinese market due to decreasing demand for iPhones."}

{"original": "Tuesday's surge erase part of Monday's nearly 8% plunge, which marked the biggest single-day point drop in the history of the Dow and the largest percentage decline since 2008. Economists have raised the likelihood of a recession, warning that American consumers wary of the virus could pare spending on travel, restaurants, sporting events and other businesses."}
{"original": "Investors are banking on government intervention to shore up the economy, with the Trump administration considering a payroll tax cut or targeted aid to affected industries. President Donald Trump joined Vice President Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and economic adviser Larry Kudlow at the Capitol Tuesday to meet with Republican lawmakers to discuss how to address the economic fallout from the coronavirus."}
{"original": "Through Monday's close of trading, the Dow had shed about 19% of its value since its most recent high — close to the 20% loss that traditionally defines a bear market."}

{"original": "Markets look poised to remain volatile and under pressure as the number of global coronavirus cases rises, UBS analysts told investors in a report. It now appears increasingly likely that governments and consumers around the world will have to adopt some of the more dramatic virus containment measures that were successful in Asia."}
{"original": "Italy, the hardest-hit country outside of China, announced that travel restrictions that started earlier in its north would be extended nationwide. In other countries trying to contain the coronavirus, Ireland canceled St. Patrick's Day parades and Israel ordered visitors quarantined ahead of Passover and Easter, one of the busiest travel periods of the year."}
{"original": "We are grappling with the problem of pricing epidemic-related uncertainty, said Arthur Kroeber of Gavekal Research in a research note. Eventually, rationality will return and equity prices and bond yields will rebound to more justifiable levels. The key question then becomes, just when is 'eventually'? We cannot answer that question."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama will pitch some new proposals to expand access to retirement savings accounts and revisit some old ones when issuing his budget next month."}
{"original": "Many Americans are not well prepared for retirement, with nearly one in three yet to retire having any savings or pension available for their later years, according to a Federal Reserve report."}
{"original": "The White House says Obama's proposals, if enacted, would provide more than 30 million people access to a retirement account."}
{"original": "The biggest chunk of that increase would occur through legislation requiring employers that don't offer a retirement plan to automatically enroll their workers in an Individual Retirement Account. The employers that did so would get a tax credit of $3,000 to help them offset the administrative expense. The proposal was also part of last year's budget, but Congress did not pass it."}
{"original": "On the new front, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez says the administration will seek to make it easier for multiple employers to join together to offer retirement plans. For small employers. That would mean lower administrative expenses."}
{"original": "We are willing to take steps to make it easier and cheaper for employers to offer a path to dignified retirement, Perez said. They should be willing to do the right thing and set up more plans so their workers can save."}
{"original": "Perez said that employers with a common bond, say auto dealers, can now pool together to offer a retirement plan. He said the president will recommend doing away with the common bond requirement and let people from all kinds of businesses join together. The White House says it's recommending that Congress pass legislation that would ensure the long-term sustainability of such arrangements."}
{"original": "A few states have recently approved state-run retirement plans for private-sector workers. The Obama administration says it wants to encourage those efforts and will finalize regulations later this year to ensure the plans don't run afoul of federal pension law."}
{"original": "Washington — House Democrats have reissued their subpoena to former President Donald Trump's accounting firm for a trove of his financial records, lawyers for the House revealed in a court filing Tuesday."}
{"original": "The House Oversight and Reform Committee is seeking the information from Mr. Trump, the Trump Organization and other entities affiliated with the former president from 2011 through 2018. Democrats told the federal district court in the District of Columbia that the subpoena to Mazars USA was reissued February 25."}
{"original": "The House panel has argued it needs Mr. Trump's financial records to help inform legislative action to address ethics issues related to the former president and his unprecedented conflicts of interest."}
{"original": "The committee's need for this information — in order to verify key facts and tailor legislative reforms to be as effective and efficient as possible — remains just as compelling now as it was when the committee first issued its subpoena, and the committee's legislative efforts remain just as critical to the American people as they were before President Trump vacated the White House on January 20, 2021, Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, told members in a memorandum before reissuing its demand to Mazars."}
{"original": "The Oversight Committee first issued its subpoena to Mazars for eight years of Mr. Trump's financial records in April 2019. But the former president swiftly sued to shield his personal information from Democrats and ultimately took his battle with the Oversight panel and two others seeking similar information to the Supreme Court."}
{"original": "While the court affirmed Congress' authority to issue a subpoena directed at a president's personal information, it outlined four factors for lower courts to consider to account for separation of powers concerns and sent the legal fight back to the lower courts."}
{"original": "In addition to House Democrats, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has also been seeking Mr. Trump's financial records, including his tax returns, as part of an investigation into his business dealings. The Supreme Court declined to shield the information from New York investigators last month, and Mazars turned over the records."}
{"original": "Former President Trump drove by supporters at a rally in Florida on Monday, CBS West Palm affiliate WPEC reported. It's the first time he has been spotted in public since Saturday, when the Senate acquitted him in his second impeachment trial."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump waved to his supporters while riding in an SUV."}
{"original": "One attendee, Tara Crete, told WPEC that she had traveled from Naples, Florida to show her support. When asked if she thinks Mr. Trump's political career is over, she replied, 100% no. It's only been getting started. We are just waking up. You know, what we believe is good for everybody. We believe even people who are liberals, who are atheist, who don't even love this country, it's going to be good for them because at the very core of who we are, we want freedom. And that's what President Trump stands for."}

{"original": "Mr. Trump has been in Florida since he left office on January 20. He had been impeached by the House of Representatives one week earlier on a charge of inciting the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Although seven Republicans broke with the party and found Mr. Trump guilty, the Senate failed to meet a two-thirds threshold to convict."}
{"original": "After voting not guilty, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell harshly rebuked Mr. Trump, saying he was practically and morally responsible for the riot that left 5 people dead."}
{"original": "Following his acquittal, Mr. Trump released a statement thanking his legal team, saying, the movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun."}
{"original": "A vote by the Senate finding the former president guilty would have paved the way for the chamber to disqualify Mr. Trump from holding office again. The option for Mr. Trump to seek the presidency in 2024 now remains, though the former president has not yet said whether he will run again."}
{"original": "Although Mr. Trump was acquitted of inciting the riot in the Senate trial, he could still face criminal charges. A Georgia prosecutor has opened a criminal investigation into Mr. Trump's alleged attempts to influence the presidential election in the state. Separately, Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance is also overseeing an investigation into Mr. Trump for possible crimes as wide-ranging as fraud and tax evasion."}

{"original": "It sure feels like maybe, just maybe, stocks will never go down again as Wall Street enjoys a rip-roaring start to 2018."}
{"original": "The dynamics are familiar: The U.S. economy is strong and about to enjoy a boost from the implementation of the GOP's new tax cuts, inflation remains tepid, the Federal Reserve's rate hike campaign is proceeding cautiously and corporate earnings growth has been solid."}
{"original": "But a number of new dynamics loom in 2018. Here are three questions investors need to ponder:"}
{"original": "Are we headed for a melt-up?"}
{"original": "With the S&P 500's gain on Monday, stocks have risen 2.8 percent for the new year, risng in every session so far. According to Jeff Hirsch at the Almanac Trader, this performance -- along with the solid run to end 2017 -- suggests 2018 will be great for investors. Over the last 39 years, when stocks performed this well, the rest of the year showed gains 87 percent of the time, with an average rise of 14 percent."}
{"original": "Even long-time market skeptics like GMO's Jeremy Grantham said markets could be headed for a near-term melt-up scenario. In a letter to investors, he wondered if stocks are entering the final, most ebullient phase of this long bull move."}
{"original": "Jason Geopfert at SentimenTrader noted that the gains are part of a globally synchronized market displaying extreme momentum. The weekly Relative Strength Index across six major worldwide stock indexes is now at the highest level in history. Such extreme readings have in the past been associated with further gains -- the type of melt-up move Grantham warns of."}
{"original": "Why a warning? Because such a move means we are probably down to the last few months of the bull market, according to Grantham."}
{"original": "Will the Fed put finally end?"}
{"original": "In a recent note to clients, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC) analysts noted that in 2017, for the first time, Federal Reserve policymakers stuck to their guns and tightened interest rates in three quarter-point increments -- a much more rapid pace than what bond traders expected at the start of the year."}
{"original": "Previously, the Fed always lowered its tightening plans to match market expectations in fear of repeating 2013's taper tantrum episode during which long-term interest rates rose rapidly. That has changed now as the Fed's velvet glove treatment has resulted in financial conditions -- when measured broadly -- being easier now than when the central bank's tightening campaign started in 2015."}
{"original": "This deferral to the market is widely known as the Fed put -- the idea that maintaining market calm overrides monetary policy desires. But it could be ending."}
{"original": "Fed officials have penciled in another trio of quarter-point hikes for 2018. But the futures market assigns only 30 percent odds for that outcome. According to traders, the more likely outcome -- at 60 percent odds -- is that the Fed is forced to back down and raises rates no more than twice."}
{"original": "However, Goldman Sachs (GS) is far more aggressive, warning clients that it expects four quarter-point rate hikes in 2018 as inflation heats up."}

{"original": "The good old greenback hasn't been faring so well lately. It has fallen 4 percent from its early November high and is down 12 percent from December 2016. Watch for a possible decline to lows not seen since 2014 as the dollar gets battered by a combination of higher oil prices, rising inflation and a creeping sense the Fed has been too slow in its policy normalization."}
{"original": "Also factoring in is the excitement in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ripple, which are widely seen as private-market alternatives -- safe havens, even -- from government-backed fiat currencies."}
{"original": "The problem, however, is that a rapidly weakening dollar would undermine the Goldilocks conditions that have allowed the Fed to take it slow by pushing inflation higher, via everything from higher import prices to a tailwind behind commodity prices like crude oil."}

{"original": "As the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on the economy and disproportionately affects lower-income Americans, the super-rich have seen their wealth increase. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has long called for a wealth tax, unveiled legislation Monday that would tax the super-rich on their net worth."}
{"original": "The proposal, called the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act and released with Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Congressman Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, would put a 2% annual tax on households and trusts between $50 million and $1 billion. It would also put a 1% annual surtax on households and trusts over $1 billion. The lawmakers say the move would level the playing field and narrow the racial wealth gap."}
{"original": "This is a wealth tax that has been needed for a long time. We need it to produce more revenue, to create more opportunity in American, Warren said. But it is a wealth tax that we particularly need because of the changes in this country under the pandemic. We have watched the wealth of the billionaire class in America increase by more than a trillion dollars over the last year."}
{"original": "Since the pandemic crisis started, billionaire wealth has shot up 40%, while millions remain unemployed and families struggle to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. It's time for a #WealthTax to make ultra-millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) March 1, 2021"}
{"original": "Warren has been a vocal supporter of a wealth tax for some time — making it one of her signature policy platforms on the campaign trail when she ran for president in 2020. Two Cents — referring to the 2-cent tax an ultrawealthy taxpayer would owe on each dollar — even adorned her campaign merchandise and was chanted at rallies. The bill is now one of her first moves as a new member of the Senate Finance Committee."}
{"original": "About 100,000 American families would be liable for the ultra-millionaire Tax, according to an analysis by economists from the University of California-Berkeley. They also estimated it would generate an estimated $3 trillion in revenue over 10 years without raising taxes on 99.95% of American households, which have a net worth below $50 million."}
{"original": "Today the richest 1% own 75% of the nation's wealth and the richest 0.1% — that's zero-point-one percent — own more than 18% of America's wealth, said Jayapal. Then just compare that to the entire bottom half of Americans owning just 1.5% of wealth. Jayapal also noted the racial wealth gap with White families having an average wealth that is 14 times that of Black families and eight times as much as Hispanic families."}
{"original": "The group of lawmakers argue the wealth tax should be at the top of the list to help pay for plans as the United States digs out of the economic crisis from the coronavirus pandemic with funds going toward child care and early education, infrastructure and other priorities."}
{"original": "I recognize that at some point we are going to have to turn to revenues. Well, here is a fair way to do it, said Boyle, acknowledging recent COVID relief spending. This is a hell of a lot better way to get revenue than taxing middle class and poor people in this country."}
{"original": "This comes as the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan was passed in the House early Saturday and is headed to the Senate. The White House has said it would be the first piece of legislation and would be followed by another with investments in long-term efforts such as infrastructure."}
{"original": "However, President Joe Biden did not support a wealth tax while running for office and his administration has already indicated they are looking at other options to pay for the costs of future investments. Last month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said a wealth tax has very difficult implementation problems. On several occasions, she and other Biden administration officials have instead discussed examining the corporate tax rate and loopholes."}
{"original": "At the same time, passage of a wealth tax would prove difficult in the Senate. The Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act is cosponsored by Democratic Senators Bernie Sanders, Sheldon Whitehouse, Jeff Merkley, Kirsten Gillibrand, Brian Schatz, Ed Markey and Mazie Hirono. But with the chamber split 50-50 along party lines, getting a majority, much less 60 votes, could prove challenge. Warren has called for scrapping the filibuster, stating the procedural mechanism to delay or block a vote gives Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell veto power."}
{"original": "The number of countries with wealth taxes has dropped over the past 30 years. In 1990, 12 European countries had wealth taxes, but by 2018, that number was down to three. Economists note there are multiple challenges associated with estimating the revenues a wealth tax would generate in part because of how assets are valued."}
{"original": "On the equity ground, on the tax burden ground, it can be very appealing. A large amount of money affecting relatively few taxpayers, all of whom are at the very top of the wealth distribution, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. But it can have trickle-down effects in a negative way if it hurts the economy, if it hurts investment, and it may not have as strong an effect as desired by supporters because of ways to avoid and evade a tax."}
{"original": "The Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act as proposed includes several provisions to block tax evasion, including a $100 billion investment in the Internal Revenue Service, a 30% minimum audit rate for taxpayers subjected to the tax and a 40% so-called exit tax on net worth above $50 million of Americans who renounce their citizenship in an attempt to get out of paying the tax."}
{"original": "For any good tax, you want it to be able to work without having these super stringent measures to prevent avoidance, said Tax Foundation economist Daniel Bunn. If you need that sort of penalty rate to prevent avoidance, then I would say that you're probably designing the tax wrong to begin with."}
{"original": "Bunn also notes that a wealth tax could cause foreign investors to replace home-grown billionaires as owners of capital."}
{"original": "If you reduce the return on wealth for U.S. citizens, and you don't have something similar for high net worth individuals who are investing in the U.S., you end up changing the ownership structure of U.S. assets, said Bunn. so instead of U.S. citizens owning a lot of the assets in the U.S — whether that's housing or equities or other assets — then you are essentially creating a preference for foreign ownership through the tax code."}
{"original": "But the idea of a wealth tax overall does have broad support in the United States. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last year found nearly two-thirds of Americans strongly or somewhat agree that the very rich should be contributing more."}
{"original": "Microsoft is planning to become carbon negative by 2030, eventually removing more carbon from the environment than it emits. The company will also reduce emissions to zero across its entire supply chain. And once it reaches zero, it plans to remove all the carbon it has emitted — either directly or through electricity consumption — since its founding in 1975."}
{"original": "When it comes to carbon, neutrality is not enough, Brad Smith, the company's president, said on Thursday. We have to get ourselves to net zero."}
{"original": "The company also said it would lobby for policies to put a price on carbon and bring clean energy technology to scale faster. Microsoft is part of a coalition of companies backing a carbon tax."}
{"original": "The concept of removing carbon from the atmosphere has garnered more attention as the window of time for the planet to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions narrows. Methods to remove carbon range from nature-based, such as planting large amounts of trees or using soil management techniques that absorb carbon, to technological methods that are still in their infancy, like capturing carbon directly from the air."}
{"original": "Technology does exist that does this, but getting the price and the scalability to where we need it to be is a significant challenge, said Lucas Joppa, the company's chief sustainability officer."}
{"original": "Microsoft will initially focus on nature-based methods like restoring degraded forests and planting new ones, Joppa said. It will also invest $1 billion into a fund for carbon removal and reduction technology."}
{"original": "This is what science says we have to do, and we can't be the only ones. This can't be seen as 'ambitious' moving forward, Joppa said."}
{"original": "He added, If we're going to achieve what science says we have to achieve, we have to remove carbon [from the atmosphere.]"}
{"original": "The company did not offer a precise figure for the amount of carbon it has emitted in its lifetime. Every year, it emits the equivalent of 16 million tons of carbon dioxide, Smith said. That estimate includes not just Microsoft's global network of energy-chugging data centers, but emissions from making electronics components for its devices and from everyone who plugs in its Xbox gaming consoles at home, the Associated Press reported."}
{"original": "The pledge to include supply-chain emissions expands an earlier promise to run Microsoft's data centers primarily on renewable energy, It also follows a similar move by Apple."}
{"original": "Microsoft plans to push its suppliers to cut their environmental footprint, in the same way it has required some of them to offer their workers paid time off and parental leave. It's also expanding the scope of a fee it has had since 2012, which charges its own business units for each ton of carbon they emit."}
{"original": "Pressure on governments, not on clients"}
{"original": "Environmental activists praised the company's intent to push for low-carbon policies."}
{"original": "A company's most powerful tool for fighting climate change is its political influence, and we're eager to see Microsoft use it, Elizabeth Sturcken, managing director of EDF+Business, said via email."}
{"original": "Likewise, Microsoft's promise to make up for its historical emissions could set an example for others. No company has yet made such a commitment, but it's been a sticking point in climate negotiations with developing countries that are suffering many of the worst effects of a climate crisis they did little to cause, said Gary Cook, senior IT sector analyst for Greenpeace."}
{"original": "This has been a topic in the climate negotiations for ages, said Cook. This is both justified by the climate science and is also what should be fair."}
{"original": "However, Cook and other environmental experts called out Microsoft's decision to keep working with oil and gas companies, which make use of cloud software to speed up extraction of fossil fuels. Amazon's AWS service has also come under fire from activists and employees for its work with fossil-fuel clients."}

{"original": "NEW YORK -- Labors of love, one from Martin Scorsese, the other from Ben Affleck, proved costly at a casualty strewn weekend box office where the uplifting NASA drama Hidden Figures stayed on top for the second straight week."}
{"original": "Hidden Figures, about African-American mathematicians in the 1960s space race, sold a leading $20.5 million in tickets in North American theaters over the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday weekend, according to estimates Sunday. Fox anticipates the film, starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae, will make $25.3 million when Monday is included, bringing its cumulative total to about $60 million."}
{"original": "The weekend was more remarkable for what didn't work than what did. Both Affleck's period gangster thriller Live by Night and Scorsese's Christian epic Silence bombed in their wide-release debuts, earning just $5.4 million in 2,471 theaters and $1.9 million in 747 theaters, respectively. Neither film earned enough to make it into the top 10 at the box office."}
{"original": "Both were high-profile projects that each filmmaker used their considerable sway to get made."}
{"original": "Live by Night was Affleck's directorial follow-up to the best-picture winning Argo. It cost $90 million to make, though rebates and tax incentives lowered its budget to $65 million. But critics said Live by Night was a step backward for Affleck, who spent much of his publicity campaign fending off questions about his plans to direct a stand-alone Batman film for Warner Bros. The studio, which declined to comment Sunday, estimates Live by Night will make $6.7 million over the four-day weekend."}
{"original": "The epitome of a passion project, Silence, which Scorsese contemplated for nearly three decades, represents a culmination of the director's investigations into the nature of faith.

{"original": "WASHINGTON -- U.S. retail sales fell for a second straight month in March and consumer prices dropped for the first time in 13 months, supporting views that the economy lost significant momentum in the first quarter."}

{"original": "The U.S. Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index dropped 0.3 percent in March, the first decline since February 2016, as declining costs for gasoline and mobile phone services offset rising rents and food prices."}

He said a number of one-off factors were behind the muted inflation results, such as an influx of cars whose leases expired and were put up for sale at discounts."}
{"original": "The U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday retail sales dropped 0.2 percent last month after a 0.3 percent decrease in February, which was the first and biggest decline in nearly a year. Compared to March last year retail sales increased 5.2 percent."}
{"original": "Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales slipping 0.1 percent last month. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rebounded 0.5 percent after falling 0.2 percent in February."}
{"original": "These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product."}
{"original": "Despite last month's increase in core retail sales, consumer spending likely braked sharply in the first quarter after growing at a brisk 3.5 percent annualized rate in the final three months of 2016. The apparent slowdown in consumption is partly blamed on the late disbursement of income tax refunds by the government as it sought to combat fraud."}
{"original": "These data are impossible to square with the stratospheric levels of consumer confidence recorded across an array of surveys, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics"}

{"original": "With job growth averaging 178,000 per month in the first quarter, the anticipated slowdown in GDP likely understates the health of the economy. In addition, first-quarter GDP tends to be weaker because of calculation problems that the government has acknowledged and is working to resolve."}

{"original": "Sales at electronics and appliances stores surged 2.6 percent, the largest increase since June 2015. Receipts at clothing stores climbed 1.0 percent, the biggest advance since February 2016.

{"original": "On the inflation front, the so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, fell 0.1 percent, the first and largest decrease since January 2010, after rising 0.2 percent in February. As a result, the year-on-year increase slowed to 2.0 percent."}
{"original": "That was the smallest advance since November 2015 and followed a 2.2 percent increase in February. The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.8 percent."}
{"original": "A 6.2 percent drop in gasoline prices was the biggest factor in the monthly decline in the CPI. Monthly consumer inflation was also weighed down by a record 7.0 percent drop in the cost of wireless telephone services. Still, consumers paid more for food and rents last month."}

The new travel ban will go into effect late Friday night at midnight."}
{"original": "In his address, the president indicated that trade would also be subject to the suspension. These prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval, he said. However, after his speech, he clarified by tweet that it's very important for all countries & businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump accused the EU of not taking the precautions the U.S. had taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus from China. The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots, Mr. Trump said. As a result a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travel. But he did not explain why he made an exception for the U.K., which has had six coronavirus deaths so far and has 373 cases diagnosed, among them, the health minister."}
{"original": "The president also announced that he was instructing the Small Business Administration to provide capital and liquidity in the form of low-interest loans to help small businesses.

{"original": "Danny Frost, a spokesman for District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr., confirmed that prosecutors had taken possession of the tax records on Monday, the same day the Supreme Court rejected Mr. Trump's last-ditch legal effort to block prosecutors from obtaining them."}
{"original": "The former president has fought to keep his financial history under wraps for years, and accused prosecutors of pursuing a politically motivated fishing expedition after the Supreme Court's order."}
{"original": "Vance's office began investigating Mr. Trump's business dealings in 2018, initially focusing on hush-money payments made to women who claimed to have had affairs with Mr. Trump. Court filings indicate the investigation has since widened to include potential tax and business fraud related to the Trump Organization's valuation of its properties."}
{"original": "Mazars USA, the accounting firm subpoenaed in the case, said after the Supreme Court's move on Monday that it would fulfill all of our professional and legal obligations."}
{"original": "Filings by Vance's office in the fight over the subpoena indicated that prosecutors are examining wide disparities in how Mr. Trump's company valued properties in its portfolio. For instance, prosecutors wrote in September that in the past decade, Mr. Trump's valuation of the Seven Springs estate in suburban New York ranged from between $25 million and $50 million, to between $261 and $291 million."}
{"original": "Other subpoenas in the probe suggest investigators are scrutinizing the expansive 200-acre property that straddles the affluent New York towns of Bedford, New Castle and North Castle. Ralph Mastromonaco, an engineer who worked on the Seven Springs estate property for Mr. Trump, told CBS News on February 11 that he recently received subpoenas for his work. Mastromonaco said he quickly complied, turning over maps of the 200-acre property, and other documents he produced for the Trump Organization nearly a decade ago."}
{"original": "Mastromonaco's subpoena came weeks after Manhattan investigators sent a subpoena to the town clerk of Bedford. The grand jury subpoena, which was obtained by CBS News, requested documents related to Seven Springs valuations and tax assessments, tax appeals and conservation easements."}

{"original": "The Transportation Department says it will take public comments before issuing a final order that could allow the subsidiary to begin flying to the U.S."}
{"original": "The decision is a setback for the major U.S. airlines and their labor unions, who say that the Irish subsidiary will be an unfair, low-wage competitor on key trans-Atlantic routes."}
{"original": "The president of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), Capt. Tim Canoll, released a statement which read in part, We are extremely disappointed by the DOT's intention to permit Norwegian Air International to fly to and from the United States because it is an affront to fair competition."}
{"original": "DOT is proposing to allow a foreign airline to compete directly with U.S. airlines on long-haul international routes with unfair economic advantages, Canoll wrote. Norwegian Air International has picked its place of incorporation based on whether that nation's tax and regulatory laws are favorable."}
{"original": "The Association of Flight Attendants union said it strongly opposes this application as it sets a dangerous precedent for transatlantic aviation and risks thousands of U.S. aviation jobs."}
{"original": "For its part, Norwegian wrote that a final approval would be a win-win for consumers and the economy on both sides of the Atlantic... Our continued presence in the U.S. will create thousands of jobs and generate tens of millions of dollars of economic activity for the Group's U.S. destinations."}

{"original": "The $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by President Joe Biden would deliver significant financial assistance to the poorest U.S. households, who have faced higher rates of income and job losses during the coronavirus pandemic, a new analysis finds."}
{"original": "Under the plan advancing in the House Ways and Means Committee, the next stimulus bill would send $1,400 to eligible people, as well as expand the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Altogether, the three programs would provide a 33% boost to the pre-tax incomes of the poorest 20% of Americans — or a $3,590 hike per family — according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy."}
{"original": "The three programs — a third round of stimulus checks, plus the two expanded tax credits — would provide a similar dollar amount of average benefits to 95% of U.S. households, the ITEP analysis found. But the impact would be much greater for lower-income households because the benefits would represent a larger share of their income. That's important because the lowest-earning households are more likely to spend that money quickly, providing a boost to the economy while stabilizing their own households, ITEP director of federal tax policy Steve Wamhoff told CBS MoneyWatch."}
{"original": "There are reasons why this is important at the micro level — helping people who need it — but also at the macro level, the best way to do that is to get money into the hands of people who will spend it, he said."}
{"original": "Middle- and high-income Americans have recovered faster during the economic downturn caused by the pandemic than lower income households, partly because the latter are more likely to work in industries that have taken a bigger hit, such as restaurants or retail."}
{"original": "That's creating different spending patterns, with households earning more than $78,000 mostly socking away their second stimulus checks, the $600 payments the U.S. started sending out in December, according to a recent study. By contrast, families below that income have tended to spend the money."}
{"original": "The benefit from the three programs would provide a total income boost of $3,590 for the poorest fifth of Americans, who earn an average of $10,900 annually, ITEP found. The benefit to the middle 20% of households would be similar, at $3,370, but would have a smaller proportional impact because of their higher average income in that quintile, at $51,500 per year."}
{"original": "Another study from the Tax Policy Center found a similar boost from the proposed stimulus plan, with its analysis projecting the bottom one-fifth of American earners would see income gains of 20% on an after-tax basis. Two-thirds of the proposed benefits would be directed to households earning $91,000 per year or less, the Tax Policy Center found."}
{"original": "About 11% of the benefits would be enjoyed by households in the top 20% of earners, or those with incomes of $164,000 or more, it said."}
{"original": "The House Ways & Means Committee could have done a better job targeting both economic impact payments and the enhanced CTC, Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center wrote in a blog post. Still, its bill would provide substantial relief to low- and moderate-income households at a time when many are in deep economic distress."}
{"original": "Among the significant changes in the stimulus effort would be an overhaul of the Child Tax Credit. Under the plan, the CTC would be expanded up to $3,600 for children up to 6 years old and $3,000 for children up to age 17."}
{"original": "The CTC's current limit is now $2,000 for many families, although the benefits are limited for the poorest families. That's one reason why some anti-poverty advocates have urged for an overhaul of the tax credit. For instance, researchers at Stanford University and Syracuse University last year found that the vast majority of children living in households in the bottom decile [or bottom 10%] of the national [income] distribution are completely ineligible for the credit."}
{"original": "Under the Democrats' plan to expand the CTC, an additional 4.1 million children would be lifted out of poverty, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. The plan would also make the tax credit payable on a monthly basis, rather than claimed annually when you file your taxes."}
{"original": "In other words, a family with three children under 6 would receive an annual CTC of $10,800, which would be deposited to their bank account by the IRS in monthly payments of $900."}
{"original": "The proposal would also extend the Earned Income Tax Credit to more low-income childless workers, raising the maximum tax credit for childless adults from about $530 to roughly $1,500. It would also boost the income cap from about $16,000 to at least $21,000 to qualify, the CBPP said."}

{"original": "Just four years ago, the cost to purchase a New York City taxi medallion, an essential license needed to operate a yellow cab, hit $1.3 million. A hefty sum but worth it given the lucrative trade in shuttling New Yorkers around the city's five boroughs. But not anymore."}
{"original": "The price of a taxi medallion crashed to its lowest level in about a decade when one sold for $241,000 in March. Last year, medallion sales ranged from $325,000 to $750,000. What has happened since 2013? The arrival of ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft, which are now a competitive force on the city's streets."}
{"original": "The March sale was just the latest sign of their devastating effect on New York City's yellow cabs. In January 2017, medallions accounted for 48 percent of total trips logged by yellow taxis as well as cars dispatched by ride-hailing companies. That's down from 68 percent in January 2016."}
{"original": "Last year, lenders foreclosed on 39 medallions, more than triple the amount in 2015, according to Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) head Meera Joshi. The city controls the number of yellow taxi medallions, capping it for the last couple of years at 13,587."}
{"original": "However, Uber has 51,000 vehicles affiliated with its service, while Lyft has 1,500, according to the TLC."}
{"original": "The problem is too many drivers chasing too few passengers, and the city abdicated its responsibility, medallion owner Carolyn Protz told the New York Post earlier this month. New York cab drivers aren't the only ones suffering from the onslaught of the hail-ride services."}
{"original": "Drivers in cities like Boston, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles also blame their new competitors for steep declines in business, adding that the newcomers don't face the same legal requirements the incumbents must meet."}
{"original": "Last year, San Francisco's largest taxi company, Yellow Cab Cooperative, filed for bankruptcy, citing ride-hailing companies as a contributing factor to its financial woes, published reports said. Barwood Car Co. in Kensington, Maryland, suffered the same fate, according to news articles."}
{"original": "Last month, New York City changed some of the regulations governing medallions in hopes of easing the burden on owners. For example, the transfer tax on a sale was dropped to 0.5 percent from 5 percent. Also, owners of single medallions are no longer limited to selling to someone who doesn't already own one, opening up the pool of potential buyers."}
{"original": "That is pretty important for an owner who wants to sell, said Joshi. She said the changes were made in response to medallion owners' complaints about the restrictive policies."}

{"original": "DETROIT - The threat from President Donald Trump to tax Mexican-made cars sold in the U.S. would throw the industry into disarray, analysts said, forcing some uncomfortable choices. Manufacturers could raise car prices or swallow the cost. They could stop selling Mexican-made cars in the U.S. but risk losing customers. Or move production to the U.S. but make less money."}
{"original": "I don't think the auto industry would turn up its feet and die, but it would be a terrible shock. It would create mayhem with their profitability, said Marina Whitman, a business professor at the University of Michigan and a former vice president at General Motors (GM)."}
{"original": "Before he was to host a breakfast meeting early Tuesday with the heads of General Motors, Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), Trump demanded on Twitter that automakers build new factories in the U.S. I want new plants to be built here for cars sold here, his tweet said. He has warned of a substantial border tax on companies that move manufacturing out of the country and promised tax advantages to those that produce domestically."}
{"original": "For more than two decades, Mexico has been an oasis for the auto industry, offering cheap labor and access to dozens of markets through free-trade deals. Whitman said Detroit automakers can't build small cars profitably in the U.S., where a unionized auto worker can make $58 an hour in wages and benefits. By comparison, a Mexican auto assembly worker makes a little more than $8."}
{"original": "That helps explain why automakers have announced $24 billion in Mexican investments over the last six years, according to the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank. In all, $50.5 billion in vehicles and $51 billion in auto parts were shipped to the U.S. from Mexico in 2015, U.S. government data show."}
{"original": "Mexico's auto sector, while still smaller than the U.S., is growing at a faster clip. Mexican production capacity is expected to rise 49 percent to 5.5 million vehicles by 2023, according to LMC Automotive, a forecasting firm. U.S. capacity will grow 13 percent to 14.2 million vehicles in the same period."}
{"original": "But Mr. Trump could change that. In frequent tweets targeting the auto industry, he has proposed both a 35-percent tariff on Mexican-made imports and a border tax, which would tax companies' imports. That's forcing automakers to consider a number of options."}
{"original": "Abandoning Mexico and moving production to the U.S., as Trump demands, would cost the industry billions and scuttle plans that are years in the making. Audi (VLKAY), for example, just opened a plant in Mexico that it decided to build five years ago."}
{"original": "It's very difficult to turn on your heels quickly in the auto industry, said Laurie Harbour-Felax, a manufacturing consultant and president of Harbour Results."}
{"original": "In recent weeks, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota (TM) and BMW have all said they won't shift their production plans, while stressing the amount they've invested in the U.S. BMW, for example, said it's proceeding with a $1 billion plant in Mexico that will make the 3 Series sedan starting in 2019. The German automaker also noted that its SUV plant in South Carolina is its largest plant worldwide."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump's border tax would hurt some automakers more than others. Volkswagen, for example, imports 32 percent of the vehicles its sells in the U.S. from Mexico, according to LMC. But Honda (HMC) imports just 11 percent, and that's expected to fall this year after it moves production of the CR-V SUV from Mexico to Indiana."}
{"original": "In early January, Ford made the surprise announcement that it would halt construction of a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico slated to build the compact Focus. It also announced plans to invest $700 million of that savings into a Michigan plant where it will make new electric and autonomous cars."}
{"original": "Ford said declining sales of small cars, not President Trump, influenced the Mexico plant decision, and the company will still make the Focus in Mexico at a different plant. But Ford CEO Mark Fields noted that Mr. Trump's promise to lower corporate taxes and ease regulations would make it more attractive to do business in the U.S. Fields also said he's not worried about the possibility of tariffs"}
{"original": "Other execs appear more nervous. Speaking to reporters at the Detroit auto show, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said his company might withdraw from Mexico altogether if tariffs got too high."}
{"original": "Those plants were designed, built and purposed at a time when NAFTA was alive and well, he said. It's one of the perils associated with the business that we run."}
{"original": "President Trump can't place tariffs on companies or groups of companies without congressional approval, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics. But he could fashion tariffs that hurt some companies more than others by, for example, picking and choosing from the dozens of import classifications for vehicles and parts."}
{"original": "Automakers could stop selling some Mexican-made cars in the U.S. altogether, but that would cost them customers. They could also try to sell the cars elsewhere."}
{"original": "Mexico has free-trade agreements covering 45 countries, including deals with the European Union, Japan and South America. By comparison, the U.S. has agreements with 20 countries."}
{"original": "Nissan Motor (NSANY), the biggest producer in Mexico, made more than 823,000 vehicles in the country in 2015. Forty-six percent were shipped to the U.S., but another 17 percent went to other countries, including Canada and Saudi Arabia. Nissan could tweak those numbers if U.S. tariffs were prohibitive."}
{"original": "All carmakers will adapt to the new rules, if there are new rules, Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn said this month in Detroit."}
{"original": "If Mr. Trump imposes tariffs, automakers could try to pass along the cost to U.S. customers. But that would raise the price tag of relatively affordable cars like the $17,000 Nissan Sentra or the $21,000 Chevrolet Trax by thousands of dollars."}
{"original": "Even a U.S.-built vehicle like the Toyota Camry would cost more. Jim Lentz, CEO of Toyota North America, said 25 percent of the Camry's parts are imported, and tariffs on those parts would add roughly $1,000 to the cost of the car."}
{"original": "Automakers could swallow the cost of the tariff, but it would hurt their bottom lines."}
{"original": "Dustin Blanchard, 31, who works for a software startup in Austin, Texas, drives a 2007 Nissan Sentra that he bought for $18,000. His car was made in Mexico, but he didn't think much about that when he bought it."}
{"original": "The parts all come from everywhere. Domestic brands are made overseas, and Japanese cars are made here, he says. It's so interconnected that you don't feel like it's a patriotic duty to buy a Ford or something."}
{"original": "But a 35-percent tariff would have added $6,300 to the cost of his Sentra, which would have put it out of his reach."}
{"original": "Blanchard has thought more about NAFTA's impact since the election. When he recently drank a Mexican Coke, he says, he half-joked that he better enjoy it while he can."}
{"original": "It's something I had taken for granted, he said, that free trade was here to stay."}
{"original": "Pierre, South Dakota — A South Dakota judge on Monday struck down a voter-approved constitutional amendment that legalized recreational marijuana after Governor Kristi Noem's administration challenged it."}
{"original": "Circuit Judge Christina Klinger ruled the measure approved by voters in November violated the state's requirement that constitutional amendments deal with just one subject and would have created broad changes to state government."}
{"original": "Amendment A is a revision as it has far-reaching effects on the basic nature of South Dakota's governmental system, she wrote in her ruling."}
{"original": "Brendan Johnson, who sponsored the amendment and represented a pro-marijuana group in court, said it was preparing an appeal to South Dakota's Supreme Court."}
{"original": "Two law enforcement officers, Highway Patrol Superintendent Col. Rick Miller and Pennington County Sheriff Kevin Thom, sued to block legalization by challenging its constitutionality. Miller was effectively acting on behalf of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who had opposed the effort to legalize pot."}
{"original": "Klinger was appointed as a circuit court judge by Noem in 2019."}
{"original": "Today's decision protects and safeguards our constitution, Noem said in a statement. I'm confident that South Dakota Supreme Court, if asked to weigh in as well, will come to the same conclusion."}
{"original": "Thom also praised the ruling, saying it solidifies the protections of a 2018 constitutional amendment that required further amendments to stick to one subject."}
{"original": "In her ruling, Klinger said that marijuana legalization would have touched on business licensing, taxation and hemp cultivation. The amendment would have given the state's Department of Revenue power to administer recreational marijuana, but Klinger ruled that by doing so, it overstepped the authority of the executive and legislative branches of government."}
{"original": "Lawyers defending legalization had cast the lawsuit as an effort to overturn the results of a fair election. About 54 percent of voters approved recreational marijuana in November."}
{"original": "Possessing small amounts of marijuana would have become legal on July 1, but that will not happen unless a higher court overturns the ruling."}
{"original": "Marijuana has become broadly accepted around the United States, with a Gallup Poll in November showing 68% of Americans favored legalization. South Dakota was among four states that month to approve recreational marijuana, along with New Jersey, Arizona and Montana. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have done so."}
{"original": "Supporters have argued that legalization creates jobs and raises tax money for governments that badly need it. Opponents have argued that marijuana leads to use of harder drugs, and may also lead to more impaired driving and other crimes."}
{"original": "The cost of owning a car varies from state by state, with auto insurance remaining one of the biggest variables."}
{"original": "That's partly because each state has its own regulations on minimum coverage, which can result in a difference of thousands of dollars. The most expensive state for buying vehicle insurance is Michigan, where the average annual cost for minimum coverage is a $2,446, according to CarInsurance.com, a quote-comparison site. The title for cheapest state goes to North Carolina, where minimum coverage will set drivers back by only $385."}
{"original": "Rates are based on a number of issues, ranging from the minimum requirements of each state as well as the number of accidents in each region and the percentage of uninsured drivers. Generally, consumers can reduce their premium to the lowest possible by signing up for liability insurance at their state's minimum limit, but that strategy can be risky."}
{"original": "Buying just the minimum amount of insurance required to drive legally typically doesn't pay off, said Michelle Megna, managing editor of CarInsurance.com. Even a minor accident can cost much more than what your insurer will pay out to cover damages."}
{"original": "In seven states at least one out of five drivers is uninsured, Megna said. They are Oklahoma (26 percent); Florida (24 percent); Mississippi (23 percent); New Mexico (22 percent); Michigan (21 percent); Tennessee (20 percent); and Alabama (20 percent)."}
{"original": "It might be tempting to drop car insurance given the overall costs of owning a car, but experts say the first step is to shop around and consider ways to lower your insurance costs."}
{"original": "The overall costs of owning a car -- including insurance, sales tax, gasoline and costs such as maintenance -- can vary widely by state, according to a new study from GOBankingRates.com, but Michigan again emerged as the costliest. Drivers there will pay more than $15,300 for three years of car ownership, while drivers in the least expensive state -- New Hampshire -- will pay just over $8,000."}
{"original": "Minimum liability coverages are usually written like 30/60/25, which means an owner must be covered for up to $30,000 of medical expenses per person, up to $60,000 in medical expenses per accident and up to $25,000 for property damage."}
{"original": "Still, drivers should be aware that they're taking on more risk if they opt to pare coverage. For instance, if a car lacking comprehensive coverage is damaged when a tree falls on it, the owner is on the hook for covering those repairs."}
{"original": "Before dropping coverage, GOBankingRates' lead reporter Elyssa Kirkham said, consumers should ask whether they have emergency savings for those incidents where you backed into a concrete pole, or when you need to have a car repaired. She added, Could you pay for that out of pocket? If you can, then your need for insurance coverage will be less."}
{"original": "Signing on for minimum coverage usually makes sense only if a consumer fits one of several profiles, CarInsurance.com found."}
{"original": "If a car is old and not worth much. In this case, it might make sense to skip collision and comprehensive coverage. The first pays if a car needs to be repaired after an accident, while the latter pays to replace a car if it's stolen or if it needs repairs after suffering damage outside of a collision with another car, such as vandalism or if a tree falls on the vehicle."}
{"original": "If the owner doesn't drive frequently. Less time on the road means less chance of getting into an accident."}
{"original": "The owner doesn't have assets that could be at risk. If you're at fault in an accident and have low insurance coverage, you could be sued to recover damages that your insurer doesn't cover. That means your home or other assets could be at risk, although CarInsurance.com notes that 401(k)s and pensions are protected. IRAs, however, might not be sheltered in some states."}
{"original": "Four weeks into a partial government shutdown that has gnarled air travel, threatened millions of tax refunds and stalled environmental protections, Wall Street seems to have a message for the feds: Stay shut."}
{"original": "Major U.S. stock indexes are up 13 percent or more since Dec. 24, the first day of the shutdown that markets were open."}
{"original": "News that the U.S. and China were considering dropping trade barriers sent the major market indexes even higher Friday afternoon, but stocks have been rising since the shutdown began. The S&P 500-stock index, now up for four weeks straight, closed at 2,670 on Friday, up 2.3 percent this week. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average spiked 3.5 percent since Monday, closing at 24,706, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 3.7 percent this week to 7,157."}
{"original": "Apparent progress in U.S.-China trade talks, as well as limited economic data coming out that shows the U.S. economy remains on solid footing, seem to have persuaded investors the economy isn't turning south, as have assurances from Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell that the central bank would be patient and listen to the markets."}
{"original": "Past shutdowns have largely been a nonevent for the U.S. economy and stocks. Business and consumer confidence indicators usually decline and government spending drops during a shutdown, but any losses have typically been recouped quickly, John Lynch, research chief investment strategist at LPL Financial, said in a blog post."}
{"original": "Still, the S&P 500 has typically fallen in previous shutdowns, according to LPL. The fact that stocks are now rising makes the current shutdown unusual for more than its length. On average, the index drops by 0.4 percent in shutdowns, LPL found. Before the current shutdown, the biggest stock rise occurred during the shutdown of 2013. During the 17 days the federal government was closed, the S&P 500 rose 2.3 percent."}
{"original": "It's worth remembering that stocks have been unusually volatile in the past half-year, and can turn on a dime. The current shutdown has also depressed consumer spending, and economists predict it could reduce GDP growth for the first quarter by as much as 0.3 percent. New York Federal Reserve President John Williams on Friday said he saw some emerging headwinds to growth from the partial government shutdown."}
{"original": "Investors will have to wait a while for the shutdown's impact to be measured—the government agency that tracks the GDP is included in the shutdown."}
{"original": "Taxing electronic cigarettes like regular smokes could result in fewer Americans kicking the habit, some researchers think. A new study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that taxing vaping products at the same rate as cigarettes could deter 2.7 million U.S. adults from quitting over a decade."}
{"original": "Although there is no federal tax on e-cigarettes, some 17 states and the District of Columbia have a vaping tax, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts. More than half of those states imposed the levy this year amid growing concerns about the safety of e-cigarettes. The taxes come as the vaping industry faces mounting scrutiny for marketing practices that critics say targets younger Americans."}
{"original": "A deadly spate of lung illnesses tied to unregulated vaping products also had the Trump administration recently mulling a ban on flavored e-cigarettes and Congress this month passing a law to raise to 21 the legal age to buy tobacco or vaping gear."}
{"original": "Nearly a decade ago, Minnesota became the first state in the U.S. to tax e-cigs. It initially imposed a rate of 35%, before sharply raising the levy in 2013 to a full 95% of the wholesale price for vaping products. The researchers — economists Dhaval Dave of Bentley University and Daniel Dench, Michael Grossman and Henry Saffer, all of City University of New York — wanted to weigh the impact of these taxes to assess the impact on consumer behavior."}
{"original": "Their main takeaway: In looking at the state's 600,000 adult smokers, Minnesota's e-cigarette tax deterred more than 32,000 adult smokers from giving up regular cigarettes over a 10-year period. That's because the sharp increase in vaping costs in the state made the products more expensive, discouraging consumers."}
{"original": "Not surprisingly, a nationwide vaping tax like the one imposed in Minnesota could have a larger effect. Should federal policy makers opt to tax e-cigs at the same rate as regular cigarettes, the price of the vaping products would rise about 62%, according to the study. That could deter up to 2.7 million smokers from quitting tobacco cigarettes, the researchers conclude."}
{"original": "Roughly 34 million Americans, or around 14% of the adult population, smoke cigarettes. And despite the potential impact of vaping taxes on smoking cessation, other considerations could still justify the added costs, the researchers said."}
{"original": "The public health benefits of not taxing e-cigarettes, however, must be weighed against effects of this decision on efforts to reduce vaping by youth, they cautioned."}
{"original": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell excoriated former President Trump Saturday in a speech on the Senate floor shortly after McConnell voted to acquit in the former president's second impeachment trial. In a speech with a first half reminiscent of the arguments made by House impeachment managers, McConnell said the former president was practically and morally responsible for the attack on the Capitol on January 6."}
{"original": "But McConnell argued that he believed it was unconstitutional to convict a president who was no longer in office."}
{"original": "This was an intensifying crescendo of conspiracy theories orchestrated by an outgoing president who seemed determined to either overturn the voters' decision or else torch our institutions on the way out, McConnell said."}
{"original": "McConnell was unequivocal about Mr. Trump's responsibility. There is no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day, he said, and added that Mr. Trump watched the events unfold on television. A mob was assaulting the Capitol in his name, he said. These criminals were carrying his banners, hanging his flags and screaming their loyalty to him."}
{"original": "The Senate voted 57-43 Saturday to acquit the former president on a charge for incitement of insurrection. Seven Republicans joined with Democrats in finding the former president guilty: Senators Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania."}
{"original": "McConnell said the people who stormed the Capitol believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of Mr. Trump. Having that belief, McConnell said, was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet earth."}
{"original": "McConnell described the violence on January 6, saying that Americans beat and bloodied their own police, stormed the Senate floor and built a gallows and chanted about murdering the Vice President. They did this, McConnell said, because they'd been fed wild falsehoods by the most powerful man on earth, because he was angry he lost an election."}
{"original": "But McConnell argued that the former president is constitutionally not eligible for conviction because he is no longer in office — even though the Senate voted 56-44 earlier this week that it was constitutionally possible to convict a former official."}
{"original": "McConnell said, I believe the Senate was right not to grab power the Constitution doesn't give us."}
{"original": "He said he respects his colleagues who have reached either conclusion about the constitutionality of convicting. This is a close question, no doubt, he said."}
{"original": "If President Trump were still in office, he said, I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge."}
{"original": "McConnell prevented the Senate from holding the impeachment trial before Mr. Trump left office. He refused to agree to an emergency session of the Senate to conduct the trial, arguing there was not enough time to conduct it fairly before President Biden took office. Mr. Biden was inaugurated seven days after the House voted to impeach Mr. Trump."}
{"original": "The trial, which began on February 9, lasted only five days."}
{"original": "Although Mr. Trump was acquitted of inciting the riot in the Senate trial, he could still face criminal charges. A Georgia prosecutor has opened a criminal investigation into Mr. Trump's alleged attempts to influence the presidential election in the state. And, separately, Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance is also overseeing an investigation into Mr. Trump for possible crimes as wide-ranging as fraud and tax evasion."}
{"original": "Some 48 million Americans have received a tax refund from the federal government so far this year, and what they do with the money is as varied as the country itself."}
{"original": "A survey by Bankrate.com finds that nearly a third of respondents (31 percent) receiving a refund said they plan to save or invest it, while 28 percent said they intend to use it to pay down debt. Twenty-seven percent said they would use the funds to pay for necessities, such as food or utility bills."}
{"original": "Bankrate said both young and old respondents were aligned in their interest to build on their tax refund, with 41 percent of millennials and 51 percent of retirees saying they plan to save or invest this money."}
{"original": "Surprisingly few Americans -- just 6 percent -- plan to use the cash they get back from Uncle Sam to splurge on a vacation or shopping spree, though that's the double the percentage compared to last year. Bankrate's Money Pulse survey also found that slightly more than half (51 percent) of Americans expect to get a refund or have already received it this year."}
{"original": "With about a month to this year's filing deadline (April 18), the majority of returns (80 percent) filed by Americans were for refunds -- not surprising, considering those who owe taxes tend to wait closer to the filing deadline to submit their returns. The average refund issued, as of Feb. 26, was $3,053 -- $5 more than last year. Most returns (94 percent) so far have also been electronically filed, according to the IRS."}
{"original": "The tax agency expects more than 150 million returns to be filed this season."}
{"original": "Bankrate's survey also found that Americans would be willing to wait longer for their refund if it would prevent tax fraud. Twenty-two percent said they're willing to wait patiently for up to eight weeks, followed closely by 20 percent who would wait one to two weeks. Fifteen percent said they would not be willing to wait any additional time to safeguard against refund fraud."}
{"original": "Overall, about three-quarters of taxpayers said they would be willing to wait longer for their refunds in an effort to thwart identity thieves from stealing a tax refund."}
{"original": "Bitcoin and other digital currency prices plunged after South Korea's top financial policymaker said Tuesday that a crackdown on trading of crypto currencies remains a possibility."}
{"original": "Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said in an interview with local radio station TBS that banning trading in digital currencies was a live option. He said the decision was subject to a thorough government review."}
{"original": "There are no disagreements over regulating speculation, such as using real-name accounts and levying taxes on crypto currency trading, Kim said. Shutting down digital currency exchanges is a live option but government ministries need to very seriously review it, he said."}
{"original": "Bitcoin was trading at $12,615.60, down 7.1 percent from the day before as of 8:03 a.m. GMT, according to Coindesk. The price of ethereum, another digital currency, had slipped 7.8 percent to $1,190.45 as of 8:04 a.m. GMT."}
{"original": "South Korean officials' remarks have swayed the global markets for bitcoin and other crypto currencies in the past few weeks. The country has seen a huge bitcoin craze, with young and old betting on the crypto currency to build wealth. The high demand from South Korean investors has created what investors call a kimchi premium, the extra price the South Koreans have to pay to buy digital currencies, sold in South Korea at higher than the average global prices."}
{"original": "South Korean officials are concerned about reports of tax evasion by some top exchanges, according to Kerrie Walsh, assistant economist at Capital Economics, in a research report. investors are also jittery about speculation that China may ban or restrict bitcoin mining over concerns about financial stability."}
{"original": "This has clearly rattled investors. And understandably so, Walsh noted. South Korea holds some of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, so a ban is expected to disrupt Bitcoin trading."}
{"original": "A ban or restriction on bitcoin mining in China could further weaken the market, given that the majority of mining occurs in China, Walsh added."}
{"original": "If Bitcoin isn't mined, transactions aren't approved and new Bitcoins aren't produced, which could grind the whole system to a halt. So a crackdown there could bring chaos to the Bitcoin community, Walsh wrote."}
{"original": "Last week, the South Korean justice minister's remark that the country will ban bitcoin and other digital currencies triggered big sell-offs and a public outcry. The presidential office then said that no final decision had been made."}
{"original": "An online petition on the presidential office's website has drawn more than 210,000 requests from people asking the government not to ban trading in digital currencies."}

{"original": "President Donald Trump has put Canada on notice about trade issues. That may leave many Americans scratching their heads, given that the country's northern neighbor hasn't sparked as much rhetoric from the current administration as Mexico."}
{"original": "That may be changing. Mr. Trump in recent days has cited two issues as specific concerns: the Canadian dairy and softwood industries. Both have stirred long-term concerns among American producers, and the Trump administration's tough stance on trade is now pushing the disputes to the forefront."}
{"original": "While the president has backed away from his pledge to cancel the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), he's still itching to renegotiate the deal. Trump's NAFTA complaints have mostly focused on how the two-decade-old trade agreement has shipped American manufacturing jobs to Mexico, a phenomenon that Canadian factories have also felt. But the administration's irritation with Canada hinges on what it's describing as unfair protectionist policies."}
{"original": "Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this, Mr. Trump tweeted last week."}

{"original": "Trade between the U.S. and Canada has mushroomed since NAFTA went into effect in 1994, yet it's fairly balanced between the two countries, according to Oxford Economics. The U.S. economy is 10 times bigger than that of Canada, which is highly dependent on American trade."}
{"original": "In fact, Canada has a minor deficit in goods and services trade vis-à-vis the U.S., Oxford senior economist Oren Klachkin wrote earlier this year in a research note."}
{"original": "He added, Canada will want to reach a final resolution to the persistent softwood lumber dispute, and find a middle ground on what U.S. producers call 'protectionist' Canadian dairy products policies. Much remains to be seen how this entire process would unfold."}
{"original": "What's going on with Mr. Trump's protests against Canadian trade policies? Here are five reasons the president is cheesed off."}
{"original": "The dairy dispute is focused on ultra-filtered milk. This product, used to make cheese and butter, had been exported by American dairy processors to Canada. But that business dried up after the Canadian dairy industry created a new pricing structure that effectively makes it cheaper to buy ultra-filtered milk domestically. The Canadian government contends its dairy industry is less protectionist than its American counterpart, and pointed to overproduction as a cause of poor results, according to an April letter from David MacNaughton, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., sent to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker."}
{"original": "U.S. dairy farmers are losing business. It's not yet clear what the impact will be, since some of the American dairy farmers who lost business are securing new contracts with other processors. U.S. dairy farmers export about 15 percent of their milk production, valued at $5 billion a year, according to the National Milk Producers Federation."}
{"original": "The question of fair trade softwoods. A smoldering dispute caught fire this month when the Trump administration said it would slap new tariffs on Canadian softwood imports. U.S. lawmakers have argued that Canada effectively subsidizes its industry because it cuts timber from public lands, something that's not widely available to U.S. producers. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross described the tariffs, which average 20 percent, as a pretty big deal in terms of the Canadian relationship."}
{"original": "The bigger framing of Canada's trade policies. Some critics say Canada is the trade partner to watch, citing the dairy and softwood disputes as two examples of how the country is unfairly protectionist. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken issue with the American critics, saying it's an example of the pot calling the kettle black. Let's not pretend we're in a global free market when it comes to agriculture, he said in April."}
{"original": "Reconsidering buy American under NAFTA. Commerce Secretary Ross has signaled he wants to tighten the trade agreement's rules of origin, which outline how much of an import can be made from materials outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico and still qualify for tax-free shipping. That could add taxes to imports from Canada. On top of that, according to Oxford Economics, Mr. Trump may want to do away with a NAFTA buy American clause that includes Canadian goods."}
{"original": "Correction: This story was updated to clarify it was the Canadian dairy industry, not the government of Canada, which lowered prices."}
{"original": "Democrats are welcoming a wide variety of potential challengers to President Trump's 2020 re-election bid — with the exception of one."}
{"original": "In an interview Sunday with CBS News' 60 Minutes, Starbucks' former CEO Howard Schultz announced he is seriously considering a bid as an centrist independent. I've been a lifelong Democrat. We look at both parties, we see extremes on both sides, Schultz told Scott Pelley."}
{"original": "The American people are exhausted. Their trust has been broken. And they are looking for a better choice, he said."}
{"original": "But what Schultz may see as a better choice, Democrats see as a bad idea. Party members wasted no time in discouraging him from moving forward with a campaign, fearing a liberal independent bid would draw away votes from the eventual party nominee and work to Mr. Trump's advantage."}
{"original": "I have a concern that, if he did run, that, essentially, it would provide Donald Trump with his best hope of getting reelected, 2020 hopeful Julián Castro told CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. I would suggest to Mr. Schultz to truly think about the negative impact that that might make."}
{"original": "Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, put it more bluntly: If he enters the race, I will start a Starbucks boycott because I'm not giving a penny that will end up in the election coffers of a guy who will help Trump win."}
{"original": "The chance to defeat Mr. Trump has become an organizing principle of the Democratic Party, and party primary and caucus voters are putting a premium on electability as they assess the candidates."}
{"original": "If you don't want Donald Trump re-elected, you should be ready to unite behind the Democratic nominee as the best antidote, says Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson, who was a spokesman for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. In the end, the American people won't take kindly to a billionaire who thinks his money entitles him to this kind of vanity experiment. People may not like the two party system, but they like a party of one even less."}
{"original": "Independent bids haven't been successful in presidential politics, and they're often seen as spoilers; The candidacies of Ross Perot in 1992 and Ralph Nader in 2000 are among the infamous examples of independent or third party bids influencing the outcome of the overall contest. And many Democrats were outraged by the candidacy of Jill Stein in 2016."}
{"original": "When New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg declined to make an independent bid in 2016, he argued that his candidacy could lead to the election of Donald Trump. That is not a risk I can take in good conscience, he wrote in an op-ed at the time."}
{"original": "Democrats have been supportive of an independent bid by a Republican — for one, John Kasich said to be weighing an independent run — as it would siphon votes from Mr. Trump. But Schultz is the first Democrat to weigh a bid outside the party. And his personal wealth and resources would allow him to remain in the running for as long as he'd like to stay in the race."}
{"original": "Schultz demurred when asked whether his entrance would be damaging for Democrats. I want to see the American people win, he said. I will be an independent person who will embrace those ideas because I'm not in any way in bed with a party."}
{"original": "Schultz has been a frequent and loud critic of Mr. Trump, and had used his position as CEO of Starbucks as a platform to weigh in on cultural debates. In his 60 Minutes interview, he agreed with many Democratic Party positions, including on immigration and climate change. And on the foreign policy front, he said it was not in the country's interest to pick fights with allies. We are much better as a country being part of the world order, he said."}
{"original": "But he disagrees with a push within the party for a Medicare-for-All approach to health care coverage, arguing that what the Democrats are proposing is something that is as false as the wall. And that is free health care for all, which the country cannot afford."}
{"original": "A big question during the post-recession economic recovery was why companies weren't sharing more of their profits with employees in the form of raises, especially after the Republican-led Congress moved to slash corporate taxes. Although President Donald Trump said last year that the cuts would lead to a pay bump for workers, new research suggests that raises may remain elusive in 2019."}
{"original": "About 70 percent of corporations say they plan to boost worker pay by 3 percent this year, according to compensation-data company PayScale. That's in line with the raises employers have offered in recent years and is only slightly ahead of the U.S. inflation rate of roughly 2 percent."}
{"original": "The upshot: At a time when corporate profits remain healthy and the economy on track for another solid year of growth, pay gains for most workers will be modest. The findings are based on a PayScale survey of about 7,000 corporations."}
{"original": "Two major factors are keeping a lid on raises, said Lydia Frank, vice president of content strategy at PayScale. First, companies are increasingly using profits to repurchase their own stock -- that benefits shareholders more than workers, with spending on such buybacks reaching a record $1 trillion last year. Second, a growing number of companies expect the U.S. to face another recession in the next year or two, and so are looking to curb spending."}
{"original": "It's been a little confounding, why wages haven't increased as much as you would expect given the robust economy, Frank said. And now there's a lot of uncertainty going into this year about an economic slowdown."}
{"original": "Despite that robust economic growth, workers' real wages -- what people take home after inflation -- fell 1.3 percent last year. PayScale's data differs somewhat from federal labor figures on wages because of differences in how the research firm crunches data. For instance, PayScale tracks workers who switch jobs, while the U.S. Department of Labor tracks a set of fixed jobs."}
{"original": "About 1 of 5 companies told PayScale they are already starting to prepare for a recession, including delaying capital spending, dialing back on hiring and making layoffs."}
{"original": "Most businesses also said that retaining key employees is a concern. With unemployment at its lowest rate in years and healthy job growth, workers have more opportunities to shift jobs -- and many are doing just that. About 20 percent of workers who quit their jobs left for better pay elsewhere, while about the same share quit for a more attractive title, the survey found."}
{"original": "Rather than offer fat pay raises, companies are boosting benefits and perks as a way to hire and retain employees, PayScale found. Forty-four percent of employers plan to offer remote work options this year, up from 39 percent last year, the study found. Other benefits that companies say they plan to add include a four-day workweek, education or tuition reimbursement, unlimited paid time off, and flex time."}
{"original": "Even if you are in a head-to-head competition, with companies offering the same type of base pay, the only way to differentiate yourself is around benefits or your mission, Frank said. That's where you see this benefits race."}
{"original": "Some companies are also relying on bonuses and what PayScale calls variable pay to attract workers or keep top talent in place. Roughly two-thirds of companies say they'll use bonuses to keep demand workers from departing for competitors."}
{"original": "Although most workers are likely to see only muted wage increases in 2019, some will enjoy much larger pay hikes, PayScale found. Last year, about 40 percent of employers handed out raises of at least 10 percent for a few jobs within their organizations, which tended to be for in-demand roles like IT positions."}
{"original": "If you are in a super-competitive job with a skill-set that's hard to find, you have more of an ability to negotiate, Frank said."}
{"original": "A controversial new proposal aims to stop overcrowding in the Italian city of Venice, one of the world's most popular tourist destinations. To deal with the approximately 30 million visitors it sees every year, the city is planning to start charging many tourists an entrance fee."}
{"original": "Its famed canals and picture-perfect setting has made Venice infamous for its tourists. But locals say it has become a Disneyland for tourists, and the city's future is at stake, reports CBS News' Seth Doane."}
{"original": "Hoards pack its narrow alleys searching for that all-important selfie, but the vast majority – about four-fifths of visitors – do not spend the night, meaning the city loses out on potential earnings from hotel taxes."}
{"original": "Now, Italy's parliament has approved a measure that'll allow the city to charge tourists who only come for the day up to 10 euros – the U.S. equivalent of about $11.50."}
{"original": "The money would go toward keeping the city clean, Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said, and allow locals to live with more decorum. Venetians have told us they're concerned the daily deluge of visitors is not only straining the city's resources and delicate architecture but causing Venice to lose its soul."}
{"original": "Since 1951, the city's population has plummeted to fewer than 55,000 people but it can see, on average, more than 80,000 visitors per day."}
{"original": "Residents have staged protests, carrying suitcases as a symbol they're on the way out. Before the new tax was announced Paola Mar, who manages tourism for the city, told CBS News that visitors are essential to the economy but that the city has reached a breaking point."}
{"original": "Mar said tourists are our guests and we want to treat them with respect but this is a fragile city."}
{"original": "Mar said they've tried to encourage tourists to visit lesser-seen parts of the city. They've put up gates so they can control the flow and have proposed raising a fine for those sitting or lying on undesignated public spaces. They've also banned the opening of new fast food chains out of concern Venice was at risk of losing its identity."}
{"original": "This new tax will be highest at peak times. It's not clear yet how or when it'll be imposed but other cities in Italy feeling the burden of too many tourists will be watching Venice closely."}
{"original": "The economic impact of the partial federal government shutdown is already seeping into the private sector, with small businesses across the country -- from construction firms to restaurants to craft beer makers -- saying they are feeling the pinch. As the impasse between President Donald Trump and Congressional leaders over funding a southern border wall enters its fourth week, business owners who rely on government customers are beginning to feel like collateral damage."}
{"original": "Mowa Haile, owner of Sky Blue Builders in Denver, was forced to stop work on several projects for the General Services Administration, the federal agency that handles office procurement and projects. That's meant laying off eight carpenters and a superintendent at the 50-person firm. In a competitive job market for skilled labor, Haile is worried he'll lose those employees by the time government reopens. And he's already considering cutting four or five more workers as the impasse continues."}
{"original": "We have these contracts, but we can't do any work because the clients aren't there to manage the work, Haile, a married father of two, told CBS MoneyWatch. We can't afford to keep nine people busy."}
{"original": "Every two weeks of a federal government shutdown trims 0.1 percentage points from U.S. economic growth, Bank of America economists wrote in a note this week, adding that more drag is likely as spending and investments are delayed and cautious companies hold tight to their cash."}
{"original": "If an impasse continues into March, funding lapses for food stamps could materially impact personal consumption and the cumulative drag from the shutdown could meaningfully cut growth in the U.S. in the first quarter, the economists wrote. Some of that could be made up if government reopens and federal workers get back pay as has happened in past shutdowns, the economists noted."}
{"original": "At the Ascension Annex coffee shop, around the corner from the federal building that houses the Environmental Protection Agency in Dallas, baristas are already feeling the pain."}
{"original": "I know for a fact that regulars we see all the time, we haven't seen them. It definitely affects us directly, barista Kioan Yare told CBS affilliate KTTV in Dallas-Fort Worth. A portion of our income is tips-based. So when we don't have the same amount of people coming in, we can't look forward to the same spending habits that we normally have."}
{"original": "Beyond D.C.: Federal jobs are spread all over"}
{"original": "The shutdown began Dec. 22, with some 800,000 federal workers across the country furloughed or working without pay and thousands more federal contractors temporarily out of work. Notwithstanding the high concentration of workers in the Washington, D.C., metro area, the bulk of federal employees live and work far outside the nation's capital."}
{"original": "Relative to population, federal jobs are as common in Alaska, Montana and Wyoming as they are in Maryland and Virginia."}
{"original": "Municipal bond-rating agencies like Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service this week struck slightly cautious notes, both citing the potential impact on local economies where there are high concentration of federal employees, like in the Denver area."}
{"original": "People will cut back on things, but unless you're talking about something that's going to be meaningful for sales tax revenues, or income tax revenues on a federal basis, that's not something that we are worried about, Amy Laskey, managing director at Fitch, told CBS MoneyWatch."}
{"original": "The big worry, she said, is when federal debt levels reach the ceiling authorized by Congress, expected sometime this summer. An extended shutdown from any Washington fight over raising that ceiling could hurt the nation's credit rating, she wrote."}
{"original": "Still, Moody's analyst Rebecca Karnovitz wrote in a note, cities and towns are already losing sales tax revenue, while retailers and food service companies are losing business because federal workers have cut their discretionary spending."}
{"original": "A longer shutdown could spread into debt markets as some cash-strapped federal employees are unable to make loan payments on mortgages or auto loans, she wrote. The impact may be small as some lenders might grant forbearance until the borrowers receive back pay."}
{"original": "Even workers looking for a new variety of stiff drink may be out of luck: The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau is shut until the funding impasse is over, which means local breweries, wineries and distilleries can't get approval on certain new unreleased products."}
{"original": "Dave Colt, cofounder of Sun King Brewery in Indianapolis, told CBS's WTTV that production for an agave-based spirit from the firm's new distillery will probably end up on hold."}
{"original": "So when we manufacture it in February we're gonna have to sit there and wait, Colt said. If you look at that retail, that's $25 to $30 a 750-milliliter, and we're talking about cases and cases and cases of sales potential."}
{"original": "The brewery also has a new bourbon awaiting approval, he said. It's not only affecting us, it's affecting every distillery in Indiana and across the country, Colt said."}
{"original": "Back in Denver, where Sky Blue Builders typically performs about $20 million of work annually, with about half from federal contracts, Haile said he's able to execute work from the the fully funded Defense Department. But Sky Blue Builders is still owed about $175,000 for federal work done in December, even though he submitted the invoice just before the shutdown."}
{"original": "Federal project managers told him they had no idea when Sky Blue Builders might be paid. And Haile estimates he can't start another $600,000 worth of work because there's nobody around to approve it."}
{"original": "The cash flow in the construction industry is intensive, you expend money and by the time you get that money back, it's 60 days [later], Haile said. These situations leave you in limbo. We have good financial wherewithal, but not enough to keep all those folks and sustain that. We have to make those tough decisions."}
{"original": "Half the time someone is unhappy with a judge's ruling. The normal recourse is an appeal. But in the caustic atmosphere of today's politics, there's a real chance the disgruntled party will threaten the judge. In the last five years, threats of federal judges have jumped 400% to more than 4,000 last year – many of them death threats, sometimes ending in violence. Now, judges are breaking with tradition and publicly calling on lawmakers to provide more protection. One of the strongest voices is federal judge Esther Salas. This past July, she was at home in New Jersey, in the basement with her son Daniel, cleaning up after his 20th birthday party, when a man disguised as a FedEx driver pulled up outside."}
{"original": "Esther Salas: Danny turned around and he said, Let's keep talking. I love talking to you mom. And it was at that exact moment that the doorbell rang. And before I could stop him, he just shot up the stairs. The next thing I hear is boom. It just sounded like a mini bomb. And then I hear no. And then I hear boom, boom, boom. And I just screamed, What is happening? When I got upstairs, it was, it was something no mother should ever see."}
{"original": "Daniel lying bleeding by the door; Mark, her husband, on his knees holding his side. Daniel was barely clinging to life."}
{"original": "Esther Salas: I--I didn't even know what to do. I remember picking up his shirt and seeing the bullet hole. You know, we were screaming, Daniel hold on and don't leave us. And then I just, as I think about that day I just, I realize I was watching my only child fade away."}
{"original": "Daniel died on the way to the hospital. Mark is lucky to be alive."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: How seriously injured was he?"}
{"original": "Esther Salas: Mark was shot three times – in the – right chest, left abdomen, in the arm."}
{"original": "A close-knit family, they called themselves the three musketeers. Judge Salas told us Daniel, a college sophomore, was the center of their universe. From his wounds, the FBI said, it appeared Daniel had tried to block the gunman."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: When did you realize that the attack was meant for you?"}
{"original": "Esther Salas: It wasn't until the FBI debriefings. They'd looked at this case inside and out, tell me Ma'am, you were the target. He wanted to get you."}
{"original": "The shooter was Roy Den Hollander, a 72-year-old lawyer. He harbored deep hatred for women and left behind a bitter manifesto. He accused Judge Salas of being, quote, a lazy Latina, dragging her feet on his lawsuit. Police found his body the next day, he had shot himself. The FBI discovered he had killed another lawyer a week before. Then he went hunting for Judge Salas."}
{"original": "Esther Salas: He knew where obviously where I lived. He knew my routes to work. He knew the church we attended. He had Daniel's school. He knew baseball games. Just a complete work up on me and my family."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: The information that he got, all from legal sources?"}
{"original": "Esther Salas: All open sources, they call it."}
{"original": "We met Judge Salas outside her home six months after Daniel's murder. She told us her husband needs additional surgery. The house has been sold. Twenty years of wonderful memories, she told us, and one that's excruciating."}
{"original": "Esther Salas in YouTube video: We're living every parent's worst nightmare, making preparations to bury—bury our only child, Daniel."}
{"original": "Last August, in a highly unusual move for a federal judge, Judge Salas made a personal plea to lawmakers on YouTube."}
{"original": "Esther Salas in YouTube video: We may not be able to stop something like this from happening again, but we can make it hard for those who target us to track us down."}
{"original": "Since Daniel's funeral, Judge Salas has become a crusader for federal legislation to scrub judges' personal information from the internet. Her mission became more urgent when the FBI discovered a second locker in New Jersey belonging to her son's killer."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: What did they find? What was in the locker?"}
{"original": "Esther Salas: They found another gun, a Glock, more ammunition. But the most troubling thing they found, was a manila folder with a workup on Justice Sonia Sotomayor."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor?"}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: What do you think when you find that a Supreme Court Justice was on his list?"}
{"original": "Esther Salas: More than on his list, on his sights. They had her favorite restaurants, where she worked out, her friends."}
{"original": "Tonight is the first time that plot has been revealed."}
{"original": "Esther Salas: Who knows what could have happened? But we need to understand that judges are at risk. We need to understand that we put ourselves in great danger every day for doing our jobs. This fact has to wake us up."}
{"original": "Judge Salas told us she never dreamed she'd be putting her family in harm's way when she was sworn in in 2011."}
{"original": "The last judicial security upgrade was 15 years ago—after Chicago Judge Joan Lefkow came home one night and found her husband and mother shot dead by a disgruntled plaintiff."}
{"original": "The new legislation, to be taken up by the Senate, is seeking more than $250 million for home security and 1,000 more deputy marshals. It would erase a long list of personal data online – such as a home address, driver's license, and property tax records."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: You chose to be a judge. And in becoming a public person, don't you have to give up some of your personal details for the sake of accountability?"}
{"original": "Esther Salas: You're right, I did choose to become a public servant. And if anyone has a problem with what I've ruled in a particular case, they can appeal. If anyone is upset, the courthouse address, you know, it's known to everyone. Come to the courthouse. But why do you need to come to my house?"}
{"original": "We can't show you, but U.S. marshals now provide round-the-clock security for Judge Salas. She told us judges are increasingly threatened online. Last year, there were 4,200 threats against federal judges. She read us a few of those."}
{"original": "Esther Salas: We, quote, must start killing these corrupt politicians and judges, and their families, end quote. Another one, The judge is a traitor and has a death sentence."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: And this is since the death of Daniel?"}
{"original": "Esther Salas: This is since Daniel's murder in this very house. One other one just in Mississippi. Quote, I will kill you. I just wanna get the gun, and come down there, and blow all their brains out."}
{"original": "But perhaps no judge in the country has felt the heat of online threats more than senior U.S. District Judge James Robart."}
{"original": "Emotions were already running high when Judge Robart temporarily blocked former president trump's first travel ban, barring some Muslim travelers. Critics posted his home phone and address online. But nothing prepared him for the tsunami of hate when president trump used his Twitter bully pulpit to scorn him as a so-called judge."}
{"original": "James Robart: When you call someone a so-called judge, what you do is you attack the judiciary. You may not even have wanted to convey that message, but that's the message which your 40 million Twitter followers took down, which was you were never authorized to issue this decision."}
{"original": "Death threats flooded in. Then President Trump tweeted again."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: If I recall, he also said to blame you if there should be a terrorist attack on the country?"}
{"original": "James Robart: People took that as somehow I was giving permission for their families to be endangered. And then the tone for a number of the messages turned into you must be stopped."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: What did you think about that? When the president attacks you?"}
{"original": "James Robart: I thought he had a right to attack my decision. I don't think that criticizing a judge is acceptable. I recognize there's a dispute on that. There is no dispute at the point that you start to talk about I'm going to kill you or I'm going to hurt you, or more importantly to me, I'm going to hurt your family. That's over the line and can't be tolerated."}
{"original": "Judge Robart was bombarded with 40,000 messages. 1,100 were serious enough to be investigated. There were so many death threats that U.S. marshals set up camp around the judge's house."}
{"original": "James Robart: The idea of needing a, you know, bomb-sniffing dog to go into a restaurant before we could have lunch, impacts you but you just try to, you know, not let that bother you."}
{"original": "James Robart: (laugh) Yes. If you wanna know how to be really unpopular with restaurant owners, show up with your dog, which runs around the restaurant barking. And a number of U.S. marshals who are noticeable."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: You're chuckling now but I take it that at the time you didn't see the humor in this?"}
{"original": "James Robart: (sigh) No, I didn't."}
{"original": "Then federal investigators uncovered something more ominous. Thousands of threats that looked to be from Americans – were actually from Russia, part of a long game by Vladimir Putin to splinter American democracy."}
{"original": "Suzanne Spaulding: If Putin can undermine a significant segment of the population's willingness to accept a court's decision, then he can cause chaos in this country."}
{"original": "Suzanne Spaulding ran top cybersecurity operations for both Democratic and Republican administrations. She told us Russia undermines the justice system by fanning some Americans' suspicions that judges are partisan."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: What did Judge Robart do to put himself in Russia's cross hairs?"}
{"original": "Suzanne Spaulding: They attacked him, his decision as reflecting his personal political preferences, as opposed to following the rule of law. And that leads people to conclude that it is appropriate to make threats of violence. And as we saw in the tragic case of Judge Salas, to actually carry out an attack of violence."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: How big a threat do you think this is?"}
{"original": "Suzanne Spaulding: You know, I think we got a taste of that on January 6th."}
{"original": "Spaulding told us since the siege of the Capitol, there's more pressure on law enforcement to determine which online threats might turn into physical attacks. Take the example of an Alabama man who answered the online call with a truckload of weapons and a hand-scribbled hit list -- second from the top, an Indiana judge."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: So how do you answer people who will say that what I say online, even if it's aggressive, it's my First Amendment right?"}
{"original": "Suzanne Spaulding: So you do have a First Amendment right to express your opinion, even if it's an unpopular opinion. But threats of violence, incitement to violence, those are things that law enforcement can legitimately look into, particularly when it's against our public servants."}
{"original": "Judge Salas lives with those threats. But when the courthouse reopens after the pandemic, she told us Daniel would want her to keep going."}
{"original": "Bill Whitaker: Will you be concerned when you re-enter this courtroom?"}
{"original": "Esther Salas: No, we're changed forever. You know, Mark and I are – are different people today, sadly. But as far as what I do on the bench, no, that's not—I'm—that's not gonna change. I'm not gonna let Mr. Hollander take that away from me—my integrity, my work ethic, and my pride. No. He won't take that."}

{"original": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - After months of pleading from Puerto Rico's government, the U.S. Congress has agreed to help the territory restructure its massive public debt. But it comes at a steep cost: a degree of lost sovereignty with the imposition of a fiscal control board as well as a potential lower minimum wage for young workers on the island."}
{"original": "Those provisions in the bipartisan measure are aimed at staving off a chaotic wave of defaults on the island's $70 billion public debt. But they stoked some anger Thursday in Puerto Rico, where people have endured a decade of a steadily worsening economy and many resent the uneven relationship with the U.S. mainland."}
{"original": "Yet the deal brought relief to others, who feel it could help Puerto Ricans rebuild the economy while providing sorely needed control over their government."}
{"original": "This should have been done a long time ago, said Jose Jeaudoin, a restaurant manager. It's been proven for many years that Puerto Rico does not know how to run itself. Any time the government takes control over something, it doesn't work or it goes broke."}
{"original": "The bill calls for the creation of a seven-member control board appointed by Congress and President Obama that would oversee some court-ordered debt restructurings. It would also require Puerto Rico's government to submit budgets and create a plan to achieve fiscal responsibility and eventual access to financial markets."}
{"original": "The board also would be responsible for maintaining the legal rights of creditors and shoring up pension shortfalls for an island whose public pension obligations are underfunded by more than $40 billion."}
{"original": "U.S. law blocks Puerto Rico's public agencies and municipalities from declaring bankruptcy and restructuring debt under a judge's supervision."}
{"original": "The situation is desperate, said Valerie Franklin, a souvenir store owner. Right now, we're just working to pay taxes. We're just surviving."}
{"original": "Supporters say the bill would help strengthen Puerto Rico's sputtering economy, which has stagnated in part since the end of U.S. tax breaks for manufacturers that set off a vicious downward economic spiral that in turn prompted hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans to move to the mainland."}
{"original": "The House Natural Resources Committee could vote on the bill as early as next week. If approved, it would go to the full House and then move to the Senate. Some of the House's most conservative Republicans appear willing to support the deal, but senators have not said yet whether they will pass the House bill or write their own version."}
{"original": "The goal is to pass the bill before Puerto Rico defaults on a $2 billion debt payment due July 1, the largest yet. The island already has missed three previous payments, including a $367 million one due earlier this month."}
{"original": "Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla said if the bill is approved without any changes, it will protect Puerto Rico from any lawsuits following the anticipated July 1 default. But he intends to fight some of the bill's provisions, including the one that would set up a fiscal control board whose members, he noted, would not be elected by the public."}
{"original": "The board's powers are excessive, he said. We have to keep fighting."}
{"original": "Garcia envisions a board with a supervisory role that would allow Puerto Rico's government to have final say over its finances. He said the measure's current provisions are not consistent with our country's basic democratic principles."}
{"original": "Other government officials echoed Garcia's concerns, including Eduardo Bhatia, president of Puerto Rico's Senate. He asked Puerto Ricans to rise up and reject the bill, calling it disproportionate and anti-democratic."}
{"original": "To those who think they can sacrifice democracy to obtain economic stability, know that in the end you'll have neither, he said."}
{"original": "Another big concern for some government officials and young adults in Puerto Rico is a provision that would allow the local government to temporarily lower the minimum wage, authorizing businesses to pay $4.25 an hour to first-time employees under age 20. The bill says the age can be automatically extended to 25 and the lower wage can be paid for up to four years if requested. The island's current minimum wage varies from $5.08 to $7.25 an hour."}
{"original": "Critics say workers can barely survive on the current minimum wage, given the rising cost of living in Puerto Rico."}
{"original": "I think it's terrible, said Jaileen Trinidad, a 23-year-old restaurant hostess. We're educated. I have my bachelor's degree. ... It would affect me greatly because my baby depends on me."}
{"original": "Puerto Ricans fear that lowering the minimum wage would further fuel an exodus to the U.S. mainland instead of helping create more jobs locally."}
{"original": "Gabriel Hernandez, a 19-year-old food delivery worker, said the measure would prevent young people from building a secure future."}
{"original": "They wouldn't be able to get ahead, to make money to buy a car, to buy school supplies, to buy a house, he said."}
{"original": "But it's unlikely the minimum wage provision will change. The bill was revised during weeks of negotiations, and it now has the support of U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew."}
{"original": "Disagreements over how the board would be appointed had held up negotiations. The bill would allow the president to select all but one of the board's seven members from lists provided by congressional leaders. Anyone that the president picked from outside the list would have to be confirmed by the Senate."}
{"original": "As U.S. legislators prepare for another round of debates, Puerto Ricans like artist Richard Daal are eager to see the bill approved."}
{"original": "The government here has demonstrated that it doesn't have the capability or the dexterity to manage the island, he said. It's like a business. If you don't manage it well, someone else should take over."}
{"original": "A business partner of longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen has pleaded guilty to criminal tax fraud, after he held onto the $5 million in taxes he owed the state from his taxicabs, according to the New York Attorney General's Office."}
{"original": "The New York Times reported the business partner, Russian immigrant Evgeny Freidman, who is known as the Taxi King, struck a plea deal to avoid jail time, and will aid prosecutors in state or federal investigations. The guilty plea comes at a critical time for special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, as those close to Cohen fear he could flip on the president in Cohen's own criminal investigation. Cohen's apartment and office were raided in April."}
{"original": "As a part of his guilty plea, Freidman will have to repay the $5 million to the state. Freidman, the CEO of Taxiclub Management Inc, managed a fleet of more than 800 medallion taxicabs out of Manhattan, Brooklyn and surrounding areas, and failed to pay those taxes over a four-year period."}
{"original": "Today, the 'Taxi King' admitted that he built his empire by stealing from New Yorkers, Attorney General Barbara Underwood said in a statement. Freidman pocketed money that should have provided much-needed investment in our transit system – and he'll now have to pay back every cent. Our office will continue to hold accountable those who cheat the system."}
{"original": "But the guilty plea could prompt concern for Cohen and even the White House, as Cohen faces his own criminal investigation for matters related to his business deals. Cohen has been under investigation for months, with his case now playing out in federal court in New York. Meanwhile, the White House has kept its distance from Cohen. Mr. Trump's latest legal hire, Rudy Giuliani, has told CBS News Cohen is no longer the president's attorney."}
{"original": "Cohen tweeted Wednesday that he is not and has never been Freidman's partner in the taxi business: I am one of thousands of medallion owners who entrust management companies to operate my medallions according to the rules of the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. Gene Freidman and I are not partners and have never been partners in this business or any other. #MediaWrongAgain."}
{"original": "In his State of the Union address, President Donald Trump made a big claim about recent economic growth, extolling the U.S. for having far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world."}
{"original": "True, America's economy is strong. But not only is it not the world's hottest -- China, India and a host of other developing nations are growing faster -- it's already significantly cooler than it was just six months ago."}
{"original": "That doesn't mean the country is about to plunge into recession. Most private economists and the Federal Reserve expect the economy to grow at a rate above 2 percent this year. But increasingly, signs are telling workers and investors they shouldn't wait for the expansion to move any faster. Here are the indicators that it has already slowed down."}
{"original": "While job creation remains strong, we are beginning to see signs of weakness under the surface, Deutsche Bank Chief International Economist Torsten Slok said in a note."}
{"original": "The unemployment rate has risen from its 50-year trough of 3.7 percent a few months ago to 4 percent in January. The share of businesses saying they couldn't find anyone to hire has stopped rising, and wages last month grew more slowly than expected."}
{"original": "Unemployment for black and Latino workers has also ticked up in recent months because fewer of them were employed in January. Bill Spriggs, chief economist for the AFL-CIO, noted that unemployment for people of color has often been the canary in the coal mine for other economic slowdowns."}
{"original": "Last year, businesses had the boost of a tax cut to juice up their profits. This year, they're less fortunate."}
{"original": "Across the S&P 500, analysts are forecasting earnings per share to drop 1.8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the Associated Press reports. Just a few weeks ago, they were predicting higher earnings. If the updated forecasts prove true, it will be the first earnings decline in nearly three years."}
{"original": "Lower profits this quarter are one element that pulled stocks lower on Thursday."}
{"original": "A favorite tool of economists and bond traders -- and generally ignored by everyone else -- the yield curve has a remarkable record of predicting when a recession is approaching."}
{"original": "Here's what it means. The yield curve plots out the return an investor earns on a particular Treasury bond. Because Treasurys are essentially loans backed by the U.S. economy, the size of the return is seen as one proxy of U.S. economic growth."}
{"original": "Typically, the longer the duration of the bond, the higher its yield, reflecting the risk to investors of tying up money for longer periods of time."}
{"original": "Starting in December, however, the yields for some short-term bonds rose above those for long-term bonds. When this inversion happens, it's an indicator that the economy is slowing. An inversion of the yield for the two-year and 10-year Treasury has preceded every recession since World War II."}
{"original": "The diminishing growth in some countries abroad is reverberating in U.S. factories. The sharp slowdown in China, independent of the hit from the trade war, is depressing manufacturing in the U.S. and elsewhere, Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note."}
{"original": "Advance orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items like cars and appliances -- are growing more slowly this year than in 2018, the latest data show."}
{"original": "But a cooling economy is different from one that's frozen over. The U.S. has a bit more growth left in it, most economists say, even though it may not be at the rapid pace of the last year."}
{"original": "Wrote UBS analysts in a note: While the US economy is slowing, we don't think it will contract in the next 12 months and expect 2.4 percent growth this year and 2 percent next year."}
{"original": "Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos made the single-largest charitable contribution in 2020, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual list of top donations — a $10 billion gift aimed at fighting climate change."}
{"original": "Bezos, the world's richest person, used the contribution to launch his Bezos Earth Fund. The fund, which supports nonprofits involved in the climate crisis, has paid out $790 million to 16 groups so far, according to the Chronicle. According to the left-leaning Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies, from March 18 through December 7 of last year, Bezos' wealth on paper surged by 63%, from $113 billion to $184 billion."}
{"original": "The sum total of the top 10 charitable donations last year — $2.6 billion — was the lowest since 2011, even as many billionaires vastly increased their wealth in the stock market rally that catapulted technology shares in particular last year."}
{"original": "Phil Knight, who with his wife, Penny, made the second- and third-largest donations last year according to the Chronicle, saw his wealth grow by about 77% over the same March-to-December period. Knight and his wife gave more than $900 million to the Knight Foundation and $300 million to the University of Oregon."}
{"original": "Fred Kummer, founder of construction company HBE Corporation, and his wife, June, gave $300 million to establish a foundation to support programs at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. It was the fourth largest charitable donation of the year."}
{"original": "Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, delivered the fifth-largest donation on the Chronicle's list: A $250 million gift to the Center for Tech and Civic Life, which worked on voting security issues in the 2020 election."}
{"original": "Zuckerberg, whose wealth nearly doubled to $105 billion in the March-to-December period according to Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies, has been widely criticized and been called to testify before Congress for his company's handling of disinformation in the runup to the 2020 presidential election."}
{"original": "In the sixth spot was a $200 million donation made by Arthur Blank, co-founder of Home Depot, through the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation, to Children's health care of Atlanta to build a new hospital in his name."}

{"original": "$63.5 million: Stephen Ross gift to World Resources Institute to support the Ross Center for Sustainable Cities"}
{"original": "Donors have broadened their philanthropic scope beyond the universities, medical centers and other organizations that typically comprise the year's list of top beneficiaries, according to the Chronicle. Joining the list of top beneficiaries of 2020, were a new environmental grant maker, a nonprofit dedicated to modernizing elections, a network of food banks, and a charity that builds housing for people experiencing homelessness."}
{"original": "Two billionaires who donated heavily to charity last year — MacKenzie Scott, Bezos' former wife, and Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter — did not make the Chronicle's list because no single donation of theirs was large enough to qualify. Rather than give billions to just one charity, both billionaires opted to make large donations to numerous causes."}
{"original": "Dorsey, whose current net worth totals $11.4 billion according to Forbes, announced in an April 2020 tweet that he would be donating $1 billion in equity to his Startsmall LLC to fund global COVID-19 relief. After we disarm this pandemic, the focus will shift to girl's health and education, and UBI, said Dorsey in his tweet."}
{"original": "Scott, whose wealth is valued at $57 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said in a blog post in December that she had increased her charitable donations for the year to $4.2 billion, in response to the wrecking ball effect of the coronavirus, which she also acknowledged substantially increased the wealth of billionaires."}
{"original": "Her $4.2 billion was divvied among 384 organizations she describes in her post as having dedicated their lives to helping others, working and volunteering and serving real people face-to-face at bedsides and tables, in prisons and courtrooms and classrooms, on streets and hospital wards and hotlines and frontlines of all types and sizes, day after day after day."}
{"original": "The nation's 644 billionaires have enjoyed a staggering rise in wealth since the pandemic shuttered the economy in March, with the group gaining almost $1 trillion in total net worth, according to a recent analysis. The spike in wealth coincides with what some economists are calling a K-shaped recovery, with the rich regaining their footing while poorer Americans struggle with lost wages and jobs."}
{"original": "In February, the Chronicle will publish its list of the 50 biggest donors, which counts cumulative donations, not individual gifts."}
{"original": "If you're one of the 48 million Americans repaying loans from school, expect a little bit of relief come tax time. Interest you paid on a student loan can be counted against your income for the year, reducing the amount of money on which you pay tax."}
{"original": "This applies to any loan you took out to pay for educational expenses, like tuition, books, room and board or necessary transportation. The loan can be for yourself, your child or another relative — as long as your name is on it, and your income is under the IRS' limits, you can deduct that interest from your taxes."}
{"original": "Even if you don't have a student loan per se, if you took a loan out and you've only used that account for qualifying educational expenses, the interest on that loan will be deductible, Alicia Jegede, founder of New Gen Financial, told CBS MoneyWatch."}
{"original": "Best of all, you can claim this benefit even if you take the standard deduction."}
{"original": "Your loan provider will usually send a form, called a 1098-E, indicating how much interest you paid for the year. It's best to wait for this form and not try to estimate your interest payments."}
{"original": "The IRS limits the deduction to $2,500 per year. At today's interest rates, that means you need a student-loan balance of over $50,000 before you hit the limit. The average household with student loans has just over $47,000 in debt, according to a NerdWallet survey from last December, so most people should be covered."}
{"original": "There are a few restrictions on who can take this deduction, noted Sahang-Hee Hahn, a tax attorney at a large financial services firm. Your filing status can't be Married Filing Separately, and you also can't be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return."}
{"original": "There is also an income limit. If your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) was more than $70,000 as a single filer, or $140,000 as a married couple, you can only take a partial deduction. The IRS offers a formula to calculate how much you're allowed to claim. Once you earn more than $85,000 as a single filer, or $170,000 married, you're ineligible for the deduction."}
{"original": "A deduction reduces how much of your income is subject to taxation, so its value depends on what tax bracket you're in."}
{"original": "For example, a single woman who earned $60,000 last year and took the standard deduction would have a top tax rate of 22%. (Thanks to her income, she likely would also be able to file her taxes for free.) If she deducts $2,000 of student-loan interest, she would save 22% of $2,000, reducing her tax payment by $440."}
{"original": "Now, getting back $440 at tax time may not seem like much when you're trying to shave down a $40,000 loan balance. But as long as you're eligible to take some money — any money — back from the government, take advantage of that."}
{"original": "Two cybersecurity firms have uncovered vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office files that have allowed hackers to install malware through Word documents. The exploit -- referred to as zero day, because it hasn't yet been patched -- works on all Microsoft Office versions, with attacks stretching back to late January, according to McAfee."}
{"original": "The suite of programs, which incorporates Word, Excel and PowerPoint, is used by 1.2 billion people, according to Microsoft."}
{"original": "Microsoft plans to issue an update Tuesday to address the vulnerability. Tuesday also is the day that the software giant launches its momentous Windows 10 Creators Update."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, we encourage customers to practice safe computing habits online, a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement, including exercising caution before opening unknown files and not downloading content from untrusted sources to avoid this type of issue."}
{"original": "The malware can be disguised as important files or documents sent over email, meaning a student's homework or an office presentation could be harboring the next attack. You might even have to worry about your finances: Researchers have found that during tax season hackers send spam emails pretending to be from a tax officer with a fake tax refund form attached as a Word document, with malware embedded."}
{"original": "An email pretending to have tax information with a virus hidden in a Microsoft Word document. IBM Security Report"}
{"original": "The attack cannot be activated if people open the documents in Office's protected view, McAfee said."}
{"original": "The exploit works like this: The attacker gives an RTF file a .doc extension name. Once the victim opens the disguised text document, it connects to the attacker's servers and automatically downloads an HTML application file and launches it, giving the hacker full control of your device."}
{"original": "If the exploit is successful, it closes the downloaded Word document and creates a fake copy of it, while quietly installing malware in the background."}
{"original": "The vulnerability comes from Windows Object Linking and Embedding feature, according to FireEye. The cybersecurity firm said it's informed Microsoft and is coordinating with the company to address the vulnerability."}

{"original": "It's another illustration of a U.S. company using a corporate inversion to cut its tax bill."}
{"original": "Johnson Controls (JCI) and Tyco (TYC) on Monday announced their deal, which they expect to be finalized by the end of September. The manufacturing companies estimate at least $650 million in savings over three years, including $150 million in annual tax savings."}
{"original": "The merger, which will create a conglomerate with $32 billion in annual revenue, is the most recent example of a U.S.-based company buying a foreign firm and switching its headquarters to the foreign company's home to cut its tax bill."}
{"original": "The issue has come up in the presidential race, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton last month urging Congress to act while calling out Pfizer (PFE) after the New York-based drug manufacturer in November unveiled a $160 billion merger with Allergan (AGN) in an acquisition meant to send one of the largest U.S. corporations -- or at least its main executive offices -- to Ireland, where Allergan is based."}
{"original": "Johnson Controls plans to move its legal and global headquarters to Tyco's base in Cork, Ireland, while continuing to operate in Milwaukee."}
{"original": "Shareholders of Johnson Controls will get $3.9 billion in cash and own 56 percent of the combined company, keeping its ownership below the 60 percent bar set in November by U.S. Treasury rules, which implemented some restrictions on deals above that level in an effort to curtail inversions."}
{"original": "At the time, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said there was only so much the administration could do to prevent U.S. companies from pursuing the maneuver, and reiterated a call for Congress to pass legislation."}
{"original": "Roughly 50 U.S. companies have inverted in the past decade, with additional corporations thinking about it, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service."}
{"original": "Tyco shareholders will own 44 percent of the company, which will retain the Johnson name."}
{"original": "Tyco itself did an inversion in the late 1990s by acquiring security company ADT, which was incorporated in Bermuda. Now based in Ireland, Tyco operates in Princeton, New Jersey."}
{"original": "Shares of Johnson Controls were down more than 2 percent in afternoon trade. Tyco shares rallied nearly 11 percent."}
{"original": "Income inequality is creating what charity Oxfam International calls a deeply shocking trend: Billionaires are not only growing wealthier and adding to their ranks, but the poorest half of the world is losing wealth at a time when the world's economy is expanding."}
{"original": "The economic climate is accruing outsized gains to billionaires, whose fortunes rose by 12 percent last year, while the poorest half of humanity — 3.8 billion people — saw their wealth decline by 11 percent, Oxfam found. Its report will be released at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which begins Tuesday and draws billionaires like Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, policymakers and corporate leaders."}
{"original": "With the benefits of the economic expansion shifting to the world's richest people, billionaires are adding $2.5 billion in wealth each day. And every two days, a millionaire jumps into the ranks of the billionaire class, Oxfam said."}
{"original": "Oxfam, which has been studying the dynamics of wealth inequality since 2011, said the latest findings suggest that a new economic approach is needed to help recenter the wealth distribution. Many policy makers and economists have believed that economic growth will lift all boats, but that isn't playing out for billions of people across the globe. One reason: Tax rates have dropped to recent historic lows, allowing the rich and corporations to hold on to more wealth, said Paul O'Brien, vice president for policy and advocacy at Oxfam America."}
{"original": "The economic figures are going in the wrong direction. This isn't just another year of the same old reality -- it's getting worse in terms of the accumulation of extreme wealth, O'Brien said. It's deeply shocking to us."}
{"original": "The top-heavy distribution of wealth has coincided with a drastic reduction in tax rates for the world's richest, Oxfam said. It found that the top rate for the rich in developed countries plunged from 62 percent in 1970 to 38 percent in 2013. In 2017, President Trump reduced tax rates for individuals and corporations, a decrease that favors the rich and businesses."}
{"original": "The leadership we've had has put in place the policies that widen the inequality gap, O'Brien said. What we are calling for is leadership and policies that slow the gap."}
{"original": "To be sure, conservative policy makers believe that lowering tax rates on the rich and businesses will spur growth, eventually providing more jobs and higher wages to middle- and lower-income workers. Yet there's little economic evidence that such policies deliver on their promises."}
{"original": "Instead of an economy that stresses growth at any cost, Oxfam is pressing for what it calls a human economy."}
{"original": "Fundamentally the human economy is built from different principals than the growth economy, O'Brien said. For years, the consensus was, 'Growth solves everything.' But that has fallen apart. Our planet has limited boundaries. We can't burn more, use more, and break through ecological boundaries that are essential for sustaining human life."}
{"original": "The human economy would provide health care, education and gender equality to people across the globe, he said. All the data show that educating your children is the best way to build a healthy economy and create genuine shared wealth. We need to get kids into quality schools, and get rid of these legal and cultural barriers to women being treated unfairly in the workplace, being burdened and discounted."}
{"original": "Raising taxes on the world's richest people and corporations would help fund those programs, with Oxfam calculating that boosting taxes on the richest by 0.5 percent would raise enough money to educate the 262 million children who currently don't receive an education and provide healthcare that would save 3.3 million people from preventable deaths."}
{"original": "Whether the rich should pay higher taxes entered the political discourse this month after freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the U.S. should raise taxes on the rich to their highest level since 1980, just before Ronald Reagan started hacking rates."}
{"original": "The top tax on the wealthy should rise to as high as 70 percent, Ocasio-Cortez told 60 Minutes earlier this month. That approach stands in stark contrast to Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act."}
{"original": "Yet higher marginal rates on the richest Americans would mark a return to the more progressive tax structure of the 1950s and 1960s — under Presidents Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, for instance, the rate on those in the top bracket topped 90 percent."}
{"original": "We totally agree with the congresswoman, Oxfam's O'Brien said. We think higher taxes for the extremely wealthy have to be a fundamental element of a healthy economy."}

Born the Hard Way is a 60-second story of immigrants, namely one Adolphus Busch, a brewmaster from Germany who makes a perilous journey to America in the mid-1800s. Confronted by anti-immigrant bias and overcoming tremendous adversity, he manages to work his way to St. Louis, where he joins forces with another immigrant, Eberhard Anheuser. The rest, as they say, is history. Directed by Chris Sargent and filmed in New Orleans, the commercial reminds us that, yes, immigrants -- including brewmasters -- are who have always made America great.

{"original": "Hoping to make a big mark in the electric car market, the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt made a splashy debut at CES 2016 in Las Vegas Wednesday. Chevy used the annual consumer tech show to show off the new model, announcing a late-2016 release date, and specs that position the car as a good combination of price and range, CNET reports."}
{"original": "The Bolt is an all-electric vehicle that promises to deliver 200 miles on a single charge. It's expected to have a starting price just below $30,000, after the $7,500 federal tax rebate that comes with electric vehicles. It's not inexpensive, for sure, but much more moderately priced than the high-end electric cars from Tesla."}
{"original": "It was less than a year ago that we revealed the Bolt EV concept and promised to deliver a long-range electric vehicle attainable by the masses, GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra said in a press release. The Bolt EV is capable of using the latest mobile app technology to enable car sharing, advanced GPS routing and gamification, all designed to enhance the ownership experience now and into the future."}
{"original": "CNET's Tim Stevens took a preproduction model of the car for a test-drive, and reports that he was surprised by the practicality of the thing."}
{"original": "With a flat battery pack on the floor of the car, like that in the Tesla Model S, the car has a low center of gravity. Stevens says the Bolt has a significant amount of storage, a big plus for a small car. The car also has a new version of MyLink, Chevy's infotainment system that will be compatible with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The car's trick rear-view mirror is actually a camera, and there are built-in safety features like collision avoidance."}
{"original": "Again, Chevrolet isn't giving us a formal price, but if they hit that $30,000 price after tax rebates, that'll be a game-changer for the EV market, Stevens writes. The Bolt will go into production before the end of the year and will be available nationwide soon thereafter. Given the cost, the range, the tech and the practicality, expect to see a lot of these on the road next year."}

{"original": "For almost two years, Joe Biden has been telling Americans what he plans to do on his first day in office — and the next 99 — if elected to be the nation's 46th president."}
{"original": "In speeches, interviews, and in at least 49 published plans throughout his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden talked about the actions he'd take in the earliest days of his administration — what he would do if he triumphed in what he saw as a battle for the soul of the nation against President Trump."}
{"original": "Incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain distributed a memo Saturday that reiterated Mr. Biden's intention to fulfill several of his promises — some geared toward immediate action to arrest the surging coronavirus pandemic, some to roll back the actions taken by President Trump in the last four years, and others to address problems that have persisted over several administrations."}
{"original": "The initiatives include around a dozen of executive actions he can enact alone as president on the first day in office, January 20. Here are a few of the highlights:"}
{"original": "End so-called Muslim ban on travel, which in 2017 restricted travel and immigration to the U.S. from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, before adding Eritrea, Nigeria, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, and Tanzania in 2020."}
{"original": "Klain said the president-elect would continue to roll out other executive actions throughout the first two weeks of the new administration."}

{"original": "Mr. Biden will be relying on Congress to approve many of the initiatives he aims to accomplish for his first 100 days, which could potentially be difficult, even with the slight majority that will be held by Democrats. Here are some of those promises:"}
{"original": "Six Democratic presidential candidates abandoned all niceties Wednesday for the last — and fiercest — debate before the Nevada caucuses, during which candidates turned their attacks awat from President Trump and toward each other, at least for the moment. From the earliest minutes of the debate at the Paris Theater in Las Vegas, the Democratic presidential hopefuls took aim at Michael Bloomberg, whose appearance Wednesday marked his first on the debate stage."}
{"original": "The Democrats — Joe Biden, Pete Buttiegieg, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — seized on Bloomberg's billionaire status, his past support for controversial policies like stop-and-frisk and accusations of sexist and degrading comments."}
{"original": "But it wasn't just Bloomberg who was on the receiving end of Democrats' jabs. There was plenty of time for them turn on one another, too."}
{"original": "Here are the top moments from the most ferocious 2020 debate so far:"}
{"original": "Less than 10 minutes into the debate, Warren made clear her disdain for Bloomberg, warning that Democrats are taking a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another."}
{"original": "I'd like to talk about who we're running against, Warren said. A billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians.' And no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg."}
{"original": "Democrats, she continued, will not defeat President Trump in November if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop-and-frisk."}
{"original": "Klobuchar continued with the attack on Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, saying that Democrats need a candidate who presents a stark contrast to Mr. Trump."}
{"original": "I don't think you look at Donald Trump and say we need someone richer in the White House, she said."}
{"original": "Buttigieg, meanwhile, sought to tie Bloomberg and Sanders together, saying the Democratic Party needs to nominate a candidate who is actually a Democrat. One, he said, wants to burn this party down, and the other wants to buy this party out."}
{"original": "Bloomberg was a Republican but switched his voter registration to Democrat before his mayoral run, while Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist."}
{"original": "The former New York City mayor attempted to differentiate himself from Mr. Trump, saying that as a New Yorker, he knows how to take on an arrogant con man like the president."}
{"original": "2. Bloomberg pressed on unwillingness to release women from confidentiality agreements"}
{"original": "But it wasn't just the size of Bloomberg's bank account that earned the ire of his Democratic opponents. His fellow candidates also hounded the businessman and former mayor on his decision to not release women from nondisclosure agreements they signed regarding allegations of workplace misconduct."}
{"original": "I hope you heard what his defense was: 'I've been nice to some women,' Warren said in response to Bloomberg. That just doesn't cut it. The mayor has to stand on his record."}
{"original": "The Massachusetts senator pressed Bloomberg on how many women signed confidentiality agreements and said a lack of transparency about his conduct damages his electability, particularly if there is a drip drip drip of damaging stories about him that could come to light in the run-up to the general election."}
{"original": "Biden echoed Warren, saying Bloomberg's unwillingness to release women from nondisclosure agreements is an issue of transparency."}
{"original": "None of them accuse me of doing anything, Bloomberg protested, adding, Other than maybe they didn't like a joke I told."}
{"original": "The multi-billionaire refused to agree to let women speak freely about their experiences working for his company. They signed the agreements and that's what we're going to live with, Bloomberg said."}
{"original": "But he also said, I have no tolerance for the kind of behavior that the Me Too movement has exposed, and he pointed to women who worked with him in New York's City Hall and the high marks his company, Bloomberg LP, receives from employees."}
{"original": "We're not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually, he said."}
{"original": "3. Warren defends Klobuchar from attacks by Buttigieg"}
{"original": "In a rare break from the infighting among candidates, Warren came to Klobuchar's defense as she fended off attacks from Buttigieg for forgetting the name of Mexico's president and his policies in a recent televised interview."}
{"original": "Buttigieg accused Klobuchar of lacking the knowledge to serve as president, saying she is staking her candidacy on her experience and literally part of the committee that's overseeing these things."}
{"original": "Klobuchar, he said, was not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south."}
{"original": "Are you trying to say that I'm dumb? Klobuchar responded. Or are you mocking me here, Pete? I said I made an error. People sometimes forget names."}
{"original": "Warren jumped in to defend Klobuchar in a brief moment of unity, saying the attacks on her are not right."}
{"original": "I understand she forgot a name. It happens to everybody on the stage, Warren said. Look, you want to ask about whether or not you understand trade policy with Mexico? Have at it. If you get it wrong, you ought to be held accountable. You want to ask about autonomy, you ought to be held accountable. You want to ask about a thousand different issues and you get it wrong, you ought to be held accountable. Let's be clear. Missing a name all by itself does not indicate that you do not understand what is going on."}
{"original": "4. Septuagenarians with stents are pressed on their health"}
{"original": "While Sanders and Bloomberg are very different candidates, they have a few things in common: they're both 78 years old and they both have stents."}
{"original": "Moderator Hallie Jackson asked Sanders about his claims of transparency, after he has not yet released his medical records after suffering a heart attack last year, despite an earlier saying that he would. His campaign did not immediately disclose the heart attack he suffered in October, and he has since declined to release his medical records. He has released letters from doctors."}
{"original": "I think the one area maybe that Mayor Bloomberg and I shared, you have two stents as well, Sanders said, addressing Bloomberg. He also said that he had cardiologists following him on the campaign trail."}
{"original": "They follow me around the campaign, three, four, five events a day; see how you're doing compared to me, Sanders said."}
{"original": "5. Mayor Bloomberg, should you exist?"}
{"original": "Bloomberg's wealth was a frequent topic of discussion among Democratic candidates in Nevada, but it was a September tweet from Sanders that kicked off a discussion about the distribution of wealth in the country."}
{"original": "When asked to elaborate on what he meant when he tweeted billionaires should not exist, Sanders said there is a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth and income."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans, he said. That's wrong. That's immoral."}
{"original": "Moderator Chuck Todd then turned the question on Bloomberg, asking Mayor Bloomberg, should you exist?"}
{"original": "I can't speak for all billionaires. All I know is I've been very lucky, made a lot of money and I'm giving it all away to make this country better, the former New York City mayor said. And a good chunk of it goes to the Democratic Party as well."}
{"original": "Asked whether he should have earned so much money, Bloomberg said yes, as he worked hard for it."}
{"original": "6. Tensions between Buttigieg and Klobuchar boil over"}
{"original": "The battle between Buttigieg and Klobuchar reached a fever pitch Wednesday as the two traded barbs over whether they each have the experience to lead the country."}
{"original": "In addition to knocking the Minnesota senator for forgetting the name of Mexico's president, Buttigieg also criticized Klobuchar on her record on immigration, for voting to confirm a Trump-nominated head of Customs and Border Protection, as well as the president's judicial nominees."}
{"original": "As he began to speak in Spanish, Klobuchar mocked, I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete."}
{"original": "The Minnesota senator said she has been in the arena, unlike the former South Bend mayor, and she countered that the unnamed CBP nominee, Kevin McAleenan, had been recommended by Obama administration officials."}
{"original": "You've memorized a bunch of talking points and a bunch of things, Klobuchar said."}
{"original": "In response, Buttigieg accused Klobuchar of suggesting his experience as a mayor didn't measure up."}
{"original": "I'm used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important than mayors, he said. You don't have to be in Washington to matter."}
{"original": "7. Warren on opponents' health care plans: a PowerPoint, a Post-It note, and Yeah, probably won't happen anyway"}
{"original": "Warren, who has proposed a plan to transition to Medicare for All, dispensed with the health care proposals offered by several of her opponents in quick succession:"}
{"original": "Mayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their health care. It's not a plan. It's a PowerPoint. And Amy's plan is even less. It's like a Post-It note, Insert Plan Here. Bernie has started very much — has a good start, but instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead, his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work. And then his own advisers say, yeah, probably won't happen anyway."}
{"original": "Buttigieg joked that he was more of a Microsoft Word guy, while Klobuchar noted that Post-It notes were invented in her home state of Minnesota. Klobuchar also touted her support for implementing a public option, saying that most Democrats in the Senate did not support the Medicare-for-All bill proposed by Sanders and supported by Warren."}
{"original": "Biden made the argument that he was the only one on stage who had actually accomplished health care reform, since he had worked on negotiations with lawmakers on the Affordable Care Act when he was vice president."}
{"original": "8. Protesters interrupt final minutes of debate"}
{"original": "As the Nevada debate came to a conclusion with candidates making their closing statements, there was one last moment of drama as protesters in the Paris Theater interrupted Biden's final remarks."}
{"original": "You deported 3 million people, the demonstrators shouted."}
{"original": "Biden paused his remarks as the protesters were escorted from the room."}
{"original": "Grace Segers contributed to this report."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON -U.S. consumer spending posted a tiny gain for the third straight month in February while income growth slowed sharply."}
{"original": "Consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent in February, matching similar lackluster gains in January and December, the Commerce Department reported Monday. Personal incomes rose a modest 0.2 percent in February after a much stronger 0.5 percent rise in January. The slowdown reflected a 0.1 percent drop in wages and salaries, the first drop in this key category since September."}
{"original": "Despite recent weakness, economists are still looking for consumer spending to accelerate this year as solid gains in employment boost incomes and fuel more spending."}
{"original": "A key price gauge followed by the Federal Reserve showed prices fell 0.1 percent in February and are up just 1 percent over the past 12 months."}
{"original": "The weakness seen in spending had been expected given an earlier report which showed that retail sales fell in February, pulled down by falling gasoline sales."}
{"original": "Economists still expect that consumer spending will accelerate this year, bolstered by solid gains in hiring. More people working means more income to support spending."}
{"original": "The government on Friday revised its estimate for overall economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, to show the economy growing at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter, an improvement from a previous estimate of 1 percent."}
{"original": "Many economists expect that GDP growth will strengthen further to around 2 percent in the current January-March quarter, helped by gains in consumer spending."}
{"original": "The Federal Reserve at its meeting this month left a key rate unchanged while signaling that it now expected to boost rates only two times this year, down from a previous expectation of four rate hikes."}
{"original": "One thing the Fed is closely watching is the performance of inflation, which for nearly four years has remained below the Fed's target of an annual price increase of 2 percent per year. While overall inflation was up just 1 percent in February, prices excluding food and energy rose 1.7 percent for the 12 months ending in February."}
{"original": "Fed Chair Janet Yellen will discuss her views on the economy in a highly anticipated speech Tuesday before the Economic Club of New York."}
{"original": "The spending report showed that the saving rate edged up slightly to 5.4 percent of after-tax income in February, compared to 5.3 percent in January."}
{"original": "Representative Hakeem Jeffries, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, knocked President Trump for suggesting Democrats were skipping town as the nation grapples with the spread of the coronavirus when he spent the weekend at his golf course in Florida."}
{"original": "During a press conference Tuesday, Jeffries, of New York, was asked to respond to Mr. Trump's tweet earlier in the day accusing Democrats of heading out on vacation in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak."}
{"original": "Nancy Pelosi just said, 'I don't know if we can be ready this week.' In other words, it's off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats. That's been the story with them for 1 1/2 years! Mr. Trump tweeted, referencing comments Pelosi, the House speaker, made Monday regarding whether the House would be prepared to vote this week on an economic relief package in response to the coronavirus."}

{"original": "Jeffries, however, criticized the president for flying to Florida for a weekend of golf while thousands of people worldwide are dying from the virus and the U.S. economy takes a hit from the spreading illness."}
{"original": "Donald Trump wants to lecture us when he spent the weekend at his Florida golf resort? With everything happening in this country, he wasn't in the Situation Room. He wasn't in the White House. He wasn't even in Washington, D.C., the New York Democrat said. Donald Trump was at a Florida golf resort hanging out with the billionaire boys club in the midst of a global epidemic."}
{"original": "Democrats, he added, are not going to be lectured by Donald Trump about leadership when he's failed to show a scintilla of it in the midst of this whole crisis."}
{"original": "After touring tornado damage in Tennessee and visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Friday, Mr. Trump flew to Florida for a weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach estate. He spent Saturday at Trump International Golf Club before returning to Mar-a-Lago for a working dinner with President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil. Mr. Trump returned to his golf club Sunday."}
{"original": "The Trump administration is working to minimize the economic impacts of the spreading coronavirus, particularly after financial markets plummeted Monday. The president is set to meet with congressional Republicans on Tuesday to discuss possible relief measures, including a payroll tax cut. He told reporters during a press conference at the White House on Monday his administration is working with Congress and the business community to ensure hourly workers never miss a paycheck."}

{"original": "Trump says he doesn't need to be tested for coronavirus"}
{"original": "President Trump is urging Americans to remain calm in the face of fear about the spread of coronavirus in the U.S. It will go away, just stay calm, Mr. Trump said of the coronavirus Tuesday. He added, Be calm. It's really working out. And a lot of good things are going to happen."}
{"original": "He went to the Capitol, accompanied by Vice President Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and economic adviser Larry Kudlow, to meet with Republican lawmakers to discuss how to address the economic fallout from the spread of the coronavirus."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump is optimistic about Republican plans to counter the economic impact of coronavirus, which has caused the markets to tumble and created uncertainty for millions of working Americans. Touting the great unity within the Republican party, he promised reporters, You'll be hearing about it soon."}
{"original": "The president is calling for payroll tax relief, as well as help for hourly and blue-collar workers who don't have paid family leave, Vice President Pence said Tuesday evening during a briefing on coronavirus. Kudlow called the payroll tax cut holiday a bold move and said that later this summer or early fall, the White House would also unveil another package of tax cut and tax reform proposals. He did not say how the proposals would be funded."}
{"original": "But Republican and Democratic members of Congress alike seem skeptical that a payroll tax cut is the right approach to address any negative economic effects of coronavirus in the U.S."}
{"original": "I don't know if a payroll tax cut is the right stimulus, but we need something, South Carolina GOP Senator Lindsey Graham said just before President Trump's visit to the Capitol."}
{"original": "Graham suggested that paid leave for people in affected industries, like airline and hospitality, might be a targeted, effective measure."}
{"original": "You really have to keep the economy from being locked down when it comes to travel, Graham said. All those jobs associated with the travel industry I think are most at risk."}
{"original": "Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, also thinks a payroll tax holiday would be inadequate."}
{"original": "With respect to a payroll tax cuts specifically, it just doesn't do a whole lot for people who are losing out on shifts, people who get tips as a big part of their take-home pay, people who don't have sick leave days, Wyden told reporters."}
{"original": "President Trump also defended his administration's performance on the provision of coronavirus testing. In response to a question from CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell about why the U.S. has been so slow to ramp up coronavirus testing, Mr. Trump replied, No, I think the U.S. has done a very good job on testing."}
{"original": "We had to change things that were done that were nobody's fault, he also said, adding, We made the changes. But the testing has gone very well. And when people need a test, they can get a test."}
{"original": "During a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on Monday night, the president said the White House is working with Congress and businesses to make sure hourly workers never miss a paycheck, as well as with the hospitality industry and cruise companies and airlines. Mr. Trump also said his administration would raise the possibility of a payroll tax cut."}

{"original": "Santa Ana, Calif. -- Dongyuan Li's business was called You Win USA, and authorities say she coached pregnant Chinese women on how to get into the United States to deliver babies who would automatically enjoy all the benefits of American citizenship."}
{"original": "Over two years, the now-41-year-old raked in millions through her business, where mothers-to-be paid between $40,000 and $80,000 each to come to California, stay in an upscale apartment and give birth, authorities said."}
{"original": "Li, who was arrested Thursday, is one of 20 people charged in the first federal crackdown on birth tourism businesses that prosecutors said brought hundreds of pregnant women to the United States."}
{"original": "Jing Dong, 42, and Michael Wei Yueh Liu, 53, who allegedly operated USA Happy Baby, also were arrested."}
{"original": "All three pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges including conspiracy, visa fraud and money laundering, according to Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles. Trials were scheduled for March 26."}
{"original": "An indictment alleges USA Happy Baby used apartments in Rancho Cucamonga to service Chinese officials, including members of the Public Security Bureau in the Beijing Municipal Government, CBS Los Angeles reports."}
{"original": "Liu and USA Happy Baby are also charged with filing false tax returns that failed to report more than $1.9 million received over three years. The indictment alleges that Liu and Dong used 14 different bank accounts to receive more than $3.4 million in international wire transfers from China during 2013 and 2014 alone."}
{"original": "More than a dozen others, including the operator of a third such business, also face charges but are believed to have returned to China, prosecutors said."}
{"original": "While it isn't illegal to visit the United States while pregnant, authorities said the businesses - which were raided by federal agents in 2015 - touted the benefits of having U.S. citizen babies, who could get free public education and, years later, help their parents immigrate."}
{"original": "They also allegedly had women hide their pregnancies while seeking travel visas and lie about their plans, with one You Win USA customer telling consular officials she was going to visit a Trump hotel in Hawaii."}
{"original": "U.S. authorities said the businesses also posed a national security risk since their customers, some who worked for the Chinese government, secured American citizenship for children who can move back to the United States and, once they're 21, sponsor their parents for green cards."}
{"original": "I see this as a grave national security concern and vulnerability, said Mark Zito, assistant special agent-in-charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's homeland security investigations. Are some of them doing it for security because the United States is more stable? Absolutely. But will those governments take advantage of this? Yes, they will."}
{"original": "Messages left for Li and Dong's attorneys were not immediately returned. Derek Tung, Liu's attorney, said the growing interest among Chinese women to give birth to American babies drew attention to a phenomenon long employed by citizens of other countries."}
{"original": "His client had nothing to do with getting women visas from China but worked almost as a subcontractor to provide housing once they arrived, he said. My client is merely the provider. The people who are in China are the ones in charge of everything, he said."}
{"original": "Birth tourism businesses have long operated in California and other states and cater to couples from China, Russia, Nigeria and elsewhere."}
{"original": "In the past, operators sometimes ran into trouble with local code enforcement officials when neighbors in residential areas complained about crowding or excess trash, but they didn't face federal scrutiny."}
{"original": "In 2015, federal agents in California raided roughly three dozen sites connected with the three businesses. More than 20 people were designated as material witnesses but some later fled to China and were charged with violating federal court orders, and a lawyer who helped them leave the country was convicted of obstruction of justice."}
{"original": "This week, a federal grand jury indicted four people who allegedly ran the birth tourism businesses until the 2015 raids, including Wen Rui Deng, 65, who is believed to be in China and accused of operating Star Baby Care."}
{"original": "That business dated to at least 2010 but advertised having brought 8,000 women to the United States - half of them from China - and claimed to have been running since 1999, prosecutors said."}
{"original": "Each business brought hundreds of customers to give birth in the United States and some didn't pay all of the medical costs tied to their care, prosecutors said. One couple paid the indigent rate for their hospital bills - a total of $4,080 - even though they had more than $225,000 in a U.S. bank account they had used to shop at luxury stores including Louis Vuitton, according to court papers."}
{"original": "Li, who operated You Win USA and paid in full for a $2.1 million home in Irvine, California and a new Mercedes-Benz, told an undercover federal agent who was posing as a pregnant Chinese citizen that her company would train her to interview for a visa and pass customs, according to court filings."}
{"original": "At one point, the papers said, she also sent a text message to her husband about the business, saying After all, this is not legal!"}
{"original": "Among President Joe Biden's first moves in office will be to extend a federal eviction moratorium, giving struggling renters time to take advantage of a $25 billion federal assistance program designed to help people pay rent and utilities during the COVID-19 pandemic."}
{"original": "Although sorely needed, those moves aren't nearly enough to cover the nation's growing back-rent backlog. More than 10 million households in the U.S., or nearly one-fourth of the nation's renters, are behind on rent, according to the most recent Census Household Pulse survey. A Moody's Analytics report this week shows that Americans owe a collective $57 billion in back rent as of January."}
{"original": "The typical delinquent renter will owe $5,600 as they will be almost four months behind on their monthly rent of $1,130 and utilities of $290. They will also be on the hook for a late-payment penalty of $50 per month, Moody's Chief Economist Mark Zandi wrote. The most vulnerable renters, according to Moody's analysis, are between ages 40 and 54 and live in the Northeast corridor, the South or California."}
{"original": "For some renters, the amount is much higher."}
{"original": "Najee Wilson, a model and performance artist living in Brooklyn, New York, said he lost all his income during the pandemic, and is nine months behind on his rent of about $2,000."}
{"original": "A lot of the time, my work is scheduled eight months in advance. I haven't been able to plan for a future, Wilson said on a conference call organized by the progressive advocacy group People's Action. I have thousands of dollars of rent that's backlogged."}
{"original": "For many, the aid can't come soon enough."}
{"original": "Meghan Heddings is executive director of Family Housing Resources, a nonprofit and affordable-housing manager in Tucson, Arizona. Right now we're in that pivotal moment, Heddings said earlier this week. The funds are only trickling out in the state of Arizona; the other programs have all ended. We're in a waiting game and have 11 days left until the next moratorium expires."}
{"original": "Mr. Biden has indicated he intends to extend the moratorium until March 31 from January 31, but has yet to formally issue an executive order stipulating the change."}
{"original": "From September to November, the Community Investment Corporation, another Tucson nonprofit, helped more than 900 people apply for rental aid. At our height, we did over 200 households in a single week, recalled Danny Knee, the group's executive director. When the funding ran out, the CIC had 250 people on a waiting list; it has since swelled to 1,000, Knee said."}
{"original": "Rental aid programs come with their own pitfalls. Some landlords don't want to participate in such government programs, while many tenants don't know how to get help or don't qualify because of income restrictions. The Treasury program excludes renters who were having trouble paying rent prior to the pandemic."}
{"original": "Jannah bint al Yusuf, a resident of Lexington, Kentucky, was nearly evicted last year despite qualifying for help. Yusuf, 46, lost her job shortly before the pandemic erupted last year. She has not received unemployment benefits but was able to make her 2019 tax refund last through most of the summer, she told CBS MoneyWatch."}
{"original": "In August, Yusef applied for rental assistance from a local organization, but the money was delayed and didn't reach her landlord in time, she said. Yusuf recalls the experience of finding an eviction notice taped to her door that month. By the time the money finally went through, an eviction court hearing had been scheduled."}
{"original": "There were literally days that I would just cry, she said. I'm thinking, you know, I'm just a complete and total failure, what is going to happen? I couldn't find employment, I got let go for my job and couldn't find employment, this pandemic happened."}
{"original": "The court date came on September 10, a few days after a federal moratorium on evictions kicked in, and her case was dismissed. Still, Yusuf worries about what will happen at the end of the month."}
{"original": "I don't feel that I'm in the clear, Yusuf said. Once something like that does take place, it does something to you on the inside, that you're, you're unsafe, and you're always going to be on edge. Because I always feel like I'm on the edge of the cliff looking down, and oh gosh, any minute, someone's going to kick me off."}
{"original": "It's not clear how many people will benefit from the $25 billion federal rent assistance — housing experts have previously estimated anywhere from 2 million to 8 million households could get help from the first tranche. But even with that federal aid, evictions are expected to rise."}
{"original": "Nationally, eviction filings are rising, and in some places approaching the level they were prior to the pandemic, according to the Eviction Lab at Princeton University."}
{"original": "While emergency protections have stalled evictions and temporarily kept people in their homes, they have not stalled rents. Most households that find themselves two, three or four months behind on rent will not be able to repay that debt on their own, they write."}
{"original": "In California, officials expect the number of eviction cases this year to double from their usual level, reaching 250,000 in that state alone. Nationally, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia expect evictions to jump 50%, according to the Washington Post."}

{"original": "LONDON - Tampons are the latest battleground in Britain's difficult relationship with the European Union."}
{"original": "The British government has declared victory in its bid to remove an EU-imposed sales tax on women's sanitary products. Campaigners argue that tampons are an essential item and should be tax-exempt."}
{"original": "Treasury chief George Osborne says EU leaders have agreed to let Britain cut the tax rate to zero, boasting: We've achieved what no British government has even tried to achieve."}
{"original": "EU opponents say the tax is a prime example of Brussels meddling."}

{"original": "In delivering his first State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Donald Trump will discuss his infrastructure plan, immigration reform, trade, and the tax bill that passed in December."}
{"original": "The theme of Mr. Trump's speech -- building a safe, strong and proud America -- was described by a senior White House official as unifying, with an emphasis on Mr. Trump's deregulation efforts and tax cuts that have spurred an economic boom and stock market records."}
{"original": "If last year was described as optimistic, I think this speech is also optimistic but it's also very unifying, the senior White House official told reporters in a background briefing Friday at the White House. In the sense that it is unifying around the greater opportunities for all Americans as a result of last year's jobs growth and success in the economy."}
{"original": "A far cry from optimistic, Mr. Trump's inaugural address last January was notable for it's dark and fear-mongering tone -- a populist ode to the forgotten men and women."}
{"original": "That was some weird sh*t, former President George W. Bush said after witnessing Mr. Trump's speech."}
{"original": "The senior official declined to provide specifics but said Mr. Trump will tout a $1.7 trillion dollar infrastructure proposal -- one that the White House believes will garner bipartisan support -- and unveil new policies and calls to action for Congress for the year ahead."}
{"original": "The opioid crisis, a topic that the administration has largely ignored since Mr. Trump declared a public health emergency in October, will be addressed, but the senior White House official declined to say whether or not the president will make a request for funding. The president will also highlight the crisis by hosting a guest who is reflective of the impact of the drug addiction and opioid crisis to sit with first lady Melania Trump during the speech."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump will face some opposition in the room during his prime-time speech on Tuesday -- a handful of Democrats are planning on skipping the State of the Union altogether -- and he'll also be addressing an American public that is one of the most polarized in American history."}
{"original": "The speech will make clear that all groups are benefiting under this presidency and I'll just leave it at that, the senior official said."}
{"original": "There's debate over whether Mr. Trump or his predecessor, President Obama, is responsible for the good economic news. And some economists argue that while Mr. Trump's tax cuts provide a small cut for a number of middle class Americans, the bill trends towards exacerbating income inequality."}
{"original": "In the vein of his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday morning, Mr. Trump will also repeat his insistence for fair and reciprocal trade and express a willingness to participate in bilateral trade negotiations with any country. Mr. Trump made news at Davos when he said he'd be open to re-entering the Trans-Pacific Partnership if a new substantially better deal was brokered."}
{"original": "The White House released its proposal for immigration reform Thursday. The proposal which the president will raise during the State of the Union, includes a fix to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program with a path to citizenship for 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $25 billion for a border wall, elimination the diversity visa lottery and an end to chain family migration outside of spouses and minor children."}

{"original": "Police describe Dr. Robin Goldman's death as a fatal case of domestic violence. Officers responded to a 911 call just after 10 a.m. Wednesday morning to the Scarsdale home of Goldman, a pediatrician affiliated with the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, and her estranged husband Julius Jules Reich, who has worked since mid-2014 as a tax specialist at a New York City firm."}
{"original": "The report is that a female has been hurt seriously, and no further information was given by the calling party, a dispatcher told officers when the crime was reported, according to the station."}
{"original": "Sources told CBS New York that Goldman was found stabbed to death in a bathroom shower and that Reich made the 911 call."}
{"original": "This is not a random act, said Scarsdale Police Capt. Thomas Altizio. Both victim and suspect resided in the house."}

{"original": "A course director at Albert Einstein College of Medicine where Goldman taught in a course on doctor-patient communication, Milan wrote that Goldman was much loved by her students as well as the faculty who have taught beside her. She was smart, sensitive, dedicated she wrote, adding that she was a thoughtful and very talented teacher and that her death was a terrible loss."}
{"original": "The crime, which marked the first homicide in this tony Westchester town in nearly 40 years, left neighbors stunned. According to CBS New York, the home where Goldman was found was worth $3 million."}

{"original": "Milan said she hadn't seen any of this coming."}

{"original": "According to FBI statistics, 35.5 percent of female murder victims whose relationship with their killers were known were murdered by husbands or boyfriends in 2014."}
{"original": "A report released by the non-profit Violence Policy Center shows that 94 percent of women killed nationally in 2013 knew their offenders and out of that group, 62 percent were killed by husbands or intimate partners."}
{"original": "The Congressional Budget Office projects the federal debt will exceed the economy's size by the end of the year and will balloon to 202% of gross domestic product over the next 30 years. And that's their outlook without factoring in President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, which is making its way through the Senate this week."}
{"original": "According to the nonpartisan office, by the end of this year, the federal debt will be 102% of GDP, a proportion that will nearly double by 2051. The CBO warns this increases the risk of a fiscal crisis and higher inflation moving forward."}
{"original": "The projections come after the coronavirus pandemic last year triggered the deepest economic downturn since World War II. With millions of people out of work and businesses temporarily or permanently shut down, revenues decreased while spending soared."}
{"original": "The White House and congressional Democrats warn the United States is far from out of the woods in its efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic and revitalize the economy. On Thursday, the Labor Department weekly report showed more than 1.1 million people last week filed for first-time unemployment benefits, including Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. More than 18 million people remain on some form of unemployment benefits."}
{"original": "But Republican lawmakers argue the latest COVID-19 relief package includes too much spending not directly related to getting control of the virus and targeting those financially affected."}
{"original": "According to the CBO projections, as the economy recovers, the deficit will decline in the near future. However, the deficit would then start to increase, driving up the debt which would hit a historic level for the country by 2031 and continue to climb."}
{"original": "Once spending associated with the pandemic declines, the report states, total spending is projected to increase in each year over thirty years. The report attributes some of that to interest more than tripling with the growth of debt and rising interest rates."}
{"original": "Another factor the CBO calls a significant contributor is increased spending on Social Security, Medicare and other health care programs, because of rising health care costs as well as the population aging. The CBO finds discretionary spending, of which half is on national defense, is expected to decline in relation to GDP over the next 10 years, but is then projected to stay consistent across the following two decades."}
{"original": "After a post-pandemic-related dip, federal revenues are expected to rise. The CBO attributes this to scheduled changes in the current tax rules including the expiration of provisions in the 2017 tax law affecting income taxes. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has indicated it would like to roll back some corporate tax cuts made under the Trump administration as well as close other loopholes as it looks ahead."}
{"original": "A second round of stimulus checks may soon land in the bank accounts of millions of Americans after President Donald Trump signed a $900 billion economic relief package on December 27. Yet in signing the bill, Mr. Trump once again called for its $600 stimulus checks to be boosted to $2,000 per person."}
{"original": "On December 28, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass a bill to increase the $600 stimulus checks to $2,000, with the bill receiving the needed two-thirds majority of the members voting to pass in the chamber."}
{"original": "But the effort's future appears dim given that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked attempts to vote on the $2,000 stimulus checks approved by the House — but resurrected the higher payments in a new bill that includes other items on Mr. Trump's wish list, including the repeal of Section 230, which shields social media companies from lawsuits."}
{"original": "McConnell on December 31 again rebuffed a push for the Senate to take up a bill increasing coronavirus relief checks to Americans from $600 to $2,000, calling the proposal socialism for rich people."}
{"original": "To be sure, millions of Americans could use bigger checks. Almost 6 in 10 consumers said they have suffered a financial setback due to the pandemic as of the end of November, according to a study from TransUnion, which also found that 40% of those households said they had been banking on the prospect of another stimulus check to help them pay their bills."}
{"original": "At this point, it's most likely that people will still receive $600 checks, according to Wall Street analysts."}
{"original": "In our view, the $2k cash supplement is unlikely to pass the Republican Senate given the strained fiscal conservatism in the [Republican] caucus, Benjamin Salisbury and Hunter Hammond of Heights Securities said in a December 29 research note. We still expect eligible recipients to receive $600, not $2,000."}
{"original": "Even so, the odds of passing the $2,000 checks have increased — but still remain slim, Hammond said in a December 28 research note: In total, we assign 30% odds (up from 10%) that a bill increasing direct payments to $2,000 will be signed into law this week, Hammond wrote."}
{"original": "It would mark the second time lawmakers have sought to boost the checks to $2,000 per person, following a December 24 vote in the House during a pro forma session. That effort was blocked by House Republicans."}
{"original": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has urged Republicans to support the bigger checks. The GOP has pushed back against bigger checks because of their cost, which would amount to an estimated $530 billion, or about $385 billion more than what Congress approved with the $600 checks, according to Heights Securities."}
{"original": "The President must immediately call on Congressional Republicans to end their obstruction and to join him and Democrats in support of our stand-alone legislation to increase direct payment checks to $2,000, which will be brought to the Floor tomorrow, Pelosi tweeted on December 28."}

{"original": "The $600 checks called for in the latest relief package would represent half of the $1,200 directed toward most adults in the first round of stimulus checks. Critics had said the aid would be helpful, but not enough to tide over families who have suffered income or job losses since the coronavirus pandemic shuttered the economy last March and caused unemployment to spike."}
{"original": "What about timing of the checks?"}
{"original": "Before Mr. Trump's pushback, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had predicted on December 21 that Americans could start receiving the funds as soon as the week of December 28."}
{"original": "Despite the president's delay in signing the bill, Mnuchin on December 29 tweeted that stimulus checks could begin arriving in bank accounts as early as tonight."}
{"original": ".@USTreasury has delivered a payment file to the @FederalReserve for Americans' Economic Impact Payments. These payments may begin to arrive in some accounts by direct deposit as early as tonight and will continue into next week (1/2) — Steven Mnuchin (@stevenmnuchin1) December 29, 2020"}
{"original": "Mnuchin said that paper checks will begin to be mailed on December 30, and that people will be able to check their payment status at the IRS' Get My Payment portal later this week. He didn't specify how many checks will be initially distributed."}
{"original": "As of January 1, the IRS site says its Get My Payment portal isn't currently open, but that it continues to monitor and prepare for new legislation related to Economic Impact Payments, which is the term the IRS uses for stimulus checks."}
{"original": "The checks would represent half of the amount directed to most U.S. households in the spring, when the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (or CARES Act) authorized $1,200 checks for eligible adults."}
{"original": "However, under the bill passed by Congress this month, one group of people would receive more money in the second round of stimulus checks than the first: dependent children, who would receive the same $600 checks as adults, up from the $500 checks that children received through the CARES Act in the spring."}
{"original": "Single people earning up to $75,000 would receive $600, while married couples earning up to $150,000 would receive $1,200."}
{"original": "The second round of checks would have the same type of income phaseouts as in the CARES Act, with the stimulus check payments reduced for earnings above $75,000 per single person or $150,000 per married couple."}
{"original": "The amount of payment individuals receive would be reduced by $5 for every $100 of income earned above those thresholds, according to the House Appropriations committee. That's similar to the CARES Act, but fewer higher-earning taxpayers would qualify for the checks under this formula when compared with the earlier bill."}
{"original": "The second stimulus checks would be phased out entirely for single people earning over $87,000 or married couples earning more than $174,000 — compared with the CARES Act's phaseout for single people earning over $99,000 and for couples earning over $198,000."}
{"original": "To check on how much you might receive, you can go to Omni Calculator's second stimulus calculator for an estimate."}
{"original": "Aside from the smaller stimulus checks for adults, the other major change under the bill passed by Congress is the amount provided for dependent children: $600 for each child, up from $500 in the CARES Act."}
{"original": "However, the bill states the $600 would be directed toward each dependent child under age 17, which means that adults who are nevertheless claimed as dependents — such as college students and older high school students — wouldn't qualify for the checks."}
{"original": "Adult dependents, such as seniors who are claimed as dependents on their adult children's tax returns, also wouldn't qualify for the checks. Excluding college students and other adult dependents was a matter of debate with the first round of checks, with some families arguing that older dependents should also qualify for the payments."}
{"original": "A family of two parents with two child dependents could receive up to $2,400 under the provision, lawmakers said."}
{"original": "Couples who include an immigrant without a Green Card would also qualify for the checks, a provision that is retroactive to the CARES Act, the summary said."}
{"original": "This is important to many families because the first round of stimulus checks only went to American citizens or immigrants with resident alien status, also known as a Green Card. Legal immigrants without a Green Card, as well as undocumented immigrants, were excluded — and American citizens married to immigrants without a Green Card were also excluded, as well as their children, even if the young dependents are citizens."}
{"original": "Denying checks to U.S. citizens due to their spousal or parental relationship to an immigrant prompted lawsuits earlier this year over what plaintiffs claimed was an unconstitutional action."}
{"original": "One glitch in the first stimulus payments was a slower rollout for Social Security recipients, as well as Supplemental Security Income recipients, Railroad Retirement Board beneficiaries and Veterans Administration beneficiaries. Because some of those recipients don't file tax returns — which the IRS relied on for distributing the earliest stimulus payments — millions of them waited weeks or months to get their checks."}
{"original": "But the new bill would ensure that those recipients would receive the $600 checks automatically, according to Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who worked on a bipartisan stimulus bill that became the framework for the latest negotiations."}
{"original": "I am particularly glad that the final text of the relief package includes my bipartisan bill to ensure that recipients of Social Security, Supplemental Security Income and certain VA benefits will receive these payments automatically, Hassan said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch."}
{"original": "That means that millions of Social Security, SSI, VA and Railroad Retirement benefits wouldn't risk missing out on receiving the payments, she added."}
{"original": "As other cities lobby to bring Amazon to town, the retailer is finding less love these days in Seattle, its home turf."}
{"original": "Amazon this week abruptly pulled the plug on a large expansion in Seattle, saying it would await the outcome of a proposed business tax"}
{"original": "The tax would pay for affordable housing and homeless services in Seattle, which last year had the third biggest homeless population in the U.S. after New York and Los Angeles, according to HUD. Amazon's growth is seen as one factor in skyrocketing housing costs in the area."}
{"original": "The tax would apply to businesses that gross at least $20 million a year in Seattle starting in 2019. About 600 businesses would have to pay 26 cents for each hour an employee works, amounting to about $500 for each full-time worker. The tax would raise $75 million a year in total."}
{"original": "Four of nine City Council members signed the draft legislation released late last month, and a fifth signaled strong support, arguing it would help offset Washington state's upside-down tax code that puts an inequitable accumulation of wealth ahead of the needs of everyday people."}
{"original": "Three-quarters of the money would fund nearly 1,800 affordable housing units in Seattle, and the rest would fund services for the homeless, according to the draft, which the council was set to vote on May 14."}
{"original": "Amazon employs more than 45,000 in Seattle, and would face a $20 million to $30 million annual tab from the tax, and possibly more when the payroll tax comes."}
{"original": "Pending the outcome of the head tax vote by City Council, Amazon has paused all construction planning on our Block 18 project in downtown Seattle and is evaluating options to sub-lease all space in our recently leased Rainier Square building, emailed an Amazon spokesperson."}
{"original": "Amazon's move took city officials off guard, and the outcome of the tax proposal seemed far from clear."}
{"original": "While the mayor's office would not say whether she was supporting the proposed tax, she seemed to indicate hopes for a compromise."}
{"original": "I'm deeply concerned about the impact on a large range of jobs - from our building trades, to restaurant workers, to nurses, manufacturing jobs and tech workers, Jenny Durkan, Seattle's mayor, said of Amazon's decision in an emailed statement."}
{"original": "At the same time, our city must urgently address our homelessness and affordability crisis, she added, vowing to work with council members and local leaders to address the problems."}
{"original": "The issue has emotions running high, with construction workers on Thursday reportedly shouting down a member of the City Council who supports the tax proposal, chanting No head tax, no head tax."}
{"original": "The Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, of which Amazon is a member, opposes the proposal, calling it a misguided tax on jobs."}
{"original": "Amazon also has the support of the editorial board at the Seattle Times, which calls the proposed tax a symbolic 'eat the rich' gesture, which it contends would hurt workers."}
{"original": "ALICE, Texas -- The price of oil rose for a change Friday, closing up nine percent to over $32 a barrel."}
{"original": "Gas dropped another penny to $1.85 -- great for drivers. But the American oil patch is sliding from boom to bust."}
{"original": "Machines that once pumped oil from the ground near Alice, Texas sit idle, lined up along a highway. It's a painful sight for Denise Walker Robinson."}
{"original": "I think that's what keeps me going, is my faith, Robinson told CBS News."}
{"original": "Her company services oil rigs, but the trucks have nowhere to go. She once had 200 employees; now there are only 48."}
{"original": "That means that I'm struggling to keep those 48 people working, Robinson said."}
{"original": "And if oil prices don't stabilize this year?"}
{"original": "Well, we may all be done, she said."}
{"original": "Cheaper oil means it's less profitable to drill here and as projects dry up, the town has suffered. Sales tax revenues plummeted more than 60 percent in one year. Unemployment has nearly doubled to nine percent."}
{"original": "Jesus Trevino lost his job moving oil equipment six months ago, and went to a food pantry Friday for help."}
{"original": "Can't even afford to pay my bills, Trevino told CBS News. You go from making a good living, you know, and all of the sudden, it's all gone."}
{"original": "Volunteer Phyllis Seidel says the pantry's case load grew by 700 people last year. She's concerned the food bank won't be able to cope with demand."}
{"original": "At this time last year, there were almost 700 rigs drilling in Texas. More than half of those are now out of production."}
{"original": "Only a few days into the tax-filing season, the IRS is sounding an alarm about a new tax scam. Specifically, it's warning tax preparers to be on guard about the scam, which is aimed at stealing taxpayers' refunds by using data compromised in tax preparers' offices."}
{"original": "The agency said it has already received a number of fake tax returns that had accurate taxpayer names, addresses, Social Security numbers and even bank account information for the victims."}
{"original": "In an unusual twist, some bogus refunds were actually directed to the real taxpayers' bank accounts, the agency said. A criminal, posing as a debt collector, then contacted the taxpayers saying the refunds had been sent in error and the victims should forward the money to the crook."}
{"original": "Because these fake returns contained all of the taxpayer's correct information, down to the right number of dependents, the IRS believes the scam started in tax-preparation offices. The agency assumes that the data was compromised because some preparers were taken in by phishing scams that then loaded malicious software onto their computer systems, making all the taxpayer information that was kept by these preparers vulnerable to theft."}
{"original": "The IRS said it's still in preliminary stages of investigating the con and can't quantify how many people have been affected. But because this type of scam has a way of burgeoning overnight, the agency wanted to immediately warn preparers to secure their computer systems."}
{"original": "Given the history that we have seen on scams like this, when these start, they tend to proliferate quickly, said IRS spokesman Terry Lemons. When a scam turns out to be successful, they tend to expand. We wanted to alert tax professionals to be on the lookout."}
{"original": "Unfortunately for consumers -- the ultimate victims of this con -- those who find themselves hit by tax fraud have a far more difficult course than consumers whose credit card accounts have been stolen. In the latter case, consumers have a number of steps they can take to deter criminals from using that stolen information to open up new accounts."}
{"original": "In the former case, the first inkling that a taxpayer would get that they were victimized is when their electronically filed return gets rejected as a duplicate. At that point, in addition to reporting the fraud to the credit bureaus and the Federal Trade Commission, tax fraud victims need to fill out a special IRS form, 14039. The taxpayer's 1040 must then be filed on paper, with the fraud affidavit attached to the front."}
{"original": "Be prepared that this will dramatically slow your refund. Lemons said the typical tax identity fraud takes roughly four months to investigate and resolve."}
{"original": "Since tax ID theft peaked in 2013, the IRS has taken a host of steps, including forming a security partnership with preparers and software companies, to stamp out tax return fraud. The agency has also launched a pilot program that has added 16-digit identifiers to some employer's W-2 information. The agency hopes this will help it spot and stop identity thieves before they take off with taxpayer refunds."}
{"original": "These efforts have helped cut ID theft reports nearly in half over the past year."}
{"original": "We have stepped up our defenses, and the private sector tax community has worked to strengthen their security too, Lemons said."}
{"original": "Still, this newly discovered fraud is ominous and suggests that individual taxpayers should also be on guard."}
{"original": "Make sure that you keep updated security software on your home computer and ask any tax preparer you hire how your data is protected, Lemons suggested. If any of your W-2 forms contain the new 16-digit identifiers, also make sure to include that number on your tax return. That will help the IRS know the return truly came from you, not an identity crook."}
{"original": "The death toll from the coronavirus in New York state now stands at 728 – up from 519 the previous day and 385 on Thursday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Saturday.

{"original": "This is going to be a big advantage, he said. The locations will add another 4,000 hospital beds to the state's capacity."}
{"original": "Cuomo also said that some sites will be COVID only – where people in those hospitals will just have the COVID virus, so the staff that is there is just working with one type of issue. Those locations are the South Beach Psychiatric Center in Staten Island, Westchester Square in the Bronx and SUNY Downstate (University Hospital) in Brooklyn."}

{"original": "President Trump said Saturday he is considering declaring an enforceable quarantine affecting residents of the New York metropolitan area. I am giving consideration to a QUARANTINE of developing 'hot spots,' New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. A decision will be made, one way or another, shortly, Mr. Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had told the president he wanted to stop the flow of New Yorkers who may be infected with COVID-19 into the state."}
{"original": "Cuomo said Saturday he had not spoken to the president about quarantining the metro region. Cuomo also said: I don't even know what that means. I don't know how that could be legally enforceable. And from a medical point of view, I don't know what you'd be accomplishing, Cuomo said."}
{"original": "President Trump is making the case to the nation Tuesday night that his border wall must be funded — and it must be funded now — as the partial government shutdown continues into its third week. It will be his first prime-time address from the Oval Office."}
{"original": "According to the White House, the president will address border security, the partial government shutdown, and the looming threat of the first missed paycheck for federal employees on Friday. Still unclear is whether the president will use his bully pulpit to announce any new policy or approach. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in Jordan the president would make a lot of news, but didn't say what."}
{"original": "It's gonna be about the border, mostly about our southern border. I saw an early version of it. He'll make a lot of news, Pompeo told reporters on the ground in Jordan."}
{"original": "Democrats are requesting air time, too, to respond to Mr. Trump's remarks."}
{"original": "Vice President Mike Pence would not say, in an interview with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett Tuesday morning, whether the president will announce a national emergency in his address. The president is considering doing so, but hadn't decided as of Monday afternoon, Pence told reporters at the time."}
{"original": "Pence told CBS This Morning Mr. Trump will use the Oval Office address to lay out the facts about what the American people view as a humanitarian and genuine crisis at our southern border."}
{"original": "The time has come for the Democrats to come to the table, and we have to start negotiating, Pence said. Not just to address the government shutdown but to address the humanitarian crisis at the border."}
{"original": "The White House is demanding $5.7 billion for barriers at the border, in addition to $7 billion for other border-related expenses, like more immigration judges to adjudicate immigration cases. Democrats have yet to formally respond to those demands, but they have already insisted in the past they won't hand the president billions for his border wall."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, the government shutdown is starting to affect airports, where more Transportation Security Administration officers are calling in sick than usual. The White House has said tax refunds won't be affected by the shutdown, but other government services, like food stamps, hang in the balance if the shutdown continues."}

{"original": "We are at an inflection point in the history of our world. We are at an inflection point in the history of our nation. We are here because the American dream and our American democracy are under attack and on the line like never before, Harris said. We are here at this moment in time because we must answer a fundamental question: Who are we? ... Who are we as Americans?"}

{"original": "The former California attorney general said she was so proud to be a daughter of Oakland, California, noting she was born at a nearby hospital. She never mentioned President Trump by name, but vowed to challenge him directly, highlighting her work as a prosecutor to argue against the administration's immigration policies."}
{"original": "Folks, on the subject of transnational gangs, let's be perfectly clear: The president's medieval vanity project is not going to stop them, Harris said, presumably referring to Mr. Trump's proposed border wall."}
{"original": "When we have children in cages, crying for their mothers and fathers, don't you dare call that border security, she added later. That's a human rights abuse."}
{"original": "The Republican National Committee was quick to return fire, with a spokesman saying Harris' liberal policies are totally out-of-step with most Americans."}
{"original": "After graduating from law school in 1989, Harris returned to Oakland and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office. In 2003, she defeated a two-term incumbent to become San Francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color."}
{"original": "Harris announced her presidential run last Monday on Martin Luther King Jr. Day after telegraphing her intentions for months. Elected to the Senate in 2016, Harris has used her perch on the powerful Judiciary Committee to quickly elevate her profile. She has laid out a plan to provide middle-class families with tax credits worth thousands of dollars. She wrote a new book published in early January laying out her life story and career as a prosecutor."}

I may not be qualified to be President, but a dramatic camera angle can make me LOOK like a president -- a president with the conviction to nod, the courage to point. ..."}
{"original": "Ideas, policies, morals? These are things I don't need. What I need is $2 billion."}
{"original": "Honest Gil Fulbright isn't a real candidate. He's an actor, and Gil's campaign for the White House is a satire that's been viewed more than three million times on social media."}
{"original": "It makes you chuckle, but there is a serious point to his pitch."}
{"original": "He's just shining a light on how politicians are routinely being bribed by special interest lobbyists, and swaying their votes in their favor, and the people who are left out are we, the American people, said Josh Silver, the director of represent.us, the grassroots organization behind Gil Fulbright that's working to pass laws combating the influence of moneyed interests in American politics."}
{"original": "To be successful, said Reynolds, you would need to have these guys in Congress vote against their self interest, right?"}
{"original": "Well, that's why we're doing what we're doing, Silver said."}
{"original": "He's talking about the strategy to basically end-run Washington and begin by focusing on local government -- building a movement from the ground up."}
{"original": "We know that Washington is not going to fix this problem any time soon, Silver said. They don't fix anything any time soon these days! The only place that there's a bright light right now is in the cities and states."}
{"original": "From its office in Florence, Mass., represent.us brought together an unlikely alliance. The group's advisors include Republicans, Democrats, prominent members of Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party -- even disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who served several years in federal prison after being convicted of conspiracy to bribe Members of Congress."}
{"original": "Dan Krassner, the political director of represent.us, sees it as a bipartisan issue: I'm a Republican, and conservatives are fed up with the amount of corruption, the fraud, the waste and abuse in government. We're all essentially paying a corruption tax because of those problems in government. So we want reform."}
{"original": "What sparked Monday's mayhem on Wall Street? The primary catalyst was a continuation of the selling wave on Friday related to inflation fears, higher bond yields and faster-than-expected wage growth. But more than that, you can blame a breakdown in an increasingly popular strategy that uses derivatives and other investing trickery to bet on ongoing market bliss, low volatility and easy gains."}
{"original": "So-called short volatility funds, such as the Velocity Shares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term (XIV), melted down roughly 90 percent in after-hours trading on Monday in what looked like panicked liquidation. The fear is that the underwriters -- Credit Suisse (CS) in this case -- will have to liquidate the fund in which it's a major investor. If so, the hit would be worth about two quarters of profits for the institution. Credit Suisse said Tuesday morning it didn't suffer losses stemming from XIV."}
{"original": "The action in XIV led to further selling in the broad equity futures in the overnight session, with Dow Jones industrials futures triggering their circuit breaker in Japanese trading (down 7 percent or more). The next trigger would be a 12 percent decline followed by a 20 percent decline, at which point trading would stop for the day."}
{"original": "Monday's selling pressure was overwhelming: Decliners outpaced advancers by a 9-to-1 margin, while down volume swamped advancing volume by 12-to-1. That ended the 410-day run without a 5 percent downturn."}
{"original": "The ferocity of the decline, according to Morgan Stanley analysts, was a drop in market liquidity as computer trading algorithms fed on each other heading into the close of cash trading on Monday. Liquidity was down 50 percent in some places from Friday, pulling down the average order size. That left a $3.4 billion sell-side imbalance heading into the close and drove the after-hours decline, which has eased as morning approached in the U.S., with Dow industrials futures down by around 300 points."}
{"original": "What's next? Well, in a typical environment, a relief rebound should be expected. But the collapse of the short volatility trade as per the XIV calls that into question (chart below). A whiff of 2007-style contagion is in the air."}
{"original": "Jason Goepfert at SentimenTrader noted that Monday's moves were of a ferocity rarely seen in history. And they have tended to lead to capitulation lows (when investors who've been holding out finally give in and sell) that lead to medium-term rebounds. The S&P 500 has lost 6 percent within six days of setting its last new high."}
{"original": "That last happened in July 2007, which marked the top of the previous bull run -- a frightening parallel. But other examples from history, including 1986 and 1955, showed higher prices in the months that followed. Overall, stocks had risen two months later 83 percent of the time."}
{"original": "But machine-based selling could spoil the pattern this time. JPMorgan quantitative strategist Marko Kolanovic estimated that soaring volatility could trigger some $100 billion in U.S. equity selling as so-called systemic traders are forced to rebalance their positions. Yet he sees a silver lining in it all, noting that strong underlying fundamentals -- such as attractive valuations, earnings and the U.S. tax cut -- argue for a recovery in time."}
{"original": "That could, perhaps, make this current unpleasantness a tactical buying opportunity ahead of fresh hurdles such as the specter of higher interest rates and a new debt ceiling standoff."}
{"original": "With nearly 40 million Americans filing their taxes this week, many are likely wondering: How much does the government need my money, anyway?"}
{"original": "The federal government took in $3.3 trillion in tax revenue last year. More than 80 percent -- $2.7 trillion -- came from individuals through either income tax or payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare."}
{"original": "Corporate taxes kick in just 9 percent of the government's revenue. After the recent tax cuts, the share from Corporate America will go down even more. The Office of Management and Budget projects corporate income taxes will drop to just 5 percent of government revenue in five years."}
{"original": "Estate taxes make up even less. Last year, less than 1 percent of the government's funding came from taxes on large inheritances (or, as the IRS calls it, taxes on your right to transfer property at your death). Now that the Tax Cut and Jobs Act has made more estates exempt, that tax will also be even less of a money-raiser."}
{"original": "More than three-quarters of the federal government's income last year came from individuals. The largest single source was the federal income tax; the second-largest was the payroll tax. Business taxes, excise taxes and estate and gift taxes made up the rest."}
{"original": "Individual income tax affects only half of individuals"}
{"original": "A relatively small population makes up the country's tax base: More than half of government revenue comes from just the top 5 percent of income earners."}
{"original": "Some 76 million Americans have no federal income tax liability, according to the Tax Policy Center. That means they either earn too little to pay income tax or qualify for tax credits that cancel out their income tax payments."}
{"original": "The bottom half of earners together contributes just 3 percent of the total income tax revenue, according to a Tax Foundation analysis."}
{"original": "In economic terms, this is a progressive tax: Higher earners are taxed proportionately more. Many other taxes, like sales taxes, are regressive, meaning they cost poorer people more as a percentage of their income. Sales taxes are imposed by states, but the federal government has a version called excise taxes, which it levies on alcohol, cigarettes and gasoline. Excise taxes have fallen in importance in recent years, and today make up just 3 percent of government revenue."}
{"original": "With $3.3 trillion moving from individuals into the Treasury last year, it may surprise taxpayers to hear that the IRS, by its own estimates, isn't collecting all the tax it can. The agency calculated the so-called tax gap two years ago, and it found that it collects about 82 percent of the tax that is actually owed. Americans who fail to file taxes, don't report income to the government or report less than they earned cost Uncle Sam $406 billion in 2010, the most recent year for which detailed analysis is available."}
{"original": "SAUGATUCK, Mich. -- Michael Ryder had been approved for $360 a week in Michigan unemployment benefits -- until the state learned he'd been dogging it at the Detroit-area restaurant where he supposedly worked. Ryder is a German Shepherd owned by attorney Michael Haddock on the other side of the state in Saugatuck, CBS Detroit reports."}
{"original": "Speaking to WWJ Newsradio 950, Haddock said he was indeed surprised when he received a benefits letter addressed to Michael Ryder from Michigan's Unemployment Insurance Agency. The paperwork listed the dog as having been employed by Kruse and Muer, an upscale seafood chain."}
{"original": "He's very food driven, so it's no coincidence that he had a restaurant on his application, Haddock said, with a chuckle."}
{"original": "When Haddock contacted the agency about the letter, he was told the agency's computer system had sent it, but that the claim was later was flagged as suspicious and denied."}
{"original": "Haddock added that, while he's not entirely sure what Ryder does all day, he is pretty sure that his dog has never had a job. Could it have been a practical joke?"}

{"original": "Agency spokesman Chris De Witt said that they're still looking into the matter, but they may never know who filed the claim."}
{"original": "Due to criminals stealing data from a number of different places -- Equifax, other places where this has happened over the last few years -- criminals are now using that information to file for unemployment benefits, and the IRS is running into the same problem with tax refunds. That's how this starts."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON - U.S. consumers kept their spending flat in December and instead boosted their savings rate to the highest level in three years."}
{"original": "Consumer spending was unchanged in December after rising 0.5 percent in November, the Commerce Department reported Monday. Incomes increased 0.3 percent, matching November's gain."}
{"original": "Higher incomes and flat spending pushed the savings rate to 5.5 percent of after-tax income in December. That was the highest level since December 2012."}
{"original": "The latest numbers underscore how cautious consumers were in the final three months of the year. Weak spending gains dragged overall U.S. economic growth, which slowed to a meager 0.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter."}
{"original": "But economists expect that an improving jobs market will boost spending this year and send economic growth back above 2 percent in the current January-March quarter."}
{"original": "An inflation gauge preferred by the Federal Reserve fell by 0.1 percent in December, reflecting further declines in energy prices. Over the 12 months ending in December, this price index is up 0.6 percent. That was the largest 12-month gain since December 2014 but remains well below the Fed's 2 percent target for inflation."}
{"original": "The flat reading on spending in December reflected a warmer-than-normal December that reduced demand for winter clothing. In addition, analysts blamed a wetter-than-normal month for holding back spending on autos. Demand for autos and other durable goods fell by 0.9 percent in December, while demand for nondurable goods such as clothing also dropped 0.9 percent. Demand for services including utilities rose 0.4 percent."}
{"original": "At its meeting last week, the Fed left a key interest rate unchanged six weeks after boosting it by a quarter-point, the first rate hike in nearly a decade."}
{"original": "Many economists believe that the recent turbulence in financial markets, weakness in the U.S. and global economies and absence of inflation pressures may prompt the Fed to move slowly. They say the Fed is likely to reduce the number of rate hikes it makes this year from four to perhaps no more than two."}

{"original": "The S&P 500 closed up 18 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,786, an new high. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 228, or 0.9 percent, to 25,803, also a record, and the Nasdaq composite gained 49.28, or 0.7 percent, to close at 7,261."}
{"original": "Kohl's (KSS) jscored one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 and closed up $2.75, or 4.5 percent, to $63.87 a share. Nordstrom (JWN), Target (TGT) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) all climbed more than 3 percent."}
{"original": "A government report confirmed that the holiday shopping season was a strong one, with retail sales rising 0.4 percent last month following a 0.9 percent surge in November.

{"original": "The floodgates are now opening for companies to report their results for the last three months of 2017, and expectations are generally high. Analysts are forecasting S&P 500 companies will report earnings per share that are 10.7 percent higher than a year earlier, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence."}

{"original": "One notable laggard was Facebook (FB), which fell to one of the largest losses in the S&P 500 after the social-media giant said that it is revamping its system to show fewer posts from brands and fewer videos in favor of more posts from friends and family. The changes may result in people spending less time on Facebook, and less advertising revenue for the company."}

{"original": "A senior U.S. Treasury official touring Asia has urged the region's banks and financial regulators to do more to tighten oversight of booming trading in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies."}
{"original": "Sigal Mandelker, the Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said Friday that more needs to be done to prevent money laundering and other criminal activities using such transactions."}
{"original": "Speaking to reporters in Tokyo after visiting China, Hong Kong and South Korea, she lauded recent moves to keep closer tabs on such dealings. South Korea, for one, has banned anonymous trading in cryptocurrencies."}
{"original": "We feel very strongly that we need to have this kind of regulation all over the world, Mandelker said. She noted that Japan and Australia are already regulating cryptocurrency trading."}
{"original": "The EU, I understand, is moving very quickly in that direction and we think it's very important that similar regulations are happening in a number of other countries."}
{"original": "Mandelker said she expects the issue to be discussed at meetings of the Group of 20 industrial economies. She recently told Congress that money laundering related to cryptocurrencies was an area of high focus for the Treasury Department."}
{"original": "The U.S. started regulating such transactions in 2013 and considers traders and administrators of cryptocurrencies as money transmitters who are required to have strong anti-money laundering and other controls to prevent their use for illegal purposes, she said. It has imposed fines for violations of those regulations. Closer scrutiny in the U.S. is a negative for those who want to use the digital currencies, wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Jaret Seiberg in a research note."}
{"original": "We continue to believe the long-term threat to crypto currency will be on national security grounds as the government is not going to want a currency that it cannot track, Seiberg noted. Consumer issues also drive toward a ban on their use."}
{"original": "Financial regulators in Asia have struggled to keep up with a regional boom in cryptocurrency investing."}
{"original": "Japan, the world's largest market for bitcoin trading, is the only major advanced economy with a licensing system for digital currency intermediaries such as exchanges and payment providers. It moved to impose order on the gray zone for such dealings after a major trading platform, Mt. Gox, filed for bankruptcy protection, after masses of Bitcoin went missing, worth millions of dollars at that time."}
{"original": "South Korea, which is also among the biggest bitcoin markets, has been looking for ways to regulate trading. In December its financial regulator ruled out using bitcoin for derivative products such as futures."}
{"original": "The government said it was focusing on curbing tax evasion, money laundering and other criminal activities through crypto trading, requiring banks to identify who the investors are and where their money comes from and ending use of anonymous accounts for such dealings."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump makes his second appearance before a joint session of Congress Tuesday night to deliver his first State of the Union address. It's expected that he will tout America's economic growth and take credit for the nearly 40 percent rise in the stock market since his election."}
{"original": "It's a big speech and an important speech, Mr. Trump said Monday. Well, I hope it's going to be good. It's going to -- we worked on it hard. Cover a lot of territory, including our great success with the markets and with the tax cut."}
{"original": "For a president who often complains that his successes are underreported, the unfiltered primetime address is a key opportunity to push his agenda."}
{"original": "Advisers say Mr. Trump will echo many of the business-friendly themes he spoke about last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland."}
{"original": "America is open for business and we are competitive once again, he said at the gathering."}
{"original": "Some of the other highlights ahead for Tuesday night include a promise of improved trade deals, a $1.7 trillion plan to revitalize infrastructure and a request to Congress for $25 billion to construct a border wall with Mexico. In exchange, he'll offer to grant a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants."}
{"original": "We're going to get something done, Mr. Trump said. We hope it's going to be bipartisan because the Republicans really don't have the votes to get it done in any other way so it has to be bipartisan."}
{"original": "One thing absent from the speech: the Russia investigation hanging over the White House."}
{"original": "CBS News asked White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders if Mr. Trump feels there's a need to address the probe."}

{"original": "Washington — Tax refunds will not be affected by the partial government shutdown, a top Trump administration official claimed in a briefing with reporters Monday. The IRS confirmed later in the day it will begin to process tax returns for refunds on Jan. 28."}
{"original": "For the time being, only 12 percent of the IRS workforce is on the job — without pay — and they are mainly focused on security and technology. The agency's shutdown plans have said it is not issuing refunds or even answering phone help lines during the shutdown. The IRS announced it will be recalling a significant portion of its workforce that is currently furloughed."}
{"original": "We are committed to ensuring that taxpayers receive their refunds notwithstanding the government shutdown, IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a statement. I appreciate the hard work of the employees and their commitment to the taxpayers during this period."}
{"original": "The question of whether tax refunds will be issued on time has loomed larger the longer the shutdown lingers. Now in week three, the partial government shutdown still appears to have no end in sight, with Democrats and the White House far apart."}
{"original": "Tax refunds will go out, Russell Vought, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, told a small group of reporters Monday, though he did not explain how the IRS would accomplish this without the vast majority of its paid staff. By the end of November 2018, the IRS had processed over 154 million tax returns."}
{"original": "Vought is essentially running OMB with OMB head Mick Mulvaney taking on the role of White House chief of staff. The OMB, the IRS said, has reviewed relevant law and concluded that the IRS can pay tax refunds in the event of a shutdown."}
{"original": "The Trump administration is looking to find workarounds as key federal agencies operate without funding in the new year. Last week in a wide-ranging press conference in the White House Rose Garden, President Trump confirmed he told Democrats and Republicans in a meeting the shutdown could last months or even years if needed — but he hopes it won't. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal workers, from Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents at airports, to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) personnel are going without pay."}
{"original": "Vice President Mike Pence told reporters in the same briefing Monday he thought progress has been made in conversations with Democrats — but that doesn't necessarily mean progress in negotiations. Representatives for the White House and Democrats and Republicans from Capitol Hill met at the White House Saturday and Sunday."}
{"original": "We think it was a productive session on both days, Pence told reporters. I said so on Saturday, the president said so yesterday. That does not mean to imply that we made progress in negotiations, but I think we gained better understanding of the issues, the crisis on our southern border, and a better understanding of the priorities on both sides of the aisle."}
{"original": "The White House is asking for $5.7 billion for border wall and other border security-related funding. Pence said they're waiting on Democrats to negotiate, although Democrats have said they don't want to fund the president's border wall."}
{"original": "The simple fact is, if we can sit down and agree that there is a crisis, then then plugging in the numbers into this process and reaching an agreement will not take very long, Pence said."}

Her mother, Shelly Bryan Parker wasn't as thrilled -- and her ire wasn't directed at the Oklahoma native, but instead at her state's scarce funding for new school resources and teachers' salaries."}
{"original": "Parker, a former high school math teacher, explained in an interview with CBS News why this issue is so personal on so many levels for her."}
{"original": "So many educators in my family, Parker said. They don't get paid enough. People don't want their taxes raised, but we're dumbing down our education."}
{"original": "Parker posted a pair of Facebook photos highlighting the issue of school funding and teachers' raises in Oklahoma, where teachers are protesting for a fifth day at the state's capitol Friday. One of the images show Marley with a smile from ear to ear holding the Look Away book. Another appears to show Shelton's handwritten name dated 1982 -- when The Voice judge would have been around 6 years old. The school's superintendent confirmed to CNN that Shelton attended Marley's school in his younger years."}

{"original": "Des Moines — Elizabeth Warren is taking a shot at primary opponent Michael Bloomberg over the 45-day extension he's received to file his personal financial disclosure form to the Federal Election Commission. That delay will keep Super Tuesday voters from knowing whether the former New York City mayor has serious conflicts of interest, Warren said in Des Moines on Sunday."}
{"original": "If he has entanglements with China, serious conflicts of interest, business interests in other parts of the world or with other corporations, when do we get to know about that? Not until after Super Tuesday, Warren said. That is not how democracy is supposed to work, and we need to shut that down."}
{"original": "Bloomberg, a billionaire whose estimated worth exceeds $50 billion, has bet big on Super Tuesday, March 3, when most of the states are slated to vote or caucus. He has spent eight figures in delegate-heavy Texas and California and over $1 million in every other one of the March 3rd states — except Warren's and Bernie Sanders' home states of Massachusetts and Vermont."}
{"original": "He will not be on the ballot on any of the first four states. Because Bloomberg will be allowed to delay handing over his financial disclosures to the Federal Election Committee until late March, Democratic voters in these states will head to the polls and caucuses without knowing just how much Bloomberg is worth and in which interests he currently has investments. He is not the first candidate to be granted an extension, but he is the only one who will not have made his disclosures before voting begins."}
{"original": "Since he entered the 2020 race, Warren has often used Bloomberg as a foil, pointing at his flood-the-airwaves strategy as an example of the corrupting influence of money in politics that she wants to root out. She has also long called for more transparency in federal elections, specifically saying that every candidate for federal office should be required to release their tax returns. She has also joked that Bloomberg decided to run because he fears she'll win and he would be subject to her wealth tax."}
{"original": "You may have heard there are some billionaires who don't like this plan, Warren said at an earlier town hall Sunday. Some have cried [...] Others ran for president, figured it was cheaper than paying a wealth tax."}
{"original": "For her part, Warren released her tax returns dating back to 2008. After Pete Buttigieg, who has released his tax returns going back to the same year, called on Warren to make public older records that include more of her private-sector legal work, she posted an additional compilation of the compensation she received for over three dozen individual cases."}

{"original": "The slide on Wall Street could damage public employee pension funds around the country, most of which haven't even recovered from the Great Recession, and the burden could end up falling on taxpayers."}
{"original": "Stocks have been tumbling in the first weeks of 2016, with the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 down nearly 9 percent since the start of the year."}
{"original": "If there's a quick rebound, the slump won't make much difference. If the tumble continues, it could be bad news for pensions. Somewhere down the line, states may have to either cut benefits -- which can be legally or politically difficult -- or pump more tax dollars into their pension funds to make sure retirees get what they were promised."}
{"original": "Pension funds for government employees in many places are already struggling to bring in enough money to cover future payouts. Data compiled by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that only four states -- Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Wisconsin -- had amassed funding for a bigger portion of their pension liabilities in 2013 than in 2007, a year before stocks fell dramatically."}
{"original": "The average state-run plan went from being 86 percent funded before the Great Recession to 72 percent in 2013, the last year for which data was available. Despite strong returns on Wall Street from 2009 through mid-2015, most states saw funding declines for a variety of reasons, including higher payouts because of longer lifespans and generous benefits that were promised during flush times."}
{"original": "States such as California, Illinois, Kentucky and New Jersey didn't come close to making the taxpayer contributions they are required to make to their pension funds."}
{"original": "Pension fund officials in states as varied as California and West Virginia said they are not worried about short-term market fluctuations because they are diversified, long-term investors."}
{"original": "For the most part, we are in it for the long haul, said Christine Radogno, the Republican state Senate leader in Illinois, which faces the nation's largest unfunded pension liability, at more than $100 billion, and is in a tough spot because the courts have ruled that employees' benefits can't be cut. We look at 30-year returns, and the market is always up and down."}
{"original": "Keith Brainard, research director at the National Association of State Budget Administrators, noted that market drops can be a good opportunity to buy low on stocks that will rise in value before long. These funds measure themselves in terms of their performance over decades rather than months, days and years, he said."}
{"original": "But some people who track government finance say even short-term returns are important."}
{"original": "They can say they're long-term investors, but they have fixed payments that they must meet come hell or high water, said Don Boyd, director of fiscal studies at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, part of the State University of New York. Illinois is very different than, say, a rich family creating a trust fund for a wayward son. While the family could reduce the son's payout when returns are low, there's little wiggle room for states to shrink payments to growing numbers of retirees, he said."}
{"original": "Boyd issued a report this week that found that from July through September of 2015, stock market losses led to a $268 billion increase in pension fund debt across the country, bringing the total to $1.7 trillion. He said he believes a strong end of the year on the stock market canceled out those losses, but the past few weeks erased the gains and then some."}
{"original": "Until the 1970s, pension funds were made up almost entirely of relatively safe investments such as bonds. Since then, it's become tougher to make big returns with bonds, so investment managers have turned to stocks, hedge funds, real estate and other holdings with the potential for larger gains but big losses, too."}
{"original": "CalPERS, the California public employee retirement fund that ranks as the nation's largest, now has more than half its funds in publicly traded stocks and nearly 10 percent in private equity. In New Jersey, U.S. stocks are 30 percent of the portfolio, the single largest type of investment."}
{"original": "American investors returned from the Memorial Day weekend unable to ignore any longer a problem that has been festering in Europe for weeks. That's the unstable political situation in Italy, where populist, anti-euro parties are ascendant and threatening yet another round of the eurozone debt crisis that first flared up in Greece in 2011."}
{"original": "Quick primer: Structural problems that have plagued the eurozone were never addressed amid the region's crushing sovereign indebtedness and painful unemployment. The European Central Bank papered over the problem starting in 2012, with a pledge to do whatever it takes to keep the monetary union together. To this point, that has meant trillions worth of bond buying."}
{"original": "But a long internal devaluation that has forced citizens in peripheral countries like Italy to suffer higher taxes, public spending cuts and economic malaise is now sparking electoral anger. The problem became acute on Sunday when Italian President Sergio Mattarella moved to block the formation of an anti-euro government."}
{"original": "That puts the country on track for a snap election, potentially as soon as July, and it's now seen as a referendum on whether Italy remains in the eurozone. Italian stocks have lost more than 12 percent over the last two weeks. And the 10-year Italian government bond yield has increased to more than 3 percent, a four-year high."}
{"original": "If all that wasn't enough, Spain (another too big to fail but heavily indebted eurozone country) is also suffering as Prime Minster Mariano Rajoy's leadership is under threat ahead of a confidence vote on Friday. His problem: a corruption scandal involving 29 individuals with ties to Rajoy's People's Party apparatus."}
{"original": "Why does any of this matter to American investors? Two big reasons."}
{"original": "The sell-off in U.S. stocks was led by the financial sector, which as a group lost 3.3 percent vs. a 1.2 percent loss for the S&P 500. The fear is that the weakness in Italian and Spanish sovereign bonds metastasizes and starts to pull down European banks that rely on these bonds for capital reserves."}
{"original": "As the 2011-2012 eurozone crisis demonstrated, the nightmare is a self-reinforcing downward spiral. Lower sovereign bond prices (and thus higher yields) weaken bank stocks and bonds, which results in a pullback in lending and capital market losses. That in turn undermines economic growth, which lowers tax revenues, further drops government bond prices and raises borrowing costs as politicians are forced to consider bailing out banks."}
{"original": "U.S.-based banks risk getting caught in the crossfire because of their European asset holdings."}
{"original": "The second big factor is the realization that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better, even if Wall Street rebounds in the near term, as Wednesday morning's stock index futures are indicating. If the European Central Bank intervenes now to quell fears, it will merely embolden the anti-establishment politicians in Italy and likely increase their support among voters in the upcoming election."}
{"original": "But if the ECB lets the situation worsen, it could grow beyond its ability to control, given that Italy's government is eight times the size of Greece's, but its bond market, on account of the country's deep indebtedness, is the world's third largest, after the U.S.'s and Japan's."}
{"original": "What will the ECB do? It was on track to taper its bond-buying program starting in July down to zero by January. That looks unlikely now. This weekend's G-7 meeting of global finance minsters could reveal what happens next."}
{"original": "Fewer than half of the IRS employees who have been recalled to work without pay during the government shutdown returned to their jobs as of Tuesday, congressional and government aides say."}
{"original": "The official start of the tax filing season is Monday, and the Trump administration had said that taxpayers owed refunds would receive them on time—despite a shutdown that entered its 35th day on Friday."}
{"original": "But about 14,000 recalled employees (out of the 26,000 who have been recalled) haven't reported to work, IRS officials told House committee staffers Thursday. Around 5,000 of them have sought permission under their union contract to be absent because of financial hardship. The remaining 9,000 couldn't be reached by IRS managers."}
{"original": "The roughly 12,000 employees who have returned to the job are working without pay."}
{"original": "The many employees staying off the job, some with managers' approval under their contract, makes the possibility of delayed tax refunds loom larger. Already the partial government shutdown and the complexities of a complicated new tax law have burdened an Internal Revenue Service that has been starved for funding for years."}
{"original": "About three-quarters of U.S. taxpayers receive annual refunds. Lower-income households, in particular, depend on refunds as their biggest cash infusion of the year."}
{"original": "Beyond refunds, no audits of tax returns are being done because the IRS auditors all remain furloughed. That's a double-edged problem: A lack of inspections could invite cheating, and the money normally captured by audits isn't flowing to the national coffers."}
{"original": "The decline in audits has been an ongoing problem at the IRS for many years, says Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Reducing them even further will only encourage more people to game the tax system — and that's bad for all of us who do pay the taxes we owe."}
{"original": "The administration had planned to eventually send about 46,000 furloughed IRS employees back to work — nearly 60 percent of the IRS workforce."}
{"original": "The recalled employees who haven't reported for work include staffers in IRS processing centers in Ogden, Utah; Kansas City, Missouri; Fresno, California; and Austin, Texas, according to union officials."}
{"original": "The IRS employees' union contract allows them to be absent from work if they experience hardship during a shutdown, and they don't have to use sick days to do so. Managers must approve hardship exceptions, though."}
{"original": "Union officials say they don't support employees staying away as a form of protest but they do support workers claiming the exception for true financial hardship."}
{"original": "Jaime Doxey, who's 43, has worked for eight years in the Ogden center, answering taxpayers' questions. She was furloughed and then recalled last week, so she is working without pay for now. Some co-workers, with a single income and children to support, for example, are claiming the hardship exemption. Others have taken second jobs."}
{"original": "Doxey's husband works in the private sector, putting her in a less needy category than others, she says. They have a married son and a daughter in college."}
{"original": "I just want to be back at work with pay, Doxey said by phone."}
{"original": "If she had to go an additional three weeks without pay, she said, I couldn't afford to put gas in my car, and might have to invoke the hardship provision."}
{"original": "Rampant speculation and a virtual gold rush of so-called ICOs -- or initial coin offerings -- have U.S. securities regulators issuing a chorus of warnings about the dangers of investing in cryptocurrencies."}
{"original": "Investors should go beyond the headlines and hype to understand the risks associated with investments in cryptocurrencies, said Joseph P. Borg, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) and director of the Alabama Securities Commission on Thursday. Cryptocurrencies and investments tied to them are high-risk products with an unproven track record and high price volatility."}
{"original": "Investor interest in the cryptocurrency market is understandable."}
{"original": "Even though the U.S. stock market is rising rapidly, the Standard & Poor's 500 index's 20-plus percent gain in 2017 pales in comparison to how the major cryptocurrencies performed last year. Bitcoin, for instance, now sells for roughly $15,000 -- some 15 times its year-ago value. Litecoin is worth nearly 60 times its year-ago value, and ethereum's ether has had a similar run-up."}
{"original": "Yet these currencies have also suffered dizzying drops. One day last November, bitcoin's value dropped 20 percent in less than two hours, and its value remains some 30 percent below the November highs. Some say this rise is proof of a bubble, and its pop is certain to decimate investors."}
{"original": "However, bubble or no, investors have a wide array of reasons to be skeptical about investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Specifically:"}
{"original": "Although the people who mine and bank cryptocurrencies maintain they have nearly unbreakable security, in numerous instances their vaults have been breached. Indeed, Fortune magazine maintains that cryptocurrencies are far more likely to be stolen than real currency. Hacking took down a South Korean bitcoin exchange, swiped $64 million from a Slovenian bitcoin mine and has caused some to question the viability of some of the more recent entrants into the cryptocurrency market."}
{"original": "Investors have learned the hard way that there is generally no recourse if your cryptocurrency disappears."}
{"original": "When you buy euros or dollars, you can hold them in your hand -- inspect them, use a special light to make sure they're legitimate. Cryptocurrencies are traded in cyberspace, and few consumers are sophisticated enough to discern whether they're real or fake."}
{"original": "That's a nearly irresistible draw to crooks, who regulators fear are already nipping around the edges of the market, convincing gullible consumers to invest in nonexistent currencies. Indeed, the Texas State Securities Board on Thursday asked for an emergency cease-and-desist order against a British company called BitConnect, which is soliciting investors with promises of massive monthly returns. That's because it hasn't registered with state securities regulators, nor even provided an office address."}
{"original": "Regulators shut down a similar Dubai-based cryptocurrency operation in December."}
{"original": "What makes most currencies valuable is investor faith in what backs them. The U.S. dollar, for instance, is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which -- if all else fails -- has the ability to tax its citizens to pay its debts. Cryptocurrencies have no such government backing, and when they're deposited in vaults, they're also not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp."}
{"original": "If investors suddenly lose faith in the ability of bitcoin's hierarchy to control the amount of currency issued or keep it safe, the value could drop to nothing overnight."}
{"original": "Generally speaking, you accumulate money to buy things. However, the number things you can buy with cryptocurrencies is severely limited. Bitcoin, the oldest and best-established of these currencies, brags that 100,000 merchants accept it as a form of payment."}
{"original": "But about 36 percent of those are other tech companies -- websites, hosting registrars and VPN services. If you pull those out, you have less than 70,000 merchants willing to accept bitcoin, worldwide. Finding one of those merchants isn't very hard, but it's not as easy as, say, finding a merchant that will accept your Visa card, which is good at roughly 29 million establishments. And can get you real cash at 2.3 million automated teller machines."}
{"original": "Zacks Investment Research said the biggest risk for cryptocurrencies are governments themselves. Why? They could simply outlaw cryptocurrencies, and they might if the currencies ever become a threat to managing monetary policy."}
{"original": "To clarify, governments (normally through central banks) encourage -- or slow -- economic growth by managing their money supply. When the U.S. was in the depths of recession, the Federal Reserve pumped money into the financial markets to encourage spending, and thus, economic growth. Because cryptocurrencies circumvent this management, they could impair countries' ability to manage their economic health."}
{"original": "Crytocurrencies are currently a relative blip in the world currency markets, accounting for less than 1 percent of the world's cash. Thus, they have yet to create any significant risk to a major financial system. However, if they did, governments have the right to make the currency illegal and force users and investors underground."}
{"original": "Few governments have so far acted to restrict -- or outlaw -- cryptocurrencies, but they could. China, in fact, already has."}
{"original": "If you choose to invest in these products, please ask questions and demand clear answers, Securities and Exchange Commissioner Jay Clayton recently urged investors."}
{"original": "Emphasizing that you could lose everything you put into cryptocurrencies, NASAA's Borg added that this market is not for the faint of heart."}
{"original": "Multilevel marketer LuLaRoe, which is battling two federal lawsuits and complaints about the quality of its brightly colored leggings and other fashions, is proving to be a tough sell for the company's 77,491 independent consultants."}
{"original": "According to internal LuLaRoe data shared with CBS MoneyWatch by two sources, more than 70 percent, or 55,571 LuLaRoe representatives, sold less than $5,000 worth of retail goods in February. About 3,700, or less than 5 percent, reported more than $10,000 in sales. In addition, 6,579, or 8 percent of representatives, sold nothing and ordered nothing."}
{"original": "What we find over and over and over is that a negligible amount of retail sales are actually happening, said Tracy Coenen, a forensic accountant and critic of the multilevel marketing (MLM) industry, who has raised questions about LuLaRoe's business practices. You don't know if they profited, she said, or if these people [at LuLaRoe] put all of their so-called profits back into buying more inventory, which is what is encouraged."}
{"original": "The sources' information doesn't indicate how many consultants are profitable, and a company spokesman declined to address the issue. Current and former LuLaRoe representatives have told CBS MoneyWatch it would be difficult to earn a return on $5,000 in sales and that $10,000 in revenue isn't necessarily a sure-fire profit either, given operating expenses, inventory and taxes. They declined to be identified by name out of fear of reprisals by the company."}
{"original": "One area where LuLaRoe has excelled is recruiting new consultants. As of July 2016, the company had about 26,000 consultants, indicating their ranks have nearly tripled in less than a year. That development is proving to be problematic for some consultants, who say they're losing sales to their new rivals."}
{"original": "One consultant told CBS MoneyWatch her weekly sales have fallen from between 35 to 40 items to about 5 to 10 items. Such cannibalization is common at MLMs."}
{"original": "Unlike traditional franchising or even traditional single-level direct selling, the MLM model is an all-against-all competition, said William Keep, dean of the College of New Jersey's College of Business, in an email. That will likely result in either a decrease in the selling price to nondistributor customers (and, therefore lower margin for the distributor), or efforts by the company to limit competition (e.g., limit sales on eBay, use only company websites, etc.), or both."}
{"original": "LuLaRoe declined to address the data obtained by CBS MoneyWatch, but it defended its business practices. A source close to the company argued that one month's data doesn't give a complete picture of its financial performance and that demand from consultants can fluctuate."}
{"original": "LuLaRoe provides our Independent Retailers with the freedom and flexibility to run a business on their own terms and strengthen their families in the process, LuLaRoe said in a statement. The strong success of our business model is why the vast majority of Independent Retailers who have joined our community continue to sell LuLaRoe products, and why many more are in line to become new Independent Retailers."}
{"original": "Critics of MLMs such as Amway, Herbalife (HLF) and Mary Kay Cosmetics have argued for years that most people don't turn a profit on the investment opportunities that are being sold, which the industry has repeatedly denied. According to the Direct Selling Association, a trade group, more than 20 million people were involved in the industry in 2015 with estimated retail sales of $36.12 billion."}
{"original": "LuLaRoe, founded at a kitchen table in 2012, is facing lawsuits for collecting sales tax in states that don't charge such a levy for sales of clothing and for allegedly stealing a lion design used on one of its leggings. The Corona, California-based company has acknowledged the sales tax problem, which it blamed on a former vendor, but it hasn't commented on the infringement case."}
{"original": "Founder Deanne Stidham named the company after her three oldest grandchildren, Lucy, Lola, and Munroe. Her husband, Mark Stidham, is LuLaRoe CEO."}
{"original": "Thanks to growth fueled by social media, LuLaRoe sales have soared 600 percent to around $1 billion as of 2016, according to details released as part of the suit regarding its tax practices. That would make the privately held firm one of the country's largest MLMs. LuLaRoe has declined to comment on the figures in the suit."}
{"original": "An MLM is not comparable to any other business, said Robert FitzPatrick, president of Pyramid Scheme Alert, a critic of the industry, in an email. It's not retail-based. It's not based on consumer demand. LuLaroe competitors aren't department stores but rather only other MLMs. The heart and soul of this business are its pay plan and the masses of people enticed by the 'endless chain' income promise, which is illusory on its face."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON — A prestigious scientific panel is recommending that states significantly lower their drunken driving thresholds as part of a blueprint to eliminate the entirely preventable 10,000 alcohol-impaired driving deaths in the United States each year."}
{"original": "The U.S. government-commissioned, 489-page report by a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released Wednesday throws the weight of the scientific body behind lowering the blood-alcohol concentration threshold from 0.08 to 0.05. All states have 0.08 thresholds. A Utah law passed last year that lowers the state's threshold to 0.05 doesn't go into effect until Dec. 30."}
{"original": "The amount of alcohol required to reach 0.05 would depend on several factors, including the person's size and whether the person has recently eaten. A 150-pound man might be over the 0.05 limit after two beers, while a 120-pound woman could exceed it after a single drink, according to the American Beverage Institute, a national restaurant group."}
{"original": "The panel also recommended that states significantly increase alcohol taxes and make alcohol less conveniently available, including reducing the hours and days alcohol is sold in stores, bars and restaurants. Research suggests a doubling of alcohol taxes could lead to an 11 percent reduction in traffic crash deaths, the report said."}
{"original": "It also calls for cracking down on sales to people under 21 or who are already intoxicated to discourage binge drinking, and putting limits on alcohol marketing while funding anti-alcohol campaigns similar to those against smoking."}
{"original": "All the proposals are likely to draw fierce opposition from the alcohol and restaurant industries. The beverage institute took out full-page newspaper ads opposing Utah's new law that featured a fake mugshot under a large headline reading, Utah: Come for vacation, leave on probation."}
{"original": "The recommendations in the academies' report would do nothing to deter repeat offenders and high BAC drivers, who represent the vast majority of alcohol-impaired driving deaths, the Distilled Spirits Council said in a statement. The council said it also doesn't support the report's recommendations for tax increases and advertising bans, which will have little or no impact on traffic safety."}
{"original": "The report points out that alcohol-impaired driving remains the deadliest and costliest danger on U.S. roads, accounting for 28 percent of traffic deaths. Each day, 29 people in the U.S. die in alcohol-related crashes and many more are injured. Forty percent of those killed are people other than the drunken driver."}
{"original": "Rural areas are disproportionately affected. In 2015, 48 percent of drunken driving fatalities occurred in rural areas."}
{"original": "The report says many strategies have been effective to prevent drunken driving, but a coordinated multilevel approach across multiple sectors will be required to accelerate change."}
{"original": "The problem isn't intractable, the report said."}
{"original": "From the early 1980s to the early 2000s, there was significant progress as the result of an increase in the drinking age to 21, decreases in the blood-alcohol threshold, and other measures, the report said. But since then, progress has stagnated and recently has begun to reverse."}
{"original": "Action to address drunken driving can't wait for the advent of self-driving cars immune to the lures of a cold beer or a fine wine — it will take too long for autonomous vehicles to replace all the human-driven machines on the road, said the panel's chairman, Steven Teutsch, a senior fellow for health policy and economics at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles."}
{"original": "In the meantime, we have 10,000 people a year dying and we ought to do something about it, he said."}
{"original": "The report cites studies that show the United States lags behind other high-income countries in preventing drunken driving fatalities. More than 100 countries have adopted the 0.05 threshold lower. In Europe, the share of traffic deaths attributable to drunken driving was reduced by more than half within 10 years after the standard was dropped, the National Transportation Safety Board said in 2013. The safety board has also recommended the 0.05 threshold."}
{"original": "Alcoholic beverages have changed significantly over the past 25 years. They are more affordable, of far greater variety, and more widely advertised and promoted than in earlier periods, the report said. The lack of consistency in serving sizes and the combination of alcohol with caffeine and energy drinks make it harder for drinkers to estimate their level of impairment."}
{"original": "The report was commissioned by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which asked the academies to determine which strategies for reducing drunken driving have been proven effective."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump and his economic advisers focus on trade deficits when it comes to China, and Mr. Trump has said a trade war would be easy to win. But trade relationships — and their impacts — are far more complex."}
{"original": "Chinese data released overnight show the trade gap between the world's two largest economies was at a record high in 2018, and it may signal a broader global economic slowdown, according to economists. An alarming point in the latest Chinese trade data was a slowdown in the country's exports in December, shrinking by 4.5 percent to $221.2 billion, while imports declined 7.2 percent to $164.2 billion."}
{"original": "That led global stock markets to slide in Monday trading as fears mounted that global growth is slowing. In the U.S., the S&P 500 lost 0.5 percent, and the Dow industrials fell 0.4 percent."}
{"original": "Here's a rundown on what the latest numbers show."}
{"original": "China's 2018 trade surplus with the U.S. surged to a record $323.3 billion. That means the U.S. purchased that much more in goods and services from China than it shipped to the country."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump's trade war with Beijing may be starting to take a toll both at home and in China, even though the White House is holding back on additional tariff measures until March while the two sides try to negotiate a trade deal. U.S. and Chinese officials ended a three-day negotiating session last week with no sign of agreements or word on what their next step would be."}
{"original": "But penalties of up to 25 percent already imposed on billions of dollars of each other's goods remain in place, raising the cost for American and Chinese buyers of soybeans, medical equipment and consumer goods, from purses and bicycles to furniture and tech gear."}
{"original": "Tariffs are taxes paid by companies, not countries, to import goods and services. Yet tariffs are just one of the many factors in China's slowing growth, economists at Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients. They estimate a cooler Chinese economy could cut about 0.2 percentage points off global GDP in 2019 compared to the 2018 pace. Other experts have pointed to a potential hit to the U.S. economy from the current partial government shutdown."}
{"original": "Admittedly, U.S. tariffs may have played a small part in the sharp fall in China's export growth last month, the Capital Economics economists wrote. But growth in exports to the rest of the world also slowed significantly, indicating that softer demand was the main culprit, and that a trade truce with the U.S. would be no guarantee of a strong recovery."}
{"original": "The trade figures were another sign that growth in the global economy is slowing too, weighing on stocks, the Capital Economics wrote. It expects economies in Europe and the booming U.S. to slip this year."}
{"original": "What does it mean for the U.S.?"}
{"original": "In the U.S., consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of economic activity. American households also save far less than their counterparts in Europe and Asia. The personal savings rate among Americans has hovered at less than 5 percent for years as their spending has boomed, according to the Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis."}
{"original": "An overwhelming majority of economists point to the high consumption levels and low savings rates in the U.S. as a major determinant of large U.S. trade deficits in general, and China in particular, Michelle Casario, an associate professor at Villanova University, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch."}
{"original": "Tax cuts passed signed into law in late 2017 by Mr. Trump likely gave the U.S. economy a quick lift last year by boosting disposable income. That means Americans are spending even more, while the tax cuts are ballooning the U.S. budget deficit. That could have consequences down the line as the pace of spending will likely slow as the impact of the tax cuts fades."}
{"original": "The Trump tax cuts not only increased the budget deficit, they also increased disposable income, at least for now, which increases consumption, Casario said. The irony here is that the tax cuts indirectly increased the trade deficit, which has been at the center of Trump's policy agenda."}
{"original": "Unless the large federal budget deficit shrinks and the low savings rate rises, the U.S. will continue to experience the world's largest trade deficit, Casario said. Tariffs do not reduce trade deficits, they simply reduce (or have the potential to reduce) trade flows. The asymmetries in trade will persist."}
{"original": "Year-end stockpiling may also be a factor"}
{"original": "Another reason for the trade deficit's jump last year is that U.S. firms may have hiked their imports of Chinese goods in reaction to Mr. Trump's threat to increase tariffs before he postponed them until March in a December decision."}
{"original": "Some companies have shifted production of goods bound for the U.S. from China to avoid U.S. tariffs. Others are lining up non-Chinese suppliers of industrial components and may have rushed to get some in hand before year-end."}
{"original": "In anticipation of tariffs, U.S. firms increased their orders from China to avoid the higher costs of imports, Villanova's Casario said. This may continue as U.S. businesses are concerned that Trump will increase the tariffs on the most recent $200 billion from 10 percent to 25 percent, and/or levy tariffs on an additional $250 billion."}
{"original": "At the same time, Chinese leaders are trying to reduce the country's economic reliance on trade and stoke self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumer spending. But their plans call for keeping exports stable to avoid politically dangerous job losses."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump could use the latest trade deficit report as ammunition to boost tariff rates or add new ones after the March 1 truce deadline, Casario said."}
{"original": "As China's growth slows, it's investing less in the U.S."}
{"original": "Chinese direct investment in the U.S. plummeted to $4.8 billion last year after a steep decline in 2017 to $29 billion, itself a sharp drop from a record-high $46 billion in 2016, a report released over the weekend from Rhodium Group shows."}
{"original": "Past free-trade agreements gave foreign companies incentive to invest in the U.S., typically in manufacturing and in startup companies. That created more U.S. jobs. But imposing tariffs can make it difficult for a country and its companies to invest in the U.S."}
{"original": "Policies such as how the U.S. uses the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., known as CFIUS, to more tightly examine transactions with Chinese companies pushed abandoned deals to an all-time high, the Rhodium report said."}
{"original": "On top of that, it said, trade barriers and a generally more confrontational stance toward China have created tremendous uncertainty for Chinese companies in the U.S., dampening investor appetite and increasing the risk perception of U.S. sellers."}
{"original": "The Associated Press contributed to this report."}
{"original": "The Internal Revenue Service wasn't just letting calls go unanswered last tax season, the agency was also auditing fewer tax returns: 22 percent less than five years earlier."}
{"original": "That's according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank that analyzes the impact of federal and state government policies."}
{"original": "Because of budget cuts that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen has blasted as penny wise but pound foolish, the government's tax-collection arm no longer has the manpower to conduct as many audits of high-income taxpayers and businesses as in years past, the center found."}
{"original": "In 2010, the IRS audited 1.2 million taxpayers, or 1.1 percent of individual returns, a count that declined by more than 350,000, or 0.8 percent in 2015, the lowest level in a decade, the center said in an update published earlier this month. Given the agency's funding level is $900 million lower in fiscal 2016 versus five years earlier, there's little reason to believe the trend won't continue."}
{"original": "And while some tax payers may breath easier knowing the odds of having the tax collector at their door has lessened, others might be annoyed that the reduced enforcement means some are getting away with cheating Uncle Sam."}
{"original": "Audits recovered about $30 billion, or 30 percent, less in the past five years than in the prior five years, the center said, while citing Treasury estimates that every additional $1 invested in IRS tax enforcement yields $4 in increased revenue. Or, as IRS Commissioner John Koskinen summarized, Essentially, the government is losing billions to achieve budget savings of a few hundred million dollars."}
{"original": "The agency has been operating in an extremely difficult budget environment for several years, Koskinen said in written testimony submitted Thursday to a House panel."}
{"original": "The IRS is not collecting about $6 billion a year in money owed, due to the agency's staffing shortages, the commissioner said in a March 24 speech to the National Press Club:"}
{"original": "These staffing losses have translated into a steady decline in the number of individual audits over the past six years. Last year, in fact, we completed the fewest audits in a decade. Plus, our audit coverage rate in 2015 was the lowest since 2004. That trend line of fewer audits will continue this year."}
{"original": "The Treasury Department issued a public service Tuesday warning taxpayers about phone scammers who claim to be IRS agents."}
{"original": "Last year, CBS News correspondent Chip Reid broke the story of the biggest phone fraud in IRS history. Since then, the number of people contacted by the scammers has almost tripled to almost a million people."}
{"original": "They're just ruthless criminals and they really don't care about people, they don't care about anything other than trying to intimidate you into paying them money, said Tim Camus, deputy inspector general of the department, which oversees the IRS."}
{"original": "North Carolina Pastor Al Cadenhead said last year he was so scared he couldn't think straight."}
{"original": "It started with a threatening call saying, Don't disregard this message... as delay in calling us back may end up in legal matter for you."}
{"original": "This woman gave me her name and her badge number said that she was informing me that they were filing a warrant for my arrest. For tax fraud, Cadenhead said."}
{"original": "He did not believe he had done anything wrong, but the stakes were too high."}
{"original": "So over the next seven hours, he made multiple withdrawals from his bank and sent the money to his IRS impersonators with pre-paid debit cards - a total of $16,000."}
{"original": "Cadenhead is far from alone. In March of last year about 366,000 people had been called by the scammers; now, the number's exploded to more than 900,000."}
{"original": "The number of victims who lost money has gone from 3,000 to more than 5,000, and the total amount of money stolen has grown from $15 million to more than $26 million."}
{"original": "According to Camus, the scam started in India, but it's so profitable it has spread to copycats all over the world. The victims come from all walks of life."}
{"original": "We've had doctors, engineers, lawyers fall for this scam, Camus said. The tipoff is, if you don't pay immediately, you're going to jail. That is the tip off. The IRS would never make a telephone call like that."}
{"original": "So if you do get such a call - and the scammers may call multiple times -- Camus said you should just hang up."}

{"original": "Behind Joe Biden's search for a running mate 02:04 More Democratic candidates jumped into the presidential race in 2019 than America has seen since the inception of the modern primary system. Here's a look at all the Democrats who campaigned for a chance to take on President Trump in November 2020."}
{"original": "Eric Swalwell Biography Although he was born in Iowa in 1980, Swalwell moved with his family to attend middle school and high school in California. He was recruited to play soccer for North Carolina's Campbell University. After suffering an injury, however, he transferred to the University of Maryland. After completing his undergraduate studies, Swalwell earned his J.D. from the University of Maryland and was a congressional intern for former California Rep. Ellen Tauscher. In 2012, while a council member in Dublin City, in California's Alameda County, Swalwell mounted a primary challenge against fellow Democrat and 20-term incumbent Pete Stark in the state's 15th Congressional District, located in the outer suburbs of San Francisco. Although Stark bested him in the primary election, Swalwell beat the incumbent in the general election, which he qualified for because of California's top two primary system. Swalwell says he's running for president 01:40 Since he was sworn-in in 2013, Swalwell has won reelection three times. Although he has been a rank-and-file member of the House Democratic caucus during his congressional tenure, he has raised his profile during the Trump administration as a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, frequently rebuking the president in cable news appearances."}
{"original": "On the Intelligence Committee, Swalwell has also strongly defended special counsel Robert Mueller's now-concluded investigation and voiced his concerns about the Trump campaign's contacts with people affiliated with the Russian government, including the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials and a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton during the summer of 2016. Issues Swalwell will look to make gun safety reform an integral part of his presidential campaign. He has been strongly critical of the National Rifle Association's (NRA) sway in Congress and has repeatedly lambasted Republicans for not supporting gun control measures. He is hosting a town hall on gun control in Florida Tuesday alongside survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School massacre, in which 17 students and staff members were killed by a gunman. Last week, the California Democrat shared a voicemail his office received in which an individual is heard making a death threat against him because of his stance on gun rights. We're going to war. And you're going to be the first motherf***ing casualty, the person in the voicemail posted by Swalwell on Twitter is heard saying. In his post, Swalwell wrote, I'm not afraid of this guy. I'm not afraid of the NRA. I'm not afraid. No fear. #EndGunViolence."}
{"original": "Controversy While Swalwell has not been embroiled in any major scandal or controversy during his tenure in Congress, the California Democrat will surely face criticism from Mr. Trump and Republicans on the campaign trail, especially if he secures the party's nomination, because of his staunch defense of the Mueller probe. What Trump says The president has yet to tweet about Swalwell, but his 2020 campaign has strongly criticized the congressman since the release of the Justice Department's summary of the Mueller report. In a memorandum, Tim Murtaugh, the director of communications of the president's campaign, urged television news outlets to challenge Swalwell and other prominent Democrats who said there was evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow."}
{"original": "Tim Ryan Biography Ryan was born and raised in northeastern Ohio in 1973. He played football in high school and was recruited to play for Youngstown State University. Because of a knee injury, however, he transferred to Bowling Green State University, near Toledo. After graduating from college, Ryan earned a J.D. from the University of New Hampshire and worked in the office of longtime Ohio Congressman James Traficant, who was expelled from the House after being convicted of numerous counts of tax evasion, bribery and racketeering. At age 26, Ryan was elected to Ohio's state senate. When his old boss Tradicant became embroiled in scandal, Ryan ran an underdog campaign to fill his seat and won. At 29, he was the youngest member of Congress when he was sworn in 2003. Although he has served eight terms in the House, Ryan gained notoriety following Mr. Trump's unexpected election in November 2016. Citing Democrats' loss of Midwestern states during the election -- as well as the lack of youth in the party's leadership -- Ryan launched an unsuccessful bid to replace Nancy Pelosi, then House Minority Leader. After Democrats retook control of the House during the 2018 November midterm elections, the Ohio lawmaker again called for someone to replace Pelosi.

But Ryan has also been supportive of progressive proposals like Medicare for all.

Messam's parents immigrated to South Florida from Jamaica. His father worked as a laborer in the sugar cane fields of the Florida Glades after coming to the United States, and his mother would cook to feed the migrant workers. Messam earned a full football scholarship to Florida State University, where he started at wide receiver and was a member of the 1993 National Championship Team under legendary coach Bobby Bowden. He would go on to build one of the fastest-growing, minority-owned construction businesses in the country. Wayne married his college sweetheart and business partner, Angela, more than 20 years ago. They have three children, Wayne II, and twin daughters, Kayla and Kyla. Issues While lacking name recognition outside Florida, Messam told CNN that under his leadership, the city of Miramar has passed living wage legislation and has made great strides recovering from Hurricane Irma. He has also filed a lawsuit against the state so local mayors can advocate for gun control in their cities.

{"original": "Beto O'Rourke Beto O'Rourke joins the 2020 presidential rac... 02:39 Biography O'Rourke was born and raised in the Texas border city of El Paso. Although his legal first name is Robert, he has been known as Beto, the nickname Spanish-speaking communities give names that end in berto, like Roberto and Alberto, since childhood. He was an avid musician as a teenager and was part of various rock bands, including the El Paso-based punk group Foss after graduating from Columbia University in New York in 1995. O'Rouke's music career, however, was short-lived and he spent several years working in start-up companies and civic groups when he returned to El Paso from New York City. After working on several local political campaigns, O'Rourke ran for the El Paso City Council in 2005 and defeated a two-term incumbent. He served two terms in the council and spearheaded a controversial effort to revamp the city's downtown. In 2012, O'Rourke, who speaks fluent Spanish, announced his candidacy for the Democratic primary in the race to represent Texas 16th Congressional District, a Latino-majority district encompassing El Paso and the surrounding communities. He managed to topple eight-term incumbent Silvestre Reyes in the primary and defeated his Republican challenger in a landslide general election victory. While in Congress, the Texas Democrat compiled a moderate voting record during his three terms, where he served on the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs committees."}
{"original": "On immigration, O'Rourke has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and but has shifted to a more progressive stance on the issue recently. In 2014, he called President Obama's executive action creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation noble but hard to stomach because he believed it bypassed Congress. He also backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan's leadership challenge against then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in 2016. O'Rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust Cruz in 2018. His robust Senate bid in Texas -- along with his Obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. Although he failed to unseat Cruz, O'Rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in Texas -- including the state's large and growing Latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. No Democrat had come that close to winning a Senate race in Texas since 1988. Despite the loss, O'Rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. Although he told 60 Minutes shortly before the election that he was completely ruling out running for president for 2020, O'Rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea. Issues In his six years in Congress, O'Rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, LGBT rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights."}
{"original": "He often called for improvements to the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. During and after his senate campaign, O'Rourke made immigration a central issue. He has routinely denounced the White House for its hardline immigration agenda, including the discontinued zero tolerance policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families near the U.S.-Mexico border. He also strongly supports legislation to put young undocumented immigrants, known as DREAMers, on a pathway to U.S. citizenship. During a fiery speech in El Paso last month where he drew sharp contrasts with President Trump's stringent policies and tough rhetoric on immigration, O'Rourke condemned Mr. Turmp's long-promised wall along the southwestern border. We know that walls do not save lives. Walls end lives, he said in a border rally that competed with one of Mr. Trump's nearby rallies. In the last 10 years, more than 4,000 children women and men have died trying to come to this country to work jobs that no one will take, to be with a family member, to flee horrific violence, brutality and death. Controversy In addition to the scrutiny O'Rourke will likely face for launching a presidential campaign a few months after losing a Senate race, the Texas Democrat can expect to be questioned by political rivals about his tenure in Congress and personal life. Although he had a generally liberal voting record in Congress, O'Rourke's progressive bona fides may come under scrutiny from the left."}
{"original": "In the House, he was a member of the pro-business New Democrat Coalition and received donations from the oil industry, which will likely not bode well with progressives who are pressuring the Democratic Party to support more audacious efforts, like the Green New Deal, to mitigate climate change.

{"original": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduces 2020 policy test with Green New Deal Some candidness may also follow the lead of O'Rourke previous political opponents and raise the issue of his arrest in the 1990s. In 1998, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated, but the charges were dismissed after he participated in a DWI program the following year. O'Rourke has apologized for the incident, but he was criticized last year for claiming he did not try to leave the scene after hitting a truck and the Houston Chronicle reporting that witnesses told police he had attempted to leave the scene. What Trump says Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked the speculation around an O'Rourke presidential campaign to challenge him in 2020, pointing to the Texas Democrat's unsuccessful Senate bid. I thought you were supposed to win before you run for president, Mr. Trump told reporters in December. When the two men held dueling rallies to tout completely different immigration agendas last month, the president bragged his event drew a larger crowd and ridiculed O'Rourke's great defeat in November."}

Hickenlooper followed an unusual route into politics, beginning his professional life as a geologist with Buckhorn Petroleum in the 1980s. But the oil bust in the mid-'80s cost him his job in 1986. There were no jobs to be had in the oil industry, so Hickenlooper went into the brewpub business, opening the Wynkoop Brewing Co. The brewery with 15 brewpubs and restaurants, was a success, and it made him a millionaire. In 2003, Hickenlooper ran for Mayor of Denver, in his first ever campaign. Considered a bit of a dark horse candidate who never ran a negative ad, he shocked many and won in a landslide. In 2010, Hickenlooper became the first Denver Mayor elected Governor in 120 years.

He has not expressed support for a single-payer health system. Hickenlooper has opposed a number of Trump administration policies, including plans to scale back on federal coal emission restrictions, and has been generally critical of the president's approach to business.

Inslee represented the state's 4th Congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994. During the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) director under President Clinton. Inslee ran for Congress again in 1998 and defeated a Republican incumbent in Washington's 1st Congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. During his congressional tenure, the Washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the American economy's reliance on fossil fuels. Inslee left Congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in Washington, defeating the state's Republican attorney general in the general election. After winning reelection in November 2016 -- the same time Mr. Trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- Inslee declared that Washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values."}
{"original": "During his second term, Inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, has challenged some of the Trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. In a campaign video focused on climate change, Inslee announced his White House bid on March 1. Issues Inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a Chinese hoax. He has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in Congress. With most 2020 Democrats throwing their support for the audacious Green New Deal proposal introduced by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among Democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. Inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. Controversy Inslee's tenures in Congress and as Washington's governor have largely been scandal-free."}
{"original": "However, some of his decisions as governor, including his backing of a controversial union legislation, have garnered opposition in Washington. What Trump says Mr. Trump has yet to tweet about Inslee or his presidential aspirations. In February 2018, however, the Washington governor confronted the president in the White House about his idea to arm teachers in the wake of multiple deadly school shootings. I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. And let's just take that off the table and move forward, Inslee told the president during a meeting with other governors in the East Room. Although he initially pushed back by saying he supported arming certain teachers, Mr. Trump listened with his arms crossed while Inslee pleaded for him to drop the idea and embrace other gun control measure"}
{"original": "Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders on 2020: We're going to win 04:49 Biography Although he has spent most of his adult life in Vermont, Bernie Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, in 1941, as part of a religiously observant Jewish family. He attended one year at Brooklyn College before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating in 1964. At the University of Chicago, Sanders began his long career of political activism as a member of the university's chapters of the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He was also an active member of the antiwar movement, and applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. He moved to Vermont in 1968. Sanders ran for governor of Vermont unsuccessfully in 1972 and 1976, and for senator in 1972 and 1974, as part of the independent Liberty Union Party. He was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1980 as an independent, and served as mayor until 1989. He was elected to the House of Representatives as an independent in 1990, where he served until he was elected to the Senate in 2006. Although technically still an independent, he caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and is seen as a leader of the party's resurgent left wing. Sanders unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. However, he inspired a grassroots movement with his focus on economic inequality and use of primarily small-dollar donations to fund his campaign."}
{"original": "His campaign exceeded expectations and won a number of major contests against eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Since the 2016 campaign, some of Sanders' more radical ideas have been embraced by many in the mainstream of the Democratic Party, such as his Medicare-for-All proposal. Issues Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist, and his defining issue is economic inequality. Sanders spent much of his presidential campaign railing against millionaires and billionaires who continue to profit as the inequality gap increases. Sanders is a longtime supporter of a universal health care system, and introduced the Medicare-for-All bill with 15 other senators in 2017. He also supports raising the minimum wage and making public colleges and universities tuition-free. Sanders is a longtime opponent of trade deals, claiming that they hurt they American worker. He opposed NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership, trade deals which President Trump renegotiated or withdrew from. Sanders opposed the U.S. war in Iraq, and remains a critic of American military interventionism. Controversy More than two dozen of Sanders' 2016 campaign staffers wrote a letter to the senator at the end of December seeking a meeting to discuss problems of sexual harassment during the campaign. A New York Times story in early January reported several incidences of sexual misconduct by staffers during the campaign, for which Sanders apologized. Politico also reported in early January that his former Iowa campaign manager, Robert Becker, had been named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement with two former employees."}
{"original": "Sanders apologized to the two women who had settled with Becker, and said that he was not aware of the settlement. What Trump says President Trump has alternated between praising Sanders and insulting him as crazy. As some of Mr. Trump and Sanders' populist ideas overlap, Mr. Trump often said during the 2016 campaign that Sanders voters would defect to him over Hillary Clinton in the general election. Mr. Trump also accused Clinton of cheating to take the nomination away from Sanders, and criticized Sanders for eventually endorsing Clinton. While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers, Mr. Trump tweeted in July 2016. Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary, he wrote in another July tweet. In several subsequent tweets, Mr. Trump has called Sanders Crazy Bernie. He has often referred to the 2016 Democratic primary during his two years in office, sometimes in an effort to cast him as the face of the party's more extreme elements."}

Klobuchar has written about her troubled family life as a child in her book, The Senator Next Door: A Memoir from the Heartland. Her father, Jim, was an alcoholic who frequently spent time away from family and was arrested for drunk driving. He and Klobuchar's mother, Rose, divorced when Klobuchar was 15. The divorce took a toll on her family, causing her younger sister, Beth, to drop out of high school. Although Klobuchar's parents reconciled a few years later, she has written that her relationship with her father was not repaired until he quit drinking in the 1990s. Klobuchar attended Yale University and University of Chicago Law School. She returned to Minnesota after graduating and worked for a private law firm. Her experience of being forced to return to work one day after giving birth inspired her to become politically active and advocate for a maternity leave bill in the state legislature. Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998. She was first elected to the Senate in 2006, and won re-election in 2012 and 2018. Klobuchar and her husband, John Bessler, have one daughter. Bessler is a private practice attorney and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. The three-term Minnesota senator launched her presidential campaign on Feb. 10 under frigid temperatures and relentless snowfall in Minneapolis."}
{"original": "Issues Klobuchar is a very active senator who is often willing to work on a bipartisan basis. As of December, Klobuchar has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation which have been signed into law. However, Klobuchar is also ideologically liberal on several issues. As a member of the Senate in 2009, Klobuchar voted to pass the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. She is pro-choice and supports LGBT rights. She also has an F rating from the National Rifle Association. Klobuchar is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and made a name for herself in 2018 for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the hearings investigating claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh in September. At one point, when asking if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he retorted: Have you? The moment quickly went viral, and Kavanaugh later apologized. Controversy Klobuchar was the sole senator from Minnesota during the resolution of the contested Senate election from January to July 2009, which Al Franken eventually won. When Franken was accused of sexual harassment in December 2017, Klobuchar did not call for Franken to step down, unlike many other senators. Franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light."}
{"original": "I felt I was in a different role as his colleague, that I'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and I felt it was best to handle it in that way, Klobuchar told CNN at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. Klobuchar has also faced scrutiny over several news reports detailing a pattern of abusive treatment towards her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. What Trump says A few hours after her announcement, President Trump mocked Klobuchar for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change during a Midwestern snowstorm. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)! the president tweeted."}
{"original": "Cory Booker Cory Booker launches 2020 campaign 02:57 Biography Cory Booker was born in Washington in 1964 and raised in the affluent suburbs of northern New Jersey. He received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in sociology from Stanford University, where he also played tight end for the football team. After graduation, Booker was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, earning a master's degree in modern history. He returned to the U.S. for a law degree at Yale. After working as a public-interest attorney and housing advocate in Newark, Booker decided to run for the city's municipal council in 1998. He managed to topple a long-time incumbent and, at age 29, become the youngest-ever member of the council, where he gained notoriety for fasting outside a housing project to denounce the intensifying crime and drug use in some of Newark's neighborhoods. After launching an unsuccessful bid in 2002 against incumbent mayor Sharpe James, Booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor Ronald Rice. During his seven-year tenure as mayor, Booker was praised for attracting large companies to Newark and revamping the city's downtown. But he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image. The only way you can see the mayor is if you turn on 'Meet the Press,' Newark's current mayor, Ras Baraka, said when he was a councilman during Booker's mayoral administration."}
{"original": "After longtime New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, Booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known Republican mayor in a special election. In 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the Senate. During his years in the Senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. Booker announced he was running for president on Feb. 1, 2019, the first day of Black History Month. Issues He has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the Senate. Pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the Marijuana Justice Act in the summer of 2017. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. The junior senator from New Jersey is one of the chief architects of the First Step Act, a landmark bill that President Trump signed into law in December after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in Congress, Booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system."}
{"original": "Controversy Although he has a liberal voting record in the Senate and has been a staunch critic of the Trump administration, Booker has faced criticism from some progressives for receiving large donations from pharmaceutical corporations and banks. In what he touted as his Spartacus moment, Booker claimed to have released confidential committee documents during the contentious Senate confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. His Republican colleagues accused him of grandstanding and said the documents had already been cleared. What Trump says In an exclusive interview with CBS News Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan the same day Booker announced his candidacy, President Trump said he thinks Booker has no chance in the 2020 election. When asked why, Mr. Trump replied: Because I know him. He has no chance. In a November interview with the New York Post, the president said Booker ran Newark into the ground and falsely accused him of not living in the city when he was mayor. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump claimed to know more about Booker than the New Jersey senator knew about himself. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself, Mr. Trump tweeted in July of that year."}
{"original": "Pete Buttigieg Pete Buttigieg explores presidential bid 06:09 Biography The youngest of the presidential contenders, Pete Buttigieg is also the only openly gay candidate who has jumped into the race. Buttigieg, 37, ran for mayor of South Bend, Indiana, his hometown, when he was only 29. He is a graduate of Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. After becoming mayor in 2011, Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan for a seven-month tour in 2013 as a member of the Navy Reserve. In 2015, shortly before the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Buttigieg came out as gay in an essay in the South Bend Tribune, becoming the first openly gay municipal leader in Indiana. If nominated, Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee. Buttigieg ran for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, running as a dark horse candidate with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. However, Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election, acknowledging his long-shot candidacy. Buttigieg married his husband, Chasten Glezman, in June 2018. Issues Buttigieg has spent much of his time as mayor of South Bend focusing on redevelopment and construction, such as implementing a project to repair or demolish targeted properties across the city and adding pedestrian and bike-friendly amenities to city streets. Buttigieg is making the case that South Bend's economic struggles are a microcosm of the problems the country is experiencing."}
{"original": "The city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since Buttigieg took office. He has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. In the video announcing his exploratory committee, Buttigieg emphasizes the need for a fresh start in American politics. He also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: We're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. Unless we do something different. Controversy Buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. In his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first African American chief of police of South Bend. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Buttigieg as of now."}

Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was a scientist from India and her father, Donald Harris, an economics professor at Stanford University, was born in Jamaica. Harris went to high school in Canada, where her mother worked as a hospital researcher and college professor. She returned to the U.S. to go to college at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. and then went on to attend law school at the University of California, Hastings. Upon graduation, Harris stayed in the Golden State and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office in Oakland. In 2003, she was elected San Francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. During her 10-year tenure as the city's chief law enforcement officer, Harris spearheaded efforts to curb high recidivism rates among released prisoners and created a nationally recognized reentry program for nonviolent, first-time drug offenders. After winning a hotly contested race in 2010, Harris became California's first female attorney general, as well as the first Indian-American and Jamaican-American to hold the post. During her two terms, Harris' office implemented implicit bias training among officers and defended several state lawyers dogged by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct. After Sen. Barbara Boxer announced her retirement, Harris launched a bid for her seat."}
{"original": "In 2016, she defeated Rep. Loretta Sanchez, also a Democrat, in a landslide and became the first woman of color to represent California in the Senate. During her two years on Capitol Hill, Harris has solidified herself as a leading critic of the Trump administration, known for her fierce questioning as a member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees. Harris announced her presidential candidacy on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21, 2019. Key issues In her short tenure in the Senate, Harris has compiled a liberal voting record and has overwhelmingly voted against President Trump's nominees for cabinet-level and other administration positions. Along with her tough, prosecutorial cross examinations during committee sessions, Harris has advocated for criminal justice and immigration reform and has contrasted her platform with Mr. Trump's agenda. Although she opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana during her law enforcement career in California, Harris announced her support for the Marijuana Justice Act crafted by Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. In October, Harris unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6,000 a year in refundable tax credits, which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail."}
{"original": "Controversy Although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail, Harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. Some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. Critics have pointed to California's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a progressive prosecutor. If Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor Lara Bazelon in an opinion piece for The New York Times. What Trump says Although Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about Harris, the White House has previously criticized the California senator. In the summer of 2018, the White House Twitter account wrote, @SenKamalaHarris, why are you supporting the animals of MS-13? You must not really know what ICE does.

She has described growing up in a paycheck-to-paycheck family that lived on the ragged edge of the middle class. Warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the University of Houston. She began law school at Rutgers University when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. Warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at Harvard Law School. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton were among her students there. After the 2008 financial collapse, Warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. She served as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. In those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. But her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the Republican Party and among Wall Street bankers. Such opposition derailed Obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the CFPB. Instead, she ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown--her first run at public office."}
{"original": "Warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 31. Warren and her second husband, Bruce Mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. They live in Cambridge, Massachusetts with their golden retriever, Bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. Key issues Warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-Wall Street crusader. The 69-year-old senator serves on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. In one instance, she helped to derail then-President Obama's nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss to a top position at the Treasury Department in 2015. Fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, Warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. What I found is terrifying. These aren't cracks that families are falling into. They're traps. America's middle class is under attack. How do we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice."}
{"original": "During a press conference after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren pushed for more accountability in the economy and pledged to go after drug companies. The problem is Washington works great for those with influence. Warren also came out against political action committees to fund campaigns. Democrats are the party of the people -- we join together and we fund our campaigns, she told reporters. We make our campaigns work through the people. Controversy Warren's claims of Native American ancestry, which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead, have been the source of controversy since her first run for the Senate. In an attempt to silence critics --namely, President Trump -- ahead of a presidential bid, Warren released the results of a DNA test in 2018 that showed a tiny portion of Native American heritage, along with a campaign-like video about her family history. The move backfired, inviting criticism from tribal leaders and Native American groups. And it raised questions about how effectively Warren will be able to compete with President Trump. What Trump says The heritage controversy put Warren high on Mr. Trump's hit list. He frequently refers to her as Pocahontas, and while campaigning over the summer, he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a DNA test. He later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize Warren over the backlash to her DNA video. She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage."}
{"original": "That didn't work out too well, Trump told Fox News in an interview on New Year's Eve. We'll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her. Warren frequently taunted Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, Twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. Asked by Fox News whether Warren would be able to win, the president said, Well, that I don't know. You would have to ask her psychiatrist."}

Gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in Albany. She attended Dartmouth University and UCLA School of Law. Gillibrand worked at the private Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to Circuit Court Judge Roger Miner, a Ronald Reagan appointee. She served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo in the final year of the Clinton administration. She was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, and worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton became a mentor to Gillibrand, and encouraged Gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning. Gillibrand defeated four-term Rep. John Sweeney, who represented a conservative district, in 2006. Gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative Democrat Blue Dog Caucus. She supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, and received a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association.

She proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command in 2013, legislation which was co-sponsored by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Although the legislation failed, it raised her profile as an advocate for women. Gillibrand has acknowledged her changed positions on immigration and gun control, saying in a 60 Minutes profile in 2018 that she was embarrassed and ashamed of her stances while serving in the House. Health care has been an important issue for Gillibrand since entering the Senate. She came out in favor of single-payer healthcare in 2017 and co-sponsored a Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders. She was the first sitting senator to call for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished, a popular cause on the left. Controversy Gillibrand has faced criticism for representing cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris during her time at Davis Polk, including in civil and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice.

After returning from her second deployment in 2009, Gabbard ran for Honolulu City Council. She served on the council from 2011 until 2012, when she resigned to focus on her congressional campaign. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. She was the first practicing Hindu in Congress. Issues Gabbard is very progressive, and one of the few members of Congress to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary. She resigned her position as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee to endorse him. Gabbard is a supporter of a woman's right to an abortion and received a 100 percent rating from NARAL. She has emphasized environmental and economic issues during her tenure, and supports a $15 minimum wage. She also supports Medicare for All."}
{"original": "Although she began her career opposing LGBTQ rights, she is now a supporter of LGBTQ issues and has apologized for her previous views. Controversy Gabbard's father was an anti-gay activist whose views influenced his daughter during her early political career. When she ran for the Hawaii state legislature in 2002, Gabbard boasted about supporting her father in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. After her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. In 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, Gabbard said at the time, according to CNN's KFile. As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. Gabbard apologized to LGBTQ activists in the state when running for Congress in 2012. She apologized again after launching her presidential campaign. Gabbard has invited controversy for her iconoclastic views on foreign policy. In January 2017, she visited Syria and met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A few months later, the U.S. bombed the Syrian airfield thought to be the origin of a government-ordered deadly chemical attack. Gabbard called the U.S. bombing reckless and questioned whether Assad was behind the attack, garnering criticism from other Democratic politicians."}

Before walking off stage without taking questions, the president said they would hold a major press conference Tuesday after he meets with members of Congress about how to address the economic fallout from the coronavirus."}
{"original": "The president said the White House that his administration is working with Congress and businesses to make sure hourly workers never miss a paycheck, as well as with the hospitality industry and cruise companies and airlines.

{"original": "LUTHER, Okla. - Luther sold its youth football field to Walmart (WMT) about three years ago so that the company could build one of its Express stores, using the money from the sale and the new tax revenue to pay off the roughly $200,000 in debt that resulted from an embezzlement scandal involving the former town treasurer."}
{"original": "The store opened in May 2015 and closed only eight months later when Walmart pulled the plug on its Express experiment, shuttering all 102 of the smaller stores it had opened in mostly Southern and Midwestern towns to compete with dollar stores. Although many locations were taken over by Dollar General (DG), the tax collections just don't measure up even though the Dollar General stores offer many of the same products, but not a pharmacy."}
{"original": "Tax collections in Luther, a town of about 1,600 on the outskirts of Oklahoma City, rose by $12,000 to $16,000 per month while the Express store was open, said City Manager Scherrie Pidcock. Since Dollar General opened in the larger building, the town's monthly revenue has recovered about two-thirds of the amount it was collecting with the Walmart Express, Pidcock said."}
{"original": "Luther has tried to pinch pennies any way it can. When its lone paid firefighter -- the chief -- quit the otherwise all-volunteer department in July, he was replaced by a volunteer, saving the town his roughly $2,800 a month salary. Mayor Jenni White, who took office a few months after the Walmart Express closed, said Luther had to put off buying two new police cars."}
{"original": "We're just trying to go slowly, moving forward and not overspend the budget, White said. It's what do we need, not what do we want."}
{"original": "Walmart closed its Express locations because of the demand of customers, who wanted more than the 12,000-square-foot stores could offer, according to Anne Hatfield, a spokeswoman for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company."}
{"original": "What we learned from the Express stores was that our customers still wanted to shop at the supercenters, Hatfield said. The customers ... were traveling to the other [supercenter] stores, which, at an average of 187,000 square feet, sell a full range of groceries, clothing, household and sporting goods, and basic automotive services."}
{"original": "In most of the towns where Dollar General took over the Express locations, it closed an existing smaller Dollar General store and employs about half the 30 workers the Walmart Expresses did."}
{"original": "Dollar General also simply doesn't generate the level of business of Walmart, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting and research firm."}
{"original": "Reason number one, Walmart was selling fresh, Johnson said, referring to produce and meats. Dollar General ... I just don't think they do a good job on it by displaying items that do not always appear fresh, Johnson said."}
{"original": "The disappearance of the Walmart Express pharmacy, which in many towns were the only pharmacies, has also played a role by reducing the number of customers entering the Dollar General stores."}
{"original": "The pharmacy ... made customers come to the stores to fill purchases, Johnson said. There's less people visiting store, and mathematically if there's less people in the store, there are less purchases being made, of various other items."}
{"original": "In Nettleton, Mississippi, a town of roughly 2,000 people about 100 miles southeast of Memphis, Tennessee, Mayor Mem Riley said the closing of the Walmart Express about 13 months after it opened cost the town about $24,000 a year in sales tax revenue, forcing Nettleton to shelve its plan to improve its water and sewer services and parks."}
{"original": "We had plans of doing infrastructure repair. We had those hopes, and then 'bam' it all disappears, Riley said."}
{"original": "In Luther, the youth football league now plays on the high school field, but instead of paying $1 per year rent to the city, the cost is $100 per game day, or about $500 per year, and the youth program no longer receives revenue from concession sales, a loss of about $1,200 each game day, according to Brian Wilson, president of the Little League Youth Football Association."}
{"original": "Birlene Langley, who was Luther's mayor when Walmart came knocking, said Walmart saved the town financially after it was discovered the town treasurer had failed to pay payroll taxes and was embezzling funds, a charge to which the former treasurer eventually pleaded guilty."}
{"original": "The Walmart is what kept this town from going under, Langley said. With Walmart, that was the best thing that ever happened to Luther. ... And then they just up and left."}
{"original": "Stung by company's departure, Langley said she vowed to never enter a Walmart again. But she now shops at a supercenter on Interstate 35 in Edmond, about 15 miles from Luther."}
{"original": "Of course I said I'd never walk in one, after the store closed. But there it is, said Langley, right there on I-35. It's convenient."}
{"original": "Washington — When Democrats took back the House in the midterm elections, they made it clear they intend to ramp up investigations of the president and his administration. On Thursday, they kicked into high gear."}

{"original": "Washington — The Senate voted Tuesday to approve Pete Buttigieg to be transportation secretary, the first openly gay person ever confirmed to a Cabinet post, tasked with advancing President Biden's wide-ranging agenda of rebuilding the nation's infrastructure and fighting climate change."}
{"original": "Buttigieg was confirmed in a final 86 to 13 vote in the Senate, after the 39-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Mr. Biden's one-time rival in the Democratic presidential primaries received bipartisan praise at his confirmation hearing last week."}
{"original": "Mr. Buttigieg is an impressive public servant who has already earned the respect and confidence of both sides, said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in floor remarks on Monday. I look forward to confirming his nomination."}
{"original": "Praised by Mr. Biden as bringing a new voice to the administration, Buttigieg takes over a Transportation Department with 55,000 employees and a budget of tens of billions of dollars. He has pledged to quickly get to work promoting safety and restoring consumer trust in America's transportation networks as airlines, buses, city subway systems and Amtrak reel from plummeting ridership in the coronavirus pandemic."}
{"original": "He is also expected to play an important role in promoting Mr. Biden's climate initiatives, helping to oversee stronger automotive fuel economy standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support the president's push later this year on a sweeping $2 trillion climate and infrastructure plan. That plan will focus in part on rebuilding roads and bridges and expanding zero-emission mass transit while boosting electric vehicle infrastructure, including building 500,000 charging stations over the next decade."}
{"original": "Pete Buttigieg speaks during a Senate Commerce Committee confirmation hearing in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, January 21, 2021. Ken Cedeno/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Images"}
{"original": "During his hearing, some Republican senators signaled fights ahead over the cost and scope of updating the nation's roads and bridges, rails and airports, a goal long promised by former President Donald Trump but never fulfilled in his four years in office. The senators questioned in particular the Biden administration's effort to redirect money for green initiatives, but said they looked forward to further discussions with Buttigieg. He easily cleared the Senate Commerce Committee on a 21-3 vote."}
{"original": "I look forward to seeing Pete Buttigieg confirmed by the full Senate, said Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the panel. Transportation issues historically have been addressed on a bipartisan basis, and I expect to continue that practice with Mr. Buttigieg."}
{"original": "Biden hasn't indicated how he intends to pay for a broad infrastructure plan, coming on top of a proposed $1.9 trillion virus relief plan that has met some headwinds in Congress. Buttigieg's suggestion during his hearing that a gas tax hike might be needed was immediately walked back by his spokesman afterward."}
{"original": "We need to build our economy back, better than ever, and the Department of Transportation can play a central role in this, Buttigieg said. He noted that the transportation sector, particularly car emissions, is the single biggest contributor in the U.S. to global warming."}
{"original": "The Afghanistan war veteran burst onto the national scene in 2019 after launching a longshot presidential bid, drawing initial skepticism due to his youth and limited government experience. He outperformed expectations after zeroing in on a message of generational change, finishing the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses in a virtual tie with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. But Buttigieg struggled to appeal to Black voters and dropped out of the race after a crushing loss to Mr. Biden in the South Carolina primary. Buttigieg chose to quickly endorse Mr. Biden, helping him solidify centrist support against Sanders' strong liberal challenge."}
{"original": "Buttigieg now points to his experience as a mayor and on the campaign trail as valuable to his bottom up approach to improving transportation. He described initiating a smart streets program to make South Bend's downtown more pedestrian- and bicyclist-friendly while spurring hundreds of millions of dollars in economic investment."}
{"original": "He'll also bring diversity to the Cabinet. There hasn't been an openly gay Cabinet secretary before. Under Mr. Trump, Richard Grenell served as acting director of national intelligence and is openly gay, but did not have to face Senate confirmation as an acting director. In the late 1990s, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott blocked a vote on President Bill Clinton's pick for ambassador to Luxembourg, James Hormel, over his sexual orientation; Mr. Clinton ultimately installed Hormel with a recess appointment."}
{"original": "Buttigieg says he recalled watching the treatment of Hormel's nomination as a 17-year-old and seeing the limits. Buttigieg says it proved to be an important crack in the glass ceiling for the LGBTQ community."}
{"original": "As I was in that hearing taking those questions from senators, you could see my husband, Chasten, over my shoulder, and that is something that has never happened before for a Cabinet nominee, Buttigieg, reflecting on the moment, told ABC's The View. My hope is that, in turn, makes it easier for the next person to come along, so that this is never even viewed as a barrier by a future generation."}

{"original": "The most common fear about retirement is outliving my savings/investments. That's what 51 percent of workers said in a recent survey that Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies (TCRS) conducted. A key way to address this fear is to save enough money while you're working and not let it leak out along the way due to hardship withdrawals, early withdrawals or loans."}
{"original": "Unfortunately, 27 percent of workers have taken some form of loan, early withdrawal or hardship withdrawal from an IRA, 401(k) or similar plan, according to the TCRS report."}
{"original": "When is it a good idea to take a hardship withdrawal or a loan from your retirement savings? Actually, the answer is different for each situation."}
{"original": "The biggest problem with a hardship withdrawal is that most likely, you'll never get the chance to pay the money back to your retirement savings, so you'll end up with less money."}
{"original": "The tax considerations are also significant, depending on whether you're withdrawing from a traditional, pretax contribution 401(k) account or from a Roth 401(k)."}
{"original": "If you take out a hardship withdrawal from a traditional 401(k) account, the amount of the withdrawal is subject to income taxes, as well as a 10 percent early payment penalty if you're under age 59-1/2 (with a few exceptions). When you consider federal and state income taxes and the early payment penalty, roughly half of the amount of your withdrawal could end up in your checkbook to spend."}
{"original": "If you make a qualified withdrawal from a Roth 401(k), you won't pay income taxes on your withdrawal and nor pay an early payment penalty. A withdrawal is considered to be qualified if it occurs:"}
{"original": "after you have reached age 59-1/2, or after you die or become disabled"}
{"original": "at least five years after the first day of the calendar year in which you first made a Roth contribution to the retirement plan"}
{"original": "If you don't satisfy these requirements, the withdrawal is considered to be nonqualified. In this case, you'll owe income taxes on the investment earnings attributed to the withdrawal but not on your original contribution. There's still no early payment penalty as there is for withdrawals from traditional 401(k) accounts."}
{"original": "According to the TCRS survey, among workers who've taken a hardship withdrawal from their retirement plan, almost one in four said the primary reason for doing so was to pay for medical expenses. Another one in five said it was to prevent eviction from their home. Given the potential income taxes and penalties, you should take a hardship withdrawal only if you're truly desperate and have no other options."}
{"original": "You have two ways of planning ahead to minimize the damage caused by a hardship withdrawal:"}
{"original": "Withdrawing from a Roth 401(k) causes less damage than withdrawing from a traditional 401(k). As a result, if you think you might encounter a hardship situation in the future, contribute to a Roth 401(k) account instead of a traditional 401(k) account. Many employer-sponsored 401(k) plans offer both types of contributions and will match either type."}
{"original": "You'll also want to build an emergency fund outside your retirement savings, so you can tap those funds instead of your retirement savings if necessary."}
{"original": "According to the TCRS survey, many workers don't have much emergency savings to cover the cost of financial setbacks, such as unemployment, medical bills, home repairs or auto repairs. Thirty-five percent of workers report having saved less than $5,000 for an emergency fund, while only 21 percent say they've saved more than $25,000."}
{"original": "A loan from your 401(k) account isn't subject to income taxes or penalties at the time you take it out, unlike the treatment of hardship withdrawals. As a result, you won't have done much damage to your eventual retirement security as long as you eventually pay back the loan in its entirety and you continue contributing the same amount to the plan before you took out the loan."}
{"original": "According to the TCRS survey, among workers who've taken a loan from their retirement plan, the top three reasons they cited were:"}
{"original": "paying for an unplanned major expense (31 percent)"}
{"original": "paying off credit card debt (29 percent)"}
{"original": "paying off other debt (25 percent)"}
{"original": "Using a 401(k) loan to pay off credit card and other debt can be a good thing because you might be retiring debt that has a higher interest rate than your 401(k) plan is earning. In this case, you're really paying yourself back when you make principal and interest payments on your 401(k) loan."}
{"original": "Two problems can occur when you take out a 401(k) loan:"}
{"original": "If you reduce your contributions to the plan because you have to make loan payments, you'll end up with less money saved when you retire. That's particularly troubling if you contribute less than the maximum that your employer matches because you're also losing the employer match."}
{"original": "If you terminate employment with an outstanding loan, most 401(k) plans require you to immediately pay it back. If you can't, the remaining balance is then treated as a payment from the plan and is subject to income taxes and early retirement penalties if you're under age 59-1/2. So it could be a bad idea to take out a 401(k) plan loan if you think your job might be in jeopardy or if you might want to switch jobs while the loan is being paid off, which is usually five years."}
{"original": "It's always a good idea to have a Plan B in place to address the possibility of needing to pay back the outstanding balance if you leave your employer when the loan is still outstanding. One idea would be to build up an emergency fund."}
{"original": "The bottom line is, leakage from retirement plans in the form of loans and withdrawals has the potential to severely inhibit the growth of your long-term retirement savings. Take steps now to prevent that from happening to you."}
{"original": "The stock market has trended upward since Election Day, stoked by optimism that President Donald Trump's agenda will translate into stronger corporate earnings. While Wall Street may be having some second thoughts lately, the Trump bump seems to be taking hold on Main Street in the form of stronger hiring by bullish small and midsize employers."}
{"original": "The pace of hiring by large companies hasn't changed much since the election, but smaller firms have shown a notable uptick in hiring, according to a Morgan Stanley (MS) study. It examined net monthly changes in employment among firms of different sizes (on a three-month rolling-average basis) relative to historical averages."}
{"original": "Morgan Stanley based its analysis on data from the ADP Research Institute, a division of payroll-processing giant ADP. This week, ADP reported that private sector employers added a stronger-than-expected 263,000 jobs in March, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Small and midsize companies led the way in job creation, generating more than 80 percent of all new private sector jobs last month."}
{"original": "Small-business hiring may have lagged -- unusually so -- in this labor market recovery, but its animal spirts are certainly awake now, said the Morgan Stanley report, which noted that small-business owners are feeling more upbeat lately, while the number of startup companies has also surged."}
{"original": "Since the presidential election, optimism among small-business owners has risen to levels not seen since 1983, a year that marked the start of a prolonged economic expansion, said William Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). The trade group publishes a monthly small-business optimism index based on a survey of a random sample of its member firms."}
{"original": "Higher levels of optimism are starting to translate into stronger hiring and capital spending, said Dunkelberg. Manufacturers and construction companies are particularly upbeat, he said."}
{"original": "Why has hiring by small businesses lagged during the recovery? Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was slow to bounce back, and that took a toll on many small businesses, explained Dunkelberg."}
{"original": "The recovery was awful for small businesses in terms of sales growth, he said."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump's unexpected win in November has many feeling decidedly more upbeat, added Dunkelberg. That's because they're hopeful the administration will deliver on its promises to reform the tax code, roll back regulations and upgrade America's infrastructure."}
{"original": "His vow to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is another cause for optimism. The cost of health insurance and complying with regulations have been among the biggest problems small businesses have faced in recent years, said Dunkelberg."}
{"original": "Existing tax policy is another pain point for many small businesses, he added. Many want tax cuts and a simpler code, among other policy changes."}
{"original": "A win by Hillary [Clinton] wouldn't have been viewed as a change in the status quo, just more of the past eight years, said Dunkelberg."}
{"original": "Of course, what goes up must come down. The Trump euphoria on Main Street may eventually fade if the administration fails to deliver on its pro-business agenda. Last month's collapse of the Republican-backed health insurance bill has undoubtedly given some supporters in the small-business community pause."}
{"original": "Not according to Dunkelberg. Many, he said, see it as just a temporary setback."}
{"original": "In this episode of Facing Forward, Margaret Brennan talks with Illumina CEO Francis deSouza for a look at the science behind the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic and how agencies like the CDC and the White House can better understand how infectious diseases evolve."}
{"original": "On sequencing a virus: I think more sequencing is important in terms of fighting the pandemic. And you're right, although, you know, in the US we are a source of some of the innovations in sequencing. We have lagged behind over 40 countries, as you point out, in terms of just how much we're sequencing. So on average in the US right now, we are sequencing about 0.3% of the positive cases that we're seeing. Now to get a good understanding of what's happening, you really need to be sequencing about 5% of the positive cases as well as sampling the negative cases. Now, for comparison, you know, countries like the U.K. that are leading are closer to sequencing, about 10% of all positive cases."}
{"original": "On new strains of COVID-19: We're going to continue to find new strains around the world and the ones that will propagate are going to be the ones of the most transmissible. And so, you know we'll- that- this will just continue to emerge. The important thing is to watch the results of the tests that the vaccine developers are doing and some of the therapy developers, and again, it's inevitable and this may be, you know, days. This could be weeks. This could be months from now or even years from now. But it's inevitable that there will be some strains that do require modifications of the vaccines that we have today. The vaccine developers know that. They understand what it would take to modify, you know, their vaccines. And so we just have to- we have to stay on top of it though, because at this point, it's a footrace between how fast we're rolling out the virus and how fast the virus is mutating and spreading around the world."}

Today, we'll be talking to Francis deSouza, the CEO of Illumina. Through its work with the CDC, Illumina has helped to detect some of the very first cases of the U.K. variant or B117 reported here in the US. We're excited to have you on the podcast, Francis. How are you?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT & CEO OF ILLUMINA FRANCIS DESOUZA: Hi, I'm doing well. Thanks for having me, MARGARET. I'm excited to be here."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your company Illumina, which is a public company, it's in the private sector, you conduct genomic sequencing, which is what scientists use to understand how infectious diseases spread and how they evolve. So for all of us who weren't science majors in college, how do you actually do that?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: Sure. So what we do at Illumina is we provide the machines and the software that allows our customers to start with biological samples. So it could be, you know, blood, saliva and you take those biological samples and our machine then reads sort of the DNA- the genomic data in that sample. So that could be DNA, and in the case of this virus, it's RNA. And then we'll spit out on the other side a report with all the sequences in that biological sample. There's an awful lot that goes into the machines we build, a lot of molecular biology, a lot of chemistry, a lot of A.I. and, you know, computer processing to go from that biological sample to the report that we provide."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you do this for all sorts of different viruses?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: Yeah, we do it for any biological sample. And so, you know, today we serve at Illumina, about over 7,000 customers in 130 countries. And our customers include CDC's who are looking for pathogens and trying to identify emerging pathogens. And we were in Wuhan in December 2019 involved when the team- the CDC team there was trying to identify the cause of what was then called this, you know, pneumonia of unknown origin. And the first viral genome that was published on January 10th was actually published by a team at the Shanghai Public Health Clinic using our sequencers."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: On COVID generally, how many different types of it exist in the world? Do we know?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: Well, the virus is continually mutating, and so, you know, a coronavirus typically mutates about two to three times a month. And so you can expect to see, you know, many, many different types of virus with different mutations on them. Now, you know, two to three times a month sounds like a lot. It's not as frequent as influenza virus, for example, that mutates on average 10 times a month. And- and- and we follow those strains to try and identify not only just how the virus is mutating, which is important information to have, because you're trying to figure out does that mean our diagnostic tools will fail because the virus has mutated enough? Does that mean our vaccines will continue to be effective, our therapies? But you also want to track these mutations to try and identify how is this virus spreading? And that gives you insight that you can use to make policy decisions for example. For example, you could decide to shut down travel to a region if, you know, that's the place where, you know, your infections are coming from."}
{"original": "MARAGARET BRENNAN: And by most accounts the U.S. hasn't been doing a very good job of this. We've reported more deaths due to COVID than any country in the world, and according to one ranking we're about 43rd in the world for genetic sequencing. If we had better sequencing, would that help us avoid further death?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: I think more sequencing is important in terms of fighting the pandemic. And you're right, although, you know, in the US we are a source of some of the innovations in sequencing. We have lagged behind over 40 countries, as you point out, in terms of just how much we're sequencing. So on average in the US right now, we are sequencing about 0.3% of the positive cases that we're seeing. Now to get a good understanding of what's happening, you really need to be sequencing about 5% of the positive cases as well as sampling the negative cases. Now, for comparison, you know, countries like the U.K. that are leading are closer to sequencing, about 10% of all positive cases."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why aren't we doing this already?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: One of the challenges here in the US is that there hasn't been a coordinating force. There hasn't been a central coordinating force across the nation. And so what's happening is you're seeing pockets of sequencing and so, you know, different labs, different health systems are making their own decisions about whether to sequence or not. And then some of them are uploading the data that they sequence into the public domain. Now, that's different in other countries. In the- in the UK, for example, because they have a national health system, you know, there is a coordinated effort happening around sequencing. And so that's one of the things I think that we really need here. You know, we need a- a national initiative around genomic surveillance. We need a coordinating central body around how to manage the- the flow of samples, you know, and then also the funding associated with- with those labs actually sequencing, you know, the samples they get."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the Biden administration says it wants to do some of that by investing in both sequencing and surveillance. So, how would that work? Does the CDC need to ask private companies like yours to help them do it?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: You know, there is hope as you said. If you look at the Biden American Rescue Plan, in it there are details around increasing funding for surveillance capacity at levels demanded by the crisis. And so there's definitely a thought that we need to- to increase funding for surveillance, that's one aspect of it, and also create a- a central group that- that will coordinate this. And then the central group will also help make sure that the- the samples from infected patients are getting to the right labs and that the data is being shared in the public domain."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: If we did more sequencing, could we then do things like say, hey Montana, shut down your restaurants, but Wyoming, you can stay and continue working, thus your economy can continue to grow. Is it that simple?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: It's- it's that straightforward. However, I'd say one of the most eye opening moments here in the US of this pandemic was the realization early last spring that we had the virus circulating in the US for weeks and we didn't know it. And what that meant was we had no idea that there was, you know, a pandemic starting and building, and it- it created the realization that we do need this genomics-based pathogen surveillance network. We need a network that will tell us if there is another coronavirus circulating, or if we're even under a bioterrorist attack, or if there is emerging antimicrobial resistance anywhere in the world, or if there's another zoonotic transmission, you know, from an animal into- into the human population, you know, that's spreading uncontrolled. And so there is this moment, this realization that we actually wouldn't even know if we were under attack. So, instead of waiting weeks and months before we know we're under attack, it could be hours or days. And that makes a huge amount of difference in terms of being able to control an outbreak, you know, before it becomes a pandemic. Also, if you are sequencing earlier and getting the genomic data of the pathogen earlier, that gives vaccine developers and therapy developers a head start."}
{"original": "You know, if you talk to companies like, you know, Moderna or BioNTech, they'll tell you that it was the publication of the viral genome on January 10th, 2020 that really kicked them off in terms of developing the vaccine. And so the earlier you catch it, the earlier you get vaccines and therapies."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you next about the mutations of the virus. Is it 'B' one one seven or 'B' one seventeen? What do you call the U.K. strain?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: We call it 'B' one one seven."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You call it that. So, that's the technical name for what you refer to as the strain that was first detected in the United Kingdom. It's highly contagious, but it's here in America now. The CDC says it's going to be the dominant strain by March. Exactly how much of the virus is here? Do we know?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: Well, working with our partners like the CDC and Helix, we have now identified 74 cases of B117. You know, that's up from 51 cases that were reported on the 6th of January. We've identified cases now in seven states, so, you know, Texas, Minnesota, Indiana, in addition to California, Florida, Pennsylvania and Georgia. And it appears to be on the rise. So last week, B117 infections represented 0.17%, you know, of the total infections that we're seeing here in the U.S. And in a week that's gone from 0.17 to 0.27. Now, we know it's much more transmissible than some of the other strains we're seeing, so we fully expect that it'll start to become a more dominant strain in terms of the infections we're seeing here in the US."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the U.K. found this mutation because they do sequencing. But correct me if I'm wrong, that doesn't mean that's where the virus actually came from. Right?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: That's exactly right. They found it because they have more sequencing and- and are just looking better than other places. It absolutely doesn't mean that it came from there necessarily."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do we know where it came from? And is answering that question important to how you treat it?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: At this point we're not sure where it came from. And, you know, over time, it will be important to sort of track, you know, the spread of this virus. However, at this point, especially in terms of treating it, it isn't essential to know where it came from. What is essential and is- is taking place is to understand, you know, with every one of these new strains that we're seeing whether it'll impact the efficacy of our tools to fight the pandemic, whether it will affect the efficacy of our diagnostic tools and- and our vaccines and our therapies. And so you have the- the manufacturers of the tools and the vaccines and the therapies testing against these strains as they emerge and reporting their results. That's important."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And what we know to date is that the U.K. strain seems to be responsive to our current therapies, but it's the strain out of South Africa that there is early reporting on that indicates it may be resistant to certain treatments. That's 'B' one three five one, right?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: Yeah, 'B' one three five one, exactly. And--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much of it's here? Do we know?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: Well, you know, it's early at this point. You know, we have more data, as you said, on B117. And the data there is encouraging that, you know, our existing, you know, therapies hold up against B117 is the data we're seeing so far. You know it's- we're getting very early data on 3151. And at this point it's too early to call whether it escapes. Now, the vaccines are targeting, you know, the- the spike protein of the virus and it will take, you know, a lot of mutations for the- the vaccines to fail. And so we'll have to see, you know, what the results with B1351 are. And, you know, at some point it- there may emerge a strain that the vaccines aren't effective for. Now, the good news is, you know, those vaccines can be updated pretty quickly, but then they'll have to go through the, you know, the testing before they get released."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We spoke on FACE THE NATION to the incoming CDC director on who emphasized she wants to focus on sequencing and surveillance. She mentioned the Brazilian strain. She mentioned a strain out of Nigeria. How worried should we be about those? What do we know about them?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: You know, we're going to continue to find new strains around the world and the ones that will propagate are going to be the ones of the most transmissible. And so, you know we'll- that- this will just continue to emerge. The important thing is to watch the results of the tests that the vaccine developers are doing and some of the therapy developers, and again, it's inevitable and this may be, you know, days. This could be weeks. This could be months from now or even years from now. But it's inevitable that there will be some strains that do require modifications of the vaccines that we have today. The vaccine developers know that. They understand what it would take to modify, you know, their vaccines. And so we just have to- we have to stay on top of it though, because at this point, it's- it's a footrace between how fast we're rolling out the virus and how fast the virus is- is mutating and spreading around the world."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The nominee to be the Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, testified this week that the Biden administration is going to try to raise corporate tax rates, but she said they're not going to return them to where they were. So right now, they're at 21%, this flat rate. And before President Trump lowered them, they were in a range between 15% to- to an effective rate of as high as 39%. What would raising the rate above current levels do to your business?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: That's a- it's a complicated question to answer without knowing all the puts and takes. So, for example, you know, we want to see the specifics around not just, you know, the headline number of what the tax rate- corporate tax rate is on average, but also things like, you know, how- how does the proposed, you know, tax code work around things like research and development credit, you know, revenue from outside the US, for example, or profits? So, you know, there's a lot of details that we'd have to work through to really assess what the implications would be."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the argument against it often is that that would hurt your ability to hire or, you know, any- any bite taken out of corporate profits comes at a cost ultimately somewhere. The other argument against it from the left is, you know, that corporations should pay their fair share. Do you see this as an argument that's going to dominate the next four years? Is- are you concerned about it?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: You know, I definitely think it will be a- a topic of conversation and debate and as- as it should be, both in terms of what the fair rate should be, as well as what the uses of those funds are. You know, how are we going to think about investing in America, whether it's on training or education? And so both in terms of sources and uses of funds, I think there should be sort of a very vigorous debate. Candidly, though, I think the more urgent conversations in the near-term are going to be around the pandemic and how we, you know, get people through the pandemic safely and quickly. I think there are going to be conversations, too, around, you know, how we continue to, you know, drive American leadership in key areas globally of- of the global economy, but also in things like climate change, for example. And so I think there are going to be a lot of very important conversations that play out. And in the near-term, I think the pandemic is probably going to be the single most important."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. On the pandemic front, the Treasury secretary nominee also testified that having a paid leave and childcare policy in the US would help the jobs crisis that women in particular have felt. Do you agree with that? And what are you doing at your own company on those policies?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: Yeah, I think there's a lot more we can do to support, you know, to support flexibility in the workplace, especially in times of need, specifically, you know, in times of illness, or if- if- you know, families have a baby, for example. So, you know, from our perspective as a company for this pandemic, you know, what we're doing is about a third of our employees come into an Illumina workplace to build the machines, you know, that- that we need to build to support customers that are- whether they're fighting the pandemic or in cancer centers. And so, you know, the work we do is- is essential for, you know, for those efforts. And so about a third of our employees do come in. We've done a lot in terms of retooling our workplaces, you know, in terms of social distancing and- and just lots, you know, cleaning the office, upgrading the ventilation, just a lot we've done in terms of ensuring that workplaces are safe. And then for two thirds of our employees, they work from home. And so, you know, we have enabled them to, you know, to be remote and be productive from home"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But should there be a government mandate on some of those specifics?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: I think in- in some cases there should be. You know and again, that's going to be the- the- the- debate that plays out--"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: --on how much and for what and for how long. But I do think, you know, we need to look harder at, you know, supporting- supporting, you know, the- the people that work."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration strongly suspected that patient zero came from a research lab in Wuhan. Maybe it was an accident. How important is it to find out the origin of this virus? You called it zoonotic, meaning it went from an animal to a human. What is pinning that down exactly when it happened, prove or give us? And can you tell something like that from the work that you do?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: I think over time it will be important to understand, you know, how this pandemic started but at this point, it's not the priority. At this point the priority has to be, you know, understand how the virus is spreading, get the vaccines out as fast as possible, stay on top of strains as they emerge so that we know that our tools will continue to be effective, adjust our tools, you know, if the virus continues to mutate. So right now, you know, my perspective is it's really all hands on deck to get us out of the pandemic. And then once we get out of the pandemic, I think there's very important research we can do to prepare us for the next one, including understand the- understanding the origins of this one. But that is not the priority right now. The priority right now is- is get through this pandemic."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think we'll ever know?"}
{"original": "DESOUZA: I think I'm hopeful. There's lots and lots of, you know, the beautiful thing about, you know, RNA is, you know, you can start to track history as you can see mutations and you can go back and see well what came from what and you start to build up these trees. So I- I'm hopeful."}

{"original": "When U.S. consumers are calling about a hotel reservation or an airline flight, there's a good chance a deportee in El Salvador is on the other end of the line."}
{"original": "Call centers are a thriving business in El Salvador. In office buildings lined with cubbies, employees sit at computers wearing a phone headset and responding to callers' questions in clear, American-accented English. Some foreign firms, including U.S. companies, run these call centers, and they find a ready pool of English-speaking workers in the community who've been deported from the United States."}
{"original": "The pay isn't much, but 45-year-old Rafa Arturo doesn't have any better options. He was born in El Salvador, but his parents brought him to California as a young child and he spent most of his life in the U.S., growing up more comfortable in English than Spanish. After committing a series of crimes involving theft in the U.S., he was deported back to El Salvador in 2009. He left behind four daughters in California, and had to start over in what felt like a foreign place."}
{"original": "Deportees like Rafa struggle to reintegrate into Salvadoran society and culture. Like many other deportees, he was able to secure a job in one of dozens of call centers where he can speak to customers in English and share a cultural familiarity with the people he answers on the phone."}
{"original": "It's one of the best ways to earn a living, as a deportee, he told CBS News."}
{"original": "Hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans fled to the United States during the country's civil war in the 1980s. From 1992 to 2000, many of those undocumented immigrants were repatriated back to El Salvador. Lacking fluency in Spanish, they faced prejudice and suspicion from Salvadoran society who viewed them as criminals (some of them did, indeed, bring street gang affiliations like MS-13 back with them). Many of the deportees ended up landing jobs in call centers and relying on the tight-knit community they built at work."}
{"original": "The deportees in the call center were very isolated from Salvadoran society, said Nestor Rodriguez, a sociology professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who interviewed 300 deportees for a survey. Their attitude was they were not Salvadoran like the rest of the people, he said. They kept to themselves, celebrated Fourth of July with BBQ and beer."}
{"original": "Call center businesses have capitalized on this labor force. The companies have low operating costs and large tax incentives, and while they pay higher-than-average salaries for El Salvador, workers make far less than the average American. Rafa says he earns less than $2.15 an hour. But even call center salaries are not enough to get by on in El Salvador, where wages average around $10 a day. Remittances from family and friends in the states made up 20 percent of El Salvador's annual GDP in 2017, according to the World Bank."}
{"original": "There's little opportunity for advancement, but that is probably the best job they're going to get, said Tanya Maria Golash-Boza, sociology professor at the University of California, Merced. Golash-Boza interviewed deportees in Latin America and the Caribbean who found work at call centers. To break into the Latin American elite is really hard. The possibility of you breaking into management is really difficult if your family is not from that background."}
{"original": "Deportees from the U.S. arrive at a government processing center in El Salvador's capital, San Salvador. CBS News"}
{"original": "There are reportedly about 70 call centers operating in El Salvador that generate about 25,000 jobs, according to PROESA, an agency that promotes investments in the country. Companies that have established call centers in El Salvador include Sykes, which is based in Florida."}
{"original": "I'm talking calls from the States, said Rafa. So far, it's all East Coast. I talk to people in Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Florida."}
{"original": "Golash-Boza pointed out that not just any deportee can find work at a call center. They prefer workers who were brought up in the U.S. and do not have a distinguishable accent. Employees often have to contend with age discrimination and conditions like limited bathroom breaks. There is scant hope of upward mobility. But for many deportees and unemployed youths, a call center is their only chance for work in El Salvador."}
{"original": "Employees can get away with sporting tattoos since clients never see them in person. Visible tattoos in El Salvador can be problematic as employers and police often assume they're tied to gangs like MS-13 and 18th Street. Visible tattoos can even be fatal. Rafa says that in 2016 he was targeted and shot by a gang member because of his tattoos. When police arrived at the scene, he says they accused him of being affiliated with a gang. He had to plead with them and pull out his work badge."}
{"original": "Rafa doesn't see any hope of building a life in El Salvador. It's not an option for me because I have tattoos. I'm not really scared of the people. I'm more scared of the police, the military and the gangs. It's messed up to live that way."}
{"original": "He continues to face stigma as a deportee. When he goes to the markets, vendors upcharge him because they consider him foreign. He said his 5-year-old son, Jacob, is singled out in school because he speaks English."}
{"original": "After spending a decade in El Salvador, Rafa is determined to give his son a chance to grow up in the U.S., as he did. He has grown daughters who would take the boy in. But Rafa's criminal record makes legal immigration a non-starter.

{"original": "We came together and gave it our best shot, Mayor Jim Strickland said. The good news is that this exercise showed us new ways to showcase our city that we are already using to attract other businesses."}
{"original": "Memphis has momentum and other companies have seen and will continue to see our value"}
{"original": "The city offered Amazon $60 million in cash incentives."}
{"original": "I can understand that some Kansas Citians may be disappointed, but it's important to remember that as a result of this very collaborative effort, more people today know more great things about Kansas City than they ever did before, said Mayor Sly James. Kansas City will continue to develop transformational projects and partnerships that continue the momentum you feel in every block and every neighborhood of this great city. We truly are a city on the rise, and I look forward to our exciting future."}
{"original": "Delaware's Gov. John Carney and the state's congressional delegation said they were of course disappointed not to be chosen."}
{"original": "But we used this opportunity to showcase all the options in Delaware not just for Amazon, but for any business looking for a location to set down roots and grow, they said. In that respect, Delaware's effort — which brought together leaders in the public and private sectors to promote our great state — was a resounding success. Going forward, we'll do everything we can to support Philadelphia's application, to help bring Amazon to our region."}
{"original": "New Hampshire's groundbreaking proposal to recruit Amazon was the most comprehensive business marketing plan our state has ever produced, Gov. Chris Sununu said in a statement. While we always knew that our bid was considered a long shot, we are excited that it is already serving as a template for other businesses that now have New Hampshire on their radar. Our commitment to economic and workforce development is already yielding results. We will never stop emphasizing that New Hampshire is open for business, open for workers, and open for opportunity."}
{"original": "New Hampshire's Amazon proposal was centered in Londonderry and emphasized the state's lack of a sales or income tax."}
{"original": "While disappointed San Diego/Chula Vista did not advance, we are not at all surprised, said Mark Cafferty, president and CEO of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corp. We knew that this would be a long shot based on geography and incentive options, but we also know that as a region, San Diego can most definitely compete with others in terms of talent, entrepreneurship, innovation and quality of life."}
{"original": "The two bids submitted by cities in the San Francisco Bay Area were both rejected by Amazon. Bay Area Council President Jim Wunderman said the decision was disappointing. We're not completely surprised by Amazon's decision, he said. The Bay Area is one of the most innovative regions in the world and the huge economic expansion we have witnessed here over the past 10 years has created significant challenges in the form of high housing costs, high cost of living and growing traffic. We are working hard to address these challenges, but we suspect they factored heavily in Amazon's decision to look elsewhere."}
{"original": "We're disappointed the City of Virginia Beach was not listed among the top 20 finalists for this project. However, we're excited the Commonwealth of Virginia is still under consideration, Virginia Beach Mayor William Sessoms Jr. said. A project of this magnitude will create many opportunities, and, if Virginia is selected, we expect Virginia Beach and Hampton Roads will benefit."}

{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on FACE THE NATION, the pomp and pageantry of the opening act of the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump are complete. The cast is set as prosecutors, defenders, jurors, and judge prepare for their roles in what is only the third impeachment trial in American history. But the question of whether there will be witnesses in the trial and who the witnesses might be will likely be delayed until act one is over. It was an unusually subdued Senate as the gravity of a presidential impeachment trial set in last week."}
{"original": "MAN: Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment."}
{"original": "JOHN ROBERTS: Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ceremony over, political posturing is well underway. House impeachment managers, the prosecutors will open their case early this week. It's a now-familiar one, charging with the President with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress."}
{"original": "JERRY NADLER: There is an overwhelming case beyond any reasonable doubt the President betrayed the country."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The defense team led by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump attorney Jay Sekulow has some new recruits, including high-profile celebrity defender Alan Dershowitz and former Clinton prosecutor Ken Starr. They say the House-passed articles of impeachment are constitutionally invalid and that the effort is a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the 2016 election and interfere with 2020. We'll preview the Senate trial with a top House prosecutor, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler and Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn."}
{"original": "We'll also look into the impact of the new revelations from Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas. He is under indictment for campaign finance charges but is implicating the President directly in efforts to push Ukraine into investigating Hunter Biden."}
{"original": "LEV PARNAS: President Trump knew exactly what was going on."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Then former White House Economic Adviser Gary Cohn joins us for a rare interview, weighing in on President Trump's economic record and what 2020 Democrats should be talking about when it comes to the economy."}
{"original": "All that and more, is just ahead on FACE THE NATION."}
{"original": "Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin this morning with House impeachment manager and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler. He joins us from New York. Mister Chairman, good morning to you."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER (D-New York/@RepJerryNadler/Judiciary Committee Chairman): Good morning."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the-- the White House legal team sent their response last night to the articles of impeachment: abuse of power, obstruction of justice. They, on the first, argue that there was no violation of any law. And on the second point, they argue that the President had the right to refuse to produce documents and witnesses due to executive privilege. How are you going to prosecute this case?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: Well, both of those statements are arrant nonsense. There is ample evidence, overwhelming evidence. Any jury would convict in-- in three minutes flat that the President betrayed his country by breaking the law. The GAO, the General Accountability Office, just came out this week and pointed out that withholding money from-- from Ukraine that Congress had appropriated is against the law. But we didn't need them to tell us that. And the reason he did that was in order to extort a foreign government to-- to-- to smear his political opponents for his personal benefits and to help try to rig the 2020 election as he worked with the Russians to try to rig the 2016 election. Same pattern. So, there is no question that working with a foreign-- working with a foreign power, trying to extort a foreign power to interfere in our election is about as bad as-- as you can imagine. The main fear the framers of the Constitution had, why they put the impeachment clause in the Constitution, was they were afraid of foreign interference in-- in our domestic affairs."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: The-- the second thing they say that he broke no law is absurd. Abuse of power is the central reason for the impeachment clause in the Constitution. It's all over the Federalist Papers. It's all over the debates in the constitutional convention. There is no question about it."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: And the evidence is overwhelming."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I-- I-- I want to ask--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: And the-- and the last thing they said is-- is--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: --is that-- is that the President is entitled to withhold documents. No, he's not. The House of Representatives has the impeachment power under the Constitution. And that includes--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: --and the Supreme Court ruled that in the Nixon case that he has every-- that we must demand documents. He-- he can't withhold all the evidence and by the way-- and then say there's not enough evidence."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Well, on the question of witnesses, from what we are hearing from Senate Republicans, there will, eventually, be a vote on whether or not to hear from witnesses. Not a commitment upfront, but an agreement to talk about it and vote on it later. Is there any circumstance in which Democrats would consider, for reciprocity, having Hunter Biden come and testify?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: You know the question of witnesses in any trial, in any trial, all relevant witnesses must be heard. Whether if-- if you're accused of robbing a bank, test-- testimony that I saw him rob the bank or he was somewhere else, he couldn't have robbed the bank, is admissible. It's not negotiable whether you have witnesses. And this whole controversy about whether there should be witnesses is just-- is really a question of, does the Senate want to have a fair trial or do they-- or are they part of the cover up of the President? Any Republican senator who says there should be no witnesses or even that witnesses should be negotiated is part of the cover up."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're saying no way would Hunter Biden ever be called to testify?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: Well, I'm saying that Hunter Biden has no knowledge of the accusations against the President. Did the President, as we said-- as the evidence shows that he did, betray his country--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: --by conspiring with a foreign country to-- to try to rig the election? Hunter Biden has nothing to say about that. They're-- they're asking for Hunter Biden is just more of a smear of Hunter Biden that the President is trying to get the Ukraine to do. But the fact of the matter is, let the chief justice rule on-- on--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: --the chief justice in the first instance rules on evidence. The Senate can overrule him."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: But no chief justice would-- would-- would think of-- of admitting evidence that-- that it is not relevant--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: No trial judge would in any trial."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about evidence because Lev Parnas, the business associate of Rudy Giuliani, some of the documents that he turned over were included in the briefs submitted by Democrats just last night. Are-- many Republicans say--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --shouldn't be admissible at all. Do Democrats want to hear him testify? And given his legal troubles, given his ties to Russian oligarchs, why do you think he is credible?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: Well, he seems to be credible because everything he says corroborates things we knew. New documents that-- that he has brought out corrob-- from the time, corroborate what he was saying. But the-- the main credit, the main thing is all relevant evidence should be admitted. And the President has engaged in a-- in a concerted attempt--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: --to deny all evidence. Everyone who testified defied the President testifying. I mean Mike Pompeo ought to testify. John Bolton ought to testify. What is the President hiding? The President says don't let these people testify. If they were-- if they had exculpatory evidence, he would be saying let them testify."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as you know, the White House argues that it sets a dangerous precedent for future Presidents. But I want to ask you about--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: There is no precedent--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I want to ask you about--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: That is-- that is-- that is nonsense."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the President's legal team or at least some lawyers who are going to be speaking on behalf of the President, Alan Dershowitz among them, Ken Starr also added as someone who is going to be speaking before the Senate. What do you think of their additions to the team? What does that suggest to you as someone who will be prosecuting?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: I am not going to comment on their witnesses, except that Ken Starr thinks that-- apparently, thinks that, asking a foreign government to involve itself in our elections is okay. But the President twenty years ago talking about a private sexual affair, now that's impeachable. I mean he's-- he's-- it's ridiculous."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Alan Dershowitz says it's not a constitutional criteria for impeachment, abuse of power. It doesn't meet that standard."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: Well, I was surprised to see Alan Dershowitz say that. That's simply ignorance. If you read all the history of impeachments in the country, if you read the Federalist Papers, if you read the--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: --consti-- the-- the Constitutional Convention debates from the 1780s, if you read the majority staff report of the House Judiciary Committee in 1974, there's no question about that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Chairman, we'll be watching. Thank you very much for your time this morning."}
{"original": "We now go to a senator who was part of a small group of Republicans invited to discuss impeachment trial strategy with Leader McConnell. That's Texas Senator John Cornyn, who joins us now from Austin. Good morning to you, Senator."}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN (R-Texas/@JohnCornyn): Good morning, Margaret."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What can you expect to see this week? How long will this process take? Will there be a motion to dismiss or are we charging ahead with this trial?"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, we'll start with the introduction of the resolution that will guide the schedule on Tuesday and in the Clinton impeachment that was adopted by a hundred Senators. Here, unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues are probably not going to participate, but it is-- fifty-three senators, I believe, will embrace, essentially, the same rules of the road that applied to the Clinton impeachment trial, deferring the decision about additional witnesses until after both sides have had a chance to make their presentation and senators have a chance to ask questions. And so, we'll be sitting there in our chairs, about probably on the order of six hours a day starting at 1:00 PM on east-- Eastern Time and then six days a week. So this is going to be, I think, kind of a grueling exercise but also one that will be public."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you say there will be at some point a decision on and potentially a vote on whether to allow witnesses. You're in leadership."}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, I would--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do Republicans have the numbers to block that vote from actually approving witnesses to be heard?"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, if I can make a distinction, Margaret, the-- the House heard testimony from seventeen witnesses, more than a hundred hours of testimony. All of that will be available to the impeachment managers to present their case to the Senate. And then after they are through, then if the senators, fifty-one senators, want to hear more then-- then we can vote to subpoena those witnesses."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as you know, House Democrats argue not all the facts have been revealed. That's why they are arguing for new witnesses and new evidence to be introduced. I know you've said you're open to hearing from former National Security Adviser John Bolton. Does that mean that the rest of Republican leadership is open to issuing a subpoena to compel him?"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, I find it curious that Chairman Nadler of the Judiciary Committee called this a rock solid case. But if the House isn't prepared to go forward with the evidence that they produced in the impeachment inquiry, maybe they ought to withdraw the articles of impeachment and-- and start over again. This isn't the Senate's responsibility to make the case. This is the House's responsibility under the Constitution. The Senate's supposed to decide the case sitting as a court of impeachment."}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: So, this is really on the House to make that decision. They can continue to process additional witnesses in the House. They could even vote on additional articles of impeachment. But this to me seems to undermine or indicate that they're getting cold feet or have a lack of confidence in what they've done so far."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- but, yet, you say the door is still open to holding a vote to hear from witnesses. I mean you were Mitch McConnell's--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --number two for-- for some time. Do you think he can control the caucus to prevent a vote to approve witnesses?"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, this is a very serious matter. Obviously, this is the third time in American history where we have had a trial on impeachment charges. Unfortunately, this seems to be more of a political or policy differences than-- than actually a high crime and misdemeanor as the Constitution requires. So, I think we--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So-- so you reject--"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: -- we're going to proceed with caution."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You reject that government watchdog report, the GAO report, that does say there was a violation of the law?"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Certainly not a crime and something that no one had ever dreamed in the past would have been-- risen to the level of impeachment. This is one of the basic problems with the House's case--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But isn't it central--"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: --is the Constitution--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --to that question of the President withholding aid for personal gain, which is the allegation?"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, it's-- it is-- he has been charged with abuse of power, which is not treason, which is not bribery, which is not a high crime and misdemeanor. So, this is the first time in history where a President has been impeached for a non-crime for events that never occurred. Ultimately, the investigation never took place and ultimately the-- their aid was delivered."}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: This is really unique, and I think every senator is going to take this very seriously."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that-- that is certainly what the-- the White House is arguing. But I want to ask you about the legal brief that Democrats did submit. It included a number of things, including documents that have been revealed recently by Lev Parnas, an indicted business associate of Rudy Giuliani. Among them, a letter that says that Rudy Giuliani himself was acting with the approval and knowledge of the President when he was reaching out to the president of Ukraine. Should all of these items be admissible during trial?"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, as you know, Margaret, I was a judge for thirteen years in-- in state courts and in no court in America would that kind of hearsay be admissible. But having said that, I would be--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a letter from Rudy Giuliani."}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, I would be careful before crediting the veracity of somebody who is under indictment in New York, the southern district of New York, and who's trying to get leniency from the prosecutor and who has ties to Russian oligarchs."}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: The Russians have--"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: --had a lot to do with our elections and disinformation campaigns, and this could be part of that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you certainly would have knowledge, since you're on Senate Intelligence on that. But given what you're saying are Lev Parnas' ties to Russian oligarchs, which is often shorthand for Russian mafia, doesn't it trouble you that he was working so closely with Rudy Giuliani, who is acting on the President's behalf and saying he was acting on the President's behalf?"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, there's no question that there have been a-- a series of grifters and other hangers on that have associated themselves with the President's campaign or claimed to have special relationships with the President. But this is not the issue that the Senate's going to be deciding. We'll take the issue of evidence as it comes. If the impeachment managers want to rest their case on the credibility of somebody who's under indictment in the Southern District of New York with extensive ties to Russian oligarchs and organized crime, as you point out, then that's their choice."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is Congress going to investigate, should they investigate what was going on with Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch who, according to these documents released by Lev Parnas, appears to have been under surveillance?"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: I'm sure that will happen. And I know the Ukrainian government has asked for some help in-- in some of this investigation. But, as you point out, I've been a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee during a three-year plus investigation into the Russian active measures campaign. We know that Ukraine was plagued with corruption. We know of the ties between Ukraine and-- and Russian oligarchs, which are proxies for Vladimir Putin. And so, that's why I think we need to approach all of this with a little bit of caution and make sure we have our facts right and make sure we know about the credibility problems that some of these purported witnesses have before we take it at face value."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these text messages, are you saying there's reason not to believe that she was, indeed, being surveilled or potentially at risk?"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Yeah, I just don't know the answer to that. I would say I'd-- I'd say anything is possible in this-- in this smarmy environment in Ukraine and-- and-- and-- and in Russia."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have questions for Rudy Giuliani about any of this?"}
{"original": "SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Not relative to the impeachment. I just, you know, that's-- that's a relationship that causes many of us to sort of scratch our heads. But I'd say he is not relevant to the articles and what the Senate's going to be asked to do, impeaching a President for the third time in American history for a non-crime over events that never occurred."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cornyn, thank you."}
{"original": "And we'll be back in one minute with former director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn. Stay with us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with Gary Cohn. He is the former director of the National Economic Council under President Trump. He's back in the private sector these days. Thank you for being here."}
{"original": "GARY COHN (Former Director of the National Economic Council/@Gary_D_Cohn): Thank you for having me."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the economy is going to be front and center in this election. Many economists say we're overdue for a recession. Do you think we're on the brink of one?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Margaret, first of all, it's great to be here. I know a lot of people have been talking about a recession. I do not see a recession on the horizon here. The U.S. economy is strong and continues to be very strong. The U.S. consumer is very strong. If you look at what's happened in the last couple of years with tax reform, we have put more disposable income in the hands of the U.S. consumer, and the U.S. consumer is out spending it."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So then why is the President and his-- the man currently in the job you once held, Larry Kudlow, continuing to criticize the Fed chairman?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I am not worried about interest rates right now. I think our interest rate policy is in a good place, I think the consumer is in a good place, and I think the U.S. economy is in a good place. We actually have interest rates at a level right now where activity is growing. I think that, you know, fourth quarter GDP will come in around two, two and a half percent--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: --probably two and a half percent."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --you differ from the President on that quibble about interest rates currently?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I don't think I differ from the President on the economy being strong."}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I think we agree completely about the economy is strong."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on interest rates."}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Yeah, I agree that I-- I think the Fed is in a good place on interest rate policy."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about trade. This week the United States and China, the two largest economies in the world, signed this Phase One trade deal. There's like two hundred billion in promised purchases, but there are still like three hundred billion dollars worth of goods under tariff. So what does this actually accomplish? What-- what do you see it?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: So, first of all, anytime the United States and China get together and sign an agreement, I think we should applaud that. I mean the mere fact that we got a ninety-plus-page agreement signed between-- between the two countries is very good relative to where we were months ago when everyone thought we were going to continue to feud with China. So we've got some trade agreement in place. The Chinese are going to buy some more goods from the United States, which has to be a good thing. But there's also, in that agreement, there are some provisions that free up trademarks and trade patents and trade secrets, which is very, very good. No, this didn't--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought this was about intellectual property--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: This didn't-- I said--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and theft and all of those things?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: This didn't address, look, this--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: --did not address the big issue. The big issue the President and I agreed upon is that the Chinese had been stealing our intellectual property. They've been infringing on our-- our trademarks. They've been infringing on our copyrights. It has not addressed that. And we still have to continue to address that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that China is going to hold up its end of the deal and actually enact some of the reforms they say they're going to carry out?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I-- I think they're going to. I think they're going to open up their markets. I think the Chinese have been closed to opening up their markets for the-- for the industries that were listed in there. So I'm cautiously optimistic that the Chinese are going to start reforming and opening up their markets."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you resigned over a difference about tariffs, or at least that was a--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Yeah, I don't think that's actua-- accurate but go ahead."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, then why did you resign?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Well, look, I-- I-- I left the administration for a variety of different reasons. And-- and the President and I had very open conversations about my policy views and his policy views. We'd accomplished a lot. And at the end of the day, he was going a different direction on some of the trade negotiations than I would have gone. I agreed fundamentally on what the issue was."}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I just didn't agree on how to solve the issue."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the steel and aluminum tariffs was what many thought was the impetus for your resignation?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Well, I didn't think--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying it's not?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I didn't think the steel and aluminum tariffs were helpful to our economy."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to the tariffs that were used to get to the-- the negotiating table with China on this deal, or where, ultimately, they ended up with the free trade deal--the new NAFTA, so to speak, USMCA. Can the President say, look, people may not like my tactics, but I got this done? Was he ultimately right? Were you wrong?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: They-- they can say that. I don't think we would have gotten to a different outcome. I don't think the tariffs helped us get to any different outcome."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did it hurt the U.S.?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I think it has hurt the U.S. I think it's totally hurt the United States. Look, the U.S. economy is very strong, very solid. Employment growth is great. But we're missing a big component. We're missing the capital expenditures from companies in the United States. That was a key component to tax reform."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lowering the corporate tax rate is what you thought was going to get companies--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: --not lowering. We actually gave them expensing of CapEx. For the first five years, they get a hundred percent expense their CapEx. But the minute you turn around and put steel and aluminum tariffs on them, the minute a company is thinking about spending capital, what do you go out and buy? You go out and buy steel and aluminum. That's how you build factories. That's how you build property-- plant equipment. So, all of the sudden, the advantages that we were trying to give companies to help stimulate the economy, to build facilities, to go out and hire people, to drive wages, we took away that advantage by taxing the input that they needed to build."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying the President got in his own way?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I'm saying the policies collided with each other."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Gary Cohn, stay with us. And we will be right back in a moment."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: CBS News plans special coverage each day of the Senate impeachment trial proceedings on the broadcast network and on our digital network CBSN, starting this coming Tuesday at 1:00 PM."}
{"original": "As for FACE THE NATION, we'll be right back in a moment."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will have more special coverage each day of the impeachment trial, but stay with us on FACE THE NATION. More of our interview with Gary Cohn, former National Economic Council director under the Trump administration. Stay ahead."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation with former director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn."}
{"original": "So at this signing ceremony the President did this week with China, he said:"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Wednesday): I made a lot of bankers look very good."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The top six U.S. banks saved about thirty-two billion dollars because of the tax cuts that you helped craft. This is analysis, according to-- to Bloomberg News. The-- the hit on the tax law is that it is good for corporations, it's good for business. It's not good for the little guy. Why do you think this analysis is wrong? The President seems to be saying and applauding that he's helping out big banks."}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Well, our-- our tax bill's clearly working, which is great. We have made U.S. businesses competitive again with the rest of the world. We lowered the corporate tax rate to twenty-one percent. So we now have a corporate tax rate that is competitive with the rest of the world. Yes, we lowered corporate tax rates, and that in itself cost less than a hundred billion dollars a year to do that. But it stimulates huge economic growth. The businesses in the United States now can thrive, which means that they can grow. They can go out and hire people, which we've seen. We've seen record unemployment. We've seen record unemployment rates down to three and a half percent. We've seen wage growth. We've seen three-percent-plus wage growth. And, most importantly--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You put this all on the tax law?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: We've seen-- a lot of it has to do with tax law. It has to. We've seen higher-end wage growth at the bottom pay scale than we have at the top. So we're seeing the incentives that we created in the tax law by lowering the corporate rate, we're seeing that happen, and-- and that is happening in the last couple of years."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a whole debate about the contribution to the deficit. But I want to put that aside here because I want to focus in on something--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to focus in on something, though, that-- that is really resonating politically. And it is this broader argument that this country somehow is rigged to benefit the wealthy and disadvantage the poor. And you've even had Jamie Dimon, the CEO of CEO of JPMorgan, you've had Hank Paulson, former Treasury secretary, former head of Goldman Sachs. I know you know him. They have said that they are all concerned about income inequality growing in this country. Are you concerned?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Of course, I'm concerned."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you-- but you don't--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: We-- we're all concerned--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --think in any way that there have been contributions to that through the tax law you helped write?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I-- I think there have been contributions for the positive. I think if you look at the data, you'll see that we have grown wages--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: --at the bottom end of the pay cy-- cycle-- scale, I'm sorry, pay cy-- scale faster than we've grown them at the top. That's exactly what we're trying to do. We're trying to attract more jobs back to the United States, put more people to work. And that's what we're seeing happening."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Michael Bloomberg says about this tax law, Nearly all the money goes to people like me who don't need it. This is a guy who knows Wall Street, who is a billionaire. He is saying that the tax law is-- is only advantaging people like him."}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I'd love to know how it's advantaging him. I'd-- I'd love to see that because at the end of the day, we have lowered rates. I'll agree that we've lowered rates. We have broadened the base, meaning that we make more of your income taxable. That's basic tax policy. Lower rates, broaden base, meaning you get rid of more of the loopholes that people have used to deduct from their income what they pay taxes on. We got rid of a lot of the loopholes."}
{"original": "GARY COHN: So people are having to pay more taxes-- they are having to pay tax on more of their income. Yes, they are paying it at a little lower rate."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to endorse Michael Bloomberg, whose board I believe you sit on--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I do not, I do not--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --as part of one of his Bloomberg entities?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I sit on one of his-- his emerging market boards. I guess it's a board."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that doesn't mean you're necessarily going to be voting for him?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two of the candidates who are also vying for the Democratic nomination--Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren--constantly come back to this idea of income inequality. They have proposed taxes on billionaires, taxes on financial transactions--Elizabeth Warren has, specifically, referred to that. People making over fifty million dollars having an additional two-percent tax. What would the impact of those policies be from your perspective?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Look, our tax system in the United States is very, very progressive. We have-- over fifty percent of the population today of workers do not pay a dollar of federal income tax. So if you're going to collect more revenue, which I am not against, we have to collect more revenue."}
{"original": "GARY COHN: It's going to come from the top half of workers. And, in fact, it's going to come from the top ten percent of workers. That's where-- that's where you can find the taxable income. I think that we will end up doing that. We will potentially need to do that. But these fangled plans that they are coming up with, we don't need to do things like that to collect more income from people. We have a basic tax system that works, and we can do some basic fundamental things, if we need to collect more money. The question is--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: --do we need to collect more money? You know, we look at spending and we look at revenue and we don't talk about them in the same sentence. We-- we collect taxes and then we spend. And-- and Congress never thinks about how much money they have to spend. They just go spend."}
{"original": "GARY COHN: And so you wouldn't run your household like that. I wouldn't run my household like that. I would decide how much revenue I have and then how much I could spend."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're-- you're a Democrat."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a single Democrat that you would consider voting for?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: There-- there-- I-- I'll consider voting for anyone. I vote on policy."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even Elizabeth Warren, whose policy you just tried to--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I will consider voting for anyone, I said. I didn't say I would. I said I'd consider voting for them."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: In pulling apart some of her proposals, you seem to be reflecting a lot of what Wall Street says, which is that there is deep concern over this focus on the financial community, on corporations, etcetera."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --is this enough that you see some of the people you know--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --on Wall Street continuing to vote along lines of whatever the President is putting forward, even if they don't like some of his behavior, vote for him because of what he is doing for--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: --that's a hypothetical question. I don't know. What I do know--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't know who you're voting for?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: --what I do know is the economy is really strong--"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: --and the Democrats haven't really come up with an idea, how to help the economy get even stronger. So it's probably easier to talk about corporate greed, and talk about Wall Street, and talk about technology companies because they don't really have an answer for an economy that's growing two and a half percent with three and a half percent unemployment and three-percent wage growth. I haven't heard their answer on that, except let's tax it to death."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, as you said, you identify as a Democrat. You did have disagreements with the President on a number of things. I was there in Trump Tower the day of the Charlottesville reference--fine people on both sides--I remember your face that day and you were very public about some of your differences with the President. Will you vote for him?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Look, I am very supportive of the President's economic policy. I am very supportive of what he's done on deregulation. I haven't heard anyone who's come up with a better policy, yet. Now, I just don't vote on the economy."}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I vote on a lot of the social issues as well. So, you know, in many respects, I've got to balance both sides of that equation before I figure out who I am going to vote for."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're leaving the door open?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I'm leaving the door open. But at this point I don't have any intention not to vote for the President."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are a frank guy. You're usually pretty direct."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there anyone around the President who can be direct with him right now? Is there anyone doing what you said you did when guiding him on some of these economic policies?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I don't know. I've been gone a year and a half. I-- I am sure there are people when you're talking to the President--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when-- when the President can say, look, I've gotten these tariffs that have helped me get this free trade deal with North America. These tariffs have helped me get this Phase One deal with China--doesn't that encourage the President's approach, one that you have said you have differed with him on?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: It may encourage his approach, but he-- he's also got advisors in there that I'm sure are telling him differences. I know that there are people in there. You know, Secretary Mnuchin and I had a lot of conversations where we agreed on tariffs. And I'm sure the secretary is talking to the President about tariffs and what effect they are having and what effect they are not having."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, I want to ask you about a new book. I know you haven't read it. It's coming out, but there have been excerpts released that directly reference you, which is why--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I want to give you a chance to respond. He's called the President is-- is-- in this meeting accused of calling advisers dopes and babies and the like. Is the-- the description of the President and his management style mat-- matching your experience?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: I don't know what book you're referring to. As you said I haven't read it, so I-- I-- I-- I wouldn't know."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The management style of berating advisers?"}
{"original": "GARY COHN: Look, the-- the President is-- what you see on TV is exactly what you get in private with the President. The President is the same person behind closed doors as he is out in public, which is a-- which is a unique feature. You know it's-- it's not like he turns it on or turns it off when he walks outside. So you have seen everything the President has. That's exactly what you see when you're in a private meeting with him."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Gary Cohn, thank you for your time."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with our political panel. Stay with us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to our political panel for some analysis. Gerry Seib is the executive Washington editor at The Wall Street Journal, Susan Page is the Washington Bureau Chief of USA Today, Ed O'Keefe is our chief political correspondent, and Weijia Jiang covers the White House for CBS News. Welcome to the table."}
{"original": "ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Good to see you."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Gerry, the President seems to have shifted his request for what he wants out of this Senate trial or at least the Senate may not be giving him everything--"}
{"original": "GERALD SEIB (Wall Street Journal/@GeraldFSeib): Yeah."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --he wants. What's going on behind the scenes?"}
{"original": "GERALD SEIB: I think, in the last few days, there has been a feeling that's taken hold that the White House is being conveyed to Senate Republicans that we would like to get this impeachment trial over with as fast as possible as opposed to let's stretch it out, let's have this exonerate the President. I think there is now a real fear that the longer this goes on, the greater the risk of unexpected, unpleasant surprises. And Lev Parnas, who you talked about earlier, kind of illustrated that this week. Somebody comes in out of the blue during the middle of a process, starts saying things that make Republicans very nervous. Maybe that increases the chances that Senate Republicans will vote to call witnesses. That's not where the White House wants to go. So I think you're seeing the President pressure Senate Republicans and you're seeing Senate Republicans having conversations this weekend about how can we speed this up and get to the finish line faster."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Susan, you-- you heard some of this with Senator Cornyn. I mean, he-- he is talking about the gravity of the moment. That doesn't sound like something you put on fast forward."}
{"original": "SUSAN PAGE (USA Today/@SusanPage): You know I thought it was remarkable what we saw over the last couple of days. We-- we've been talking about impeachment since Inauguration Day."}
{"original": "SUSAN PAGE: It's not a surprise that the President is being impeached, although maybe it's a surprise that it's over aid to Ukraine. But I thought that with the transmission of the articles of impeachment with the arrival of the chief justice with the senators signing the oath book that we had a sense of-- have the importance and the gravity of what is ahead. I'm not sure that's going to hold for an impeachment trial, especially with Alan Dershowitz on the-- on the President's defense team. But for at least a moment, it seemed like a different kind, a more serious exercise than it seemed before."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Weijia, you spoke to Alan Dershowitz I know in your reporting. He's got his own legal problems, but he is someone the public knows well from being on television. Ken Starr, people know him from the Clinton impeachment. What is behind this-- this casting, if that's the right word, of these individuals?"}
{"original": "WEIJIA JIANG (CBS News White House Correspondent/@weijia): You know that baggage could follow them, if you believe that the company you keep says something about you. But President Trump clearly doesn't care because he really cares about the appearance of his legal team. And he thinks that Dershowitz and Starr, despite the other things that come along with them, will lend credibility to his case along with, quote, great television ratings, according to an adviser to the White House. So the President thinks that they will make for great TV to put on a show for who he believes are the real jurors in this case, not the senators, but the people watching at home."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will it be great TV, Ed? I mean, this is something that is so-- so solemn, so scripted. The senators can't even speak."}
{"original": "ED O'KEEFE: Right. And I think there's only--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is Mitch McConnell planning for great TV?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or is he seeing something else or not?"}
{"original": "ED O'KEEFE: He's-- he's hoping for a dignified process, and if that means bad TV, so be it. Remember, there's only going to be like four camera angles in the room. We don't get to see the jurors necessarily during this trial. So get no facial reactions from guys like Jim Inhofe or Chris Murphy. You know it's just-- it's just going to be sort of whoever is speaking and the chief justice for the most part. He'll get plenty of air time. Look, McConnell has four priorities here over the course of the next few weeks, manage the Senate and make sure it's a dignified process. But three other important things, he's got to manage the President and his expectations. He's got to manage the fact that several-- twenty-two of his colleagues are up for reelection and about seven or eight of them are in trickier contests than they'd like, and he has his own reelection back home. So he has to be seen as not only maintaining the decorum but also keeping in the back of his mind or in front of him that this could be a factor eleven months from now in elections across the country."}
{"original": "SUSAN PAGE: You know what he's lucky with? John McCain is not in the Senate."}
{"original": "SUSAN PAGE: Can you imagine the fifth and sixth and seventh chores that McConnell would face if John McCain were still representing the state of Arizona? What does that mean others-- Lindsey Graham would do? Does that mean Mitt Romney would feel more empowered to stand up in a serious way?"}
{"original": "ED O'KEEFE: Yeah. And I would-- I would argue, too, that there could be somebody who emerges if not a McCain, some Republican that does step up and say, we do need to allow this to play out a little more."}
{"original": "GERALD SEIB: But we should remember, though, that the-- the moment that would make for great TV to your question would be if John Bolton, the former national security adviser does, in fact, testify. That would be great TV. That would be a dramatic moment. And I think not getting to that point is a top goal of Mitch McConnell and the White House."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And while impeachment does not poll as a political win necessarily for Democrats, it's, apparently, helping fundraising at the RNC, Jerry."}
{"original": "GERALD SEIB: Oh, it has. And it has since for several weeks now. And they've raised millions of dollars, and they've signed up lots of volunteers, people on the Trump team, people out in the country are-- are unhappy about this, and they're voting with their feet and their dollars right now to some extent. By the way one of the other groups that has to be worried about this, the thirty House Democrats who come from districts that Donald Trump won in 2016, and part of what the Republican machinery is doing is going after those people. They voted except for one for impeachment. Republicans would like to ensure they pay a price for that politically as well."}
{"original": "WEIJIA JIANG: The campaign is really capitalizing this as well, too. Sources say every time there's a twist and turn in this entire process, you see that being advertised to supporters, and they say there's a spike in the money that they're bringing in every time something significant happens. And so they're not shying away from this, and-- and they're owning the fact that it's helping them financially. So we'll continue to see sort of this campaign for more money as this process goes on."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there concern in the White House about Lev Parnas, Rudy Giuliani's business associate? You've heard Senator Cornyn and others say, not credible, not worth listening to."}
{"original": "WEIJIA JIANG: There is concern, because there's a recognition among sources who are being honest that even if he's not an official witness, he's already impacting this trial. Unless senators are completely tuned out, they are absorbing what he is saying, and they are seeing what he is dropping in these document dumps. So even though the President insists that he has no idea who Parnas is, the problem is Parnas has receipts. And he--"}
{"original": "WEIJIA JIANG: Exactly, not one, not two, but a whole collection that tells a story of two men who know each other over the course of years, and so the President has to add to his defense, he can't just say, I don't know who he is."}
{"original": "SUSAN PAGE: You know, I think great TV maybe, but I am not sure it matters in the substance of the trial in that there's not really a dispute over what happened. Aid got delayed, the President wanted an investigation of Joe Biden by Ukraine, now there's an argument about whether it's an impeachable offense."}
{"original": "SUSAN PAGE: There's an argument about the President's motives. But-- but in a way the-- the facts are-- are set, and I wonder if at the end of the day when we get to election day, does-- would this even matter? You know, this is--"}
{"original": "SUSAN PAGE: --part of the Presi-- in a way, these people have absorbed this idea already and made up their minds about whether they care."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Ed, what about that and what about some of the jurors who are running for office themselves?"}
{"original": "ED O'KEEFE: Right. So four, of course, are senators running for President, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, and Michael Bennet who spends most of his time in New Hampshire. All of them concede this is going to be a problem for them. All of them were in-- or on the trail again this weekend, trying to button things up admitting to voters, I might not be back before caucus day, sorry about that. They'll send their spouses, they'll send surrogates. They're establishing office hours at their campaign offices across New Hampshire and Iowa for people to come meet their surrogates and ask questions. And they will find ways from Washington if need be to campaign, whether that's holding Skype sessions with voters or calling in to rallies and certainly doing television interviews, but they all understand they could be at a huge disadvantage. And if you look at the schedule in the coming days, who's spending most of their time in Iowa and New Hampshire? Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg who sit up there with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren at the top especially in Iowa. So we've never seen anything like this. And it will really sort of test whether being there and the face time that voters in these early states crave is a factor or whether those four senators have done enough already to bank away goodwill and votes."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Gerry, what do you make, though, of the argument that Democrats need to be campaigning on issues like health care. Speaker Pelosi says, how do you respond to what Gary Cohn laid out, which was it's hard to run against a strong economy."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you turn back to the Senate?"}
{"original": "GERALD SEIB: Well, first of all, I thought it was very instructive that there was almost no discussion of-- of impeachment in the debate the Democrats had this week. They're not eager to talk about this out in the country. Second of all, I think Gary Cohn made a really good point. Where is the conversation in the Democratic primary dialogue about how to create jobs and what the role of the private sector is in creating jobs? You listen in vain. There's no discussion of that. And that's the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren effect on the field, but you wonder whether that's really resonating with the moderates in the party--"}
{"original": "GERALD SEIB: --because they would like to hear some conversation about job creation and good wages and they're not hearing it."}
{"original": "SUSAN PAGE: And, of course, the person talking about that is Mike Bloomberg, who's not even competing--"}
{"original": "SUSAN PAGE: --in Iowa and who I think maybe-- maybe somebody we're not talking about enough in terms of the possibility he could emerge as a contender."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, thanks to all of you."}
{"original": "We will be right back in a moment."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is a lot of news on the Supreme Court beat this week, so who better to bring in for some analysis than our own chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford. Jan, it's good to have you here. You-- you know the court very well, and John Roberts, chief justice, we don't hear from him very often. He will now be at the center of the Senate impeachment trial. What do you-- I mean how is he going to the shape this?"}
{"original": "JAN CRAWFORD (CBS News Chief Legal Correspondent/@JanCBS): Well, that's the-- the thing. I mean we may not hear very much from him at all during this trial, because his role in this trial is completely different than what you think of as the role of a judge. And in a sense he doesn't really have a lot of power. The Senate sets the rules. So they have the first word. And they can overturn any of his rulings by a majority vote. So they have the last word. So John Roberts is going to be in this really kind of weird position where he may rule on some related matters or issues, but then the Senate could overrule him if it disagrees. He has been talking about it."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And now he's stepping into one of the most politically heated partisan environment, staying above that--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --is going to be tough."}
{"original": "JAN CRAWFORD: It will be very tough. And that's why a lot of people said this is a nightmare for the chief justice, but it's also an opportunity, because it's an opportunity to-- for him to show in this hyper partisan environment of the Senate that he is above politics, that he is neutral, that he is not taking one side or the other. So he's going to go there as the face of the Supreme Court and potentially see that as an opportunity to remind the American people that judges are above politics. That is his opportunity and that is also his challenge."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to ask you about something else that seemingly was historic this week. Both Houses of the Virginia legislature voted for-- to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, a lot of people would say, wait, isn't that already law that you have to treat men and women equally? But actually this proposal was never amended to the Constitution. You need thirty-eight states, three-fourths of the country to actually go ahead and do it. Why has that benchmark, why has this country never reached it and gone ahead and amended this in the Constitution?"}
{"original": "JAN CRAWFORD: Well, so I mean that's the great question, right? Because on the surface it seems, you know, really straightforward. Of course, women should be treated equally in the workplace. Of course, women should get the same kind of equal access that men would. And that was the way it was viewed in 1972 when Congress with the broad support, bipartisan supermajority of two-thirds approved that resolution and sent it to the states to ratify. Three-fourths of the states needed to ratify at thirty-eight states. And it gave the states a deadline of seven years to do so. Everyone thought it's going to happen. Thirty states passed it within the first year. Five more got on board pretty soon after that. And then it ground to a halt. And the reason is conservatives started kind of taking issue with certain things, including the issue of abortion. The Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade in 1973 that women had a constitutional right to abortion, and then it occurred to certain ad-- activists that this ERA could further enshrine abortion rights in the Constitution. So it became controversial. And there were other issues that--that activists pointed out on the right that would raise concerns potentially for women."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said something important there, a seven-year deadline. So this means it's expired."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this just symbolic?"}
{"original": "JAN CRAWFORD: Potentially, yes. After this expired in 1979, Congress tried to extend it to 1982 just to give the states more time, and no states jumped at it. So it got stuck at thirty-five. Virginia now ostensibly would be the thirty-eighth state because we've had two other states recently also approve it. In the House later this month is going to take up a resolution to take out that deadline from the original amendment. But that's entirely questionable whether that's constitutional."}
{"original": "JAN CRAWFORD: Congress passed that in 1972 with two-thirds vote. And now to say that they're going to change it with the simple majority, the courts I think it's-- it's pretty suspect. And they're going to have a huge legal battle on that, that potentially going back to John Roberts could make its way to the Supreme Court."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And on to your desk. Jan Crawford, thank you very much."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan."}
{"original": "Tax-preparation firms impeded millions of Americans in using an Internal Revenue Service program that lets people file their taxes for free, a recent U.S. government report concludes."}
{"original": "Most taxpayers qualify to file their returns for free under an IRS-sponsored program known as Free File. But at least five of the 12 commercial tax-prep companies that agreed to provide free software under the program used code to hide their free service from online searches, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found in an audit."}
{"original": "The federal watchdog looked into the Free File program last spring after the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica revealed that TurboTax parent Intuit, H&R Block and other tax-prep companies were steering low-income customers to paid services that could've been done for free."}
{"original": "The Free File program, which the IRS created in 2003, is supposed to let 70% of Americans file their taxes for free. (This year, anyone earning less than $69,000 is eligible.) But the process to use Free File is obscure and complex, the Inspector General's office found."}
{"original": "The only sure way for a taxpayer to file for free is through the IRS' website, irs.gov/freefile. Yet that requirement isn't mentioned in the IRS' agreement with commercial tax preparers, and most taxpayers don't know about it."}
{"original": "Last year, 104 million taxpayers met the criteria to use Free File, but only 2.5 million used it, the audit found. About a third, or 35 million, filed their tax returns through a commercial site. Via follow-up surveys with a sample of those taxpayers, the watchdog estimated that 14 million people paid a fee to file their taxes when they were eligible to file for free."}
{"original": "A detailed flowchart shows just how many clicks a person needs to make to successfully fill out a return via Free File."}
{"original": "Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration"}
{"original": "With Free File mostly absent in online searches, most taxpayers may be unaware the program exists. The IRS hasn't advertised the program since 2014. Nearly 30% of low-income taxpayers contacted in a follow-up survey told TIGTA they didn't know about the offering or its availability."}
{"original": "[T]he IRS does not provide adequate oversight to ensure that the Free File Program is operating as intended, the audit concludes. Moreover, taxpayers are not made aware of protections .... and do not have a process to report concerns."}
{"original": "The report recommends a number of changes, including that the IRS promote Free File and regularly test whether tax-prep firms are complying with the program."}
{"original": "ATLANTA -- Cities all over America are competing to host a new Amazon headquarters and the jobs that go with it. On Thursday, Amazon whittled down the choices from 238 to 20."}
{"original": "Finding a home for Amazon's second headquarters -- the company calls it HQ2 -- became corporate catnip to a frenzy of suitors coast to coast. American communities courted the company with gifts of land and tax incentives worth billions. Stonecrest, Georgia, proposed 345 free acres and even offered to change its name."}
{"original": "Deliberations were secret, but Amazon had a type in mind -- a metropolitan area of more than 1 million people that's a hub for top tech talent."}
{"original": "Atlanta touted its airport, highways and business climate. The city made Amazon's final cut."}
{"original": "The number of jobs and just how positively it could change the landscape of the city. It is a big deal, said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms."}
{"original": "These 20 names on Amazon's new dance card fell heavily in the Midwest, Southeast and Northeast. Here's why: Amazon, the world's largest internet retailer, proposes spending $5 billion to build HQ2, and create up to 50,000 jobs that average $100,000."}
{"original": "I would hope that cities don't enter into a bidding war, said Amy Liu, an urban policy expert at the Brookings Institute."}
{"original": "Liu warns suitors that overspending is only one potential pitfall. Seattle, home of Amazon's world headquarters, has seen a surge in housing costs and traffic congestion."}
{"original": "It will stress the housing market, it will stress the wages in the community, including really leaving some parts of the community behind, Liu said."}
{"original": "But for the 20 finalists, the corporate courtship will only intensify in the weeks ahead. Here in Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal may call a special session of the legislature if necessary to come up with needed sweeteners to reel in Amazon."}
{"original": "The IRS may be auditing fewer tax returns these days, but that doesn't mean you're home free. In fact, the trend is likely to reverse, now that the currently low audit rates have the Treasury Department's attention."}
{"original": "Generally, the IRS has three years to audit tax returns. If it finds a significant understatement of income, it could look back at more years' returns, but not more than the past six. Returns filed in the past two to three years get the most attention."}
{"original": "What should you do if the IRS contacts your for an audit? It's natural to feel panic, but don't. Here are a few things to keep in mind before you respond to the IRS."}
{"original": "The first thing you should know is if your return is selected for an audit, the IRS will notify you by mail on official letterhead. The agency will never call you to initiate an audit or to make a demand to collect taxes. Indeed, it continues to warn the public that calls, texts or emails from individuals claiming to work for the IRS demanding money for unpaid taxes are scams. You should simply hang up or ignore such requests."}
{"original": "The IRS letter will tell you which return(s) it intends to audit and whether it will do so by mail or through an in-person interview. An interview may be conducted at an IRS office or at a field audit, in which the IRS meets you at your home, place of business or your tax preparer's office."}
{"original": "The IRS letter will request information it wants to examine, such as bank deposits or proof of expenses and deductions. It will also provide instructions on how to contact the agency and a date by which your reply is required."}
{"original": "You can proceed with an audit in three ways: attend it personally and speak to the IRS yourself, hire a tax pro to go with you or hire a tax pro to go in your place. My suggestion is that you don't attend an audit -- have your preparer attend or hire a pro to represent you. If you handle the audit yourself or to attend with your representative, you increase the risk that the IRS agent will ask you questions that put you on the spot."}
{"original": "If you do attend the audit, keep in mind that idle conversation with the auditor helps them but could hurt you. The purpose of each question is to get information that can help determine if you've underreported your income or overstated your deductions. Remember, IRS auditors are experienced professionals -- you won't outwit them."}
{"original": "Regardless of how you choose to handle the audit, here are some basic rules:"}
{"original": "Before the audit, get organized. Gather all the records you used to prepare the tax return(s) being audited."}
{"original": "Provide only the documents needed to support the point under discussion. Never give the auditor more information than requested."}
{"original": "Only answer the questions asked. Provide succinct answers, and always respond honestly and briefly. If you're unsure of how to answer a question, make a note of it and offer to get back to the agent with answers."}
{"original": "Never give the auditor original documents, only copies. Make a list of everything you submit."}
{"original": "Remember the reason why you're there: It's not to make new friends. Don't chit-chat or exchange casual conversation. Each comment you make gives the auditor more information about you. But also keep cool and stay calm. Never be argumentative, stubborn or belligerent."}
{"original": "If you hire a tax pro to represent you, wait until your rep has time to review any document before you sign it. Always insist on getting copies of information in the auditor's files or copies of anything that you sign."}
{"original": "If the audit determines you owe additional taxes, the IRS Collection Process will begin. First, the agency will send you a bill, which will include the taxes owed, plus interest and penalties. If you don't pay, you'll get at least one more bill. If you still don't pay, the IRS will begin collection proceedings."}
{"original": "Collection of unpaid taxes can include the IRS applying any tax refunds to your unpaid tax bill, garnishing your wages or seizing your property and assets."}
{"original": "You should always pay the tax owed in full as quickly as possible. If you need time to complete your payment, you can apply for an installment agreement, which can be set up with the IRS online, by phone or by mail."}
{"original": "Around 800,000 federal employees are affected by the ongoing government shutdown. And some 380,000 of those employees are furloughed without pay, while the remainder are working without pay. Many on furlough have been recalled to work, so that Americans can have their tax refunds processed and food and drugs inspected, among other tasks."}
{"original": "If a deal to reopen the government is not reached by midnight Tuesday, federal workers will miss their second paycheck since the shutdown began. The president has signed a bill providing back pay for federal employees when the government re-opens. But for the workers who have gone 32 days without pay, the promise of repayment doesn't address their current financial needs."}
{"original": "Federal employees are receiving assistance at pop-up food banks, including mobile pantries which travel to airports to help TSA officers. The TSA said in a press release that there was a 7.5 percent rate of unscheduled absences Monday, up 4 percent from a year ago, with many employees reporting that they are not able to report to work due to financial limitations."}
{"original": "The 800,000 government workers affected have lost an average of $5,000 each since the shutdown began last month, about $200 million per workday in delayed wages."}
{"original": "Federal workers are not the only Americans negatively affected by the shutdown. The Department of Housing and Urban Development was one of the hardest-hit agencies, with 95 percent of its workforce on furlough due to the shutdown. Several HUD programs intended to support lower-income Americans stopped working on Jan. 1, meaning that many people are unable to pay their rent without the typical assistance from the federal government. Furthermore, several nonprofits which help the homeless and the financially insecure who have been struggling without the typical boost from HUD payments."}
{"original": "The shutdown could also affect the 42 million Americans on food stamps if it extends through the spring. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at the federal level, is one of the agencies unfunded during the partial government shutdown. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue announced this month that SNAP would be funded through February, thanks to the funding bill that expired on Dec. 22, which included a provision allowing federal agencies to make obligated payments to support certain programs for 30 days after its expiration date."}
{"original": "In September 2018, the last month for which data is available, $4.7 billion in SNAP benefits were disbursed throughout every state. If the shutdown continues through March, there will be no remaining funding for SNAP, endangering food stamps for millions of Americans. The Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which assists pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding women, infants, and children up to age 5 who fall within the poverty index and are at nutritional risk, will also run out of funding by March 1."}
{"original": "The ripple effects of the shutdown continue for contractors reliant on the federal government who are unlikely to receive back pay. Applications for unemployment in early January rose in states with large numbers of federal contractors. In Washington D.C., unemployment claims rose to 2,158 from 1,190. In Virginia they jumped to 5,966 from 3,497, and in Maryland to 4,949 from 4,467. In cities like Washington, businesses and restaurants are hurting because of lower traffic."}
{"original": "The shutdown is also affecting government workers who are divorced and who, because of the lack of a paycheck, are unable to provide child support or alimony payments. Several unions are suing the federal government on behalf of unpaid workers."}
{"original": "The effects of the shutdown are not just felt by individuals, but by the economy, too. Average weekly direct and indirect costs of the partial shutdown, which began Dec. 22, currently add up to $1.2 billion, according to Beth Ann Bovino, S&P Global's U.S. chief economist. Monday marked the start of the shutdown's fifth week, and if the government does not reopen by the end of the week, it's on track to exceed the $5.7 billion President Trump wants for a southern border wall."}
{"original": "And the average weekly cost of the shutdown is expected to grow as the damage to industries and consumers both widens and deepens. The longer this shutdown drags on, the more collateral damage the economy will suffer, Bovino wrote."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, President Trump and Congress seem no closer to reaching a deal on reopening the government. Mr. Trump offered a deal to Democrats over the weekend extending temporary protections for the Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program. While the Senate will vote on the deal this week, Democrats have already expressed opposition due to the temporary nature of the extended protections, and the $5.7 billion border wall funding request."}
{"original": "On Jan. 4, Mr. Trump was asked what he would say to federal workers who may not have a financial safety net if they remain unpaid for an extended period of time. He replied that the safety net is going to be having a strong border because we're going to be safe."}
{"original": "This really does have a higher purpose than next week's pay, Mr. Trump said. And the people that won't get next week's pay or the following week's pay, I think if you ever really looked at those people, I think they'd say, 'Mr. President, keep going. This is far more important.'"}

{"original": "SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: America deserves a president who is as resilient as her people."}
{"original": "SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: 2020 is our time to change who makes the rules."}
{"original": "MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This election is just too important, and we cannot afford to get it wrong."}
{"original": "JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There's no limit to what we could get done in the next four years."}
{"original": "TOM STEYER (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Show up in November of 2020 and win."}
{"original": "WARREN: Together, we have built a movement."}
{"original": "STEYER: We have a fantastically diverse and wonderful party."}
{"original": "BIDEN: We choose hope over fear."}
{"original": "SANDERS: We are going to unite together."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: And, together, we are going to get it done."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: We will deliver a democracy worthy of the name."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: We are here, and we are strong."}
{"original": "ANNOUNCER: Live from the Gaillard Center in Charleston, South Carolina, this is the CBS News Democratic debate."}
{"original": "Here are the seven candidates for the presidential nomination."}
{"original": "The Democratic presidential primary here in South Carolina, the first primary in the South, is just four days away."}
{"original": "KING: And Super Tuesday is just a week away. And this is the biggest primary day of the year, as voters in 14 states cast ballots, and many of them tell us they have not actually made up their mind."}
{"original": "So, this debate, when you think about it tonight, may be the last, best chance for the candidates to make their case to South Carolina and Super Tuesday voters."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: And CBS News is proud too bring you this debate, along with our co-sponsors."}
{"original": "They are the Democratic National Committee and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, a nonpartisan organization committed to educating voters and training political leaders."}
{"original": "KING: And we are partnering tonight also with Twitter."}
{"original": "So, you at home can participate in this debate. How do you do that? Send us your questions for the candidates using the Twitter hashtag #DemDebate."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Now, here are the rules for the next two hours."}
{"original": "When you are asked a question, you will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer, and 45 seconds for follow-ups."}
{"original": "Senator Sanders, we haven't had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years. Here in South Carolina, the unemployment rate is even lower."}
{"original": "How will you convince voters that a Democratic socialist can do better than President Trump with the economy?"}
{"original": "SANDERS: Well, you're right. The economy is doing really great for people like Mr. Bloomberg and other billionaires."}
{"original": "SANDERS: In the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth."}
{"original": "But you know what? For the ordinary American, things are not so good. Last year, real wage increases for the average worker were less than 1 percent. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck; 87 million Americans have no health insurance or are underinsured; 45 million people are struggling with student debt; 500,000 people tonight are sleeping out on the street, including 30,000 veterans."}
{"original": "That is not an economy that's working for the American people. That's an economy working for the 1 percent."}
{"original": "We're going to create an economy for all, not just wealthy campaign contributors."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Mayor Bloomberg, I'll let you respond to that."}
{"original": "Do you think Senator Sanders' economy would be better for America than President Trump's?"}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: I -- I think that Donald Trump thinks it would be better if he's president. I do not think so."}
{"original": "Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States."}
{"original": "And that's why Russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him."}
{"original": "Let me tell Mr. Putin, OK, I'm not a good friend of President Xi of China. I think President Xi is an authoritarian leader."}
{"original": "And let me tell Mr. Putin, who interfered in the 2016 election, try to bring Americans against Americans, hey, Mr. Putin, if I'm president of the United States, trust me, you're not going to interfere in any more American elections."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: Look, we know what the president -- what Russia wants. It's chaos."}
{"original": "SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So, look, the way I see this is that Bernie is winning right now because the Democratic Party is a progressive party, and progressive ideas are popular ideas, even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don't want to say so."}
{"original": "WARREN: You know, but Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie."}
{"original": "And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard, and it's going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen."}
{"original": "Bernie and I both wanted to help rein in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance. But I dug in. I fought the big banks. I built the coalitions, and I won."}
{"original": "Bernie and I both want to see universal health care, but Bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there, doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it, and doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it."}
{"original": "WARREN: I dug in. I did the work. And then Bernie's team trashed me for it."}
{"original": "We need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work, and actually get it done. Progressives have got one shot. And we need to spend it with a leader who will get something done."}
{"original": "KING: Mayor Buttigieg, we want to bring you in this conversation."}
{"original": "KING: Why would the Russians want to be working on behalf of Bernie Sanders?"}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: I will tell you what the Russians want. They don't have a political party. They want chaos."}
{"original": "And chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders vs. Donald Trump."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: Think about what that will be like for this country."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: And, meanwhile, folks at home, from South Carolina to South Bend, are trying to figure out what any of this means for us, because it's right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up, and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement."}
{"original": "But, also, there's a majority of the American people who I think right now just want to be able to turn on the TV, see their president, and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit, instead of up through the roof."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: We have an opportunity to set a different tone."}
{"original": "STEYER: Bernie Sanders' analysis is right."}
{"original": "The difference is, I don't like his solutions. I don't believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families."}
{"original": "I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant, competitive private sector."}
{"original": "But we all know, unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer is not for the government to take over the private sector, though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again."}
{"original": "STEYER: We need to -- well, let me just finish, because we need to have an alternative to Donald Trump."}
{"original": "I'm talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10 percent for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over 4.5 million good-paying union jobs."}
{"original": "STEYER: Donald Trump thinks -- he's incompetent as a steward of the American economy. We have to show that we can create a growing, prosperous economy that works for American working people."}
{"original": "KING: Mr. Steyer, thank you. Your time is up."}
{"original": "BIDEN: You know, when we talk about progressive, let's talk about being progressive."}
{"original": "Walking distance of here is Mother Emanuel Church, nine people shot dead by a white supremacist."}
{"original": "Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and wanted a waiting period..."}
{"original": "A waiting period of 12 hours. I'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared."}
{"original": "In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama -- he wanted a primary-- he said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should, and, in fact, the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, this is -- let's talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done, and that's what we got done. We got a lot done"}
{"original": "KING: Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, your response."}
{"original": "SANDERS: You know, Pete mentioned -- I'm hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight."}
{"original": "SANDERS: I wonder why. And maybe, you know, Pete mentions what the American people want. I will tell you, Pete, what the American people want, and, Joe, what the American people want. They don't want candidates to be running to billionaires for huge amounts of funding."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: All right, let's clear this up once and for all."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Pete has gotten funding from over 50 billionaires."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: You've got people believing something that is false. This needs to be cleared up."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Joe, I think, has gotten a little bit more. What the American people want, by the way, and a lot of the issues we'll be discussing tonight are issues I raised four years ago: raising the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour. Making public colleges and universities tuition-free. And finally, doing what every other major country on Earth does, guaranteeing health care to all people as a human right through a Medicare for All, single-payer system."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: I can't allow -- I can't allow this to stand because it's just not true. Senator Sanders..."}
{"original": "KING: We're going to allow everyone an opportunity opportunity to respond."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: ... has got people believing something that is untrue about my campaign. The idea that most of my campaign is funded by billionaires..."}
{"original": "SANDERS: I didn't say that, Pete."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: Fifty people, all right. In Charleston alone, just in Charleston, over 2,000 people have contributed to my campaign. That means the dollars that have come to my campaign, just from Charleston, is more than the dollars that have come from the 50 people that you mentioned. Grassroots contributions are the life blood of my campaign."}
{"original": "In fact, I shouldn't miss the opportunity, if you're watching right now and you support my campaign, go to peteforamerica.com, and chip in. And if you are watching right now, and you're a billionaire, I will raise your taxes. But if you'd like to defeat Donald Trump, please go to peteforamerica.com and donate legal maximum of $2,800, if you're a billionaire."}
{"original": "KING: All right, all right, Mayor Buttigieg."}
{"original": "Vice President Biden, I want to make -- I want to bring us to another topic. We're in South Carolina. It's the first primary with a significant black voting population. Your numbers appear to be slipping with black voters. And I'm wondering if you could respond about why that is happening to you at this particular time."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Well, first of all, the latest poll I saw, my numbers -- I'm still 15 points ahead, the latest poll."}
{"original": "KING: Yes, yes, you're correct. You're correct."}
{"original": "KING: But Senator Sanders is in striking distance of you. You are within the margin of error in this state."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Well, it depends which -- look, I've earned the vote, I've worked like the devil to earn the vote of the African-American community, not just here but across the country. I've been coming here for years and years, creating jobs here, making sure that the port, for example, that employs one in 11 people, we put $500 million, in our administration, just into this county. We've created jobs for people."}
{"original": "The people know me. My entire career has been wrapped up in dealing with civil rights and civil liberties. I don't expect anything. I plan to earn the vote. I'm here to ask. I'm here to earn it. But, folks, I intend to win in South Carolina, and I will win the African-American vote here in South Carolina."}
{"original": "KING: Mr. Biden, will you continue if you do not win South Carolina? You have said that South Carolina will determine the outcome of this presidential race. If you don't win South Carolina, will you continue in this race?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: I will win South Carolina."}
{"original": "Mayor Bloomberg, I'd like to bring you into this conversation. I want to ask you about a question that impacts the black and brown community. You've apologized for stop and frisk repeatedly. What exactly are you apologizing for?"}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: We let it get out of control and when I realized that, I cut it back by 95 percent. And I've apologized and asked for forgiveness. I've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how I can better position myself and what I should have done and what I should do next time."}
{"original": "But let me tell you, I have been working very hard. We've improved the school system for black and brown students in New York City. We've increased the jobs that are available to them. We've increased the housing that's available to them. We have programs like the..."}
{"original": "KING: But what more can you do about this issue, Mr. Mayor, to put people's fears and skepticism to rest? It continues to follow you."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: No -- well, that's because it's in their interest to promote that. But if you talk to the people in New York City, I have over 100 black elected officials that have endorsed me. A lot of them are in the audience tonight. And I've earned the respect of people in New York City."}
{"original": "I was the mayor of the largest, most populous city in the United States for 12 years, and people will tell you it's a lot better city today. It is safer for everybody. The school system is better. The budget is under control. We've done the things that people need in New York City for all ethnicities."}
{"original": "KING: Mayor Buttigieg, mayor to mayor, mayor to mayor, you've certainly had your issues with the black community as well. Do you think the New York City's implementation of stop and frisk was racist?"}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: Yes, in effect, it was. Because it was about profiling people based on their race. And the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped white people too often and minorities too little. And I'm not here to score points. I come at this with a great deal of humility, because we have had a lot of issues, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community."}
{"original": "And I come to this with some humility because I'm conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice. None of us -- none of us have the experience, the lived experience of, for example, walking down the street, or in a mall, and feeling feeling eyes on us, regarding us as dangerous, without knowing the first thing about us just because the color of our skin."}
{"original": "None of us had the experience that black women have had that drives that maternal mortality gap that we are all rightly horrified by, of going into a doctor, and being less likely to have your description of being in pain believed because of your race. Since we don't have the experience, the next best thing we can do..."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: ... is actually listen to those who do."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: I know -- wait a second. I know that if I were black, my success would have been a lot harder to achieve. And I know a lot of black people that if they were white it would have been a lot easier for them. That's just a fact, and we've got to do something about it than rather just demagogue about it."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, was the way that the mayor implemented stop and frisk racist?"}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: Yes, and I think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where we're going to go forward. Martin Luther King once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly. So when there is racism in the criminal justice system, then we need to fix it."}
{"original": "And to me that means sentencing reform, like the First Step Act, and extending that to the states with the Second Step Act. It means equal opportunity. Because if we don't pass Representative Clyburn's bill out of South Carolina here to invest in impoverished communities, we're never going to get to that single garment of destiny."}
{"original": "And we also need to do something about child care, about making sure we increase the minimum wage. And then, finally, voting. While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls. Georgia kicked 100,000 off. As president, I will get voting rights to be a reality for everyone."}
{"original": "KING: Senator Warren, I'm coming to you. I want to direct this question to you because you -- because Mayor Bloomberg has said he got in this race late because he doesn't believe that any of you on stage can beat Donald Trump. You said Mayor Bloomberg is not the safest candidate, he is the riskiest candidate. What did you mean by that?"}
{"original": "WARREN: I mean that Mayor Bloomberg -- let's think of it this way. We're here in Charleston, and you know who is going to be in Charleston later this week is Donald Trump. He's going to be here to raise money for his buddy Senator Lindsey Graham, who funded Lindsey Graham's campaign for re-election last time? It was Mayor Bloomberg."}
{"original": "And that's not the only right-wing senator that Mayor Bloomberg has funded. In 2016, he dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania Senate race to help re-elect an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator. And I just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. She lost by a single point."}
{"original": "In 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger. That was me. It didn't work, but he tried hard."}
{"original": "WARREN: I don't care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has. The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust. I will. And the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the Democratic Party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage."}
{"original": "KING: All right, Senator Warren, thank you."}
{"original": "Mayor Bloomberg, would you like to respond? Mayor Bloomberg?"}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: I have been training for this job since I stepped on the pile that was still smoldering on 9/11. I know what to do. I've shown I know how to run a country. I've run the city which is almost the same size -- bigger than most countries in the world."}
{"original": "I am not the -- I'm the one choice that makes some sense. I have the experience. I have the resources. And I have the record. And all those sideshows that the senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that. When people hired me to run New York City three times, in an overwhelmingly Democratic, progressive city, they elected me again and again."}
{"original": "WARREN: I was mentioned in this."}
{"original": "WARREN: He called me out by name."}
{"original": "BIDEN: There was a -- I thought..."}
{"original": "WARREN: ... and referred to what I talk about as a sideshow. You know, this is personal for me. When I was 21 years old, I got my first job as a special education teacher. I loved that job. And by the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant."}
{"original": "The principal wished me luck and gave my job to someone else. Pregnancy discrimination, you bet. But I was 21 years old. I didn't have a union to protect me. And I didn't have any federal law on my side. So I packed up my stuff, and I went home. At least I didn't have a boss who said to me, Kill it, the way that Mayor Bloomberg is alleged to have said..."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: I never said that. Oh, come on."}
{"original": "WARREN: ... to one of his pregnant employees. People want a chance to hear..."}
{"original": "People want a chance to hear from the women who have worked for..."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: I never said that. And for the record, if she was a teacher in New York City, she would never have had that problem. We treated our teachers the right way, and the unions will tell you exactly that."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Well, Mayor Bloomberg, Senator Warren has raised..."}
{"original": "WARREN: Then let us -- let us have -- the women have an opportunity to speak. The Bloomberg corporations and Mayor Bloomberg himself have been accused of discrimination. They are bound by nondisclosures so that they cannot speak. If he says there is nothing to hide here, then sign a blanket release and let those women speak out..."}
{"original": "WARREN: ... so that they can tell their stories the way I can tell my story without having the fear they're going to be sued by a billionaire."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Thank you. Thank you. We have a number of issues to discuss tonight, but I want to give the mayor an opportunity to respond, because she has raised concerns about women in your workplace. At the last debate, you said some of your female employees might not have liked some of your jokes. Did these women take your jokes wrong? Or were you wrong to make the jokes?"}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: Probably wrong to make the jokes. I don't remember what they were. So I assume -- if it bothered them, I was wrong, and I apologize. I'm sorry for that."}
{"original": "But what happened here is we went back 40 years and we could only find three cases where women said they were uncomfortable. Nobody accused me of doing anything other than just making a comment or two. And what the senator did suggest was that we release these women from the nondisclosure agreement. I did that two days later, and my company has said we will not use nondisclosure agreements ever again. The senator has got it. And I don't know what else she wants us to do."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: We're following exactly what she asked to do."}
{"original": "WARREN: I'll tell you exactly what I want you to do."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: And the trouble is with this senator, enough is never enough for what this -- I'm going to start focusing on some of these other things. We just cannot continue to re-litigate this every time. We did what she asked. And, thank you, we've probably made the world better because of it. And by my company renouncing using these, we probably changed, hopefully, the corporate landscape all across America."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: If you get nominated, we'll be re-litigating this all year."}
{"original": "WARREN: Sorry, Mayor, you did not do what I asked."}
{"original": "KING: Senator Warren, that is a very serious charge that you leveled at the mayor."}
{"original": "KING: He told a woman to get an abortion. What evidence do you have of that?"}
{"original": "KING: And, Mayor Bloomberg, could you respond to this?"}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: I never said it, period, end of story. Categorically never said it. When it was accused -- when I was accused of doing it, we couldn't figure out what she was talking about. But right now, I'm sorry if she heard what she thought she heard, or whatever happened. I didn't take any pleasure in that. And we've just got to go on. But I never said it. Come on."}
{"original": "WARREN: What I asked the mayor to do is to do a release of all people who have discrimination claims..."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: We are doing that, Senator."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: We want to get to the -- we want to get to the issue -- we want to get to the issue of electability and the ideological difference within the Democratic Party."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, the cost of your agenda. Yesterday, you released information about how you will pay for your major proposals, but not all of your details are clear. You've proposed more than $50 trillion in new spending."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: You've said Medicare for all will cost $30 trillion."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: But you can only explain how you'll pay for just about half of that. Can you do the math for the rest of us?"}
{"original": "SANDERS: How many hours do you have?"}
{"original": "SANDERS: No, it's not the problem. All right, let's talk about Medicare for all. I'm sure you're familiar with the new study that just came out of Yale University, published in Lancet magazine, one of the prestigious medical journals in the world. You know what it said? Medicare for all will lower health care costs in this country by $450 billion a year and save 68,000 lives of people who otherwise would have died."}
{"original": "What we need to do is to do what every other major country on Earth does: guarantee health care to all people, not have thousands of separate insurance plans, which are costing us some $500 billion a year to administer."}
{"original": "Our plan -- we have laid out options all over the place. One of the options is a 7.5 percent payroll tax on employers, which will save them substantial sums of money. Another..."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: Bernie, let me -- let me respond to this."}
{"original": "SANDERS: You asked me a question."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, does the math add up?"}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: No, the math does not add up. In fact, just on 60 Minutes this weekend, he said he wasn't going to rattle through the nickels and the dimes. Well, let me tell you how many nickels and dimes we're talking about: nearly $60 trillion. Do you know how much that is, for all of his programs?"}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: That is three times the American economy -- not the federal government -- the entire American economy. The Medicare for all plan alone on page eight clearly says that it will kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years. That is true."}
{"original": "As one prominent Democrat once said, we should pay attention to where the voters of this country are, Bernie. That prominent Democrat was Barack Obama a few months ago. And I think that's what we should do. They are not with you on spending nearly $60 trillion."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: What I think we should do is make things more affordable, nonprofit public option, make sure we're paying for long-term care better, take on the pharmaceuticals, like you and I have done together..."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: ... and do something for the people of America."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: Instead of a bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers."}
{"original": "KING: Mr. Steyer -- Mr. Steyer..."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: I think we're talking about math."}
{"original": "KING: We'll get to you, Mr. Sanders."}
{"original": "SANDERS: No, I think -- Tom, I think she was talking about my plan, not yours."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: I think we were talking about math, and it doesn't take two hours to do the math."}
{"original": "SANDERS: No, no, well, let's talk about math."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: Because let's talk about what it adds up to."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: Let's talk about math, indeed. OK, so here's the math..."}
{"original": "SANDERS: If we do nothing is what..."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Excuse me, can I respond to the attack?"}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: To do nothing is what will happen..."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, you are allowed a quick response and then we would like to allow the other candidates..."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Listen to the moderator, guys."}
{"original": "SANDERS: The moderator -- is it my turn?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: This helps a lot, doesn't?"}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, you have been name checked. You are allowed to respond."}
{"original": "SANDERS: OK. What the Health and Human Services have said in analyzing health care costs, what Yale -- recent Yale study has said is that your program would cost some $50 trillion over a 10-year period. We would continue to pay in some cases 10 times more for the same exact prescription drugs. What every study out there -- conservative or progressive -- says, Medicare for all will save money. Ours will cost about $45 billion, not $60 trillion."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: Bernie, I was talking about -- I was talking about..."}
{"original": "KING: We would like -- Senator Sanders, we would like to bring Mr. Steyer in on this conversation."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: I was talking about all your programs."}
{"original": "STEYER: Excuse me, Amy. This conversation shows a huge risk for the Democratic Party. We are looking at a party that has decided that we're either going to support someone who is a democratic socialist or somebody who has a long history of being a Republican."}
{"original": "And let me say that I got into this race because I wanted to fight for economic justice, for racial justice, and to make sure we had climate justice for the American people. And I am scared."}
{"original": "If we cannot pull this party together, if we go to one of those extremes, we take a terrible risk of re-electing Donald Trump."}
{"original": "STEYER: And that is something -- I still have some time. And let me say this."}
{"original": "STEYER: That is a risk that will hurt the American people in a way that none of us on this stage should be willing to risk."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Thank you. Let's keep this topic going. Mayor Pete?"}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: So let's do this math. Senator Sanders at one point said it was going to be $40 trillion, then it was $30 trillion, then it was $17 trillion. That's an incredible shrinking price tag. At some point, has said it is unknowable to even see what the price tag would be. Now there are new numbers."}
{"original": "I'll tell you exactly what it adds up to."}
{"original": "It adds to four more years of Donald Trump, Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House, and the inability to get the Senate into Democratic hands."}
{"original": "The time has come for us to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters. Not only is this a way to get Donald Trump reelected."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: We got a House to worry about. We got a Senate to worry about. And this is -- this is really important."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: ... if you want to keep the House in Democratic hands, you might want to check with the people who actually turned the House blue, 40 Democrats, who are not running on your platform."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: They are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: I want to send those Democrats back to the United States House."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: ... when they say that they don't want to be out there defending Senator Sanders..."}
{"original": "KING: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg."}
{"original": "I guess the only way you do this is jump in and speak twice as long as you should."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Here's the deal. Here's the deal."}
{"original": "Look, a guy who's a friend of mine down here named Fritz Hollings -- he passed away -- he said, you want to know what a woman will do, look what they have done. Look what they have done."}
{"original": "You talk about -- concerned about race. Well, my good friend on the end of this platform, he, in fact, bought a system that was a private prison system, after, after he knew that, in fact, what happened was, they hog-tied young men in prison here in this state."}
{"original": "They, in fact, made sure that, in Georgia, they did not have health care for the people who were being held. They, in fact, went on, and he said, after he knew that, he bought it. And then he said he was proud of his accomplishment."}
{"original": "You talk about what we're talking about with Bernie. Bernie, in fact, hasn't passed much of anything. The fact of the matter is..."}
{"original": "STEYER: OK. But I get to answer."}
{"original": "STEYER: I get to answer that."}
{"original": "BIDEN: The -- look -- look..."}
{"original": "I'm not out of time. You spoke over time, and I'm going to talk."}
{"original": "The fact of the matter is, look at what's happening here. Look at what's happening here. We have to win the Senate back."}
{"original": "And, by the way, I went into all of those races that got 41 new Democrats. The majority of them are supporting me for president and endorsing me."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: And, Mr. Vice President, I have to allow -- yes, Mr. Mayor."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Mr. Mayor, you're allowed to respond."}
{"original": "STEYER: I bought stock in a prison company thinking they would do a better job. And I investigated. And I sold it."}
{"original": "BIDEN: But you knew -- you knew when you bought it they'd done that."}
{"original": "STEYER: I get to answer this question."}
{"original": "And, in fact, since then, I have worked to end the use of private prisons in my home state, and we have ended it. I have started a bank to support black ownership of businesses, women ownership of businesses, and Latino owners of businesses, because this financial service industry is prejudiced."}
{"original": "I have worked tirelessly on this. And you know I'm right. You wrote the crime bill that you called..."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Where we come from, that's called Tommy come lately."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: There are other people here."}
{"original": "STEYER: ... crime bill that put hundreds of thousands of young black and Latino men in prison."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: OK. Let me say something."}
{"original": "STEYER: There's something going on here. I have worked for racial justice..."}
{"original": "STEYER: ... completely. And that is an absolute unfair statement."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: ... if we spend the next four months tearing our party apart, we're going to watch Donald Trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: So, my argument here is that we need to get back to what's happening right now."}
{"original": "We have a clear choice of who's going to lead this party. And I am the only one in the New Hampshire debate, when asked, if we had a problem with a socialist leading the ticket, that raised my hand."}
{"original": "I like Bernie. We came in together to the Senate. But I do not think that this is the best person to lead the ticket."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: And if you want to talk about getting things done and make a comparison, according to Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, last Congress, I was the most effective Democrat in the U.S. Senate on 15 metrics."}
{"original": "Bernie and Elizabeth were in the bottom half. It matters -- it matters if you can actually get things done."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: It is not just who talks the best, who actually gets things done."}
{"original": "And especially with the African-American community, there have been a lot of broken promises.. And I think having someone that keeps their promises and follows through and is going to get things done for these people matters. And that's why I ask for your support."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: Let's just go on the record."}
{"original": "They talk about 40 Democrats; 21 of those were people that I spent $100 million to help elect. All of the new Democrats that came in and put Nancy Pelosi in charge and gave the Congress the ability to control this president..."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: ... I -- I got them."}
{"original": "Number two, when you talk about money, let's put this in perspective. The federal budget is $4.5 trillion a year. We get $3.5 trillion in revenue. We lose $1 trillion a year."}
{"original": "That's why the federal budget -- deficit is -- right now, the debt is $20 trillion, going up to 21."}
{"original": "We just cannot afford some of this stuff people talk about. But if you..."}
{"original": "If you keep on going, we will elect Bernie. Bernie will lose to Donald Trump. And Donald Trump and the House and the Senate and some of the statehouses will all go red."}
{"original": "And then, between gerrymandering and appointing judges, for the next 20 or 30 years, we're going to live with this catastrophe."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: I will allow Senator Sanders a quick response, and then Senator Warren."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Thank you very much, Norah."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, a quick response, and then Senator Warren."}
{"original": "Mayor Bloomberg has a solid and strong and enthusiastic base of support. The problem is, they're all billionaires."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Now, if you look -- oh."}
{"original": "On the other hand, of the last 50 polls that have been done nationally, Mr. Bloomberg, I beat Trump 47 of those 50 times."}
{"original": "If you look at battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, polling just done this Sunday..."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: The polls aren't the election."}
{"original": "And if you want to beat Trump, what you're going to need is an unprecedented..."}
{"original": "SANDERS: ... grassroots movement of black and white and Latino, Native American and Asian, people who are standing up and fighting for justice."}
{"original": "SANDERS: That's what our movement is about."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: Can anybody -- can anybody in this room imagine moderate Republicans going over and voting for him?"}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: And you have to do that, or you can't win."}
{"original": "And that is that a progressive agenda is popular, Mayor Bloomberg."}
{"original": "And, for everyone on this stage, we talk about how to build a future. That's what matters."}
{"original": "I talk to people in selfie lines every day who tell me about the importance of getting real help on health care. It's why I also have a way to pay for health care that doesn't raise taxes on middle-class families."}
{"original": "But it's so much more than that. As Democrats, we need to speak to the future we can build together. We need to speak of the prosperity we can build together."}
{"original": "How about a wealth tax in America? Because with a 2 cent tax on just the top one-tenth of 1 percent, we have a chance to invest in universal child care for every one of our babies, to really level the playing field."}
{"original": "WARREN: Put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities."}
{"original": "WARREN: And start closing the racial wealth gap by canceling student loan debt for 43 million Americans."}
{"original": "WARREN: We need to talk about our aspirations, our hopes."}
{"original": "WARREN: ... to choose hope over fear."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: We have to take a quick break."}
{"original": "When we come back, the Democratic presidential debate continues right after this, only on CBS."}
{"original": "KING: I'm Gayle King with Norah O'Donnell. Joining us now on the question here in Charleston, South Carolina are CBS News colleagues, the A team, Bill Whitaker of 60 MINUTES, chief Washington correspondent, that's Major Garrett, and Margaret Brennan, moderator of FACE THE NATION."}
{"original": "We're going to begin with you, Vice President Biden, for this part. Just across the street, as you mentioned at the top of the debate, is the theater (sic) where nine people were shot and killed inside the Mother Emanuel Church. We all remember that day back in 2015."}
{"original": "And every day in our country, over 100 people die from gun violence. You all have plans, I know, on this stage, to address the gun crisis. But Congress has not been able to pass a major gun legislation in a quarter of a century. And just think about this, in those 25 years we've had Columbine, Newtown, Parkland, Las Vegas. We could go on and on."}
{"original": "Vice President Biden, I want to start with you, why should anyone have faith that you're the one who can get this done now?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: Because I'm the only one that ever got it done nationally. I beat the NRA twice. I got assault weapons banned. I got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them. I got them eliminated. Except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in Florida and it was not reauthorized."}
{"original": "In addition to, that I passed the Brady Bill with waiting periods. I led that fight. But my friend to my right and others have in fact also gave into the gone manufacturers, absolute immunity. Imagine if I stood here and said we'd give immunity to drug companies. We would give immunity to tobacco companies. That has caused carnage on our streets, 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. More than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on."}
{"original": "Carnage on our streets. And I want to tell you, if I'm elected, NRA, I'm coming for you, and gun manufacturers, I'm going to take you on and I'm going to beat you. I'm the only one who has done it."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: That's why we have got to change what Washington can deliver."}
{"original": "WARREN: So this is about being able to dig in and talk about what really it's going to take to get something done. I've been in the Senate. What I've seen is gun safety legislation introduced, get a majority, and then doesn't pass because of the filibuster. Understand this, the filibuster is giving a veto to the gun industry."}
{"original": "It gives a veto to the oil industry. It's going to give a veto on immigration. Until we're willing to dig in and say that if Mitch McConnell is going to do to the next Democratic president what he did to President Obama, and that is try to block every single thing he does, that we are willing to roll back the filibuster, go with the majority vote, and do what needs to be done for the American people."}
{"original": "KING: We're going to stay on this top and allow Senator..."}
{"original": "BIDEN: ... and I can beat Mitch McConnell."}
{"original": "WARREN: Understand this, many people on this stage do not support rolling back the filibuster. Until we're ready to do that, we can't have real change."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: I want to allow Senator Sanders to respond because you've gone after the insurance industry. You've taken on pharmaceutical companies. And you've taken on big tech. Why did you vote repeatedly to give gun manufacturers a pass?"}
{"original": "SANDERS: Well, you know, Joe has voted for terrible trade agreements."}
{"original": "SANDERS: No, no, no, no, no. Joe voted for the war in Iraq. My point was, not to be -- I have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes. That was a bad vote. I have today a D-minus voting record from the NRA. Thirty years ago, I likely lost a race for the one seat for Congress in Vermont because 30 years ago, I opposed -- I supported a ban on assault weapons. Thirty years ago."}
{"original": "Right now, my view is we need to expand background checks, end the gun show loophole, and do what the American people want, not what the NRA wants."}
{"original": "BIDEN: OK, but wait a second..."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: ... the opposition to the filibuster is not a discretion from a long time ago."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: I think she recognized me, thank you. I have a 6 million-person organization around this country. Moms Demand Action and Everytown."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: We have put background checks -- we have got background checks in 20 states. So you can do it. It's Congress that can't seem to do it. And I don't know why we think they're going to do it. The vice president voted for a death bill, and supported the NRA. And certainly Senator Sanders has supported the NRA."}
{"original": "But we can do this. We have just got to stop talking about it."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: But the way we do it -- the way we do it is having someone leading the ticket from a part of the country that we actually needs the votes. So I have long supported the assault weapon ban. I am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can't go out and get an AK-47."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: That bill, along with -- you didn't write that bill. I wrote that bill."}
{"original": "BIDEN: I wrote the bill, the Violence Against Women Act..."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: OK. You did you that."}
{"original": "BIDEN: ... that took out of the hands of people who abused their..."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: OK. We'll have a fact check look at this."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Let's look at the fact check..."}
{"original": "BIDEN: The only thing that the boyfriend loophole is was not covered. I couldn't get that covered. You, in fact, when you were -- as a senator tried to get it covered and Mitch McConnell is holding it up on his desk right now, and we're going to lose the Violence Against Women Act across the board."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: OK. So, if I could finish. I have the bill. Anyone can check it out, to close the boyfriend loophole. Also to close the Charleston loophole is another bill that is out there. Universal background checks."}
{"original": "But let me say how we win this. We have got to win in the middle of the country. And while everyone talks about winning rural areas, suburban areas, I'm the only one up here with a receipts that has actually repeatedly, while being for the assault weapon ban, won in Republican congressional districts over and over again, including Michele Bachmann's district."}
{"original": "So having someone that can lead the ticket, that can bring people with her, is the way you get gun safety legislation. I look at these proposals and say, do they hit my uncle Dick in the deer stand? They do not. So coming from a proud hunting state and still being able to pass this legislation is going to be the key."}
{"original": "We want to allow many people to get in on this topic. Mayor Buttigieg."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: I'm definitely on board with the part about sending up somebody from the middle of the country. But I want to come back to this question about the filibuster because this is not some long-ago bad vote that Bernie Sanders took, this is a current bad position that Bernie Sanders holds."}
{"original": "And we're in South Carolina. How are we going to deliver a revolution if you won't even support a rule change? We are in this state..."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: We are in the state where Strom Thurmond used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation repeatedly. No less a Senate traditional figure than Harry Reid has called for it to go. It has got to go, because otherwise Washington will not deliver. I was in high school when the Columbine shooting happened. And I remember everybody in Washington saying, never again, we'll never let this happen again."}
{"original": "And then a second school shooting generation has now been produced. Shame on us if we allow there to be a third. And also..."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: ... in terms of making the case, I think it wouldn't be a bad idea for somebody to illustrate, from the perspective of the a veteran, why the kinds of weaponry, anything remotely like what I trained on in order to go serve in a war zone has no business being sold anywhere near an American school or church or neighbor."}
{"original": "KING: All right, Senator Sanders, please."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Thirty years ago, I supported a ban on assault weapons. Mike Bloomberg has started a very good organization, Moms Demand Actions. Congratulations."}
{"original": "SANDERS: They have credited me with gun sense, as you know."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Furthermore, furthermore, it is my view, the time is now, and Joe made this point, look, at the end of the day we need to rally the American people. Here is the good news. Because of all these disgusting and horrific mass shootings, the American people now understand that we must be aggressive on gun safety, not be dictated to by the NRA."}
{"original": "And I am proud that I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. If elected president, it will get worse than that."}
{"original": "KING: All right, Mr. Steyer, please? Mr. Steyer?"}
{"original": "STEYER: Look, it isn't a question of the American people deciding that we have too much gun violence. Everyone in America knows we have too much gun violence. The problem we have is that corporations have bought Washington, D.C."}
{"original": "The gun manufacturers own the Senate of the United States. So even though more than 90 percent of Americans want mandatory background checks on every gun purchase, we can't get it through the Senate."}
{"original": "So the question you have to ask yourself is, how do we change the Senate of the United States in a material way? And there are two things. That's why I am for term limits of 12 years for every congressperson and senator, to change who's in charge, to get rid of Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz."}
{"original": "But I am also -- Senator Sanders is right. We need to win a huge victory across the board."}
{"original": "STEYER: Democrats need to go to the grassroots. I built one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the United States."}
{"original": "STEYER: The way to win at the grassroots is, tell the truth and organize."}
{"original": "KING: Your time's up, sir. Bill Whitaker?"}
{"original": "STEYER: That's what it's going to take in 2020."}
{"original": "KING: Your time's up, sir. Bill Whitaker?"}
{"original": "WHITAKER: Let's talk about education. South Carolina's schools score in the bottom half of the national assessment. Black students here consistently score worse than white students. Mayor Bloomberg, a key element of your response to failing schools in New York City was a dramatic increase in public charter schools. As president, would you pursue that same strategy and seek to expand charter schools nationwide?"}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: I'm not sure they're appropriate every place. I can only tell you, in New York, they provided parents with an alternative to send students to them. We had -- the charter schools are mixed in with the non-charter public schools, because our charter schools are public schools, as well. They've helped each other."}
{"original": "I saw a statistic the other day, when I came into office, zero New York City schools were in the top 25 of the state. When I left, 23 out of 25 were from New York City. We've cut the gap between the rich and the poor. We've made an enormous difference in all of the options that parents have."}
{"original": "I raised teacher salaries by 43 percent. I put an extra $5 billion into our school system. I value education. It is the only way to solve the poverty problem is to get people a good education. And rather than just talk about it in New York, we actually did it."}
{"original": "WARREN: So this is one thing where a president can make a big difference all by herself. And I'm going to start with my secretary of education. My secretary of education will be someone who has taught in public school."}
{"original": "My secretary of education will be someone who believes in public education. And my secretary of education will believe that public dollars should stay in public schools."}
{"original": "One more thing. My secretary of education will believe that it is time to get rid of high-stakes testing. We need to support our children. But, look, we want to build a future in this country? We build a future by investing in our children. I've got a plan to put $800 billion new federal dollars into our public schools."}
{"original": "WHITAKER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator."}
{"original": "WARREN: Education is not free. We must invest in the future of our children."}
{"original": "SANDERS: This campaign, our campaign, our campaign is about changing American priorities. Instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we're going to have high-quality, universal childcare for every family in this country."}
{"original": "Because the psychologists tell us 0 to 4 are the most important years of human development. We are going to triple funding for low-income Title I schools, because kids' education should not depend upon the ZIP Code in which they live. We're going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free through a tax on Wall Street speculation. And we're going to move to make certain that no teacher in America earns less than $60,000 a year."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: Look, the best thing that we can do to support public education is to support public educators. I'm a little biased, because I'm married to one. And I get an education about education every day I come home."}
{"original": "I have seen how teachers are expected to dip into their own pockets to furnish their classrooms. Teachers are being expected to handle the mental health challenges that their students are facing because we don't have an adequate mental health system to support kids."}
{"original": "And now some politicians, because they aren't willing to face the need for commonsense gun law, are expecting teachers to somehow transform themselves into highly trained armed guards when there's a threat to a classroom."}
{"original": "We have to show not only with compensation, but with support for the profession overall our regard for those who are educating our kids. And, yes, that means a secretary of education who will support teachers. It also means investing."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: I'm proposing an education access..."}
{"original": "WARREN: One way we -- one way we can support our teachers is to cancel student loan debt."}
{"original": "WHITAKER: We're going to pass this on to Major."}
{"original": "GARRETT: Candidates, good evening. Candidates, good evening."}
{"original": "WARREN: People across this country are being crushed by student loan debt. This is an issue we need to talk about."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: And that's what my plan would do, through the education..."}
{"original": "GARRETT: As we all know, as we all know, the political conversation in our country is interactive, and because of our partner, Twitter, this debate is no different. So I want to put a question from Twitter to you, Senator Klobuchar. This is from Casey Pennington. How will your policies address and ensure affordable housing and education equity for minimum wage workers?"}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. This is one of the first times we've talked about housing. And I put forward an extensive policy."}
{"original": "I think -- when I've looked at this both in my job in local government and in the Senate, one sure way we can make sure that kids get a good start is if they have a roof over their head and a stable place to live."}
{"original": "So the way you do that is, first of all, taking care of the Section 8 backlog of applicants. There are literally hundreds of thousands of people waiting. And I have found a way to pay for this and a way to make sure that people get off that list and get into housing."}
{"original": "Secondly, you create incentives for affordable housing to be built and, third, to help people pay for it."}
{"original": "And I want to make clear, given South Carolina and the rural population, as well as urban, that this isn't just an urban problem. It's a big urban problem, but it's also a rural problem, where we have housing deserts and people want to have their businesses located there, but they're not able to get housing."}
{"original": "So for me, it's building a coalition. And I actually like to get these things done and to -- the way you do it is by building a coalition between urban and rural so you can pass affordable housing and finally get it done."}
{"original": "GARRETT: Senator Warren, hold on one second, because I want to -- I want to..."}
{"original": "WARREN: This is a point where we need to talk about race, though."}
{"original": "WARREN: It is not enough to talk about housing neutrally..."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Can we just speak up when we want to? Is that the idea?"}
{"original": "WARREN: ... and just be race-blind. It is important to recognize the role that the federal government played for decades and decades in discriminating against African-Americans having an opportunity to buy homes."}
{"original": "WARREN: And while Mayor Bloomberg was blaming the housing crash of 2008 on African-Americans and on Latinos, in fact, I was out there fighting for a consumer agency to make sure people never get cheated again on their mortgages. We have a -- I have a housing plan, and what it has in it specifically..."}
{"original": "WARREN: ... to deal with the effects of red-lining. We can no longer pretend that everything is race-neutral. We have got to address race consciously, what's happening in this country."}
{"original": "GARRETT: OK. Mayor Bloomberg, please, we were going to ask you about this. I want to give you a chance to respond, because in addition to what Senator Warren just said on Twitter, she called you a liar and a borderline racist because of what you said about red-lining."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: Yes, she's -- I'm sorry, but, unfortunately, she's misinformed on red-lighting. You can go back and look at the record. I fought against it before '08, the crisis, during '08, and after that. Red-lining is not the problem with the mortgage market, but it was a problem for the communities where it was done, and we stopped that."}
{"original": "Let me also say, because just -- since I have the floor for a second, that I really am surprised that all of these -- my fellow contestants up here, I guess, would be the right word for it..."}
{"original": "... given nobody pays attention to the clock -- I'm surprised they show up, because I would have thought after I did such a good job in beating them last week, that they'd be a little bit afraid to do that."}
{"original": "But let me just say, when you're talking about affordable housing, we created 175,000 units of affordable housing in New York City. And I listened to them. They're in Congress and they say they can't get it done, can't get it done. But if you change something like the president, they would. No, you have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle and then you can get stuff done."}
{"original": "I did it in New York City. I got the Republican State Senate to vote for gay marriage virtually before anybody else in this country. You can work across the aisle. You just have to know how to deal with people."}
{"original": "GARRETT: Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much. Back to you, Bill."}
{"original": "WHITAKER: Vice President Biden, black men earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by white men, are about twice as likely to be unemployed, five times more likely to be incarcerated, conditions that ripple across black families and have endured during both Democratic and Republican administrations. How do you convince black voters that you can change years of inequities?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: Two ways. Number one, my entire life I've been involved with the black community. I was a public defender."}
{"original": "I worked in the projects, I came along, and the first thing I did as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, extended the Voting Rights Act eventually for 25 years. And I have been deeply involved. And my first effort I had as a councilman was doing away with red-lining in the county."}
{"original": "The way we do this, we've got to help them create wealth, and that's why we double the amount of money that is available for young entrepreneurs and black entrepreneurs, are as successful as any other group of people in the country. We go from 1.5 billion to $3 billion, taking $30 billion off the sidelines. That's how you create wealth."}
{"original": "Secondly, I provide for the opportunity for first-time home buyers to be able to have a $15,000 tax credit so they can get the mortgage at the front end and be able to keep it. Thirdly, I go after those people who are involved gentrification, because what's happening is we're moving people out of their neighborhoods in ways that in fact make no sense. They're being bought out. You cannot find a place to live."}
{"original": "And thirdly, I make sure that with regard to housing, we allow people -- look, right now if you live in a black neighborhood and you have the same exact house as the guy across the street in a white neighborhood has, your house is valued significantly less than the white, the same exact house. We've got to deal with the institutional racism."}
{"original": "WHITAKER: Thank you, Mr. Vice President."}
{"original": "BIDEN: I note how you cut me off all the time but I'm not going to be quiet anymore, OK?"}
{"original": "STEYER: Every single policy area in the United States has a gigantic subtext of race. We're talking about education. We're talking about criminal justice. We're talking about housing. We're talking about loans. I started a bank to basically correct the injustice in the financial services industry. Basically, to make loans to black-owned, Latino-owned, and women-owned businesses. We've supported over 8,000 affordable housing units."}
{"original": "But more than that, I believe I'm the only person on this stage who believes in reparations for slavery."}
{"original": "STEYER: Something happened. We should have a formal commission on race to retell the story of the last 400-plus years in America of African-Americans, of systematic legal injustice, discrimination, and cruelty, but also of 400-plus years of contribution in terms of building the United States of America and leading the United States of America from a moral standpoint."}
{"original": "BRENNAN: Senator Klobuchar, next question, new topic, new topic. Senator Klobuchar..."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: ... for this whole campaign, I don't know where you got the impression..."}
{"original": "BRENNAN: If you could honor the rules of the debate, thank you."}
{"original": "Senator Klobuchar, I'd like to change topics and ask you, rural areas have populations who are older, sicker, and poorer than non-rural communities. And they have to travel farther to get medical help when they need it. Expanding coverage is going to be useless if there are no providers to go to. So how would you ensure that there is available health care in rural areas?"}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: People aren't always aware, I know you are in South Carolina, about how much poverty there is, particularly child poverty in rural areas. So the answer is one size doesn't fit all. And one of the ways you do this, right now we have something called critical access hospitals so they're designated for rural areas. And actually, I am leading -- the lead Democrat on a bill to extend that, to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered."}
{"original": "The other issue is we don't have enough personnel. And so that's where we get to this education plan.. And I don't want agree with some of my colleagues here about putting hard-earned taxpayer money into rich kids going to college. What I think we need to do instead is look at what our needs are in our economy."}
{"original": "We're going to have a million openings for home health care workers, particularly in rural areas, that we don't know how to fill. We're going to have over 100,000 openings for nursing assistants. We're not going to have a shortage of sports marketing degrees. We're going to have a shortage of plumbers and nurses."}
{"original": "So putting incentives in place with how we do loan payback, making one- and two-year degrees free, and then of course creating loan payback programs if people will go, especially medical students, into rural areas."}
{"original": "Final thing is comprehensive immigration reform. I have passed..."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: I have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas. We need to expand that."}
{"original": "BRENNAN: Mayor Buttigieg, the floor is yours, would you like -- same question."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: Yes, so, when I was born, there was no difference in your life expectancy, if you were born in a rural area or a city. Now the gap is the biggest it has been in a generation, and that is particularly affecting black rural families in places like South Carolina. We're seeing hospital closures right and left. And we're seeing them, in particular, in states where Medicaid was not expanded, something that is hurting black and poor white families and is largely the result of racial voters suppression."}
{"original": "See, all of these things are connected, housing, wages, the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. All of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation, which is happening on everything from the purging of voter rolls to the closing of voting locations. And that harms everyone."}
{"original": "BRENNAN: You're out of time, sir."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: It's why in my Frederick Douglass plan for comprehensively dealing with these issues, part of the core of it is a 21st Century Voting Rights Act."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Yes, I'm very proud working with Congressman Jim Clyburn, South Carolina, that we increased funding for the Community Health Center Program by $11 billion as part of the Affordable Care Act, which now provides for 9 million Americans access to primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs, in that bill."}
{"original": "We also put $2 billion into a program which would provide debt forgiveness for doctors, nurses, dentists, we have a major dental affordable crisis in this country, to make sure that they are practicing in underserved areas."}
{"original": "The advantage of a Medicare for All health care program, because it's not driven by profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies, we will have health care for all people in all parts of this country."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: But in order for any of that to happen it has to pass. And we're talking about a plan that..."}
{"original": "BRENNAN: Thank you. Next topic. Gayle?"}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: ... even goes beyond even what they do..."}
{"original": "KING: I'm sorry, we're going to go to Mayor Bloomberg. We're going to change topics."}
{"original": "Mayor Bloomberg, as mayor of New York, you declared war on obesity, you banned trans-fats from restaurants and you tried to do the same thing with large surgary drinks. So if you become president, will you push those policies on the national level as well?"}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: Well, I think what's right for New York City isn't necessarily right for all the other cities, otherwise you would have a naked cowboy in every city. So let's get serious here."}
{"original": "But I do think it's the government's job to have good science and to explain to people what science says or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives. The -- we are a country where there are too many people that are obese. We should do something about that. But just a look what happened with smoking."}
{"original": "We did ban smoking in New York City in public places, restaurants, offices, and that sort of thing. And it has spread across America, across Europe, across Latin America, even into places in the Middle East and into the Far East. It has saved an enormous number of lives."}
{"original": "So it just goes to show, if you have good public health, then you can do things. And one of the great problems today, you read about the virus, what's really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago. So there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: And he has defunded -- he had defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don't have the organization we need. This is a very serious thing. As you see, the stock market is falling apart because people are really worried and they should be."}
{"original": "KING: We're going to talk about that."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: We don't have anybody to respond. I'm sorry."}
{"original": "KING: We're going to talk about that in our next segment. Before I leave you, are New Yorkers living longer because of your policies?"}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: There's no question about that."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: Before I left, life expectancy in New York City had grown by three years during our 12 years in office such that, when I left, it was three years greater than the national average."}
{"original": "KING: All right. Vice President Biden, please. Vice President Biden."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Look, one of the things we have to do, we have a thing in the Defense Department called DARPA, a special operation thing to find out all the things we have to deal to make us safer. They came up with the internet, I mean, they came up with the internet, they came up with the whole idea of stealth technology."}
{"original": "I'm going to do the same thing at the National Institute of Health. We're going to focus at least $50 billion over the first five years on -- focusing on obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and cancer. And we're going to make that investment because no one else is willing to make that investment."}
{"original": "We can, in fact, find cures if we make the investment, and we can get that done. The American people support it. Even Republicans will support it. We have to focus on extending life, saving life, and making people -- put them in a position to be able to live longer and more securely."}
{"original": "KING: All right, Senator (sic) Biden, thank you."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, Senator Sanders wants to legalize marijuana on day one of his presidency..."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: ... and is promising to expunge the record of anyone who has been arrested for possession. As a former prosecutor, is that a a realistic promise?"}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: Well, it is realistic to want to legalize marijuana, I want to do that, too. And I also think you need to look back and -- at people's records and you maybe can't do it on day one, as he said. I think you want to have a process that you go through, because there's too many people that have things on their records that have stopped them from getting jobs."}
{"original": "I think a lot of what we also need to do is to make sure that when we do this that we have money for treatment. And it's not necessarily because of marijuana. It is because of things like opioids and the like. And that's why one of the first plans I put out was for treatment, because if you want to make the criminal justice system work, you don't want to have repeat customers, and you want to help people to get off of drugs."}
{"original": "And the way you do that is with drug courts. The way you do that, by the way, is with my proposal for a clemency board in the White House so that you don't have a president that pell-mell gives pardons to his buddies and to white-collar offenders, but that, instead, you have a set process that you use that's fair and is outside of the Justice Department, and while getting their advice."}
{"original": "KING: All right, thank you, Senator Klobuchar."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Can I respond to that, as well?"}
{"original": "SANDERS: Can I respond? I was mentioned..."}
{"original": "KING: I'd like to get your thoughts on this, because you have called marijuana another addictive drug that we've never done research on."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: Look, the first thing you do is we should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount. For dealers, yes, but for the average person, no, and you should expunge the records of those that got caught up in this before."}
{"original": "Number two, we're not going to take it away from states that have already done it."}
{"original": "But, number three, you should listen to the scientists and the doctors. They say go very slowly. They haven't done enough research. And the evidence so far is worrisome, before we get all our kids, particularly kids in their late teens, boys even more than girls, where this may be damaging their brains."}
{"original": "Until we know the science, it's just nonsensical to push ahead. But the cat's out of the bag. So some states have it, you're not going to take it away. Get rid of the -- decriminalize the possession."}
{"original": "KING: All right, thank you, Mr. Mayor."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, you were name checked."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Thank you. All right, look, you're right. We have a criminal justice system today that is not only broken, it is racist, got more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China. And one of the reasons for that is a horrific war on drugs."}
{"original": "So I do believe that, on day one, we will change the Federal Controlled Substance Act, which, if you can believe it, now equates heroin with marijuana. That's insane. We're going to take marijuana out of that and effectively legalize marijuana in every state in the country."}
{"original": "What we are also going to do is move to expunge the records of those people who were arrested for possession of marijuana."}
{"original": "And I'll tell you what else we're going to do. We're going to provide help to the African-American, Latino, Native American community to start businesses to sell legal marijuana, rather than let a few corporations control the legalized marijuana market."}
{"original": "KING: All right, Senator Sanders, thank you..."}
{"original": "BIDEN: I wrote the drug court bill."}
{"original": "KING: We passed the halfway mark."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Can I respond to this? I wrote the -- I wrote the bill that set up drug courts."}
{"original": "KING: All right. Thank you, Vice President Biden. We will get back to you."}
{"original": "The CBS News Democratic presidential debate will continue right after the break."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Welcome back, the CBS News Democratic debate. Each of you is campaigning for the role as commander-in-chief, where you will command 1.3 million U.S. troops and be responsible for protecting America's national security. There are also 53,000 here in South Carolina."}
{"original": "You said, Senator Warren, you said you wanted to bring home all troops from the Middle East and then you walked that back to say you want to bring home combat troops."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: How does that protect America's national security?"}
{"original": "WARREN: Look, a president's job, first job, is to keep America safe, and an important part of that is to have a strong military. All three of my brothers served in the military, and I understand how much the military sacrifices, how much their families sacrifice, and how much they are willing to put on the line."}
{"original": "That means that we have a sacred responsibility to them, and that is not to use our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. We are not winning in Afghanistan. We are not winning in the Middle East."}
{"original": "What we need to do is we need to use all of the tools in our toolbox. We need a strong military. We also need a strong State Department. Those are our eyes and ears on the ground. They are our frontlines in diplomacy."}
{"original": "We need a strong economy and to work worldwide on that economy, and we need strong alliances. We need to know the difference between our friends and between dictators who would do us harm. And we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators. We need not to cut and run on our allies."}
{"original": "And we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators."}
{"original": "We need not to cut and run on our allies. We need an approach that keeps us safe by using all of the tools in a measured way."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Mayor Bloomberg, voters have not heard much about your foreign policy views. Would you pull all combat troops out of the Middle East?"}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: No. You want to cut it back as much as you can, but I think, if we learned something from 9/11, people plan things overseas and execute them here. We have to be able to stop terrorism. And there's no guarantees that you're going to be able to do it, but we have to have some troops in places where terrorists congregate, and to not do so is just irresponsible."}
{"original": "We shouldn't be fighting wars that we can't win. We should go to war only as a last resort. Nobody argues with that."}
{"original": "But this is a dangerous world. And if we haven't learnt that after 9/11, I don't know what's going to teach us what to. This -- we have to do something, and I think the budget that we -- the things that I've seen recently convinced me that the military today is better prepared than they have been in an awful long time, and that the monies they are spending on the war of weapons we need for the next war and not for the last, a common mistake that they're not making now."}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: They're doing a good job."}
{"original": "KING: Mayor Buttigieg, I'd like to go to you as the only veteran on stage. Can you weigh in on this?"}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: Well, the first time I ever set foot in South Carolina, it was stepping off the bus that brought me to combat training near Fort Jackson. And that was to get ready to go to Afghanistan, where I saw that one of the things that kept me safe, just as sure as my body armor, was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country that was known to keep its word. Our allies and our adversaries knew it."}
{"original": "The president has torn that to shreds. And so the first thing we've got to do is restore the credibility of the United States."}
{"original": "The second thing we've got to do is make sure that we not only have the intelligence capabilities -- and I guess I disagree with the mayor; I don't think we need to have ground troops anywhere terrorists can gather, because terrorists can gather anywhere in the world. But we do need intelligence capabilities and specialists on the ground."}
{"original": "But what good is that if you have a president who won't listen to them?"}
{"original": "Right now, some of the biggest threats that we face are not only things like counter-terrorism but issues like global health security and the Coronavirus, that rely on the ability to listen to scientists..."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: ... listen to your own intelligence and coordinate with an international community that this president has alienated because his idea of a security strategy is a big wall."}
{"original": "KING: I know it goes fast..."}
{"original": "... but a minute-fifteen is really a long time."}
{"original": "So we'd ask respectfully if you would all please try to keep to the time."}
{"original": "KING: Senator Klobuchar -- good idea, right, Mr. Vice President?"}
{"original": "Senator Klobuchar, today -- as we were coming over here today..."}
{"original": "I promise, Mr. Vice President, we are going to get to you today. I promise."}
{"original": "BIDEN: You keep promising me that, but you haven't done it yet."}
{"original": "KING: I've never broken a promise."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Well, let's get to it."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: Why don't you let me answer, OK?"}
{"original": "KING: There was breaking news from the CDC about the Coronavirus. And so far there have been 2,700 deaths globally, and so far in this country there have been no deaths. But the CDC says this. It's not a matter of if the virus will spread here but when."}
{"original": "The question to you is this, would you close the borders to Americans who have been exposed to the Coronavirus in order to prevent an outbreak here in this country?"}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: Well, what we have to do is make sure that we have treatment for those Americans and that they are in a quarantine situation. We don't want to expose people, but we want to give them help."}
{"original": "And I would agree, when Mayor Bloomberg said that this president has not invested like he should have in his budget -- he tried to cut back on the CDC; he tried to cut back on the international organization that would coordinate with the rest of the world; he hasn't yet really addressed the nation on this topic, I would do all of that."}
{"original": "But I want to take this out of politics right now and talk to the American people because this is so serious. I'm not going to give my website right now. I'm going to give the CDC's website, which is cdc.gov, so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their health care provider. Because many doctors are saying it's just a matter of time before we're going to start seeing this here."}
{"original": "And I think the answers, as president, what would I do, I would better coordinate throughout my presidency to be ready for the next pandemic and to prepare for this one."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: I would have better relations with our allies and I would support, because I know the vaccine is out there in the head of some kid right now in school, in Columbia, South Carolina, or Houston, Texas, and it's investing in education, so we are ready to lead, again, in the world."}
{"original": "Mr. Vice President, we reached a turning point today with the CDC, warning schools that they must prepare that they might have to close, members of the Trump administration saying we don't have enough medical masks if necessary."}
{"original": "BIDEN: What we did with Ebola -- I was part of making sure that pandemic did not get to the United States, saved millions of lives. And what we did, we set up, I helped set up that office in the presidency, in the president's office, on -- on diseases that are pandemic diseases."}
{"original": "We increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. We should -- and our president today -- and he's wiped all that out. We did it. We stopped it."}
{"original": "And the second thing I'd point out to you is that what I would do immediately is restore the funding. He cut the funding for CDC. He tried to cut the funding for NIH. He cut the funding for the entire effort."}
{"original": "And here's the deal. I would be on the phone with China and making it clear, we are going to need to be in your country; you have to be open; you have to be clear; we have to know what's going on; we have to be there with you, and insist on it and insist, insist, insist."}
{"original": "BIDEN: I could get that done. No one up here has ever dealt internationally with any of these world leaders. I'm the only one that has."}
{"original": "SANDERS: In the White House today -- in the White House today, we have a self-described great genius -- self-described -- and this great genius has told us that this Coronavirus is going to end in two months. April is the magical day that this great scientist we have in the White House has determined -- I wish I was kidding; that is what he said."}
{"original": "What do we have to do? Whether or not the issue is climate change, which is clearly a global crisis requiring international cooperation, or infectious diseases like Coronavirus, requiring international cooperation, we have to work and expand the World Health Organization. Obviously, we have to make sure the CDC, the NIH, our infectious departments, are fully funded."}
{"original": "SANDERS: We've got to work with countries all the over the world to solve it."}
{"original": "O'DONNELL: Senator, we're going to stay on the topic of foreign affairs. Margaret Brennan?"}
{"original": "Mayor Bloomberg, you've said that President Xi Jinping of China is not a dictator and that he is responsive to his constituents, and that the U.S. must cooperate with Beijing."}
{"original": "How far does that go? Would you allow Chinese firms to build critical U.S. infrastructure?"}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: No, I would not. And I think the Chinese government has not been open. Their press -- the freedom of press does not exist there. They -- their human rights record is abominable, and we should make a fuss, which we have been doing, I suppose."}
{"original": "But we -- make no mistake about it, we have to deal with China, if we're ever going to solve the climate crisis. We have to deal with them because our economies are inextricably linked. We would be -- not be able to sell or buy the products that we need."}
{"original": "And, in terms of whether he's a dictator, he does serve at the behest of the Politboro, of their group of people, but there's no question he has an enormous amount of power. And he -- but he does play to his constituency. You can negotiate with him. That's exactly what we have to do, make it seem that it's in his interest and in his people's interest to do what we want to do, follow the rules, particularly no stealing of intellectual property; follow the rules in terms of the trade agreements that we have are reciprocal and go equally in both directions."}
{"original": "Vice President Biden, same question to you. Would you allow Chinese firms to build critical U.S. infrastructure?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: No, I would not. And I spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had by the time we left office. This is a guy who is -- doesn't have a democratic, with a small D, bone in his body."}
{"original": "This is a guy who is a thug, who in fact has a million Uighurs in reconstruction camps, meaning concentration camps. This is a guy who you see what's happening right now in -- in Hong Kong, and this is a guy who I was able to convince should join the international agreement at the Paris agreement because, guess what, they need to be involved."}
{"original": "You can cooperate and you can also dictate exactly what they are, when in fact they said We're going to set up a no-fly zone, that you can't fly through our zone."}
{"original": "He said, What do you expect me to do, when I was over there."}
{"original": "I said, We're going to fly right through it. We flew B-1 bombers through it. We've got to make it clear. They must play by the rules..."}
{"original": "BRENNAN: Thank you, Mr. Vice President."}
{"original": "BRENNAN: Senator Warren, same question. Would you allow Chinese firms to build infrastructure?"}
{"original": "WARREN: We -- we have to be able to trust our president, because there are a lot of decisions a president makes that you just can't follow every part of that. And that's one of the reasons that we need to see any candidate's taxes."}
{"original": "We know that Mayor Bloomberg has been doing business with China for a long time, and he is the only one on this stage who has not released his taxes."}
{"original": "He plans to release them after Super Tuesday. It is not enough to be able to say, just trust me on this. We have a president who said he was going to release his taxes after the election and has refused to do this."}
{"original": "BRENNAN: Was that a yes or no?"}
{"original": "BRENNAN: OK. Mayor Bloomberg, would you like to respond?"}
{"original": "BLOOMBERG: I got into this race only 10 or 12 weeks ago, we have been working on our tax returns, I've said they will be out. We probably have another couple of weeks left to go. We're doing it as fast we can. We've complied with every single requirement for disclosure. And when I was mayor of New York, we had our tax returns out twelve years in a row and we will do that in the White House."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: My tax return is online light now."}
{"original": "STEYER: I released my tax returns."}
{"original": "STEYER: That was easy to do. But I want to say something about foreign policy..."}
{"original": "I want to say something about foreign policy, which is this, we keep acting as if we're in the 20th Century or the 19th Century. If you look at the biggest threats to the United States, we're talking right now about coronavirus that cannot be solved within the borders of the United States. We're talking about climate change which is a global problem where we need U.S. leadership for countries around the world."}
{"original": "In fact, Mr. Trump's policy of us going it alone, of America first, of having no values, no allies, and no strategy is disastrous for us. The biggest threat to America right now in terms of our safety of our citizens is climate. And it's time for us to deal with it that way. Every single foreign policy issue is about American leadership and coalition."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Can I say one word on..."}
{"original": "BRENNAN: You praised -- it's in the same theme, sir. You've praised the Chinese Communist Party for lifting more people out of extreme poverty than any other country. You also have a track record of expressing sympathy for socialist governments in Cuba and in Nicaragua. Can Americans trust that a democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass?"}
{"original": "SANDERS: I have opposed authoritarianism all over the world and I was really amazed at what Mayor Bloomberg just said a moment ago. He said that the Chinese government is responsive to the politburo, but who the hell is the politburo responsive to? Who elects the politburo? You have got a real dictatorship there. Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba."}
{"original": "What I said is what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education. Yes, I think..."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Really? Really? Literacy programs are bad?"}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: Yes, because there's no comparing those two commentaries (ph)."}
{"original": "SANDERS: What Barack Obama said is they made great progress on education and health care. That was Barack Obama. Occasionally..."}
{"original": "BIDEN: I talked to Barack Obama..."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Excuse me, occasionally it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran. And when dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans do something good, you acknowledge that. But you don't have to trade love letters with them."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Barack Obama was abroad, he was in a town meeting, he did not in any way suggest that there was anything positive about the Cuban government. He acknowledged that they did increase life expectancy. But he went on and condemned the dictatorship. He went on and condemned the people who, in fact, had run that committee."}
{"original": "He also made sure to make it clear -- and by the way, I called to make sure that I was prepared to -- I never say (INAUDIBLE) my private conversations with him, but the fact of the matter is he, in fact, does not, did not, has never embraced an authoritarian regime and does not now."}
{"original": "BIDEN: This man said that, in fact, he thought it was -- he did not condemn what they did."}
{"original": "SANDERS: That is untrue, categorically untrue."}
{"original": "BIDEN: What did you tell them?"}
{"original": "SANDERS: I have condemned authoritarianism, whether it is the people in Saudi Arabia that the United States government..."}
{"original": "BIDEN: How about Cuba or Nicaragua?"}
{"original": "SANDERS: ... has loved for years. Cuba, Nicaragua, authoritarianism of any stripe is bad."}
{"original": "SANDERS: But that is different than saying that governments occasionally do things that are good. That's what Barack Obama said."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: The only way we're going to restore..."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: ... American credibility, the only way you can do this is to actually win the presidency. And I am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump, with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s, and Bernie Sanders with a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: This is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or '80s, this is about the future. This is about 2020. We are not going to survive or succeed, and we're certainly not going to win by reliving the Cold War. And we're not going to win these critical, critical House and Senate races if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the Democratic Party is telling people to look at the bright side of the Castro regime. We've got to be a lot smarter about this and look to the future."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Let us be clear, do we think health care for all, Pete, is some kind of radical communist idea?"}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: Well, you brought this up, let's talk about that."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Do we think raising the minimum wage to a living wage..."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: I'm happy to respond to the question because this is really important..."}
{"original": "SANDERS: ... do we think building the millions of units of affordable housing that we need..."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: If you're going to ask that rhetorical question, let's..."}
{"original": "SANDERS: ... do we think raising taxes on billionaires is a radical idea?"}

{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: We've got to open this up. Universal health care, for example..."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: Donald Trump's worst nightmare is having someone that the people in the middle who are tired of the insults and the extremes in our politics have someone to vote for. And I was going to comment on Cuba policy because I actually lead the bill to lift the embargo. I went with Barack Obama when he went to Cuba. And I've seen firsthand how the Cuban are way in front of our -- their leaders."}
{"original": "They like America. They want to be entrepreneurs. And the way that we embrace them, and not the socialist regime, is by opening up Cuba and starting to do business with them."}
{"original": "But to get at what we were just talking about, I just think we have a huge choice. Super Tuesday states, one-third of America will vote. Do you want to have someone..."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: ... in charge of this ticket -- could I finish, Margaret?"}
{"original": "BRENNAN: Well, you're out of time. Senator."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: You want to have someone in charge of this ticket who wants to put forward $60 trillion in spending, three times the American economy."}
{"original": "KLOBUCHAR: I don't think we do. I think that we can get all those bold progressive things done without having someone that is so alienating that we're going to turn off the voters that we need to bring with us."}
{"original": "BRENNAN: You have to allow the senator to respond. Senator Sanders."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: I want to respond to the question that Senator Sanders..."}
{"original": "SANDERS: Can I respond? Amy used the word alienating. Hey, Amy, my favorability nationally I believe are the highest up here, as a matter of fact."}
{"original": "SANDERS: All right. But the point is -- the point is the way we are going to beat Trump, which is what everybody up here wants, is we need a campaign of energy and excitement. We need to have the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States. We need to bring working people back in to the Democratic Party. We need to get young people voting in a way they have never done before. That is what our campaign is about."}
{"original": "BRENNAN: Bill Whitaker has the floor."}
{"original": "WHITAKER: The bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report concluded Russia interfered in our last presidential election, and the Obama administration failed to respond forcefully. U.S. intelligence says Russia is at it again. If it is proven that Russia has interfered in the 2020 elections, would you, as president, launch a retaliatory cyber attack?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: I would make them pay for it, and I would make them pay for it economically. They are engaged now, as I speak, in interfering in our elections. They were engaged, and when we -- when, in fact, we were -- the last election in 2016 against Hillary, they were. There's no question."}
{"original": "This man stood before the whole world, turned to the Russian leader and said, why in God's name would this man ever interfere in our elections? Give me a break. Seventeen intelligence agencies said he did. When we got the information, we went to the committee in the Senate that's responsible for knowing these issues and dealing with them."}
{"original": "We went to Mitch McConnell and said join us and point out what is happening here. He said, no, we want no part of it. And if we had moved -- we didn't have all the information at that time until after the election was over. And, so, the idea the bipartisan committee said we could have done more, theoretically that's true, but the fact of the matter is we didn't have the information until the end. And so, look, we, in fact, should be imposing sanctions on Russia now for their interference."}
{"original": "STEYER: Look, 21st Century warfare is cyber warfare. What we're having is an attack by a hostile foreign power on our democracy right now. The question you have to ask is, where is the commander-in-chief? And let me say this..."}
{"original": "STEYER: ... this isn't news, what Vice President Biden said is true, he did stand next to Vladimir Putin. There was a hostile, foreign attack on our election last time and the president sided with the hostile foreign power. That's why I started Need to Impeach."}
{"original": "That's what we have to do. We have to oppose a president who sides with a hostile foreign power that commits cyber warfare against the United States of America. That's where we are. Where are all these patriotic Republicans who wave the flag, but when we're actually under attack, they side with our enemies? It's outrageous."}
{"original": "That's why he should have been impeached. They covered it up. And I was years before these people. There's something wrong here. We're under attack, and they're not doing a darn thing about it."}

{"original": "GARRETT: Senator Sanders -- no, Senator Sanders, I have a question for you, sir. You're the frontrunner in this race. You're on the ballot in South Carolina. Mayor Bloomberg, you'll understand that preamble in just a second."}
{"original": "If elected, Senator Sanders, you would be America's first Jewish president. You recently called a very prominent, well-known American Israel lobby a platform for, quote, bigotry. What would you say to American Jews who might be concerned you're not, from their perspective, supportive enough of Israel? And specifically, sir, would you move the U.S. embassy back to Tel Aviv?"}
{"original": "SANDERS: Let me just -- the answer is, it's something that we would take into consideration."}
{"original": "SANDERS: But here -- excuse me. But here is the point. I am very proud of being Jewish. I actually lived in Israel for some months. But what I happen to believe is that,"}
{"original": "President Donald Trump's Virginia vineyard could be eligible for a federal bailout under the $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus he signed into law last month, despite provisions in the bill that Democrats said were intended to prevent him and his family from personally benefiting."}
{"original": "Deep in the fine print of the law passed by Congress to try to arrest an economic free fall is language that would the make the vineyard eligible for aid extended to growers and producers of specialty crops, among them grapes used to make wine."}
{"original": "There is no indication that any of Mr. Trump's companies, which are currently being operated by his sons, will apply for the aid, and a company representative said Friday there were no plans to do so."}
{"original": "The White House declined to comment, but last month, the president refused to rule out the possibility."}
{"original": "Let's just see what happens, because we have to save some of these great companies, he said on March 22, when asked specifically during a news conference if his companies would forgo such aid."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump's private business interests have been the subject of scrutiny from the moment he decided that, unlike other presidents, he would not divest his holdings or put them in a trust when he assumed the presidency. Most recently, he proposed holding the G-7 summit — which has since been canceled because of the outbreak — at his Doral resort in Florida, only to abandon the effort after intense criticism."}
{"original": "Federal employees, officeholders and officials are prohibited by laws and regulations intended to stop them from personally benefiting from their positions. Many of those restrictions, however, don't apply to the president, including provisions aimed at limiting conflicts of interest."}
{"original": "After Mr. Trump refused to say whether his companies would seek aid, Democrats negotiated to add restrictions to the stimulus bill before it passed Congress preventing the president and his family from personally benefiting."}
{"original": "But those guardrails only apply to one massive $500 billion tranche of money set aside in the law."}
{"original": "The limitations don't apply to a separate $9.5 billion fund made available for producers of specialty crops, which under U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines includes grapes."}
{"original": "It certainly looks like there are ways that the Trump Winery could benefit, said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for the government watchdog group Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, D.C. Grape growers we think definitely could qualify."}
{"original": "The hospitality industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, including the golf courses, hotels and resorts that are staples of the Trump Organization."}
{"original": "The Trump Winery, which is located outside Charlottesville, Virginia, has limited the hours of its tasting room and restricted its offerings to pickup and delivery of food and wine. A hotel on the grounds has been closed through May 19, according to a notice posted on the winery's website."}
{"original": "Control of Trump Winery isn't entirely clear. The president has repeatedly said he owns it. And his 2019 financial disclosure shows he collected revenue from the winery hotel and rent from the vineyard. The disclosure also states that Trump-controlled companies own Trump Vineyard Estates LLC."}
{"original": "Yet a statement on the winery's website says that Trump Winery is a registered trade name of a company controlled by Mr. Trump's son Eric, which is not owned, managed, or affiliated with Donald J. Trump or any of his affiliates."}
{"original": "The president isn't the only one in Washington with a stake in wine grapes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's family has a vineyard in California. But members of Congress are barred under federal laws and congressional ethics rules from directly participating in federal government contracts."}
{"original": "A Pelosi spokesman said the speaker's family would not seek the funds even if they were eligible for the aid."}
{"original": "Trump hotels could be eligible for help, too"}
{"original": "The Trump Winery isn't the only business that could get a cut of stimulus money. Individual Trump Organization hotels with fewer than 500 workers could be eligible for small business loans to keep employees on the payroll. And tax changes made under the law could also benefit him and other real estate developers."}
{"original": "In a letter to the White House sent Thursday, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode island and Democratic Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas jointly requested records detailing any internal deliberations related to some of the tax provisions."}
{"original": "Before Mr. Trump was president he showed a willingness to pursue such types of business relief."}
{"original": "His two New Jersey golf courses previously received an agriculture tax credit by growing hay and using grass-eating goats to help maintain the grounds, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2016."}
{"original": "In 2005, Mr. Trump received a $17 million insurance payment for hurricane damage at his private Mar-A-Lago club, though an Associated Press investigation in 2016 found little evidence of large-scale damage."}

{"original": "Home values across the U.S. spiked almost 9 percent last month, marking that fastest pace since the height of the housing bubble in June 2006."}
{"original": "Despite the sharply higher prices, demand from buyers remains strong, thanks to a combination of demographic changes, rising wages and the new tax cut, creating what real estate data site Zillow describes as a perfect storm. On top of that, new construction has been sluggish, leading to tight inventory."}
{"original": "The median home price in the U.S. rose 8.7 percent to $215,600 in April compared with a year earlier, Zillow found."}
{"original": "Higher mortgage rates add to the challenge of finding an affordable home, and some buyers may be rushing to make a purchase before the Federal Reserve potentially boosts rates again later this year. Fixed rates for 30-year mortgages are now at about 4.66 percent, their highest level since May 2011, Freddie Mac reported on Thursday."}
{"original": "There may be a good news/bad news situation in the months ahead, according to Zillow senior economist Aaron Terrazas."}
{"original": "The housing market may slow later this year as it hits headwinds such as the impact of rising mortgage rates, he said. That may provide a breather for buyers, but may disappoint some home sellers."}
{"original": "Once mortgage rates get beyond 5.5 percent and closer to 6 percent, there will be a more meantingful headwind to home appreciation, he told CBS MoneyWatch."}
{"original": "In the meantime, prospective buyers should get their finances in order, including boosting their credit scores before securing a mortgage, he said."}
{"original": "If you can get as high a credit score as possible in the year before you buy, it'll save you a lot of money, he noted."}
{"original": "Research from Zillow found that homebuyers with a fair credit score -- or between 640 to 680 -- could pay up to $21,000 more than a buyer with an excellent credit score over the life of the mortgage. Buyers with higher credit scores are rewarded with lower interest rates."}
{"original": "Below are 5 things to know about the housing market."}
{"original": "Home values are appreciating fastest in these cities"}
{"original": "Some locations are witnessing faster appreciation than others, Zillow found. The cities experiencing breakneck price gains include San Jose, where home values rose 26 percent in April to a median $1.26 million. Other pricey locations include Las Vegas and Seattle, where home values rose 16.5 percent and 13.6 percent, respectively, last month."}
{"original": "Waiting until late 2018 or 2019 may pay off"}

{"original": "Not all millennials are living at home"}
{"original": "The size of the millennial generation -- some 83 million people under age 35 -- guarantees built-in demand for housing, even if their household formation is slower than in previous generations. About one-third of millennials still live with adult relatives -- but that still leaves millions who are on the hunt for their own places."}
{"original": "About 1 million new households will form each year for the next few years, creating pent-up demand for housing, according to Freddie Mac."}
{"original": "The single-family housing market isn't keeping up with new homes, according to Freddie Mac. Labor shortages and development costs are to blame for the shortfall, although construction started to pick up late last year, it added."}
{"original": "Existing home buyers are hesitant to sell"}
{"original": "Because there's not enough inventory to meet demand, some home owners are opting to stay put rather than to put their homes on the market. The fear is that they might sell their home quickly, but be unable to find new home to buy. That's stoking a vicious cycle of low inventory, according to Freddie Mac."}
{"original": "Washington — As former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial kicks off in the Senate on Tuesday afternoon, congressional Democrats are working to ensure the legislative focus remains on President Biden's sweeping coronavirus relief package."}
{"original": "The impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump will take priority in the upper chamber, with other legislative activity and nominations put on the back burner for the duration of the trial. But on the other side of the Capitol, the Democratic-led House committees are crafting their parts of Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion aid package, as outlined in budget reconciliation instructions approved by both chambers in a budget resolution last week. Those portions will then be combined to form the reconciliation bill."}
{"original": "We have to do everything we can to end this crisis. And even though the impeachment trial is an important and august responsibility, we are doing both, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said during a press conference ahead of the trial's start."}
{"original": "Joined by Democrat committee chairs, Schumer said the Senate is working with House members and Republicans to address the coronavirus crisis, juggling the impeachment trial with drafting the relief package."}
{"original": "The bottom line is simple. The Senate is moving full steam ahead on a bold plan to get this country out of the crisis, the New York Democrat said, chastising political commentators who warned the impeachment trial would knock Mr. Biden's legislative agenda off course."}
{"original": "To the pundits that said we can't do both at once, we say, you are wrong. We can and we are, he said."}
{"original": "Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer speaks to the press as preparations for former President Donald Trump's trial are made on Capitol Hill on February 9, 2021. NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images"}
{"original": "As the trial gets underway in the Senate, the House Ways and Means Committee is poised to consider nine legislative proposals to be included in the coronavirus relief package beginning this week."}
{"original": "Among the measures are $1,400 direct payments to Americans, which would phase out for individuals making at least $75,000 and joint filers bringing in at least $150,000. The income threshold outlined by House Democrats is higher than that proposed by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who offered an amendment to the Senate's budget resolution lowering the phaseout to $50,000 for individuals and $100,000 for joint filers."}
{"original": "Additionally, the Ways and Means Committee will consider a provision extending temporary federal unemployment assistance through August 29 and boosting the weekly benefit from $300 to $400, as well as a proposal expanding the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 per child, or $3,600 for children under the age of 6."}
{"original": "Democrats also plan to include in their relief package a measure raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. It's unclear, however, whether the provision will withstand parliamentary scrutiny in the Senate, as Congress is using a legislative process called budget reconciliation to swiftly pass Mr. Biden's coronavirus aid package and do so without needing Republican support."}
{"original": "Mr. Biden conceded in an interview with CBS Evening News anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell that he didn't think the minimum wage hike was going to survive, as there are rules that dictate what can be included in a reconciliation bill."}
{"original": "The president has largely avoided weighing in on the impeachment trial in the Senate, where he served for more than three decades. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that Mr. Biden would not be watching the proceedings, as he'll be spending his time talking with lawmakers about his hopes and plans for the American Rescue Plan moving forward as quickly as possible."}
{"original": "I think it's clear from his schedule, and from his intention, he will not spend too much time watching the proceedings any time over the course of this week. He will remain closely in touch with Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, a range of officials on the Hill about his plan, and that's exactly what they want him to do, is to remain focused on that, Psaki told reporters during the White House press briefing. And he will leave the pace and the process and the mechanics of the impeachment proceedings up to members of Congress."}
{"original": "The Senate is set to convene as a court of impeachment at 1 p.m., with members tasked with deciding whether to acquit or convict Mr. Trump on the single charge of incitement of insurrection for his conduct related to the January 6 assault on the U. Capitol. The president, meanwhile, is scheduled to meet with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and business leaders later Tuesday afternoon to discuss the critical need for the American Rescue Plan to save our economy, according to the White House."}
{"original": "It's unclear how long Mr. Trump's Senate trial will last, as its length hinges in part on whether House Democrats will seek to call witnesses. Members are set to spend Tuesday debating the constitutionality of whether a former president can be tried after he has left office. The House impeachment managers, who are prosecuting the case against the former president, and Mr. Trump's lawyers then each have 16 hours to make their presentations to senators, beginning Wednesday."}
{"original": "It's no secret that millions of Americans are approaching their retirement years with meager savings and high anxiety about their financil security. And a recent study from Merrill Lynch and Age Wave reveals steps that Americans are willing to take to get their retirement back on track."}
{"original": "The overwhelming majority (88 percent) of people surveyed said their primary objective is peace of mind, while just 12 percent say they want to accumulate as much wealth as possible. But peace of mind means different things to different people:"}
{"original": "57 percent report they want to live comfortably within their means."}
{"original": "39 percent say they want to have the financial resources to live the life they choose."}
{"original": "34 percent want to feel they could handle a major unexpected expense."}
{"original": "28 percent don't want to feel overwhelmed by debt."}
{"original": "25 percent want to feel confident they won't outlive their money."}
{"original": "17 percent want to provide for their family if something happens to them."}
{"original": "Actually, this is a good planning list -- it would be best to address all of these goals."}
{"original": "One challenge is that talking about your finances is generally taboo in America: Only 8 percent of survey respondents feel personal finances can be discussed openly, while the remainder consider the topic a private matter or one that can be discussed with a spouse or partner or only very close family and friends. In fact, many people would rather talk about their preferences for end of life than their financial status."}
{"original": "It would certainly help if older workers and retirees would share their ideas and insights with their family and friends. After all, they're all in the same financial boat."}
{"original": "What changes are people willing to make to enhance their financial security in retirement? Here are 11 steps the survey found Americans are willing to take:"}
{"original": "90 percent would be willing to cut back on their expenses. Perhaps they can focus on spending just enough to meet their basic living needs and what truly makes them happy."}
{"original": "79 percent would seek financial advice. In this case, they'll want to make sure their advisers are qualified and act in their best interests."}
{"original": "77 percent would increase the use of tax-protected retirement accounts."}
{"original": "75 percent would seek expert advice on how to pay lower taxes. Note that this may not be a good use of time for Americans with meager savings, since they could already be in a very low tax bracket when they retire."}
{"original": "70 percent would buy a financial product that provides guaranteed income for life. These people would be wise to seek low-cost income annuities that maximize their lifetime income."}
{"original": "66 percent would sell real estate or other personal belongings. Finding the best way to deploy home equity is a good use of time for older workers and retirees who own a home but have modest retirement savings."}
{"original": "64 percent would postpone taking Social Security. This is a smart move for virtually all retirees."}
{"original": "60 percent would take Social Security as early as they could. This strategy works only if you're sufficiently disciplined to save your Social Security benefits, don't spend them, and are skilled or lucky enough to out-earn the stock market. Oh, it also helps if you die fairly quickly after you retire.

{"original": "Target's announcement this morning of holiday performance is consistent with our expectations as we continue to believe that its short-term investments in stores and online capability will generate longer-term benefits, which is borne out by these results, Charlie O'Shea, lead retail analyst with Moody's, said by email."}
{"original": "Kohl's (KSS), Macy's (M) and JCPenney (JCP) have all reported strong holiday sales in the past week, providing more evidence that traditional retailers have learned how to win customers over online, while leveraging the advantages of its physical locations."}

In addition to double-checking the bank account information, make sure to specify a date for the debit that's no later than April 18, the last day you can pay what you owe without incurring additional interest and penalties."}
{"original": "If you're paying a tax owed by check, don't attach it to your tax return. Mail it (payable to United States Treasury) in a separate envelope with a Form 1040-V Payment Voucher and send it to the appropriate IRS address. The mailed payment must be postmarked no later than April 18 to avoid any additional interest and penalties."}

{"original": "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments about whether a rule it announced decades ago in a case involving a catalog retailer should still apply in the age of the internet."}
{"original": "The case on Tuesday focuses on businesses' collection of sales tax on online purchases. Right now, under the decades-old Supreme Court rule, if a business is shipping a product to a state where it doesn't have an office, warehouse or other physical presence, it doesn't have to collect the state's sales tax. Customers are generally supposed to pay the tax to the state themselves, but the vast majority don't."}
{"original": "States say that as a result of the rule and the growth of internet shopping, they're losing billions of dollars in tax revenue every year. More than 40 states are asking the Supreme Court to abandon the rule."}
{"original": "Large retailers such as Apple, Macy's, Target and Walmart, which have brick-and-mortar stores nationwide, generally collect sales tax from their customers who buy online. But other online sellers that only have a physical presence in a few states can sidestep charging customers sales tax when they're shipping to addresses outside those states."}
{"original": "Sellers who defend the current rule say collecting sales tax nationwide is complex and costly, especially for small sellers. That complexity was a concern for the Supreme Court when it announced the physical presence rule in a case involving a catalog retailer in 1967, a rule it reaffirmed in 1992. But states say software has now made collecting sales tax easy."}
{"original": "The case the court is hearing has to do with a law passed by South Dakota in 2016, a law designed to challenge the Supreme Court's physical presence rule. The law requires out-of-state sellers who do more than $100,000 of business in the state or more than 200 transactions annually with state residents to collect and turn over sales tax to the state."}
{"original": "The state wanted out-of-state retailers to begin collecting the tax and sued Overstock.com, home goods company Wayfair and electronics retailer Newegg. The state has conceded in court, however, that it can only win by persuading the Supreme Court to do away with its current physical presence rule."}
{"original": "After dropping for three years in a row, U.S. carbon emissions spiked in 2018, demonstrating how hard it can be to move away from fossil fuels while the economy is growing."}
{"original": "Preliminary data from the Rhodium Group, a research consultancy, found that emissions rose 3.4 percent last year. That's even as Americans' reliance on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, hit a 40-year low."}
{"original": "While a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, natural gas not only beat out renewables to [replace] most of this lost generation but also fed most of the growth in electricity demand, the report said."}
{"original": "Natural gas, which has become a cheap and attractive competitor to coal, is cleaner-burning, but it is still a fossil fuel, emitting about half the carbon dioxide that coal does. Earlier studies have found that switching over all the world's coal plants to natural gas would do little to curb climate change."}
{"original": "The Trump administration's rollback of environmental laws and decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords play a role in the increase. But the main culprit is last year's spike in economic growth. Between 2007 and 2015, U.S. emissions came down 12 percent as utilities brought on clean-energy technology and the Great Recession dampened demand for power. In 2016 and 2017, emissions still decreased, but more slowly. Last year, as the economy expanded at the fastest pace in 15 years, boosted by tax cuts and other measures, emissions also grew at a record-setting pace."}
{"original": "So long as the economy is growing, that dynamic isn't going to change without a lot of breakthrough technology innovations or federal policy actions, John Larsen, one of the report's authors, told Greentech Media."}
{"original": "The transportation sector was the largest source of carbon emissions last year, with a slight drop in gasoline demand more than offset by increased trucking and air travel. Transport-sector emissions grew 1 percent last year, the same as 2017, according to Rhodium. In this sector, increases in efficiency—doing more with less power—and a move toward electric transport is beginning to make a dent, although a small one."}
{"original": "The largest emissions growth was in sectors that don't get much attention outside climate policy circles: Industry and buildings. The industrial sector added 55 million metric tons of carbon last year, more than four times its annual average in the past decade, because of an uptick in industrial activity. The sector is predicted to grow its gassiness and to become the leading carbon emitter in Texas within three years, according to Rhodium."}
{"original": "Absent a significant change in policy or a major technological breakthrough we expect the industrial sector to become an increasingly large share of US greenhouse gas emission in the years ahead, the report found."}
{"original": "Emissions from buildings increased by 54 million tons last year, a sevenfold increase from its typical rate of increase. That's partly because of weather, with a colder winter requiring more heating, but Rhodium expects population growth to keep driving emissions in this sector."}
{"original": "The prospect of reducing emissions by up to 28 percent from their 2005 levels—as the U.S. would be required to do under the Paris climate agreement—will require a radical shift. It would mean cutting emissions at nearly double the pace of their 2007-to-2015 decline. That prospect, while not impossible, would require an immediate policy shift or a technological breakthrough, Rhodium found."}
{"original": "The U.S. was already off track in meeting its Paris Agreement targets. The gap is even wider headed into 2019, it said."}
{"original": "The mayor of Seattle may make the final call on whether to risk furthering Amazon's wrath by imposing a tax on the city's biggest employers to help pay for the city's efforts to confront homelessness."}
{"original": "Amazon (AMZN) unexpectedly halted a large expansion in Seattle earlier this month, when the e-commerce giant said it would hold off until the outcome of a proposed tax that would affect it and about 600 businesses was known. Amazon on Monday declined further comment."}
{"original": "The levy, which would apply to businesses that gross at least $20 million a year, would finance affordable housing and homeless services in a city with the third-largest homeless population in the U.S. Amazon's growth is viewed as a factor in the area's skyrocketing housing costs."}
{"original": "The company, which employs more than 45,000 in Seattle, would be looking at an annual tab of up to $30 million and possibly more should the tax take effect as proposed, starting in 2019."}
{"original": "Seattle City Council members on Monday narrowly defeated a scaled-back version of the proposed tax supported by Mayor Jenny Durkan. After rejecting the alternative, council members at a committee meeting voted 5-4 to put the tax on the full council agenda scheduled for later in the day."}
{"original": "If council members vote as they did to advance the tax, the mayor would then have to decide on whether to sign it into law, let it become law or veto it. Six council members would be needed to override a veto by Durkan."}
{"original": "The mayor has expressed concern about the potential ramifications on workers in the building and retail industries if Amazon permanently pulls the plug on its planned construction in Seattle. At the same time, our city must urgently address our homelessness and affordability crisis, she added in a recent emailed statement."}
{"original": "I will continue to work with Council and remain hopeful that Council will pass a bill that I can sign, Durkan said in a statement issued Friday, before the compromise proposal was rejected."}
{"original": "Amazon has the backing of the Seattle Times editorial board, which has called the proposed tax a symbolic 'eat the rich' gesture, that it contends would harm workers. Proponents argue that the proposal would help offset the state's tax code, which they claim stacks the deck in favor of the wealthy and against working people."}

{"original": "How to avoid a tax audit"}
{"original": "1. Hiring the wrong tax preparer iStockphoto This mistake might occur before you even get your name on the tax return. Select a tax preparer who is incompetent or unethical, and he or she could spell big trouble for you. If the IRS audits one of the returns the tax preparer filed and finds significant problems, the agency could decide to audit all the returns that person prepared for the year, or for the past several years. Don't make this mistake. (Read our advice on how to select the best tax pro.)"}
{"original": "2. Saying your hobby is a business iStockphoto Let's say you breed and sell dogs, or sell blankets on Etsy, or resell garage sale purchases on eBay. At the end of the year, you realize expenses exceeded what you made and decide to deduct a tax loss from your business. However, do that for three or more years and the IRS is going to get suspicious. A business is something that makes money. If you haven't made money in three years, what you have may actually be a hobby. The IRS doesn't allow business deductions for hobbies."}
{"original": "3. Filing certain schedules or forms iStockphoto You might say the third item on our list isn't a mistake because, in many cases, there is no way to avoid it. For example, if you have a business, you need to file a Schedule C. And yet filing a Schedule C increases your chances of an audit. However, it would be a mistake to file a Schedule C if you have an unprofitable business that is more like a hobby. It might also be a mistake to file a Form 5213 if you're not sure. Form 5213 prevents the IRS from auditing you for the first five years of your business, and it is typically used when transitioning a hobby into a business. This form allows you to claim losses from your hobby-turned-business, no questions asked. That is, until the five years are up, and the IRS comes calling to see what you've been up to."}
{"original": "4. Taking questionable deductions or credits iStockphoto Experts generally agree that claiming excessive charitable contributions and claiming a home office are the two deductions most likely to raise red flags with the IRS. If you donate a large percentage of your income to charity, be sure to keep careful records. Too many contributions, relative to your income, can be a problem. So think twice about inflating the value of those items you dropped off at the thrift store. Keep careful records of all donations and be sure to get a written acknowledgement from any charity to which you donate $250 or more per year. As for the home office, take the deduction to which you're entitled, but be ready to defend it if needed. The most important thing to remember is you can only deduct a home office if you use that space exclusively for business. Under the category of credits, the Earned Income Tax Credit is most likely to get you in trouble, according to experts. Back in 2013, the IRS came under fire for not taking enough action to curtail improperly awarded Earned Income Tax Credits. In a statement reported by multiple news outlets, the agency fired back by saying EITC claims were twice as likely to be audited as other returns. If you claim the EITC, consider yourself warned."}
{"original": "5. Claiming a loss from a rental Justin Sullivan/Getty Images When housing prices were depressed, some people converted homes into rentals rather than selling them. Those who found the rent didn't cover the mortgage and taxes may have assumed they were entitled to take a deduction for the losses. Not so fast. You have to either be an active participant in the management of your rental or a real estate professional to do that. The IRS has a long and confusing page with the details, but Nolo.com has a much clearer explanation. Make sure you're eligible to deduct the losses before doing so."}
{"original": "6. Failing to claim all of your income iStockphoto Thinking you can keep secrets from the IRS is a mistake. You may think the government won't know about the money you earned freelancing on the side, but if the company you worked for files a 1099 form, the IRS knows. You may think you can keep your alimony checks a secret, but if your spouse is reporting those payments on his or her return, the IRS knows. You may think the interest you earn from foreign bank accounts is between you and that country's bankers, but if those nice bankers are sharing information with the United States, the IRS knows. Don't take the chance of getting caught in a lie. Claim all your income. Then, the IRS won't have any discrepancies to note, giving it one less reason to flag your return for an audit."}

Governor Greg Abbott, he blamed green energy in a state beholden to fossil fuels. And especially Senator Ted Cruz, he left with his family for tropical Mexico, and was whacked like a pinata. He raised home for redemption, handing out water to Texans who could only dream of Cancun. Last night, Senator Cruz's office told FACE THE NATION, Before the storms hit, Senator Cruz spoke with a meteorologist about the seriousness of the projected storms. Senator Cruz connected the meteorologist to Governor Abbott, and warned Texans early on to take the storm seriously. Beyond Texas, last week's snow storms also threw a three-day delay into the COVID vaccine rollout from coast to coast. Wintery weather shut down the FedEx hub in Memphis and the UPS one in Louisville. FEMA reported more than two thousand vaccines sites lost power. Six million doses have been delayed."}

{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: I believe that we need to take a variety of steps to look at this-- the previous administration's response to the pandemic and what lessons we need to learn to make sure that never happens again. I also believe that we need a credible, open, transparent international investigation led by the World Health Organization. And they're about to come out with a report about the origins of the pandemic in Wuhan, China, that we have questions about because we do not believe that China has made available sufficient original data into how this pandemic began to spread both in China and then eventually around the world. And we believe that both the WHO and China should step up on this matter."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden spoke to Xi Jinping, China's president, for what he said was two hours. Did he ask China specifically to make this data available? And-- and in what you just said, are you suggesting the WHO is being manipulated by China?"}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: I'm not going to characterize it that way. What I am going to say is that the only way to have a scientifically based investigation is to have access to all of the data and not merely, Margaret, to know what happened in this pandemic, but to be able to prevent future pandemics, as well, because the lessons we learned this time around will apply in the future. President Biden did raise the issue of COVID-19 and the need for all countries to shoulder responsibility-- to take their own responsibility for helping protect the world, including China."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The State Department said back in January that the U.S. has evidence that a COVID-like virus was circulating in Wuhan, China, as far back as autumn of 2019. And the Chinese military was conducting secret experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Do you dispute any of that declassified material?"}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, this is why the WHO investigation has to be left to the scientists and the experts to lay out without any interference by any government because that's the only way we're going to know what the origins of this are. I'm not in a position to say how COVID-19 came into this world. All I'm in a position to do is to call upon the WHO to do its job to the fullest extent possible."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you-- so you are standing by that declassified report?"}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: No. I'm saying that I am not in a position, nor is the Biden administration in a position to make a determination about precisely where COVID-19 originated. And that's in part because there has not been sufficient transparency coming from the government of China. And the WHO still has more work to do to get to the bottom of exactly where this virus emerged."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So later on in the program, we're going to hear from Matt Pottinger, who you know is the former deputy national security adviser to President Trump. And he says that when it comes to dictatorships like China, they're not going to be transparent, period, with health officials. And that is why the intelligence community, he says, needs to take more of a direct role in monitoring these biological threats. Do you agree with that assessment?"}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: I think it is absolutely the case that-- and-- and we've seen this in COVID-19, that pandemics represent one of the most severe threats to American lives and livelihoods and therefore our intelligence community should, across the board, be elevating its tools, its resources, its practices to focus on detecting, preventing and responding to pandemics. And that is something the Biden administration will be pursuing as we go forward."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that they failed to do so with COVID-19, that the intelligence community should have played more of a role?"}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: What I believe is that the Trump administration did not take pandemic surveillance as seriously as they should have. There was an office, Margaret, at the National Security Council, which I now lead, that was stood up under the Obama administration to detect and prevent exactly the kind of pandemic we have now seen in COVID-19."}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: The Trump administration dismantled that office. That is the kind of thing, the kind of step that we cannot see going forward. So whether we're talking about the types of policy tools required, the types of intelligence tools required--"}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: --or the type of engagement in international institutions required across the board, it is going to be important for every future administration to elevate global health, bio preparedness and pandemic--"}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: --preparedness to the highest order of national security priority."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: They would say they just rolled it up into a different directorate. But moving on to Iran, I want-- I want to make sure that I ask you, there are at least five Americans who are being held there as hostages. That's viewed as trying to build leverage over you-- over us in the United States. Do you need to begin hostage negotiations with Iran?"}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: We intend to very directly communicate with the Iranians about the complete and utter outrage, the humanitarian catastrophe that is the unjust, unlawful detention of American citizens in Iran."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you done that yet?"}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: We intend to demand-- it-- we are-- we have begun to communicate with the Iranians on this issue, yes. And we will continue to do so as we go forward. And our strong message to the Iranians will be that it-- we will not accept a long-term proposition where they continue to hold Americans in an unjust and unlawful manner. It will be a significant priority of this administration to get those Americans safely back home."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has Tehran responded yet to the offer made this past week to begin nuclear talks? And-- and does the offer still stand, given what Iran said overnight about perhaps unplugging or, you know, dismantling some of the video surveillance of its nuclear facilities?"}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, in order to answer that question, let me offer just a couple of basic propositions. First, Joe Biden is intent, determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Second, he believes that hardheaded, clear-eyed diplomacy is the best way to do that. And so he's prepared to go to the table to talk to the Iranians about how we get strict constraints back on their nuclear program. That offer still stands because we believe diplomacy is the best way to do it. Iran has not yet responded. But what's happened as a result is that the script has been flipped. It is Iran that is isolated now diplomatically, not the United States. And the ball is in their court."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You recently said that action would be taken soon to respond to this massive hacking of the federal government known as SolarWinds. Sanctions have not deterred Vladimir Putin one bit over the past few years. How do you make Russia pay a price and not escalate tensions?"}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, we have asked the intelligence community to do further work to sharpen the attribution that the last administration made about precisely how this hack occurred, what the extent of the damage is, what the scope and scale of the intrusion is, and we are in the process of working through that now. And then what I have said is that it will be weeks, not months, before we have a response prepared. That response will include a mix of tools seen and unseen. And it will not simply be sanctions because, as you say, a response to a set of activities like this require a more comprehensive set of tools, and that is what the administration intends to do. We're in the process of working through that, and we will ensure that Russia understands where the United States draws the line on this kind of activity."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake Sullivan, thanks for your time this morning. We hope you'll come back."}
{"original": "JAKE SULLIVAN: Thanks for having me."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner. Good morning to you, Mister Mayor."}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER (D-Houston/@SylvesterTurner): Good morning. Thanks for having me."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm glad your power is on. President Biden says he wants to visit Texas when it's not a burden. Is that time now? And what federal resources does your city need?"}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: Well, he certainly can come now. We certainly would welcome him and he would not be a distraction, not-- neither a burden. Let me just say right now with so many homes across the city having pipes that burst because of the frigid weather and major leaks, major water damage, we need a lot of plumbing materials and supplies, like right now. We have a number of licensed plumbers but could use even more. But the main thing is that even when plumbers are going out, it's very difficult to find the necessary materials and supplies. And we are needing water as well for people across the board."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about the-- the core issue of electricity. But on the water front, the head of the water utility reports to you. Why wasn't that system better prepared for the cold? And what are you doing to fix it?"}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: You have to bear in mind that the power outages and the water system are all interconnected, so it's not one versus the other. In addition, mostly when the power went out, we had to bring on even more generators in order to power our system. We have a very large system. I am pleased to say at one point in time, the-- the water pressure was below what we call 20 PSI. But as of now, the system has been normalized. The water pressure is above 50 PSI and we have already taken samples, forwarded them to the state. And hopefully we can get a positive response that our system is fine and ready to go. And that could come-- it could come later on today. It could come tomorrow. It could come on Tuesday. But we are hoping for the best."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to the matter of electricity. The state did not push utilities to winterize the grid, the power lines and the power plants. That costs money. And the power system, as you know, is-- is powered by a mix of energy resources, fossil fuels and green energy. All this has gotten really politicized in the past week, which is why I'm laying it out."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But for your constituents, they're going to have to pay to fix all this. Is that fair to stick them with the bill? Who pays for this?"}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: Well, the answer is no. Let me just say this, all of what happened this past week was foreseeable and preventable. Back in 2011, when I was in the legislature, I filed a bill that would have required the Public Utility Commission, which oversees ERCOT, which manages our Texas grid, to ensure that there was an adequate reserve to prevent blackouts. That is specifically what the bill said. I filed it. The leadership in Austin did not give it a hearing. At the same time, our system in Texas is designed primarily for the summer heat--"}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: --and not necessarily for a winter event. The reality is climate change is real. It is real, and these major storms can happen at any time. The system needs to be weatherized. You need to maintain adequate reserve. And we need to open up our Texas grid because right now we-- we have a closed grid. We can't get generation from outside of the state because of our system. And then it's a market driven system. When the demand exceeds the supply, the cost that the generation-- the generators can charge can go from a few thousand to nine thousand megawatts."}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: All of this was foreseeable. I wrote about it in 2011. And so for these exorbitant costs, it's not the consumers who should assume that costs. They-- they are not at fault for what happened this week."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well then who should then?"}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: The bill should go to the state of Texas. The state of Texas--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that still goes back to taxpayers, no?"}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: Well, there-- there-- there's a huge rainy-day fund in the city of Houston. Ultimately, all of the-- the dollars, the revenues that come in, whether it's the city, the state or the federal government, comes from the taxpayers."}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: But what I am saying for people in, for example, in this city or in other cities, when they're getting these exorbitant electricity bills and they're having to pay for their homes, repair their homes, they should not have to bear the responsibility of paying a thousand dollars a day, or two thousand dollars a day."}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: Those bills, those exorbitant costs should be borne by the state of Texas and not the individual consumers--"}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: --who did not cause this catastrophe this week."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very-- very quickly, can you get vaccines back on track?"}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: Vaccines started in the city of Houston yesterday. As of-- on Monday, February the second, the major distribution, the FEMA site, will open. That would be six thousand vaccines per day for the next six to eight weeks. In addition to our normal supply, I suspect that this coming week we'll probably vaccine more than a hundred thousand people in the city of Houston. The people are resilient. I'm very proud of the people in the city of Houston, how they've come together. And then we are putting together, let me just add--"}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: --a special fund--"}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: --relief fund to assist people who don't have insurance, people who don't have the financial means to assist them--"}
{"original": "MAYOR TURNER: --in repairing their homes while we wait on the federal monies to come forward. And I want to thank the President--"}
{"original": "MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER: --for signing the disaster declaration. That will help out quite a bit."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Mayor, thank you."}
{"original": "We'll be right back with another Texas mayor, Betsy Price."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the mayor of Fort Worth, Texas, in just a moment. We're having some communication issues there. As you know, there are some power issues in Texas. So when we get that right back up, we will take you to the mayor of Fort Worth. But standing by, we do have former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who's joining us from Westport, Connecticut. He sits on the board of Illumina and Pfizer. Doctor Gottlieb jumping into the fire again. I want to ask you, the numbers frankly look good in terms of the infection rate going down, but we are about to cross this morbid milestone of half a million Americans dead. Where are we in this? And should we be optimistic, given the infection decline?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Look, this has taken a tragic toll on the United States, but we should be optimistic in my view. I think we're going to continue to see infection rates decline into the spring and the summer. Right now they're falling quite dramatically. I think these trends are likely to continue. The new variants do create new risks. I think B.1.1.7 creates some risk that we could see a resurgence of infection in certain parts of the country and higher prevalence overall in the spring and summer than we might have seen without this strain. But it's not going to be enough to reverse these trends at this point. I think it's too little, too late in most parts of the country. With rising vaccination rates and also the fact that we've infected about a third of the public, that's enough protective immunity that we're likely to see these trends continue. The risk is really to the fall. And one last point, if you look at the counties in New York and New Jersey that had greater than forty-five percent seroprevalence, meaning that forty-- more than forty-five percent of the population was infected going into the winter, they really didn't have much of a winter surge. So once you get to about forty percent of the population with some form of protective immunity, you don't have herd immunity, meaning that--"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: --this won't transfer at all. It will continue to transfer, but it will transfer at a much slower rate. And that's what we have right now around the country."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you reach herd immunity without vaccinating children since they make up a quarter of the population?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: No, you can't. But I don't really think we're ever going to reach true herd immunity. This isn't going to be like measles or smallpox where it just sort of goes away. COVID is going to continue to circulate at a low level. Hopefully we'll continue to vaccinate the vulnerable population, so we'll protect them from hospitalizations or severe illness and dying from this. But this is going to continue to spread. And I think as we get into the fall, we need to be prepared of those new variants. The P.1 and the B.1.351, the South African and the Brazilian variant could become more prevalent here in the United States. And that's why you see the manufacturers-- the vaccine manufacturers, including Pfizer, the company I'm on the board of, trying to reengineer those vaccines and develop boosters that cover those new variants. We have time to work this out. You see the CDC investing a lot of resources in sequencing to try to uncover these new variants. So we do have time. I think we're going to have this spring and the summer to work this out and prepare much better for the fall."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm--Hm. Will high schoolers be vaccinated by the fall? Will elementary school children-- I mean, when do they get the shot?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Yeah, I think it's possible that this vaccine gets moved into the high school-age population in the fall. And that really should be the goal because we've seen the spread happen more in the high schools than the elementary schools. And we know that high schools-- high school students are probably at equivalent risk in terms of contracting this and spreading the infection. There's less risk in the grade school-age children. I don't believe that this vaccine is going to get moved to twelve and under heading into the fall. The studies are underway right now looking at that. It may be a question of trying to reformulate the vaccines at a lower dose for younger kids because they develop a more robust immune response from the vaccine. What's likely to happen is maybe it's not licensed for twelve and under, but we have it available if we have to put it in that age population, if in fact we run into trouble."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: But I think students are likely to start school without being vaccinated for twelve and under and maybe in the high school as we introduce the vaccine."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And so bottom line, when will we know if the vaccine prevents you from transmitting the virus?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Well, there's accruing evidence right now that it does. There's evidence out today, another study out of Israel, and I think the data out of Israel is going to be the most definitive answer to this question in the near term. I think conventional wisdom right now is that--"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: --the vaccine does prevent infection and does prevent transmission. The question is the magnitude. We don't know the full magnitude of that effect yet."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Doctor Gottlieb, thank you very much for your time. We will be right back."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Thanks a lot."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: FACE THE NATION has a podcast now. A new episode drops every Friday. And on our latest edition of Facing Forward, I spoke with Lexi Reese, chief operating officer of Gusto. You can listen and subscribe on Apple podcast or your favorite podcast platform."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with former Trump deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, and hopefully the mayor of Fort Worth."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Matthew Pottinger was the deputy national security adviser during the Trump administration and one of the first people inside the White House to sound the alarm about the coronavirus as it emerged last year. He had previously worked as a journalist in China, and later a Marine Corps intelligence officer. Yesterday, he spoke with us in what he said was the spirit of sharing information about what he thinks still needs to be fixed within the government to deal with future pandemics."}
{"original": "MATTHEW POTTINGER (Former Deputy National Security Adviser): The-- the Chinese government was not sharing useful data with anyone in the world. The World Health Organization was parroting misinformation about this virus. They were-- they were claiming that it is not featuring significant human-to-human spread. They continued for weeks, even months, to claim that there was not a significant amount of asymptomatic spread. So that misled our public health experts. I-- I was able to call doctors on the ground in China in late January. And they were already telling me, look, this thing spreads asymptomatically. Half of the cases or more are asymptomatic. That was a different story from what the Chinese government was telling."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why is it that you were seeing and hearing things from doctors that the official health organizations were not getting?"}
{"original": "MATTHEW POTTINGER: We had about a dozen CDC officers in China. We have lots of CDC officers in the United States who deal with Chinese doctors. I had covered the SARS epidemic back in 2003 when I was living in China, writing for The Wall Street Journal. So I dusted off some of my old contacts and talked to Chinese doctors who had firsthand information about this pandemic. And they were very open. They said, yeah, this thing is not going to be like SARS 2003. It's going to be like the 1918 flu pandemic because it's spreading silently."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was the administration being intentionally misled here or was it a problem in terms of how our own public health officials consumed information?"}
{"original": "MATTHEW POTTINGER: We were a little bit too credulous. We were-- we were waiting to be fed information. When the nature of that regime meant that we were not going to get that information, they-- they had a strong incentive to mislead their own public and the rest of the world about the nature of this virus."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the World Health Organization has said that COVID-19 was circulating in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Why didn't U.S. health officials or U.S. intelligence know earlier about this threat?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: Well, U.S. intelligence wasn't focused on these kinds of questions. They-- they were relying on the CDC. The problem was the Chinese Communist Party did not turn to their CDC to deal with this crisis. They turned to their military. And our CDC did not have relations established with the Chinese military. So the director of the Chinese CDC, based on public reporting, didn't know either. I mean, the Chinese CDC director did not know that this thing was circulating until the last day of December, which is incredible when you think about that. So it looks like the Chinese CDC to some extent was cut out because the Chinese Communist Party turned to its military to try to cover this thing up, to try to contain it until it was too late."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the-- the Biden administration and their national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said he has deep concerns about the World Health Organization's recent report and Chinese interference in it."}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: Look, the World Health Organization made all sorts of-- of un-- untruthful or-- or misinformed claims about this virus. So, the WHO has a lot to answer for. When it comes to the-- this investigation into the origins, unfortunately, we're seeing a panel that's been sent to China that is deeply conflicted. You have people who were hand-selected by the Chinese government. They had a veto over who could come in."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: U.S. intelligence has said COVID, according to wide scientific consensus, was not man-made or genetically modified. You are not in any way alleging that it was, are you?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: No. If you weigh the circumstantial evidence, the ledger on the side of an explanation that says that this resulted from some kind of human error, it far outweighs the-- the side of the scale that says this was some natural outbreak. We have very strong reason to believe that the Chinese military was doing secret classified animal experiments in that same laboratory, going all the way back to at least 2017. We have good reason to believe that there was an outbreak of flu-like illness among researchers working in the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the fall of 2019, but right-- immediately before the first documented cases came to light."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what you're referring to is some information that the State Department declassified right before the end of the Trump administration."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it said that you have reason to believe a COVID-like disease was circulating in autumn of 2019 in China. Is there evidence to back up that assessment?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: There is. And that was a very carefully crafted statement, carefully crafted so as not to overstate the case that-- that it was making. The case it was making was for following up on these important leads."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's unpack some of what you were saying about the response here at home. It's-- it's been widely reported that you went into the Oval Office alongside National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and told President Trump at the end of January that this would be the greatest national security threat that he ever faced. Did he understand the gravity of what you were saying at that time?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: I think he did. That was something that Robert O'Brien told the President. To the President's credit, he decided to shut down travel from China."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Around that same time, though, the American public is being told that this is not a direct threat to them. Robert O'Brien was on FACE THE NATION saying exactly that."}
{"original": "ROBERT O'BRIEN (February 2, 2020): Right now, there's-- there's no reason for Americans to panic. This is something that is low risk, we think, in the U.S."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that what you thought at the time?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: I-- I thought that it was going to be potentially quite-- quite devastating. You could match that against quotes from-- from a great number of public health experts in this country and abroad who were saying similar things because we did not have hard evidence from the Chinese government that this thing was-- was as dangerous as it was. So my view was, let-- let's prepare for the worst."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in preparing for the worst inside the National Security Council, you started telling your staffers to wear masks. Yet the American public wasn't told definitively by the CDC to wear masks until April, why?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: Yeah. Remember, we-- we misjudged the nature of this thing to think that it was like flu, one of the mistakes that followed on from that was the misjudgment by public health officials in this country to-- to not advocate for the widespread generalized use of face coverings, cloth masks, surgical masks and what have you. That was, they feared shortages, rightly. We'd put all of our mask making supply chains into, guess where, China. And China was not making it easy for us to get access to-- to additional supplies. So the CDC, that was an understandable thing to do. But it then made the mistake of conflating that with a-- a set of advice that masks don't work effectively for the general public. That was a big mistake. Robert O'Brien and I weren't really willing to wait. And so we thought that the risk of an outbreak in the White House could be potentially devastating for the United States. It would-- it would-- that would create a national security risk. And so in early April, we started looking for supplies of masks. I ended up calling a foreign government. I called some senior officials in Taiwan just to-- just to ask for lessons learned. Taiwan had done better than probably any other country in the world at-- at containing this-- this virus. And so in the course of my conversation, I asked whether they had masks available."}
{"original": "They agreed to send a shipment of half a million masks just a couple of days later. We put those masks into the national stockpile so they'd be available to front-line medical workers. I made sure that one box got delivered to the White House and was disseminated through the NSC and the White House Medical Unit."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you knew enough to call a foreign government to ask for masks, but the American public wasn't being told yet to wear them and the President wasn't wearing them. How do you make sense of that?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: Yeah, it's frustrating. The-- the-- the mask misstep cost us dearly. It was the one tool that was widely available, at least homemade, you know, cotton masks were widely available. It was the one effective, widely available tool that we had in the arsenal to-- to deal with this. You know, public health officials were stuck in this sort of flu mentality. It was-- it was a-- it was a grave misstep. The other really grave misstep, and this is the one that I-- I think we haven't rectified yet, and we've got to rectify it. It has to do with the collection and analysis of critical data about how this virus is spreading in real time, so that we can stay ahead of it, ensure that-- that we-- we don't get sucker punched by a new variant that could compromise the effectiveness of our-- of our vaccine. And this is an area where the Centers for Disease Control has stumbled very, very badly. I-- I know that the new director, Doctor Walensky, is-- is working hard on trying to get the-- get a far greater number of samples of this virus genetically sequenced, which is critical. We-- everyone should give as much support to her in that endeavor as possible. But there are cultural and organ-- organizational problems that still need to be rectified at the CDC. If we're-- if we're going to have a chance at success, both in-- in bottling up this pandemic and also preventing the next one."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Inside the White House, the Commander-in-Chief himself got COVID. Matt, I mean, as a national security risk, did you ever look and say who exposed him and figure out how that happened?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: I mean, it was a terrible day. I was-- I was overseas when we got the news that the President had been infected. It was scary."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But was it-- should there have been a real contact tracing effort within the White House to pin down the source of the outbreak? I mean, wasn't that a national security lapse?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: You've got to remember at that moment you-- we had-- we had multiple cases. It may have had to do in part with the-- the-- the quality of the tests that we were using. There was a range of different tests that the White House was using to screen staff. Some were more effective than others. But I-- I'm not certain that there-- there was a failure to do that kind of contact tracing."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment with more of our interview. Stay with us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go back to our conversation with former Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I've heard you on all the criticisms of the CDC and you've highlighted some really specific areas for them to improve."}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: My view is that they should establish a new super body for pandemic preparedness and response within the CDC, probably move it from Atlanta into Washington, DC, so that-- that-- that person who's in charge of that can also be attached to the White House."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is your prime reform to the CDC to prevent us from being sucker-punched the next time?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: That's-- that's one of them. The other one would be to create a centers for lessons learned like-- like I-- like the military has for each of its service branches. You have a quasi-independent body of investigators who can go in and talk to anybody and everybody, collect lessons learned in real time and then report. It's important that the director of the CDC and the other senior leadership actually listen to those reports and implement the-- the lessons learned so that you've got a living organization that's learning. That is not, unfortunately, what the CDC is today. There's-- so the-- the final thing really about the CDC is cultural. The-- the CDC has developed over the years, even though it's got great talent in there and-- and-- and well-meaning people and a lot of expertise, it's developed an academic kind of mindset."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say the CDC, are you talking about Director Redfield?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: Bob Redfield did the very best that he could with what he had. I'm talking about institutionally in the-- in the belly of this institution. CDC was unwilling to-- to partner with industrial labs to do tens of thousands of-- of sequences so that-- so that you could actually see where this thing was going. They wanted to do it internally. And-- and I think the reason for that is they want the data themselves so that they can publish. There's a very powerful incentive within CDC culture to partner with academic institutions rather than private institutions and-- and to collect data, submit for peer review articles that burnish your credentials. That's a very slow process. That's not the-- the kind of incentive you want for dealing with a fast moving pandemic."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much of this is a question of if this should be handled by public health officials at all, or whether a pandemic should be handed over to intelligence officials and handled like a national security threat?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: The intelligence community does need to prioritize the collection of intelligence on these kinds of bio threats rather than relying strictly on-- on sister-to-sister relationships between our CDC and-- and public health officials in other countries. But I don't think that the intelligence community is going to be able to-- to do more than that critical role of-- of collecting and analyzing the information."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're clearly thinking a lot of what could have been done differently. Do you think that the Trump administration did the best it could?"}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: We had an impeachment, the first impeachment trial taking place as the coronavirus task force was meeting at a time when the country wasn't focused on-- on this pandemic. People in the White House were. People at Health and Human Services and at the CDC were. I-- I never encountered anyone at a senior level who was not deeply seized by the major weight of what we were facing. I do think that people did their best. I'm-- I'm doing this Hot Wash, as I call it, in the-- in the spirit of trying to help understand that the narrative that it was all political failures at the top is not true. And so what I'm trying to-- to bring to light here is that we have a deeper problem with the permanent government in how we are organized culturally and-- and organizationally to deal with this pandemic and with future ones. I want us to succeed at getting better."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Matt Pottinger, thank you very much for your time."}
{"original": "MATT POTTINGER: Thank you. Thanks a lot, Margaret."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our full interview is available on our website as well as on our FACE THE NATION podcast platform."}
{"original": "We'll be back in a moment with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We think we've worked out that technical issue in Texas and can go now to Betsy Price, who's the mayor of Fort Worth. Good morning to you, Madam Mayor."}
{"original": "MAYOR BETSY PRICE (R-Fort Worth/@MayorBetsyPrice): Good morning, Margaret. Let's hope we got this worked out. It's a perfect storm, no pun intended."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm-- I'm glad we're talking now. Republicans have been in charge of Texas and the energy system by default for years now. After this week's blackouts, what do you think needs to change? Do you trust the state to manage the grid?"}
{"original": "BETSY PRICE: Well, I think the citizens are depending on their local leaders to insist that we get answers and we're going to demand those answers of the state because the state runs the power grid and we're the ones who dealt with the issues on the ground. So, yeah, they're going to have to come up with solid answers and solutions."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe the state needs to maintain control. I mean, I-- I was looking into this and-- and the majority of the ERCOT board, the energy grid operator, the people on the board don't even live in the state of Texas. Are they in touch at all with what's going on? I mean, what's the problem here?"}
{"original": "BETSY PRICE: I certainly hope they're in touch, but it doesn't appear that way. And I think that's what surprised more people than anything is that they are not Texans who have not been living here. Most people didn't realize that, including myself. I didn't realize that. And, of course, now you've had the perfect storm, a state-wide storm that's tested our system. And we just have to-- we went through this ten years ago. I know Mayor Turner said that and the solutions were put on the table. But at the time, when Texas was coming out of an economic downturn and they just didn't want to spend the money to do it. Now, our economy is strong even with COVID and we're going to have to do that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The governor has said lawmakers should make sure that Texans themselves don't have to pay for this. But, I mean, let's be honest, the bills got to go somewhere. Who do you expect to pay for it?"}
{"original": "BETSY PRICE: Well, we expect the state to step up and pay it, but of course, the state is taxpayers."}
{"original": "BETSY PRICE: You and I fund government and that's where it comes from. But the state does have a big rainy-day fund and they do have access to other sales tax and things that everybody shares a piece of. They're just going to have to take a real hard look at this and see what piece gets passed back directly to consumers and what piece they pick up on it."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would not support any kind of request to the federal government for increased aid to pick up the bill for this?"}
{"original": "BETSY PRICE: I think that we will go to the feds. It will probably be a partner on this. We'll just have to work through it and see. Right now, for me at the local level, we're focused on getting water and power back to our citizens first and foremost. We're not playing politics here. We're in public service. And we got to get power, water and food delivered to our citizens. But we're going to demand answers as we go along with this process."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need more federal resources right now? I know President Biden has had this major disaster declaration. What do you need?"}
{"original": "BETSY PRICE: Well, FEMA has been very good about stepping up, providing water and some of the services. The state's provided some of the State Guard to help us for our services. What we're going to need most, it will appear, is probably grants to help people who have broken pipes, whose homes are flooded. My own home is flooded, and I'll have insurance to help with that, but many people don't. And so at some point, we're going to have to have additional plumbers and resources, but there's going to have to be dollars follow that to help these folks who don't have the ability to pay this themselves."}
{"original": "BETSY PRICE: And that's going to have to come through the federal government."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you can restart vaccinations when?"}
{"original": "BETSY PRICE: We believe we'll restart vaccinations probably tomorrow. At the very latest Tuesday morning early."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Mayor Price, thank you for your time and good luck to you."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to bring back former FDA commissioner and Pfizer board member Doctor Scott Gottlieb for a quick final word. Doctor Gottlieb, we've asked you in the past about what you think happened with the origins of this virus. I wonder what you took away from Matt Pottinger's insights there. He made some news."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD: Yeah, look, the most likely scenario here is that this came from nature, that this was bouncing back and forth between people and animals for a period of time and finally broke out. I think the lab leak theory, the fact that this could have been an-- an accident out of that lab is never going to be fully dispelled. And the WHO shouldn't walk away from that so easily. I think the one thing that Matt said in that interview, which is interesting and I think is new, is that the Chinese military was in that institute doing experiments and doing experiments with animals. That does create increased risk that this could have jumped from animals to people inside that laboratory."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. And he detailed some of that. We're going to have our full interview online. I-- I was pressing the current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, on some of this. He didn't dispute the report. He also didn't address it. But the bottom line is that both administrations agree there needs to be more data shared by China. Specifically what answers are needed?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, they-- one thing that you'd want to look at is antibody tests in people who worked in that lab to see if they have prior exposure to COVID. Now, those tests may not show antibodies at this point because it's been some period of time, but that data is available and it wasn't shared with the WHO team. And so you'd want to see that data for sure."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: You'd want to see some of the source strain, some of the original strains, to see how this has evolved over time and try to get closer to the source of the initial outbreak."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Important to protect us against the next time. Doctor Gottlieb, thank you for your insights."}
{"original": "And that is it for us today. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan."}
{"original": "The person (or persons) who purchased the single winning ticket for this past weekend's $429.6 million Powerball jackpot has not yet come forward to claim the prize. Waiting to claim a prize like that is a wise thing to do."}
{"original": "Winning the lottery is exciting, but also exposes you to unique risks. When you step forward to claim a big prize, it's newsworthy, it's a public event and -- unless you take specific steps to protect yourself -- there's no way to escape the publicity and loss of privacy. Almost all lottery programs publish the identity of people who publicly claim the prize due to the open records or sunshine laws."}
{"original": "I can't think of any upside to claiming such a large financial prize in a public manner. If you casually promised people you'd buy things or give them money, your new-found riches will be a lightning rod for attracting the attention of family and friends. Everything you say or do will be taken in a much different context than before you became rich. If you don't deliver on a promise, you may find yourself having to defend against a lawsuit claiming breach of a verbal agreement or contract. It's better to keep your lips zipped about your generous intentions and surprise family and friends with generosity."}
{"original": "If you have a winning lottery ticket, and have verified it contains all of the winning numbers, sign it. Then make a copy of the ticket and put the original in a secure location, such as a safe deposit box at a bank."}
{"original": "Most states' lotteries have a six to 12-month statute of limitations before a winning ticket expires. So check with the state's lottery commission to verify how long a winner has to claim a prize. Take a few weeks, or even months, to assemble a team of trust-worthy advisers -- an attorney, a tax adviser, and a financial adviser -- to help you decide how to claim your winnings."}
{"original": "The next step is to work with your attorney, who can represent you and keep your identity as private as possible. A trustworthy and skillful attorney will help you establish the authenticity of your claim while ensuring your identity is not released to the public. The attorney should give you advice about setting up a legal entity, such as a Limited Liability Company, or LLC, or a revocable trust. The purpose of this would be to transfer the ownership of the ticket into the LLC or trust, and minimize gift taxes (in the case of multiple people owning one ticket.) This entity would eventually be used to claim and receive the proceeds of the prize. Your attorney can also help you decide how to claim the prize and represent your claim to the lottery officials."}
{"original": "When you set up the entity, use an unlisted phone number and a U.S Postal Service or commercial Post Office Box. Lottery winners who come forward publicly get barraged with unsolicited mail and phone calls from a cast of characters with every story in the book. These characters have the same objective: to pry some of your new found wealth from you. These steps will help you avoid the majority of these characters."}
{"original": "Most lottery prizes can be paid out in either a one-time lump sum or in annual installments of ten to 25 years. Some lottery games require players to decide how they want to be paid when they buy their tickets. Other lottery games allow you a period of time, such as 60 days, to decide how to receive the prize after you submit the claim."}
{"original": "Basically, the choice is whether to take a cash lump sum or to receive smaller annual payments over an extended period of time. Either way, all payments received are taxed as ordinary income."}
{"original": "Most lottery winners elect to receive their prize in a none-time lump sum. For many, that may be a mistake. One reason for this behavior is some winners are incorrectly advised that their survivors will get nothing or be forced to deal with estate tax problems if they choose installments. This simply is not true. Under lottery commission rules, survivors may request to cash out some or the entire remaining installment payments to pay any estate taxes due at the death of the winner and they can do this without penalty or additional cost."}
{"original": "When you take the lump sum, the first thing to realize is that about 45 to 50 percent of the lump sum prize will be lost up front to pay income taxes. You'll need tax advice as to how much tax you'll owe and when tax payments must be made."}
{"original": "Next, you'll need to create an investment plan for the remaining lump sum proceeds, which means you'll need to hire an investment adviser. Finally, you'll be tempted to make large purchases and invest with large amounts of money, and those investments will most likely be complicated, illiquid and risky. All of this is risky business and most lottery winners do not fare well when taking the lump sum."}
{"original": "If instead you elect to receive installments, here's what happens:"}
{"original": "According to the Multi-State Lottery, when the winner chooses to receive installments, the lottery commission will invest the entire cash lump sum amount, unreduced by income taxes. They request competitive bids from major financial institutions for a portfolio of bonds backed by the U.S government and U.S. government agencies. The bonds are purchased with maturity dates that coincide with the annual cash payments each year. The bonds are held in a trust account, which is secure from creditors, where a major bank or financial institution is the custodian. In each year that an amount of bonds come due, the cash is paid over to the revenue or finance division of the state of the prizewinner, and the payment is sent to the individual."}
{"original": "In short, taking the installments is a low risk financial strategy, the return is reasonable and the payments are protected from creditors -- or from being stolen by a crooked adviser. The benefit of receiving installments is that if you blow the money paid to you from one year, you'll hopefully learn your lesson and will manage the remaining installments more carefully. You could do a lot worse."}
{"original": "Julián Castro spoke with Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan from San Antonio, Texas, for the Jan. 13, 2019 broadcast."}
{"original": "Read more interviews of 2020 candidates on Face the Nation here."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: With dozens of Democrats considering a 2020 presidential bid on Saturday the former mayor of San Antonio, Julián Castro, became the latest candidate. Castro gained national attention when he delivered the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic convention and he was also secretary of housing and urban development during the Obama Administration. The grandson of a Mexican immigrant, Julian Castro has already been endorsed by a Democratic member of Congress, his twin brother, Joaquin. And Julian Castro joins us from the site of his announcement. Welcome to FACE THE NATION."}
{"original": "JULIÁN CASTRO: Thanks a lot. Great to be with you, Margaret."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president visited your home state of Texas this week, went to the border, said there is a humanitarian and national security crisis. Do you agree with him that there is a crisis at the border?"}
{"original": "CASTRO: What I believe is that he's created a tragedy at the border. This policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that Customs and Border Protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. That's a real tragedy. And, you know, the folks down on the border know - and many of them have said - in fact, I just saw one border resident the other day on camera that said that a wall is not the answer. That we can have strong border security with personnel, with technology, but that the wall is not the answer. So the president may have his rhetoric but everybody else has the facts right that a wall isn't the answer."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that family separation policy has been paused at least. But there are a record number of family units crossing the border and that creates a lot of challenges. So what would you do? Would you extend the amount of time that families can be held together in detention?"}
{"original": "CASTRO: I don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status, so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country. And we- we have developed some ways to do that but that we don't detain them the way that we have been. So no, I don't agree with that. The other thing I'll say Margaret, and this is very important is, I hope that folks remember that the president said that he wanted to do this family separation policy because it would deter more families coming from these countries. And actually the exact opposite happened. And so he's failed. He's a failed leader on this issue and now he's just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time. And it's just a failure of leadership all around. I would end this kind of family detention. I would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology, and that does not scapegoat these immigrants but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been calling immigration system broken for some time and you were critical even under the Obama administration, specifically about their high level of deportations. So what do you offer as an alternative if you're not going to detain and you're not going to deport what do you do with illegal immigrants?"}
{"original": "CASTRO: Well, what I believe we could do and what the Obama administration did do I believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that you're able to monitor where people are in the country and ensure that they report back when they need to and that they are part of, you know, legal proceedings. But we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. And the president is playing games with this, blocking people's right to seek asylum. I would change that. I would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if they've been law abiding, if they pay a fine, that- that they can get an earned path to citizenship. I still believe that that should be part of the answer."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You announced your candidacy today and almost immediately the RNC issued a statement. I want to read it here to you. It says, Julián Castro has made history by becoming one of the biggest lightweights to ever run for president. He was a weak mayor who couldn't even handle being HUD secretary. This is obviously just another desperate attempt to become someone else's running mate. These are sharp words, but it's the first official attack on you. How do you respond and- and how do you explain why you are qualified to be Commander in Chief?"}
{"original": "CASTRO: Well first of all, I think they could just dust off those same words, you know they're going to use those kinds of words for every single Democrat that decides to run for president. I wouldn't put too much stock in that. I would just say to the American people directly, I've had executive experience. I've led one of the largest, most diverse cities in the country. I've led a federal agency at HUD and- and done some great work to expand opportunity. I know what it takes to ensure that we have a government that functions well and to help inspire people. I also have a life experience that I think resonates with a lot of Americans. You know I'm here in my neighborhood that I grew up in. Grew up in a single parent household, went to the public schools here in San Antonio. Was able to go to college and law school and to reach my American dream. And I am motivated to make sure that every American can reach their dreams. And then, I have a strong vision for the country's future. I want to make sure that in this century, this 21st century, that we are the smartest, the healthiest, the fairest and the most prosperous nation on earth."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're going to have a- a lot of competition for the Democratic nomination. It looks to be a very crowded field. How are you going to distinguish yourself?"}
{"original": "CASTRO: I'm going to articulate a very strong positive vision for the country's future. I'm going to get out there and work hard. I'm gonna make sure that I let people know what I've actually accomplished in the executive experience that I have. And I think that right now people are looking for a leader that can show they can get things done. Being a mayor is all about getting things done. And when I was cabinet secretary I got things done. They want government that functions well now and somebody that's trying to bring people together instead of tear them apart. So I'm going to go out there and make my case. And you know I'm under no illusion right now that- that I'm in the poll position or anything. I'm not a front runner but nobody who grew up here in these neighborhoods, including myself, has ever been a front runner. And I think in this country right now, that there are a lot of people who don't feel like front runners. And I'm going to go speak to them in this campaign."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well some of the things you outlined as part of your platform today, Medicare for all, universal access to prekindergarten education, a Green New Deal, these put you in the more liberal or progressive wing of the Democratic Party. So one of the challenges for you is how do you attract centrists or people who perhaps were alienated by the president but aren't comfortable with being so reliant on the government as their main provider?"}
{"original": "CASTRO: What I hear out there is that there are a lot of folks, a lot of people, who want us to invest in universal health care. There are a lot of people- even people that call themselves centrists that think of themselves as- as not necessarily- you know they wouldn't call themselves liberal. But a lot of people are ready for universal health care. I mean look at the polls. When- when it's polled you know it gets over 60, 70 percent of support--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Medicare for all you mean."}
{"original": "CASTRO: And so I think- that's right. And I believe that this country is ready for that. Now you bring up the issue or one- one issue people bring up is OK well you know- of course, you know we're going to put forward a plan. And I'm sure people have other- have their own plans of how we would accomplish that. And I'm under no illusion that accomplishing something like Medicare for all would be easy. But I do believe that in this nation, in the richest nation on earth, that not a single person should be without health care when they need it. And so I believe it is worth it, that that fight is worth it. And whether people call themselves liberal or centrists or conservative, what they want right now is they want to know that- that you're coming at them straight and that you're being honest with them. And I'm going to be honest with folks."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what is that going to cost taxpayers? Because Bernie Sanders, when he ran in the last campaign, had a universal health care call and estimates showed it costing one point four trillion dollars a year. You gotta make some real changes there to be able to pay for it."}
{"original": "CASTRO: No, you do. There's no question that it's going to take several things. I think it's going to take asking wealthier individuals to pay their fair share--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean?"}
{"original": "CASTRO: --we've had basically the- the last 40 years. Well, I mean I think we've had the last 40 years essentially of- of lower and lower commitment on people at the very top. Same thing goes for corporations. We have corporations - multinational corporations - that are hardly paying anything in federal taxes."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to increase the corporate tax rate?"}
{"original": "CASTRO: --we need to ask them to pay their fair share. I think that we can consider different ways, different proposals, to be able to raise more revenue from the wealthiest corporations. I also think it's interesting, Margaret, you know, that I'm here in a neighborhood that was built up like a not- a lot of neighborhoods by small businesses. Little convenience stores, little restaurants, little dry cleaners. And at the same time, that a company like Amazon, that is one of the biggest companies in the world, can get huge tax- tax breaks, huge abatements, and also only begrudgingly end up paying their- their employees 15 dollars an hour."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well how would you- how would you ask--"}
{"original": "CASTRO: We need to change that in this country."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: How would you ask those same people to pay for the Green New Deal you're calling for? Are you going to put a tax on gases and fossil fuels? How are you going to pay for that?"}
{"original": "CASTRO: Yeah, so I look forward during the course of- of this campaign to putting forward proposals on each of these things. And- and I think that- that a vast majority of the American people are ready for that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We will be tracking you and your campaign and more details as you promise them there. Thank you so much for joining us."}
{"original": "The Treasury Department now says that Americans on Social Security will not be required to file a simple tax return to receive a stimulus check from the U.S. government. The announcement reversed an earlier statement from the Internal Revenue Service that participants in the federal retirement program would need to file such a return to get the funds."}
{"original": "The IRS directive would have impacted about 15 million people, including millions of seniors on Social Security, who aren't required to file tax returns, according to Chuck Marr, senior director of federal tax policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Seniors who rely on Social Security for their sole source of income don't have to file tax returns."}
{"original": "The Treasury's reversal comes after lawmakers including Senators Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, both Democrats, expressed alarm over the guidance, saying in a letter on Wednesday to the IRS and Treasury that it will place a significant burden on retired seniors and individuals who experience disabilities."}
{"original": "The lawmakers had urged the IRS and Treasury to make sure the payments are automatically sent to vulnerable seniors and disabled Americans without them needing to file a tax return, especially given that the IRS's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and Tax Counseling for the Elderly program has been closed due to the coronavirus."}
{"original": "Many Americans are counting on the stimulus checks to help them stay afloat financially during the coronavirus pandemic. The payments amount to $1,200 for individuals who earn less than $75,000 per year and $500 per child younger than 17. The IRS will use the information from Social Security statements to send the $1,200 checks to Social Security recipients who did not file tax returns in 2018 or 2019, Treasury said late Wednesday."}
{"original": "Social Security recipients who are not typically required to file a tax return need to take no action, and will receive their payment directly to their bank account, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement."}
{"original": "The IRS's guidance on Monday sought to provide more details about what Americans need to know about receiving a government check to help ease the massive blow from the virus on the economy, but also created concern and confusion with its statement that some seniors would have to file the simple tax return."}
{"original": "In the earlier guidance, the tax agency noted that people who don't typically file a tax return will need to file a simple tax return to get their check, which impacts millions of seniors, low-income taxpayers, some veterans and individuals with disabilities. The simple tax form would ask for a person's filing status, number of dependents and direct-deposit bank account information, the IRS said on Monday."}
{"original": "I just read the IRS website for which people need to file a simple tax return to get the stimulus check. As per everything else with this administration it's confusing & not entirely clear!!! I'll keep studying it until I get the answers! 🤔 — ReapwhatuSow (@Vickyisgrateful) March 31, 2020"}
{"original": "That raised questions about whether seniors who failed to file a simple tax return would forfeit their stimulus checks or face delays or other issues. On social media, some consumers expressed confusion over the requirement. The Treasury department earlier on Wednesday had told CBS MoneyWatch that it was examining whether seniors who didn't file the simple tax return would still receive stimulus checks, and that it hoped to provide more guidance."}
{"original": "Most Americans don't need to do anything to receive a check, given that the IRS is relying on 2018 and 2019 tax returns to find household income — which determines the amount of an individual's stimulus check — and direct deposit information for bank accounts."}
{"original": "The requirement to file a new return could have caused millions of seniors to miss out on stimulus payments, based on what happened in 2008 when the government issued stimulus checks to help offset the damage households suffered during the Great Recession. At the time, lawmakers required millions of people who don't typically file tax returns, including some seniors and veterans, to file annual returns."}
{"original": "But about 3.5 million of those Americans didn't file the required returns and lost out on the stimulus payments, Marr noted in a post."}
{"original": "LONDON — Ireland says it will begin collecting more than 13 billion euros ($15.9 billion) of back taxes from Apple (AAPL), 19 months after the European Commission ruled that a tax deal with the tech giant amounted to illegal state aid."}
{"original": "The Commission ordered Ireland to collect back taxes for the years 2003-2014, which it estimated at 13 billion euros, plus interest. Ireland disagreed, saying the ruling undermined the integrity of the country's tax system."}
{"original": "But Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe says he will on Tuesday sign an agreement setting up the escrow account that will hold the payments while Apple and Ireland appeal. The payments should be completed by September."}
{"original": "Donohoe says the government fundamentally disagrees with the ruling, but Ireland is intent on complying with our binding legal obligations in this regard."}
{"original": "A federal judge has ruled that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort breached his plea agreement with special counsel Robert Mueller's office by lying to the FBI, a federal grand jury and the special counsel. [T]he Office of Special Counsel is no longer bound by its obligations under the plea agreement, Judge Amy Berman Jackson said in a ruling after a hearing in Washington on Wednesday."}
{"original": "The ruling means the special counsel is released from its promise to support a reduced sentence for Manafort in exchange for his cooperation. Manafort is due to be sentenced March 13. The government can also now file additional charges against Manafort for lying, but prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said in January there was no current intention to do so."}
{"original": "Manafort faces a maximum of 10 years in prison on the two felony conspiracy counts."}
{"original": "Manafort's attorneys had vehemently opposed the government's contention that Manafort had lied, filing a memorandum with the court Wednesday morning arguing there was no basis to determine he had intentionally misled investigators."}
{"original": "In November 2018, Mueller's office told the court Manafort had lied to investigators while he was supposed to be cooperating about five aspects of the government's investigation, most notably about his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political operative with ties to the Kremlin. Jackson ruled Manafort lied to the government about three of those instances."}
{"original": "Since November 2017, Jackson has kept the case under a gag order, banning the government and lawyers for Manafort and his former associate Rick Gates from speaking to the press."}
{"original": "Manafort was found guilty of financial crimes including bank fraud and lying on his tax returns in August 2018. Facing the prospect of another trial, he pleaded guilty to two additional felonies and soon afterward agreed to cooperate with the government."}
{"original": "The special counsel accused Manafort of lying to federal prosecutors on a variety of subjects, though he was required by his plea agreement to cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly."}
{"original": "In particular, Manafort was found to be lying about his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, who ran Manafort's office in Kiev. But the nature of those allegations is not known because the material in the filing related to Kilimnik remains heavily redacted."}
{"original": "Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort departs from U.S. District Court in Washington on Feb. 28, 2018. Reuters"}
{"original": "Jackson was unconvinced by the special counsel's claim that Manafort lied about Kilimnik's role in the obstruction of justice conspiracy. She also did not find that the government had proven he intentionally lied about his communications with anyone in the Trump administration."}
{"original": "Kilimnik, who has ties to Russian intelligence, was indicted in June. Manafort has admitted he conspired with Kilimnik to obstruct justice."}
{"original": "Manafort was also found to have made false statements related to another Justice Department investigation."}
{"original": "The court is expected to release a transcript of the proceedings by Friday."}
{"original": "Americans are living in a gotcha economy, where the advertised prices for goods and services are rarely the price they pay. Whether buying a car, booking an airline ticket, attending an event or signing up for telecommunication services, hidden added fees -- most of them mandatory -- significantly boost the final price, often without the consumer's advance knowledge or consent."}
{"original": "Consumers are being deliberately fooled by advertised prices that fail to include the full amount they'll have to pay, not just for cars but for an increasing number of goods and services, said Susan Grant, director of consumer protection and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America. It's not a brand-new issue, but it's a growing trend. We're increasingly finding that advertised prices deviate significantly from what the consumer faces at check-out."}
{"original": "Indeed, a series of reports issued in the past month by regulators and consumer advocates have detailed a raft of sneaky, hidden fees that affect everything from hotel bookings and airline reservations to banking and college costs."}
{"original": "Here are the five most egregious hidden fees and what you can do about them:"}
{"original": "Student fees: Over the past decade an increasing number of colleges and universities have added a litany of levies dubbed freshman counseling fees, technology use fees, advising fees, stadium facility fees, development and enhancement fees. Combined, these fees are now estimated to add over 20 percent to the price of tuition at four-year public universities, according to a report by the National Economic Council."}
{"original": "What you can do: All colleges and universities are required to provide students and parents with an estimate of the full cost of education, including any mandatory fees. Be sure to ask for this disclosure and use it to calculate the full cost of attendance -- after scholarship and grant-based aid -- before committing to a college. If the net cost of attendance is prohibitive, ask a financial aid counselor to review your file for additional grant and scholarship aid."}
{"original": "Good students often have significant bargaining power to reduce their final cost of attendance if they're willing to make the price tag a major factor in their college choice. However, colleges are more likely to bargain for students who have other good options and are at the top of their academic acceptance range given grades, SAT/ACT-scores and other factors, such as sports and outside activities."}
{"original": "New car fees: You negotiate what you think is a fair price for a vehicle and then go into the sales office to write up the deal. There consumers often get sideswiped by a variety of bogus charges that can add thousands of dollars to the purchase price."}
{"original": "For instance, in Florida, where these fees are not regulated, dealerships can add as much as $999 for documentation fees, that supposedly reimburse the dealership for filling out purchase paperwork, according to car shopping service Edmunds.com. Ten states limit these fees to as little as $75. In other states, the fee is completely at the dealerships discretion."}
{"original": "In addition, some dealerships also levy floor plan fees; dealer preparation fees; advertising, destination, delivery and processing fees. All are discretionary."}
{"original": "What you can do: Before heading out to a dealership, check out Edmund's guide to average fees, including which states regulate fees and what the fees average in states where they aren't regulated. Then make sure to ask the dealer about these charges while you're still in the process of negotiating the deal. Factor those costs into the price when making comparisons."}
{"original": "Those who don't like the negotiating process may also benefit from services, such as Costco's (COST), that prenegotiate the price of vehicles at a set level below invoice and demand clear and upfront disclosures."}
{"original": "Event ticketing fees: So-called convenience, processing and service fees can add as much as 21 percent to the price of a concert or sporting-event ticket, according to a recent report by the New York attorney general. These fees are among the largest unavoidable levies in the consumer marketplace, amounting to some $1.6 billion in added costs, government officials say. They're unavoidable because many venues no longer provide their own ticketing services, leaving the consumer to deal with third-party vendors that charge these fees."}
{"original": "What you can do: If the concert/event operator doesn't provide a way to get tickets without added service fees, the only current recourse for consumers is to forego the event or complain to authorities. Complaints may not help with the immediate purchase, but they could be effective in the long run, noted Consumer Federation's Grant."}
{"original": "The New York attorney general, for instance, has already suggested that these fees may violate New York laws. Additionally, if not clearly disclosed in ads, these mandatory fees may also violate Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rules regarding deceptive disclosures. Both agencies -- as well as most other government offices -- offer an online complaint process that can be completed in minutes."}
{"original": "Resort fees: These were once relatively rare add-ons that covered extras, such as beach-side cabana service and luxury hotel gyms. Now, they're so commonplace that it's difficult to book a hotel in a tourist mecca, such as Las Vegas, without facing added fees that can range from $10 to $100 a night."}
{"original": "Indeed, said Grant, honest hoteliers who disclose the full cost of a stay upfront are put at a disadvantage by these sneaky levies, which are often collected at the end of the hotel stay or added on like a tax when the consumer is paying for the booking."}
{"original": "What you can do: Shop carefully, making sure to review the fine print at online booking sites for any additional fees that might be added to the advertised price. Save a copy of the disclosures, if a fee is added later. The FTC and some members of Congress are now calling for all-in hotel pricing, noting that while hotels say the fees are for extras, such as coffee in the room and other amenities, the charges are mandatory. Consumers can't simply decline them as they would for other extras, such as room service."}
{"original": "Adding mandatory fees that weren't disclosed before booking is likely a violation of Unfair and Deceptive Practices acts, which are overlaid in both state and federal laws. If you're hit by one of these fees, complain to the FTC and your state consumer affairs department."}
{"original": "Telecommunication fees: Couching added charges as regulatory cost recovery and administrative fees, telecommunication companies often deceive consumers into believing that their bills have been inflated by government taxes, when these fees actually go to the phone and cable companies themselves."}
{"original": "Calling the big four -- AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter -- an oligopoly on steroids, Consumer Federation of America (CFA) recently delivered an extensive report to the Senate Judiciary Committee that contends consumers are being overcharged by an average of 25 percent."}
{"original": "What you can do: Unfortunately, while you can comparison shop for cell phone service, the chance of having choice when it comes to telecommunications services provided at home is increasingly rare, according to the CFA report. AT&T's pending purchase of Time-Warner (TWX) could exacerbate the dearth of options."}
{"original": "If you have a choice of cable, TV, phone and internet providers, shop around. If you have no choices and feel you're being overcharged and underserved, complain to the FTC."}
{"original": "It's worth noting that federal and state legislatures, as well as some government regulators, have the authority to require all-in pricing, said Grant. However, some agencies have been reluctant to use this authority, which makes it all the more important that consumers make their dissatisfaction heard, she said. The internet makes filing a complaint with a regulator and your own elected representatives a relative breeze."}
{"original": "You can find your elected representatives here."}

{"original": "PORTLAND, Texas - A South Texas school board has approved an estimated $1.2 billion in tax breaks to entice Exxon Mobil (XOM) and its Saudi partner to build a $9.3 billion petrochemical plant within its district along the Texas Gulf Coast."}
{"original": "The six-member Gregory-Portland Independent School District board's unanimous vote late Tuesday adds to a $210 million tax package passed a day earlier by San Patricio County commissioners."}
{"original": "Exxon and Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corp. are considering a 1,300-acre (526-hectare) site in Portland, just north of Corpus Christi, for the world's largest ethane steam cracker plant. It would convert natural gas into chemicals used for plastics."}
{"original": "The plant, scheduled to open in 2024, also would provide thousands of jobs."}
{"original": "We're the school board and I thought we were supposed to be educating our kids, but it seems like we're in the middle of economic development, Randy Eulenfeld, the board's president, said. We will take this responsibility and do the best that we can."}
{"original": "The school board vote came despite a petition signed by 1,500 people who oppose the plant, citing safety and environmental concerns. The plant would be less than 2 miles (3.22 kilometers) from the district high school."}
{"original": "They are bullying this county, they're bullying you . we don't allow bullies in our schools, Errol Summerlin, who signed the petition, told the board. We shouldn't tolerate it from them."}
{"original": "Under terms of the school board tax plan, the district would limit the taxable value of the new plant at $90 million for 10 years, cutting the district's tax revenue from an estimated $120.9 million per year to less than $1.2 million per year."}
{"original": "The county's separate tax abatement package would cover seven years."}
{"original": "The project still needs state approval and Exxon and its Saudi partner are considering another Texas site in Victoria, about 70 miles (112.65 kilometers) to the north, and two in Louisiana."}
{"original": "However, company officials have said the Portland site is the front-runner."}
{"original": "If we do choose the Gregory-Portland site as our location, I want to assure you that we will follow through with our Good Neighbor Commitments on health and safety, quality of life, education and workforce development, and being good environmental stewards, project leader Robert Tully told residents in an email Wednesday, according to the San Antonio Express-News."}
{"original": "The tax breaks also are contingent on job creation. Project leaders have committed to the Texas Comptroller's Office more than 15,000 temporary construction jobs. The tax abatements require Exxon to employ a minimum of 400 people and seek an alternate water source if local water sources become scarce."}
{"original": "OAKLAND -- Marijuana dispensaries across California experienced long lines on the first day of legal recreational pot sales. But advocates warned the legal industry won't survive without big changes, CBS SF Bay Area reports."}
{"original": "I'm very happy about – thrilled really – to see the legalization of cannabis in California, said Steve DeAngelo, co-founder and CEO of Harborside in Oakland. At the same time, I'm terrified about what's going to happen with these taxes."}
{"original": "Harborside has been a medical marijuana dispensary for more than a decade, and is now selling recreational marijuana at a much higher price."}
{"original": "In our shop here, the tax rate has gone from 15 percent all the way up to almost 35 percent for adult consumers, DeAngelo said."}
{"original": "Steve DeAngelo CBS SF Bay Area"}
{"original": "Here's how that math works for Harborside. There is the regular state sales tax of 6 percent, and the regular Alameda County sales tax of 3.25 percent. Then there is a 15 percent state tax on marijuana, and a 10 percent Oakland tax on recreational marijuana."}
{"original": "That is a huge hit. And it's going to mean that a significant number of people, less affluent consumers, are going to turn to the lower prices of the underground market, DeAngelo said."}
{"original": "Some customers are willing to pay a premium for quality product, such as Geno Escalante, who was among those in line on Monday."}
{"original": "We all want the best stuff and you know the best stuff is always here at Harborside, Escalante said."}
{"original": "Geno Escalante CBS SF Bay Area"}
{"original": "DeAngelo said the black market may be lower cost, but Harborside offers hundreds of products not available on the black market and they also offer consumer protection."}
{"original": "All of our medicine is tested in a laboratory, DeAngelo said. It's evaluated both for safety, for things like pesticides and pathogenic molds, and it's also evaluated for potency."}
{"original": "Still, all this protection isn't cheap. In addition to taxes, marijuana regulations drive up the cost."}
{"original": "We have to pay rent, we have to have security systems, we have to pay licensing fees, we have to have insurance, we have to buy equipment, DeAngelo said."}
{"original": "It adds up. And not everyone can pay the higher prices. People who are disabled or on fixed incomes may turn to the black market."}
{"original": "They can barely afford cannabis now, much less with a 35 or 40 percent tax increase, DeAngelo said."}
{"original": "When people aren't buying from a regulated business, the state is getting zero taxes."}
{"original": "Colorado, Washington state and Oregon each legalized marijuana at one tax rate and then had to lower the rate to keep people in the legitimate market. DeAngelo believes California will have to do the same."}
{"original": "I don't think that the current tax rate for cannabis in California is sustainable, he said."}
{"original": "Escalante agrees. I honestly don't think this tax is gonna last too much, the customer said. They'll see that cannabis is not bad. It's a plant."}
{"original": "DeAngelo said it makes no sense that marijuana is taxed so much more than alcohol. California taxes beer and wine at 20 cents a gallon. That amount has not changed since 1991."}
{"original": "As for federal alcohol taxes, the new tax law taking effect next year decreases the taxes on beer, wine and spirits."}
{"original": "Editor's Note: The video references a 5 percent Oakland tax on marijuana. The 5 percent tax is on medical marijuana. Recreational marijuana in the city is taxed at 10 percent."}
{"original": "America is a nation of drivers. The U.S. has about 214 million licensed drivers, which is about seven of every 10 of us."}
{"original": "But did you know that if you drive your car during specific activities, you may be eligible to claim a tax deduction for the miles you drive? I'm guessing a lot more people could claim this deduction than do so. Only about 30 percent of all households itemize deductions, and only a subset of these claim the mileage deduction."}
{"original": "If you drove your automobile for business, medical reasons, moving for work or in support of a charitable organization, here are the mileage rates you can claim on your 2016 tax return:"}
{"original": "Business: 54 cents per mile (decreasing to 53.5 cents in 2017)"}
{"original": "Medical or moving: 19 cents per mile (decreasing to 17 cents in 2017)"}
{"original": "Charitable purposes: 14 cents per mile (unchanged in 2017)"}
{"original": "If you want to claim this deduction, you need to first know that the miles you drive to commute to work aren't included. But any mileage you drive from your home or workplace to another work-related location and back are fair game. If your employer doesn't reimburse you for the business miles you drive, keep a record of the mileage and purpose of each trip, so you can claim those miles."}
{"original": "For your 2016 tax return, you can claim the deduction on Schedule A Itemized Deductions, under the section for Job Expenses and Miscellaneous Deductions. If you've used your own vehicle and are using the standard mileage rate of 54 cents per mile and your employer didn't reimburse you, report this deduction on Form 2106 EZ instead."}
{"original": "Either way, you can deduct only the amount of all miscellaneous expenses that exceeds 2 percent of your adjusted gross income."}
{"original": "When you drive to receive medical care, the miles driven can be added to the other out-of-pocket costs you pay for care. If you're age 65 or older in 2016, these costs (including the mileage) must exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income before any can be deducted. For everyone else (and for everyone in 2017, regardless of age), only medical costs exceeding 10 percent of AGI can be claimed."}
{"original": "To be eligible for this deduction, you must meet the time and distance criteria: The miles driven are because you take a new job, your new job is at least 50 miles away from your former home and you start working in the new job the first year you live in your new residence and work for at least 39 weeks."}
{"original": "Again, this mileage deduction is a part of your overall miscellaneous expenses, and you can deduct only the amount that exceeds 2 percent of your adjusted gross income."}
{"original": "If you drove to and from a charity to perform volunteer work or to donate your services, you can claim this deduction, at 14 cents per mile. Or you can deduct the actual cost of gas and oil used. Either way, you can also add parking and tolls, if the charity didn't repay any of these costs."}
{"original": "This deduction is also claimed on Schedule A but isn't subject to any AGI limits like the others."}

{"original": "With borrowing limit approaching, Republicans' lack of unity could deprive them of leverage in negotiations with Democrats"}
{"original": "The U.S. officially exhausts its borrowing authority Friday, and the Treasury Department will be forced to resort to so-called extraordinary measures to prevent a default on the debt – a tactic that will work until late February, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said repeatedly."}
{"original": "But the deadline has been greeted with nonchalance on Capitol Hill, where Republicans have been plotting to demand something in return for raising the debt ceiling – they're just not sure what. And even though they couldn't agree on something, lawmakers shrugged, packed their bags, and left town for the weekend."}
{"original": "I think that we're still looking for the pieces to this puzzle, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters Thursday morning. But listen, he assured them, we don't want to default on our debt and we're not going to default on the debt."}
{"original": "The folks up the way on Pennsylvania Ave. were similarly unalarmed by the impending deadline, and seemed content to stand back and let House Republicans sort out their strategy."}
{"original": "We certainly believe Republican leaders who say that we have to raise the debt ceiling. It's the responsibility of Congress to ensure that bills that have already been incurred are paid in a timely fashion so that the United States doesn't default, said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney."}
{"original": "Carney maintains the administration's position has not changed – they will not negotiate. We are not going to pay ransom in return for Congress fulfilling this basic responsibility, he said."}
{"original": "Boehner and President Obama have tried and failed to negotiate on fiscal issues time and time again – over the debt ceiling once before, tax and entitlement reform, the grand bargain, and the government shutdown. This time, they aren't even trying to get together to talk (though this would violate the administration's no-negotiations policy)."}
{"original": "That leaves Boehner to sell his conference on deal the president hasn't had a hand in crafting. But so far, Boehner isn't having much success among his fellow Republicans."}
{"original": "Earlier this week, House Republican leaders pitched two possible trades for a year-long debt ceiling extension: approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline or repeal the risk corridors in the Affordable Care Act, a provision that which enables the government to share in the risks and gains of the marketplace. If the cost of insuring people is lower than expected, insurers pay into a pool, and if it's higher than expected, they can draw from that pool."}
{"original": "But just a day later, neither had enough support, and both ideas were ditched."}
{"original": "Now, they're kicking around a few possibilities that could even get some Democratic support: patch the reimbursement formula for doctors who treat Medicare patients, known as the doc fix; change the congressional budgeting processes and undo cuts to the cost-of-living formula for military retirees that were part of the budget deal negotiated last year."}
{"original": "It's unclear that any of those options will pass, and the Republicans might end up having to approve an unconditional debt ceiling increase, which some members say is inevitable."}
{"original": "We've had three years of fighting over the debt ceiling, [and] unfortunately we have not been victorious in many of those fights. I think that this year the speaker should just allow the Democrats to pass a clean debt ceiling, the Democrats can own it, they can explain to the American people why they want to continue to increase the debt without any major reforms and we can go to the American people and we can tell them that if they get rid of [Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid we will actually make the reforms that are necessary for America to be strong again, said Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, at a regular forum featuring conservative lawmakers Wednesday morning."}
{"original": "That leaves Boehner in his usual position: at the head of a fractious group of lawmakers, trying to piece together enough votes to keep the government running."}
{"original": "At least he has a sense of humor about it."}
{"original": "Mother Teresa is a saint now, but if the Congress wanted to make her a saint and attached that to the debt ceiling we probably couldn't get 218 Republican votes, he said Thursday."}
{"original": "Ride-hailing companies provided consumers with options for getting around, but the advent of Uber and Lyft also wrought financial havoc on New York City's taxicab industry."}
{"original": "Amid a litany of bankruptcies, foreclosures and eviction notices, at least five drivers have committed suicide since December."}
{"original": "Among the dead was Yu Mein Chow, 56, who had taken out a loan seven years ago to purchase a $700,000 medallion that allowed him to operate a cab in the city. Another driver shot himself in February outside Manhattan's City Hall after posting a message on social media faulting politicians for allowing the unchecked competition."}
{"original": "Those medallions were worth more than a million before Uber came in, said Alison Griswold, a reporter for Quartz who covers gig economy jobs like ride-sharing drivers. A lot of drivers feel animosity toward the city, she told CBSN. They feel like they had this contract, where the value of the taxi medallion appreciated and so a lot of drivers who had sunk their life savings into that felt like that was their key into retirement."}
{"original": "Seven of the medallions reportedly sold for under $200,000 in January."}
{"original": "The city's cab industry, reliant on the market value of those once-coveted tax medallion, has been turned on its head by the proliferation of Uber, Lyft and other ride-sharing services. The competition has driven down demand for yellow cabs and significantly cut the value of the medallions."}
{"original": "For decades, no more than 13,000 taxis operated in New York, according to The New York Times. Now there are some 100,000, roughly two-thirds affiliated with Uber."}
{"original": "There's a lot of blame, actually, to go around, said Harry Campbell, author of The Rideshare Guide, a book offering advice on driving for a ride-hailing company. We're seeing too much of a good thing can definitely be a bad thing, he added of the lack of regulation that has allowed the city to be flooded with for-hire cars."}
{"original": "Of course, Uber drivers also don't have it easy. Treated as independent contractors and lacking traditional benefits or employment protections, Uber drivers earn less than $10 an hour after expenses, according to a study by the Economic Policy Institute."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON - Caterpillar, a week after its headquarters and other facilities were raided by a number of federal agencies including the Internal Revenue Service, denied that it had broken any federal tax laws."}
{"original": "The IRS has challenged Caterpillar's taxes for years 2007 - 2012, the company said Friday. We disagree with the IRS' position, have cooperated for requests for information, and believe that we are compliant with tax laws and stand by our financial reporting."}
{"original": "Caterpillar has been challenged for some time by federal agencies in regard to its accounting practices and last week the company said that the raids may have been related to a Swiss business, called CSARL."}
{"original": "In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, Caterpillar said that the IRS had informed the company that it owed $2 billion in additional taxes for the years 2010 to 2012 because of profits from that Swiss unit."}
{"original": "Caterpillar takes very seriously its obligation to follow tax law and pay what it owes, the company said Friday."}
{"original": "The raids came two days after the New York Times cited a report by Dartmouth College accounting professor Leslie A. Robinson, which stated that Caterpillar did not comply with either U.S. tax law or U.S. financial reporting rules."}
{"original": "The Times said the report was commissioned by the government but it's not clear which agency wanted it, and the report has not been made public."}
{"original": "Caterpillar had not been furnished with a copy of the report until Thursday morning, it said, a week after the raids and more than a week after the New York Times story was published."}
{"original": "Officials at Dartmouth would not discuss the report or release it officially to The Associated Press."}
{"original": "Other than the IRS, the agencies involved in raids on three properties where Caterpillar operates included the U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Export Enforcement and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s office of inspector general."}
{"original": "Caterpillar is one of the world's largest makers of construction and other heavy equipment and had revenue of $38.54 billion last year."}
{"original": "Republican Senator Tom Cotton is proposing that the federal government send American families cash stipends so they can afford basic needs as the coronavirus grinds American life to a halt, keeps many from working, and plunges the economy into a possible recession."}
{"original": "Cotton, a conservative Republican from Arkansas, released the framework of a proposal Tuesday that includes authorizing the Treasury Department to cut a $1,000 tax-rebate check to every adult tax filer who earns under $100,000, and $500 for every dependent. Under Cotton's proposal, any couples who file taxes jointly and make less than $200,000 a year could receive a $2,000 tax-rebate check."}
{"original": "I'm working on legislation to get cash stipends to affected workers and their families so they can buy food and pay the bills during this crisis, plus help to small and mid-sized businesses weather the storm. Now is the time to avoid Italy's fate, Cotton tweeted Monday."}
{"original": "Cotton's proposal also calls for expanded eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits, wider access to food assistance and expanded access to loans for small businesses."}
{"original": "He joins Republican Senator Mitt Romney, who is proposing that each American adult receive a one-time $1,000 payment from the federal government — similar to an initiative proposed by former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who campaigned on a platform of universal basic income."}
{"original": "I'm pumped about it actually, Yang tweeted when The Daily Show pointed out that Yang had been pitching universal basic income long before now."}
{"original": "That proposal of some form of basic income or cash stipend, particularly from Republicans, highlights the severity of the financial road ahead. Markets experienced one of their worst days on record Monday, as the number of cases increases and the number of shuttered businesses and schools continues to climb."}
{"original": "Some lawmakers, like Democratic Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, insist assistance should be more targeted."}
{"original": "Cash payments are better than corporate bailouts but there are people who need much more than a thousand bucks and people who or just don't need a thousand bucks. So let's target the needy, including gig workers, underemployed, caregivers and others, Schatz tweeted Monday."}
{"original": "The Senate is expected to take up a House-passed bill meant to address the financial needs of Americans unable to work due to the crisis. And lawmakers are indicating more legislation is yet to come to help American industry and workers."}
{"original": "President Trump on Monday warned the coronavirus outbreak could last until July or August, after issuing new guidelines recommending Americans gather in groups no larger than 10, and that restaurants and bars close in areas with a high concentration of cases."}
{"original": "They think August, it could be July, he said at a press briefing Monday, referring to members of the White House task force. Could be longer than that. But I've asked that question many, many times."}
{"original": "Now that the Internal Revenue Service has reopened its doors, taxpayers who hope for refunds are urged to file their tax returns as soon as they can. After all, we could see another government shutdown in the next month."}
{"original": "At least a week in delays can be expected, said Yahoo Finance senior reporter Jeanie Ahn. The IRS reopened Monday, but after 35 days in the longest government shutdown ever, the tax agency is struggling to get through the backlog."}
{"original": "Employees returning to the office are sorting through 5 million unopened letters, dealing with worker shortages, and wading through changes to the tax code. The excess is straining what many experts consider an already lean government operation that typically struggles with budget cuts and IT difficulties."}
{"original": "Everyone is bracing for the most chaotic tax season in three decades, Ahn said."}
{"original": "Long wait times and new tax codes"}
{"original": "IRS call centers are taking only about 35 percent of calls, after federal workers who found other jobs during the shutdown failed to show up to work Monday morning. Ahn found that it took nearly 30 minutes to reach an employee when she called the IRS and discovered that many of the dial-in options are no longer in service."}
{"original": "The IRS is instead having to hire new workers and train them to deal with new tax codes, something that is confusing to taxpayers, IRS employees and accountants across the board. While some taxpayers may have gotten a nice bonus from the 2017 tax cuts, many failed to update their withholdings in their W2 forms to reflect the changes, meaning they might not get refunds as sizable as they were expecting."}
{"original": "A lot of people who didn't do anything to their forms are now going to be surprised, Ahn said. There are a lot of question marks."}
{"original": "To get ahead of the pileup, Ahn advises that taxpayers gather their documents together and file as much as possible. Now is the year to file electronically, as paper returns are not expected to get processed until mid-February."}
{"original": "Seek out help if your tax situation needs a little more work than most and hire someone soon, because tax professionals are likely to book up as well."}
{"original": "It's going to be a really complicated year, Ahn said."}

The giant retailer also lowered its forward guidance. Earnings came in at 40 cents (vs. 36 cents expected), while sales totaled $5.77 billion (vs. $5.95 billion expected). Sales at stores open a year or more dropped 5.6 percent."}

{"original": "As the coronavirus continues to batter U.S. small businesses, new data from tax-prep service H&R Block suggests Black-owned firms are taking the biggest hit."}
{"original": "An H&R Block survey of almost 3,000 small businesses found that 53% of Black business owners saw their revenue drop by half, compared to 37% of White owners, since the pandemic started. Black business owners also had more trouble establishing an online presence for their company and were more likely to have customers submit late payments, the survey said."}
{"original": "Black-owned businesses play such an important role in improving local economies and uplifting communities everywhere, H&R Block Vice President of Small Business Ian Hardman said in a statement. Clearly there's a grave need to support small business owners, especially those hit hardest by the pandemic."}
{"original": "H&R Block's survey is the latest in a catalog of research detailing how Black-owned businesses have struggled in the past year."}
{"original": "A Main Street Alliance/Color of Change poll released in October found that only 40% of Black business owners expected to remain open over the ensuing six months, compared with 46% of Asian respondents, 48% of Latinx owners and 55% of Whites."}
{"original": "The Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that small business ownership in the U.S. dropped 22% between February 2020 and April 2020, but Black ownership dropped 41% — the greatest decline among all racial groups during the depths of the pandemic."}

{"original": "The Supreme Court said Monday it will take up a closely-watched challenge to the Affordable Care Act as Democrats work to save the health care law."}
{"original": "The justices likely won't hear the case until its next term, which begins in October, with a decision coming by the end of June 2021."}
{"original": "The case hardly marks the first time the Supreme Court will hear a dispute involving Obamacare. Most notably, in 2012, the high court upheld the health care law's individual mandate, which is considered to be the heart of Obamacare and requires all Americans to purchase health insurance coverage, in a 5-4 vote."}
{"original": "The five justices who upheld the individual mandate — Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — all remain on the court."}
{"original": "But President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress have already taken steps to dismantle the health care law, which was enacted in 2010."}
{"original": "As part of Republicans' overhaul of the tax code in 2017, Congress abolished the financial penalty for individuals who do not purchase health insurance. The move prompted a group of GOP-led states to file a lawsuit challenging Obamacare, arguing the individual mandate is unconstitutional because the fine had effectively been eliminated. The red states — with the Trump administration in agreement — also said that because the mandate could not be separated from the rest of the health care law, it should fall."}
{"original": "In 2018, a federal district court judge in Texas agreed with the states that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and struck down the entire Affordable Care Act on grounds that it cannot survive without the mandate. The judge put his ruling on hold while litigation continued."}
{"original": "Then, in December, a divided panel of judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. But the New Orleans-based court did not decide the question of whether the rest of Obamacare could stand without the mandate and sent the case back to the lower court to reconsider the issue."}
{"original": "Twenty states and the District of Columbia and the Democratic led-House of Representatives, all of which intervened in the case, asked the Supreme Court in January to fast-track review of the legal battle over Obamacare and decide the case before the end of its current term. The questions raised by the case, they argued, cannot be left unanswered for a prolonged period of time."}
{"original": "The 5th Circuit's decision poses a severe, immediate and ongoing threat to the orderly operation of healthcare markets throughout the country, casts doubt over whether millions of individuals will continue to be able to afford vitally important care, and leaves a critical sector of the nation's economy in unacceptable limbo, lawyers for the House wrote in their request to the Supreme Court."}
{"original": "But the Republican states and the Trump administration opposed the efforts to expedite review of the 5th Circuit's ruling, writing to the court that the decision creates no present, real-world emergency."}
{"original": "The appropriate course is instead to defer any review in this court until after the district court has completed its reassessment of severability on remand and the court of appeals has reviewed that determination on appeal, Solicitor General Noel Francisco said. That approach not only will ensure that the court has the benefit of the lower courts' considered views, but it also may narrow the scope of the issue ultimately presented to this court."}
{"original": "The Supreme Court rejected the fast-track request last month, reducing the chances that the justices will decide the case before the 2020 presidential election."}
{"original": "When gunmakers and dealers gather this week in Las Vegas for the industry's largest annual conference, they will be grappling with slumping sales and a shift in politics that many didn't envision two years ago when gun-friendly Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress took office."}
{"original": "Some of the top priorities for the industry — expanding the reach of concealed carry permits and easing restrictions on so-called silencers — remain in limbo, and prospects for expanding gun rights are nil for the foreseeable future."}
{"original": "Instead, fueled by the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, the federal government banned bump stocks and newly in-charge U.S. House Democrats introduced legislation that would require background checks for virtually every firearm sale, regardless of whether it's from a gun dealer or a private sale."}
{"original": "Even without Democrats' gains in November's midterm elections, the industry was facing a so-called Trump slump, a plummet in sales that happens amid gun rights-friendly administrations. Background checks were at an all-time high in 2016, President Barack Obama's last full year in office, numbering more than 27.5 million; since then, background checks have been at about 25 million each year."}
{"original": "Gary Ramey, owner of Georgia gunmaker Honor Defense, says the mood at last year's SHOT Show, which stands for Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade, was subdued. He's expecting the same this year."}
{"original": "There was no one to beat up. You didn't have President Obama to put up in PowerPoint and say 'He's the best gun salesman, look what he's doing to our country,' he said."}
{"original": "Numbers are down, he added. You can't deny it."}
{"original": "Robert J. Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and a longtime watcher of gun issues, said that not only have shifting politics made it difficult for the gun industry to gain ground but high-profile mass shootings — like the Las Vegas shooting that happened just miles from where the SHOT Show will be held and the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting — also cast a pall."}
{"original": "After the Parkland shooting, [gun rights' initiatives] were kind of frozen in their tracks, Spitzer said. Now there's no chance that it's going anywhere."}
{"original": "It's easier to drive up gun sales when there's the threat or risk of gun-rights being restricted, he said. It's harder to rally people when your target is one house of Congress. It just doesn't have the same galvanizing effect."}
{"original": "The National Shooting Sports Foundation's SHOT Show has been held annually for more than four decades. This year more than 60,000 are expected to attend the event that runs Tuesday through Friday — from gun dealers and manufacturers to companies that cater to law enforcement. There's a wait list for exhibitors that is several hundred names long and it will have some 13 miles of aisles featuring products from more than 1,700 companies."}
{"original": "Last year's show in Las Vegas was held just months after a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds at an outdoor music festival. The massacre was carried out by a gunman armed with bump stocks, which allow the long guns to mimic fully automatic weapons."}
{"original": "Organizers last year restricted media access to trade journalists. This year's show will again allow reporters from mainstream media to attend."}
{"original": "Gun-control advocates are rejoicing in the gun industry's misfortunes of late and chalking it up to not just shifting attitudes among Americans but a shift in elected political leaders."}
{"original": "Without a fake menace in the White House to gin up fears, gun sales have been in a Trump slump and, as a result, the NRA is on the rocks, said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg."}
{"original": "Joe Bartozzi, the new president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said the industry isn't disturbed by the drop in gun sales or the shift in federal politics. While Democrats who ran on gun-control platforms made huge gains in the House, he sees the Senate shifting to the other end of the spectrum."}
{"original": "Having been in the industry for over 30 years and seeing the trends of gun sales ebb and flow over time, it's very hard to put your finger on any one specific issue as to why this happens. It's just the cyclical nature of the business, he said."}
{"original": "Trump's campaign was bolstered by about $30 million from the National Rifle Association and when he took office, the industry had hoped that a host of gun rights would be enacted. The Trump administration quickly nixed an Obama-imposed rule that made it more difficult for some disabled people to purchase and possess firearms."}
{"original": "But other industry priorities, such as reciprocity between states for carrying certain concealed firearms and a measure that would ease restrictions on purchasing suppressors that help muffle the sound when a gun is fired, failed to gain traction."}
{"original": "For now, Bartozzi said his organization is focused on a measure that would expand public gun ranges, funded by an existing tax on firearms and ammunition sales that supports conservation, safety programs and shooting ranges on public lands. The hope is that increasing the number of public ranges will encourage more people to become hunters."}
{"original": "Outgoing U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos urged Congress to reject calls to forgive student loan debt, a promise made on the campaign trail by President-elect Joe Biden."}
{"original": "In what reads like a farewell letter, DeVos offered closing thoughts on her time leading the education department. DeVos, a decadeslong advocate for school choice, made her final case as education secretary for expanding federal tax dollars for families that opt for private schools and opposed student loan forgiveness and free college, calling the proposals misguided."}
{"original": "Across-the-board forgiveness of college debts is not only unfair to most Americans, it is also the most regressive of policy proposals – rewarding the wealthiest sector of our labor force at the expense of the poorest, DeVos wrote in the Monday letter obtained by CBS News."}
{"original": "The Department of Education suspended all monthly federal student loan payments in March amid the coronavirus outbreak and the economic fallout caused by the pandemic, granting all borrowers an interest-free forbearance period. In its $900 billion stimulus bill, Congress neglected to extend the program and student loan payments could resume as soon as February."}
{"original": "It's possible the popular forbearance program will be extended again after President-elect Joe Biden takes office on January 20. When student loan payments do resume, the Department of Education doesn't expect a smooth transition. In its 2020 annual report, issued Tuesday, the department said it expects loan servicers and the federal government will face a heavy burden in 'converting' millions of borrowers to active repayment. Some of those borrowers, the report warns, will become delinquent."}
{"original": "Tackling student loan debt will be a major issue for the Biden administration. Mr. Biden has pledged to address the student loan crisis, including a proposal to cancel $10,000 in debt for students who work in national or community service."}
{"original": "Last year student loan debt reached an all-time high, nearly $1.6 trillion among more than 40 million Americans, making the Department of Education the country's biggest consumer lender, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. About 1 in every 5 borrowers are in default, according to the U.S. Department of Education."}
{"original": "DeVos wrote that under her leadership the way in which borrowers apply and pay back loans was revolutionized thanks to a streamlining of services."}
{"original": "Where there was once a confusing and frustrating maze of websites, StudentAid.gov is now the single online home for information. Where there were once dozens of phone numbers, now there is a single 800 number, DeVos wrote. Understanding and repaying student loans is becoming easier than ever."}
{"original": "DeVos did not directly acknowledge President Trump's loss or refer to Mr. Biden by name in the five-page letter, which was shared with Congressional leadership and House and Senate education committee members as well as Congressional appropriation subcommittee members."}
{"original": "The ongoing controversy over the money left behind by Prince when he died without a will is heating up again after Internal Revenue Service calculations showed that executors of the rock star's estate undervalued it by 50%, or about $80 million. The IRS determined that Prince's estate is worth $163.2 million, overshadowing the $82.3 million valuation submitted by Comerica Bank & Trust, the estate's administrator."}
{"original": "The discrepancy primarily involves Prince's music publishing and recording interests, according to court documents. Documents show the IRS believes that Prince's estate owes another $32.4 million in federal taxes, roughly doubling the tax bill based on Comerica's valuation, the Star Tribune reported."}
{"original": "The IRS also has ordered a $6.4 million accuracy-related penalty on Prince's estate, citing a substantial undervaluation of assets, documents show."}
{"original": "Prince's death of a fentanyl overdose on April 21, 2016, created one of the largest and most complicated probate court proceedings in Minnesota history. Estimates of his net worth have varied widely, from $100 million to $300 million."}
{"original": "With Prince's probate case dragging on, his six sibling heirs have grown increasingly unhappy, particularly as the estate has doled out tens of millions of dollars to lawyers and consultants."}
{"original": "Comerica and its lawyers at Fredrikson & Byron in Minneapolis maintain their estate valuations are solid. Comerica sued the IRS this summer in U.S. Tax Court in Washington, D.C., saying the agency's calculations are riddled with errors."}
{"original": "What we have here is a classic battle of the experts - the estate's experts and the IRS' experts, said Dennis Patrick, an estate planning attorney at DeWitt LLP in Minneapolis who is not involved in the case. Valuing a large estate, Patrick added, is way more of an art than a science."}
{"original": "Comerica, a Dallas-based financial services giant, has asked the tax court to hold a trial in St. Paul. A trial could dramatically lengthen the settlement of Prince's estate and generate more legal fees at the expense of Prince's heirs, Patrick said."}
{"original": "Manhattan prosecutors conducting a criminal investigation into possible bank, tax and insurance fraud by former President Donald Trump and his company recently subpoenaed documents from an engineer who worked on an expansive property owned by the Trump family in Westchester County, north of New York City."}
{"original": "The engineer, Ralph Mastromonaco, told CBS News he recently received the subpoena and quickly complied, turning over maps of the 200-acre Seven Springs Estate and other documents he produced for the Trump Organization nearly a decade ago. The subpoena has not been previously reported and there is no indication that Mastromonaco is being investigated for wrongdoing."}
{"original": "Mastromonaco said his work included surveying Seven Springs as part of an effort by the Trump Organization to get approval for a subdivision in 2013, and that he doubts his work will prove relevant to the tax fraud investigation."}
{"original": "I think they are just touching every base. I really had nothing to do with the project after (that). My role ended after they got an approval and whatever they did after that, I had nothing to do with, Mastromonaco said."}
{"original": "Mastromonaco's subpoena came weeks after Manhattan investigators sent another subpoena to the town clerk of Bedford, New York. Seven Springs straddles Bedford and two other affluent suburban towns, North Castle and New Castle. The grand jury subpoena, which was obtained by CBS News, requests documents related to Seven Springs valuations and tax assessments, tax appeals, and conservation easements."}
{"original": "Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance first began investigating Mr. Trump in 2018, and initially targeted hush-money payments made during the 2016 campaign to adult film star Stormy Daniels by former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. However, Vance's office has indicated in court filings that the investigation has since widened to look at possible crimes as wide-ranging as fraud and tax evasion."}
{"original": "Seven Springs has also drawn scrutiny from New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is conducting a civil probe into the Trump Organization."}
{"original": "James' office has indicated in court documents it is interested in a 2015 valuation of Seven Springs that factored into a $21.1 million tax deduction taken by Mr. Trump."}
{"original": "Vance's office said in a September court filing that in the past decade, Mr. Trump's valuation of the property ranged from between $25 million and $50 million, to between $261 and $291 million."}
{"original": "As part of his investigation, Vance is seeking Mr. Trump's tax records. The Supreme Court ruled in July that a subpoena of the records was constitutional, but their release was held up by a follow-up appeal on different grounds. The Supreme Court has not yet said if it will hear that appeal."}
{"original": "Vance's office has not said why it is interested in documents Mastromonaco produced for the Trump Organization, and declined to confirm the subpoena or comment for this article. His investigation is one of two known criminal probes focused on Mr. Trump. On February 10, the District Attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, launched an election fraud and racketeering investigation into Mr. Trump's attempts to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia."}
{"original": "Alan Futerfas, an attorney who is counsel for Mr. Trump in the Supreme Court proceedings, declined to comment on the subpoena. Attorneys for the Trump Organization did not reply when asked for comment."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump has previously called Vance's investigation a witch hunt, and one of his attorneys, William Consovoy, referred to it in court in October 2019 as a fishing expedition."}
{"original": "For the New York State civil case, James' office has said in court filings that it is seeking information concerning whether the Trump Organization and its agents improperly inflated, or caused to be improperly inflated, the value of the Seven Springs Estate."}
{"original": "Valuations of Seven Springs were used in connection with an appraisal….to claim an apparent $21.1 million tax deduction for donating a conservation easement on the property in tax year 2015, and in submissions to financial institutions as a component of Mr. Trump's net worth, attorneys for James's office wrote in an August 2020 court filing."}
{"original": "Mastromonaco said James' office subpoenaed similar documents more than a year ago."}
{"original": "James' office has interviewed Eric Trump and squared off in court with a lawyer for the Trump Organization who initially refused to hand over emails relating to Mastromonaco's work, citing attorney-client privilege. A New York court rejected that argument in December."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump purchased Seven Springs in 1995 for $7.5 million, and originally planned to build a golf course on it. After that plan faced local opposition, Mr. Trump considered building and selling 15 mansions on the property, which includes what once was H.J. Heinz Jr.'s 10-acre family estate, called Nonesuch."}
{"original": "Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump told Forbes in a 2014 interview that they have used the property as a vacation and weekend residence. Eric Trump called the estate home base for us, and said the brothers enjoyed riding ATVs and fishing on the property."}

{"original": "The New York Times reported last September that in 2014 Mr. Trump deducted $2.2 million in property taxes by claiming Seven Springs was an investment property. The deduction was not applicable to personal residences."}
{"original": "Trump and Seven Springs gained nationwide attention in 2009 when then-Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi rented the property where he planned to pitch a Bedouin-style tent that he often brought with him while traveling. Qaddafi was visiting New York for a United Nations' General Assembly and had been turned away by other officials in New York City and Englewood, New Jersey. Tents were installed on Trump's property, but the plan was scrapped when Bedford town officials objected. In 2016, Mr. Trump told CBS News' Face the Nation that he made a fortune on the brief deal."}
{"original": "By 2015, Mr. Trump had dropped all public plans for development of the property, and placed much of it in a conservation easement, which came with a $21.1 million tax deduction."}
{"original": "In an August 2020 court filing, the New York Attorney General's office accused the Trump Organization of refusing to produce records sufficient to show how a $21.1 million apparent tax deduction in connection with the Seven Springs conservation easement was reflected on applicable tax returns. The two sides continue to litigate that dispute."}
{"original": "Mastromonaco said his work for the Trumps had long since ended by then."}
{"original": "I'll save you a lot of time, because I don't really think I had any relevance to any of this, because my role in the project ended well before there was any controversy, Mastromonaco said."}

Mnuchin denied on Capitol Hill Wednesday that such aid would be a bailout. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has said the administration will also help families who miss paychecks, but exactly how is unclear."}

{"original": "Vashukevich's earlier revelation of an alleged affair with Deripaska fueled opposition allegations in Russia of official corruption and enraged the Kremlin. A public scandal erupted in early February last year when Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny published an investigation drawing on her social media posts suggesting corrupt links between Deripaska and a top Kremlin official, Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Prikhodko."}

TSA workers, many of whom have been calling out sick, are looking for jobs at a 30 percent higher rate than in recent years."}

{"original": "At the IRS, where nearly 46,000 workers have been asked to work without pay for the tax-filing season that begins Jan. 28, job searches started going up dramatically in December. They're now 50 percent higher than they were this time last year. Job searches from workers at Health and Human Services, which houses the Food and Drug Administration and the Indian Health Service, have shot up even more, rising 80 percent over their level this time of year in the last two years."}
{"original": "The data don't mean federal workers have found new jobs, cautioned Martha Gimbel, research director at the Indeed Hiring Lab, but it means that the number of people looking for work, whether casually or seriously, is dramatically higher."}
{"original": "This shutdown is injecting volatility into a sector that had been appealing to a lot of people because it's secure. A lot of people are now thinking, 'what is my future in this industry?' We won't know the answer to that for a while, she said."}
{"original": "The dissatisfaction is even moving to departments unaffected by the shutdown, Gimbel said, citing preliminary data."}
{"original": "When the shutdown first happened, for workers who were still being paid, it wasn't impacting their job search behavior, she said. But those workers became more likely to search for other jobs the longer the shutdown went on, though not as much as workers who aren't being paid."}
{"original": "Not paying its workforce is also affecting the government's ability to hire. Applications for federal jobs on Glassdoor have dropped 46 percent below where they were one year ago, said Daniel Zhao, a senior data scientist at the job-review and hiring site. Given that the federal government hires about 30,000 people every month, that drop translates into a significant decline in numbers."}

{"original": "CBS News polling shows that the bill is widely popular with the public, with three in four Americans approving of its passage. Two-thirds of Americans also said Mr. Biden is doing a good job in his handling of the pandemic."}
{"original": "Fewer Americans are likely to receive checks in the third round of stimulus payments because the bill tightens the income threshold for qualifying for the $1,400 checks compared with the previous two rounds of direct checks."}
{"original": "The American Rescue Plan directs the $1,400 direct payments to individuals earning up to $75,000, but cuts off eligibility for single people earning more than $80,000. For couples who file a joint federal income tax return, the phase-out begins at those making $150,000 and ends at $160,000. People who file their taxes as head of household will receive the full $1,400 if they earn less than $112,500, while the payments will be cut off for those earning more than $120,000."}
{"original": "To see how much you might receive, you can use this Omni online calculator to determine whether you qualify and your potential payment."}
{"original": "The president signed the bill into law before Sunday, March 14, a key date since that's when the current extra $300 in weekly unemployment aid was set to expire. The American Rescue Plan ensures the extra $300 in weekly jobless pay will continue through September."}
{"original": "In addition to the $1,400 checks, the bill provides funding for small businesses; offers families with kids a tax break of up to $3,600 per child; and boosts government spending on COVID-19 testing and contact tracing."}
{"original": "The legislation would send $350 billion to state and local governments and tribal governments for costs incurred up until the end of 2024. The bill also requires that small states get at least the amount they received under virus legislation that Congress passed last March. Schools will also benefit, with $130 billion in additional funding targeted to schools for students in kindergarten through 12th grade."}
{"original": "Spending for colleges and universities would be boosted by about $40 billion, with the money used to defray an institution's pandemic-related expenses and to provide emergency aid to students to cover expenses such as food and housing and computer equipment. And a new program targeted for restaurants and bars hurt by the pandemic will receive $28.6 billion. Other measures include help for rental and homeowner assistance and more support to help people pay for health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act."}
{"original": "The two previous rounds of stimulus checks required anywhere from days to months to reach consumers' checking accounts and mailboxes. The second stimulus check, approved at the end of December, had a faster rollout than the first, with some people receiving their checks just days after the bill was signed into law."}
{"original": "The IRS relies on a taxpayer's most recent tax return to determine how much they should receive and when they might receive it. That's why some tax experts had urged taxpayers to file their returns as soon as possible, especially if they had a major life change last year, such as the birth of a child or the loss of a job or income in 2020."}
{"original": "Because the IRS officially started accepting tax returns on February 12 and is slated to close the filing window on its customary date of April 15 for most Americans, the bill has been signed into law during the middle of tax filing season."}
{"original": "If a taxpayer has not filed their 2020 tax return by now, the IRS likely will rely on their 2019 tax return to calculate their stimulus check payment — and that 2019 return might not reflect income losses during last year's economic crisis or a new child, for example. In that case, a taxpayer might not receive as much stimulus money as they are entitled to."}
{"original": "Here are the income limits for checks"}
{"original": "A person's income is the chief determinant of whether they'll get a check, as well as the payment amount."}
{"original": "The payments will amount to $1,400 for a single person or $2,800 for a married couple filing jointly. Only individuals earning up to $75,000 would get the full payments, as would married couples with incomes up to $150,000. Payments would decline for incomes above those thresholds."}
{"original": "The bill cuts off single people with incomes over $80,000 and married couples earning more than $160,000. Under the first stimulus check, the cut-offs were higher, at $100,000 for individuals and $200,000 for married couples."}
{"original": "Some lawmakers argued the checks should be targeted to lower-income families, citing research that shows that higher-income families are rebounding from the pandemic's economic impact. But other research signals widespread financial pain throughout the nation, with the ranks of adults experiencing financial hardship little changed from December, according to Morning Consult economist John Leer."}
{"original": "A third round of $1,400 checks would allow nearly 23 million adults to pay their expenses for more than four months without going into more debt or eating into their savings, his analysis found."}
{"original": "That third stimulus check is absolutely vital, Credit Karma Chief People Officer Colleen McCreary told CBS MoneyWatch. I don't see a world where people will have their financial footing without some additional stimulus money."}
{"original": "The Associated Press contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Last year the IRS reactivated a program using private debt collectors to collect unpaid taxes from individuals with delinquent tax debts. According to the National Taxpayer Advocate, the IRS' Private Debt Collection (PDC) program is a most serious problem."}
{"original": "A troubling finding of a recent report was that taxpayers, whose tax debts were assigned to private collection agencies, entered into installment agreements that they are unable to afford, with approximately 43 percent earning income below their allowable living expenses."}
{"original": "To make matters worse, the program costs the U.S. Treasury more than the money it brings in. Part of the reason may be that the private collection agencies can keep up to 25 percent of what they collect."}
{"original": "The taxpayers most likely to be contacted by the program's private debt collectors are those identified by the IRS to have an inactive tax receivable. A tax debt is deemed to be inactive when the IRS removes it from their active case list for lack of resources or inability to locate the individual, or if more than a year has passed since the taxpayer had any interaction with the IRS for the collection of the over-due tax."}
{"original": "Private collection agencies will first request full payment of the debt. If the taxpayer can't immediately pay, the agency will then offer an installment agreement."}
{"original": "There have been many reports of phone scams by individuals who claim to represent the IRS and demand payment for tax debts, so it's important to know the difference between these scams and a legitimate IRS collection program."}
{"original": "Taxpayers should know that the legitimate collection agencies will not call you. Instead, the IRS will send a letter on official IRS letterhead, called a Notice CP40. This will explain that your tax debt has been assigned to one of the private debt collection firms. A separate letter from the private collection agency will confirm the tax case has been assigned to them."}
{"original": "Both letters will have the same unique 10-digit identifier number in place of your Social Security number. This special identifier will allow two-party authentication between you and the private collection agency."}
{"original": "Below are additional tips to determine whether firms claiming to work with the IRS are legitimate."}
{"original": "The IRS' private debt collectors will not ask you to pay them any fees or owed taxes, and they will not accept any payments from you."}
{"original": "They will inform you that any payments for taxes should be paid by check and sent directly to the IRS or paid via debit or credit card on the IRS website."}
{"original": "Any checks sent should be payable to United States Treasury. Neither the IRS or the private collector will suggest or take payment in the form of gift cards, prepaid debit cards, or iTunes cards (which are commonly requested by scammers.)"}
{"original": "If you're contacted by a tax collector, you can call the IRS directly to confirm your debt has been assigned to the private debt collector. If this is the case, the IRS will instruct you to speak directly with the private collector."}
{"original": "The IRS will provide direction only on making payments and calculating a payoff on your tax debts. These private collection agencies cannot enforce collection actions against you, such as issuing a levy or filing a notice of federal tax lien and they must follow the IRS rules under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act."}
{"original": "The four private debt collection agencies selected by the IRS to operate the program are the only firms that should be legitimately contacting taxpayers. They are: CBE Group in Cedar Falls, IA; Conserve in Fairport, NY; Performant in Livermore, CA; and Pioneer in Horseheads, NY."}
{"original": "Finally, the IRS cannot assign a tax debt to private collections in cases involving a deceased tax payer, an individual under age 18, or military in a designated combat zone. Also exempt are folks who are a victim of tax-related identity theft, classified as an innocent spouse, and currently involved in an exam, installment agreement, or offer in compromise."}
{"original": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said it's very unfortunate a rule change could allow his fellow presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg into the next Democratic debates. The qualifications no longer include a unique-donor threshold."}
{"original": "That is what being a multi-billionaire is about. Some very good friends of mine who were competing in the Democratic nomination — people like Cory Booker of New Jersey, Julián Castro — work really, really hard. Nobody changed the rules to get them in the debate, he said on CBS This Morning Friday."}
{"original": "But I guess if you're worth $60 billion, you can change the rules. I think that is very, very unfortunate, he added."}
{"original": "Sanders has been critical of Bloomberg using his wealth to run for president since he entered the race."}
{"original": "When asked to respond to a recent Quinnipiac University poll with black voters that put Bloomberg and former Vice President Joe Biden ahead of him, Sanders expressed confidence in his support from minority communities."}
{"original": "I don't know what the most recent poll has, but we are doing very, very well with minority communities, both African-American and Latino, he said."}
{"original": "A lot of politicians go from the top on down. That's what Bloomberg is about. He's spending hundreds of millions of dollars. That's fine, we don't have hundreds of millions of dollars. Our movement is made up of working people, of young people, and we're going to put that coalition together, we are going to take on the establishment and I believe we're going to win."}
{"original": "Sanders also addressed the criticism from a Democratic congressman in South Carolina who recently said, South Carolinians don't want socialism in explaining why he doesn't support Sanders."}
{"original": "In my view, to a significant degree, we are living, right now under Donald Trump, in a socialist society. The only difference is does the government work for working people or does it work for billionaires? he said, explaining that he views tax breaks and subsidies for corporations and billionaires as socialism for the rich."}
{"original": "Sanders, an Independent senator from Vermont, has long identified as a Democratic socialist. Pressed if that label is confusing voters and allowing his critics to hurt him politically, he said, I'm not worried about labels. We will define ourselves, not let other people define us."}
{"original": "The next Democratic debate is Wednesday, February 19 in Los Vegas, ahead of the Nevada caucuses on February 22."}
{"original": "Ahead of President Obama's last State of the Union address, Republicans are once again blasting what the White House considers a key accomplishment of the president's foreign policy legacy: the Iran nuclear deal. And this time, they're warning that the international agreement could take down the U.S. oil industry."}
{"original": "As a consequence of President Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran, this state sponsor of terrorism will now be able to increase its oil exports at a moment when our moderate Sunni allies, and their partners, feel increasingly threatened by Iranian belligerents, Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, said in a video released Saturday. As a result, Saudi Arabia has opened the spigot to maintain its own level of exports."}
{"original": "The GOP senator warned that these factors -- compounded with the threats of Russia and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) -- are actually working to undermine our energy industry."}
{"original": "A huge part of Vladimir Putin's power base on the world stage is the fact that so much of Europe depends on oil and gas from Russia, Hoeven said. And [ISIS] is relying on oil and gas dollars to fund its brutal terrorist activities in the Middle East and beyond."}
{"original": "The chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, Hoeven added that energy security is a vitally important part of national security."}
{"original": "Hoeven proposed taking more proactive steps to growing domestic oil production. He pointed to such legislative maneuvers like Congress' recent lifting of the U.S. ban on crude oil exports, which passed after GOP leaders struck a spending deal with Democrats that also extended renewable energy tax breaks."}
{"original": "Low-cost energy makes us more competitive in the global economy across the board in all industry sectors, he said. You do that by building the kind of legal tax and regulatory climate that attracts investment, innovation and jobs. You do that by reforming the tax code to make it simpler, flatter and fairer so that the American people have the motivation to compete and win."}
{"original": "In his own video, Mr. Obama championed initiatives that have helped prop up another industry tied heavily to U.S. oil production: America's auto manufacturers."}
{"original": "I placed my bet on American manufacturing, Mr. Obama said in the Saturday video. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We said the auto industry would have to truly change, not just pretend that it did. We got labor and management to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure."}
{"original": "He touted the fruits of the auto industry bailout, countering critics who called it a road to socialism and a disaster waiting to happen."}
{"original": "Since our plan went into effect, our automakers have added more than 640,000 new jobs, Mr. Obama said. We've cut the Detroit-area unemployment rate by more than half. The Big Three automakers are raising wages."}
{"original": "Today, the president said, the American auto industry is back."}
{"original": "The president also previewed his trip to Detroit later this month to visit the city's annual auto show, saying his attendance would allow him to see this progress firsthand."}
{"original": "Some progressive Democrats have announced that they will vote against House Democrats' rules package, which was rolled out Tuesday evening. Although the package includes bills which would create a committee on climate change and implement ethics reforms, some representatives are basing their opposition on the inclusion of the pay as you go rule."}
{"original": "The pay as you go rule, commonly known as PAYGO, requires that any increase in entitlement spending be offset by cuts in other entitlement programs, or by new revenue raisers, in order to prevent the deficit from increasing. The deficit jumped by 17 percent in 2018, after the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul passed in 2017. While managing a yawning deficit may be a priority for presumed incoming House speaker Nancy Pelosi, it angers progressives who oppose cutting some entitlement spending in order to increase funding for other programs."}
{"original": "After the new House is seated, one of the first orders of business will be approving the new rules package governing the House for this term. Assuming none of the 197 Republicans vote to approve the rules package, the 234-member Democratic conference cannot afford to lose more than 16 votes in order for it to pass."}
{"original": "California Rep. Ro Khanna was the first Democrat to announce his opposition to the rules package based on the PAYGO provision Wednesday."}
{"original": "It is terrible economics. The austerians were wrong about the Great Recession and Great Depression. At some point, politicians need to learn from mistakes and read economic history, Khanna tweeted, referring to austerity measures, which are focused on reducing a deficit due to risks of budget default."}
{"original": "Incoming New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has quickly become a leading progressive voice in the freshman class, also said that she would not vote for the package on Twitter. In her tweet, Ocasio-Cortez said that the PAYGO rule is a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation."}
{"original": "So far, Khanna and Ocasio-Cortez are the only Democrats to announce opposition to the package. Other notable provisions include reviving the Gephardt rule, which automatically raises the debt ceiling when the House passes a budget. Members would be required to have additional ethics training, and would be prohibited from serving on corporate boards. One provision would also amend the rule against wearing hats on the House floor to have religious exceptions, so that incoming Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Muslim, may wear her headscarf."}
{"original": "Another notable provision would change the process to vacate the chair, a process to force out the speaker. Instead of only one member being able to trigger the process, the new rule would require motion to vacate to only be offered on the House floor if a majority of either party conference agrees to do so."}
{"original": "Stocks rose across the board Monday on Wall Street as traders welcomed a move lower in long-term interest rates in the bond market. Investors also watched Washington, D.C., as a big economic stimulus bill moved to the Senate."}
{"original": "The S&P 500 added about 2.4% on Monday. More than 95% of the stocks in the index were higher Monday, led by energy and technology companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up a little over 600 points, or nearly 2%, to 31,535, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 3%."}
{"original": "Much of the focus on Wall Street was on the bond market, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note falling to 1.45% after going as high as 1.5% last week, the highest level in more than a year. Higher interest rates can slow the economy and discourage borrowing."}
{"original": "Bond yields, which influence interest rates on mortgages and many other kinds of loans, have been steadily climbing much of 2021 so far as investors bet that vaccination efforts and more government stimulus will lead to strong economic growth later this year. However, along with strong economic growth comes concerns of inflation."}
{"original": "A handful of high-level officials with the Federal Reserve will make speeches this week that are expected to give investors additional information on how concerned the nation's central banker are about the economy and threat of inflation. Lael Brainard, an advocate for looser monetary policies to stoke job growth, will give a monetary policy speech on Tuesday and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will give a speech on Thursday."}
{"original": "The House of Representatives approved Biden's $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill on Friday and it now goes to the Senate for approval. The bill infuses cash across the struggling economy to individuals, businesses, schools, states and cities battered by COVID-19."}
{"original": "The stimulus bill is expected to include yet another round of one-time $1,400 payments to most Americans, including an expansion of other refundable tax credits like the child tax credit, and additional aid to state and local governments to combat the pandemic."}
{"original": "The combination of the vaccine rollout, stimulus payments and elevated consumer savings as a result of the fiscal stimulus could drive economic recovery, according to Goldman Sachs analysts in a March 1 research note."}
{"original": "Johnson & Johnson's stock price rose 1.5% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave approval for the company's own coronavirus vaccine, one that does not require extensive refrigeration like the ones made by Moderna and Pfizer."}
{"original": "Energy companies made some of the biggest gains Monday. Exxon Mobil rose 3.7% and Occidental Petroleum rose 3.9%. Industrial companies, including airlines beaten down by the coronavirus pandemic, also helped boost the broader market. United Airlines rose 1.2%."}
{"original": "Investors will get several big economic reports this week, including February's jobs report on Friday. On Monday a report on manufacturing came in better than expectations, and new orders also came in better than expected."}
{"original": "Senate Democrats are racing to finalize a new tax provision that would penalize large companies that pay low wages. The move comes after Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled Thursday night that a $15 minimum wage hike cannot be included in the Senate COVID relief package, which is currently being pushed through the chamber through a process known as budget reconciliation."}
{"original": "The plan being drafted by aides to Senate Finance Committee chair Ron Wyden of Oregon — in close consultation with Senate Budget Chair Bernie Sanders of Vermont — would impose a 5% payroll tax penalty on very large companies that do not pay workers a certain amount. That amount is still unclear: Wyden favors $15 an hour, but is currently seeking feedback from fellow Democrats on that figure and on exactly which companies would face the penalties."}
{"original": "Everyone in the caucus is envisioning 'very large' companies – think Walmart, Amazon, a Senate Democratic aide told CBS News."}
{"original": "Under the proposal, which Senate Democrats hope to finish crafting by early next week, smaller businesses that raise their workers' wages would be eligible for income tax credits equal to 25% of wages — up to $10,00 per employer to year — tax incentives to increase wages."}
{"original": "Basically we're having the stick approach for the very big companies at the top, and the carrot approach for the smallest of small businesses to try to encourage them to raise wages on their own, the aide said."}
{"original": "Democratic aides, anticipating an adverse ruling from the Senate parliamentarian, began quietly working on the Plan B proposal several weeks ago. The tax penalties would apply not only to large companies that pay their own employees low wages, but also to those that hire contractors – such as security guards – who earn low wages for work they do on premises."}
{"original": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday stressed the importance of the minimum wage hike, saying at a press conference that we will not rest until we pass the $15 minimum wage."}
{"original": "The new push comes one day after Sanders announced that he would introduce an amendment to the COVID relief package to take tax deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don't pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide small businesses with the incentives they need to raise wages."}
{"original": "The White House acknowledged the new effort Friday without endorsing or rejecting it. We haven't reviewed the measure. We are certainly aware… But we have not reviewed and we don't have a final conclusion on that proposal, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters aboard Air Force One."}
{"original": "House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, whose House COVID relief bill does contain a $15 federal minimum wage hike, was also reluctant to weigh in. I hesitate to, you know, to say anything until they decide on a strategy. I don't want to be perceived as second guessing what they're doing, Neal said Friday."}
{"original": "Jason Furman, who served as chair of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, sounded a note of caution, tweeting this is a really big, complicated, brand new proposal. It is *possible* that it works. It is also *possible* that another tax version works. But I would be extremely nervous about trying out a brand new idea like this with virtually no vetting."}
{"original": "House progressives were more enthusiastic about the tax proposal, but cautioned that it was no substitution for a true minimum wage increase. I'm very supportive of doing whatever we can, but at the end of the day we promised a $15 minimum wage, so if that $15 min wage isn't in this package, we are going to have to figure out a way to get it through and if that means reforming the filibuster, then we should reform the filibuster, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) told reporters."}
{"original": "This tax measure, which would be included in the $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill, would have to win the support of two moderate Democrats – West Virginia's Joe Manchin and Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema – who opposed including an across-the-board $15 minimum wage in the COVID relief bill."}
{"original": "Republicans are likely to balk at any proposal that involves imposing new taxes, even if those penalties would only apply to the nation's largest companies. On Friday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called the proposal stupid, and Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania slammed it as wealth redistribution and social engineering. It is a bad idea."}
{"original": "Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told reporters on Friday that the inclusion of a minimum wage hike had smoothed over the negotiation on this process for progressives in the House."}
{"original": "I think that Senator Sanders is doing the right thing by trying to include something, last minute, because the fact of the matter is that these negotiations, the entire negotiations of this package, for a lot of people, were predicated on the $15 minimum wage, Ocasio-Cortez said."}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez also challenged Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has expressed opposition to raising the minimum wage to $15 and has instead suggested that it be raised to $11 per hour."}
{"original": "His own constituents, West Virginians, want a $15 minimum wage. So I don't even see what kind of leg he's standing on here where the majority of his own state doesn't agree with him, Ocasio-Cortez said. A February poll by the One Fair Wage Coalition, a group which supports a minimum wage hike, found that 63% of West Virginians support raising the minimum wage by 2025."}
{"original": "Raising the minimum wage is widely popular across the country, with a 2019 poll by the Pew Research Center showing that 67% of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15. It even has support in some red states, as demonstrated by a ballot initiative in Florida to increase the minimum wage increase to $15 by 2026, which passed with support from more than 60% of voters in the last election."}
{"original": "Some Republicans have taken note of the public support for a minimum wage hike. On Friday, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri announced a proposal to require companies with revenues of $1 billion or more to pay their employees $15 per hour."}
{"original": "Under Hawley's plan, small business employees who earn less than $15 per hour would qualify for a Blue Collar Bonus in the form of an automatic tax credit. Mega-corporations can afford to pay their workers $15 an hour, and it's long past time they do so, Hawley said, but this should not come at the expense of small businesses already struggling to make it."}
{"original": "Offshore accounts conjure images of bad behavior by the rich and shady, and for good reason: They've been used to dodge taxes, fund organized crime and facilitate corruption. But many people use offshore accounts for more than just hiding bribes and laundering money."}
{"original": "And offshore accounts can be financial tools for more than just the ultra-wealthy, too. Regular people use them to simplify transactions with relatives overseas or to keep money in places where they travel often -- or for more distasteful reasons, like to hide money from a soon-to-be ex-spouse."}
{"original": "These accounts and trusts, and the shell companies sometimes set up to control them, have come under scrutiny this week after a massive leak of confidential documents from a Panamanian law firm has shown how some of the world's richest people hide assets to avoid paying taxes."}
{"original": "It's impossible to say how many accounts are for legitimate purposes rather than illicit ones, according to Mark Matthews, an attorney and former IRS deputy commissioner. My sense is there is a vast majority of people who have legal reasons, he said."}
{"original": "An offshore account is simply a financial account or trust held somewhere outside of that person's home country. Americans can hold them overseas, and many foreigners hold them in the U.S. They can be set up by companies or individuals."}
{"original": "Regulators, particularly the U.S., have cracked down on them in recent years. An exact measure of how many offshore accounts exist and who they are held by is tricky because of their nature: Many are specifically designed to offer account holders anonymity."}
{"original": "Here are a few common reasons an individual who isn't among the world's superrich might hold an offshore account:"}
{"original": "Immigrants often maintain accounts in their home country to make things simpler to manage when back home or to help care for relatives who stay behind. Financial ties can last for generations through inheritances."}
{"original": "It's not the mega-rich, you see other people who were otherwise middle class, Matthews said."}
{"original": "There can be confusing or tricky situations, of course. Matthews said these can come up if a family business is maintained in a home country or if there are family secrets. Matthews tells of a case where a woman never told her husband of an account established years before by her father because he didn't want her to marry that American."}
{"original": "I wish I could sell the movie rights. The stories of these families are amazing, Matthews said."}
{"original": "The U.S. has made several efforts to force and encourage citizens to reveal their offshore holdings, including a voluntary disclosure program that started in 2009 that has brought more than 54,000 disclosures and $8 billion in taxes."}
{"original": "An estimated 8 million Americans are living abroad. That means there are that many people who might want easy access to local banks to deposit their paycheck, pay bills or get cash."}
{"original": "There seems to be the presumption that if you have an account in a foreign country you are trying to hide money from the government, said Jane Bruno, whose Florida-based tax consulting and preparation business specializes in helping Americans living overseas."}
{"original": "The easy access abroad can create some thorny problems at home, though. Bruno said efforts to crack down on wrongdoers holding offshore accounts have made it daunting for people living overseas who try to follow the law. Unlike most other countries, the U.S. taxes its citizens on all income, regardless of where it is earned or where they live. That can make for some anxiety-producing tax paperwork."}
{"original": "There is a lot of angst around the whole thing, and there is a lot of fear about what the IRS can do, Bruno said."}
{"original": "Some people move assets offshore to protect them from a future lawsuit, divorce or other attack by a third party."}
{"original": "Barry Engel, an attorney specializing in asset protection, said some people feel they're a target because of their wealth or their profession, or maybe they've seen a friend ensnared in costly disputes or other problems."}
{"original": "In many cases, assets in an offshore trust cannot be touched in a legal dispute. And as long as the money is reported to the IRS, the whole arrangement can be above-board."}
{"original": "People outside the U.S. may also put money in offshore accounts if they feel the political or financial climate in their own country isn't stable. And while the U.S. is outspoken about its fight against offshore abuses, it has become a popular place for many global companies and wealthy to park their money, thanks to laws in some states that make it easy and cheap to establish businesses and accounts, and do so anonymously."}
{"original": "Small-business owners, especially Internet-based ones, can have customers all around the world, and they may have little or no operations in the country where the owners live."}
{"original": "These businesses often find it much simpler -- and cheaper -- to incorporate the company abroad where registration fees or taxes are low, or where it's easier to process payments coming from several countries."}
{"original": "Some financial products may be available only in certain countries that may require an account in that country to access."}
{"original": "Often, offshore accounts are just plain practical. There's been a lot of press and coverage of all the wrong uses because, let's face it, the right uses aren't very exciting, Engel said."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON -- The IRS said Friday that the number of taxpayers whose tax information may have been stolen by computer hackers now exceeds 700,000 - more than double the agency's previous estimate."}
{"original": "The tax collecting agency said 390,000 more taxpayer accounts may have been compromised than the 334,000 it warned about a year and a half ago. The breach was first discovered in May 2015, and the increase first reported by The Wall Street Journal."}
{"original": "The sensitive information can be used for identity theft or to claim fraudulent tax refunds."}
{"original": "The thieves accessed a system called Get Transcript, where taxpayers can get tax returns and other filings from previous years. In order to access the information, the thieves cleared a security screen that required knowledge about the taxpayer."}
{"original": "The IRS says it is immediately moving to notify taxpayers, offering identity theft protection services and giving them access to a program that assigns them special ID numbers that they must use to file their tax returns."}
{"original": "The IRS is committed to protecting taxpayers on multiple fronts against tax-related identity theft, said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. We are moving quickly to help these taxpayers."}
{"original": "In addition, hackers have tried to access almost 600,000 additional IRS accounts in an attempt to gain private information on taxpayers."}
{"original": "The IRS has earlier said that agency investigators believe the identity thieves are part of a sophisticated criminal operation based in Russia."}
{"original": "Washington — A federal judge has given the new Biden administration more time to determine how it would like to proceed with a legal battle mounted by House Democrats seeking former President Donald Trump's tax returns."}

{"original": "Fewer suicides occur when minimum wages are higher during periods of elevated unemployment, according to a new study."}
{"original": "Every $1 increase in the minimum wage is associated with a 6% reduction in suicide for high school grads."}
{"original": "Boosting the minimum wage by $1 could have saved 27,550 lives from 1990 to 2015, the study says."}
{"original": "Raising the federal minimum wage, which hasn't increased in more than a decade, might accomplish far more than simply offering U.S. workers a boost in pay. New research suggests that lifting the baseline wage could also stop thousands of Americans from killing themselves."}
{"original": "The study, published in the the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health and undertaken by Emory University researchers, found that a higher minimum wage made the biggest difference in periods of high unemployment. Every $1 increase in the baseline wage could have saved more than 27,000 lives from 1990 to 2015, the authors estimated."}
{"original": "The research comes at a time when so-called deaths of despair are rising, with Princeton economists Anne Case and Nobel Prize-winner Angus Deaton finding rising mortality rates for less educated white Americans. Their theory: Life for many lower-skilled workers has become a literal dead end, with chronic unemployment, poverty-level wages and a lack of opportunities leading to higher rates of alcoholism, drug abuse and suicide."}
{"original": "Life expectancy of the richest 20% of Americans has increased over the last three decades, while life expectancy of the middle 60% has changed little, and has decreased for the poorest 20%, wrote the Emory University authors, who specialize in epidemiology and behavioral health. Minimum wage increases may be one intervention to reduce income-based disparities in life expectancy, including from suicide."}
{"original": "Economists have also examined whether a higher minimum wage could reduce deaths of despair. An April study in the National Bureau of Economic Research posits that a 10% boost to both the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit, a tax break for low- and moderate-income people, could prevent more than 1,200 suicides annually."}
{"original": "This year has already seen a record number of minimum wage increases across the country. Twenty states raised their baseline pay on or around January 1, while another 26 cities and counties also boosted their minimum wages. More states, cities and counties are set to follow suit later in the year."}
{"original": "Despite that push, the federal baseline wage has been frozen at $7.25 an hour since 2009, a record-long period of time without an increase to the national minimum wage. In 21 states, the minimum wage remains at $7.25 an hour, which labor advocates say keeps workers mired in poverty."}
{"original": "The new study took a state-by-state approach, examining local minimum wage data and unemployment rates as well as the number of suicides. In times of high unemployment, a higher minimum wage within a state was associated with lower suicide rates among workers without a college degree. By contrast, raising the basic wage had little impact on suicide rates among college-educated workers, presumably because they tend to earn more and wouldn't directly feel the impact of a minimum wage hike."}
{"original": "The researchers estimate that 13,800 suicides could've been prevented between 2009 — when unemployment peaked during the Great Recession — and 2015 if the minimum wage for people with no more than a high school degree had been only $1 higher."}
{"original": "To be sure, many other factors could be at play, such as the impact of other social programs like access to food stamps and the availability of welfare programs in states that boosted their minimum wages. But the research could inform a broader discussion about the link between health in the U.S. and the growing gap between rich and poor."}

{"original": "Art Konovalov/iStockphoto By David Schepp The odds of winning the growing Powerball jackpot -- around 300 million to 1 -- are infinitesimal, but that hasn't stopped hordes of Americans from buying tickets and pushing the prize up to $1.5 billion. That mind-boggling amount does make the mind dance. Just what would you do with all that money? Quit your dead-end, or even tolerably decent, job? Buy a new house? Buy a new car -- a fleet of new cars? Travel the world? The options are endless. First, a small reality check: Should you win, you won't, of course, get all $1.5 billion. Taking the cash option rather than an annuity, advisable for anyone over age 35, leaves you with $930 million before taxes. Next, Uncle Sam will take a chunk -- 39.6 percent to be precise, the rate at which big jackpots are taxed -- costing you roughly $368 million, reducing your haul to $562 million. And don't forget state and local income taxes, should they apply. In most states, tax rates on high-income individuals range from 5 to 10 percent. Using the 7.5 percent median, state income tax would lop off another $42 million, leaving you with a still tidy $520 million. What could you buy with all that cash? Here are some suggestions."}
{"original": "A really swell house Virtually staged image courtesy of the Corcoran Group With more than $500 million in your pocket, you can afford nearly any home. But let's stipulate some rules. Many financial planners suggest not spending more than 30 percent of your annual income on housing. So for the sake of simplicity, let's divide your winnings by 30 (to mimic the type of mortgage most Americans prefer -- a 30-year-fixed) to establish your yearly income and then multiply that amount by 30 percent to find your housing allotment, which figures out to be about $5.2 million. With that budget, you could easily swing the nearly $3 million asking price for a penthouse apartment at the Level Club on New York City's posh Upper West Side. According to the listing, the funky apartment is reminiscent of a Venetian palazzo and is a castle in the sky. It features bright blue and pink plaster walls and arched windows. The building, which features 144 condos and rentals, was once the headquarters of a group of Freemasons who called themselves the Levelers."}

{"original": "In 1986, LaRouche described himself as being in the tradition of the American Whig party, a forerunner of the Republican Party in the first half of the 19th century. In 1990, he ran unsuccessfully to represent Virginia in Congress."}

{"original": "He ran his 1992 campaign from a prison cell after a 1988 conviction for mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the IRS by defaulting on more than $30 million in loans from campaign supporters. During a 1984 libel trial, LaRouche said he had no income and had filed no tax returns for 12 years. He said he did not know who paid his bills."}

That's a potential regime change similar to the situation that marked the final stages of the last two bull markets -- when both volatility expectations and stock prices rose together."}
{"original": "This comes at a time when Wall Street brokerages including Goldman Sachs (GS), Deutsche Bank (DB) and Bank of America (BAC) are warning that small traders have overextended positions in short VIX exchange-traded funds, meaning they're betting volatility will remain low. This potentially sets the stage for a violent reversal as these short positions are closed."}

{"original": "When you buy something with a credit card, the merchant pays processing fees to the financial institutions that handle the transaction. But when you put a tax payment on a credit card, the IRS doesn't pay those processing fees. You do."}

Her advice to people who can't pay in full: Pay as much as you can by the April 18th due date, then you can set up an installment agreement with the IRS to pay the remaining balance."}
{"original": "For 2017, it costs $31 for qualified taxpayers to set up an installment agreement online and pay via direct debit from a checking account, according to the IRS website. That's in addition to 4 percent annual interest on unpaid federal taxes and a penalty of 0.25 percent of the outstanding balance for each month the agreement is in effect. That works out to an annual percentage rate of about 7 percent in interest ."}
{"original": "It's a much better deal than 13.61 percent , the average APR for all U.S. credit card accounts that were assessed interest in the last quarter of 2016, according to the Federal Reserve."}

{"original": "Charging a big tax bill on your card could put you within spitting distance of your credit limit, making it easy to max out the account and incur penalties. Your credit could also suffer."}
{"original": "I'd look at 'What is my financial situation?' says Cari Weston , director of tax practice and ethics for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. If I need to have my credit card available for emergencies to pay for expenses, because I might not have a rainy-day fund set aside, [I'm] better off not adding that credit card debt."}

{"original": "Go online. An online installment agreement with direct debit is the cheapest option, with a setup fee of $31. If you set it up offline without automatic payments, it costs $225 . (For state taxes, you'll have to set up a separate payment plan with your state, which may have different rates.)"}
{"original": "Choose a long repayment period. To avoid falling behind on payments, Weston recommends taking the longest repayment period the IRS offers. Commit to what you know you can pay, she says. You can always pay more. Then the faster you pay it down, the more you'll save on interest and penalties."}

{"original": "New York state's income tax receipts are down more than $2 billion so far, creating a significant and serious state budget deficit that is mainly caused by last year's Republican-led federal tax cuts, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday."}
{"original": "Cuomo said during a news conference in Albany, N.Y., that the year-old federal law capping a deduction for state and local taxes — known as SALT — at $10,000 is the culprit for a projected $2.3 billion deficit."}
{"original": "We've set up reserves, but this is worse than we had anticipated, Cuomo said after referring to the fiscal situation as being as serious as a heart attack."}
{"original": "Cuomo, joined by Democratic Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli and Robert Mujica, the governor's budget director, said he'll be making adjustments in the $175 billion state budget proposal he unveiled last week. The governor didn't provide specifics, although he mentioned the state's top funding priorities — education, health care, infrastructure and a middle class tax reduction — as areas that could be impacted by budget cuts."}

But as many as 13 million people may experience a delay in receiving their money after the IRS sent the funds to closed or invalid bank accounts, according to tax-prep company Jackson Hewitt."}
{"original": "Some people who don't receive their checks may need to wait to file their 2020 taxes, when they can claim the stimulus payment as a tax rebate, the IRS said. That could mean at least several more weeks of waiting for their stimulus checks, which would be sent via tax refunds. The IRS typically begins accepting tax returns for the prior calendar year at the end of January and starts processing them in February."}
{"original": "The latest glitch in delivering millions of stimulus checks may complicate the recovery effort from the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused 8 million Americans to slip into poverty. In some cases, the IRS sent checks to temporary accounts created by tax-prep services such as H&R Block, TurboTax and Jackson Hewitt, which are typically used for the depositing of tax refunds. But those accounts, set up for last year's refunds, aren't currently valid, leading to delays in delivering the money."}
{"original": "In other cases, people may have closed the accounts they used last year when the IRS distributed the first round of stimulus checks. The tax agency said it is relying on the same bank information that it used to deliver the $1,200 checks in the first round of payments last spring and isn't able to update bank information for the current round of $600 checks."}
{"original": "Unfortunately, the IRS has confirmed that certain processing issues on their end will cause payment delays to many Americans waiting to receive the relief they're eligible for, Mark Steber, the chief tax information officer at Jackson Hewitt said in a company blog post. It is estimated that the IRS has inadvertently sent payments to over 13 million bank accounts that are no longer open or valid."}
{"original": "H&R Block said on Tuesday it was already receiving a high number of calls and emails from customers.

The bill payment service found that almost 6 in 10 people will use the stimulus funds for household bills, while another 2 in 10 will use the money either to feed their family or pay off credit card bills. Only about 1 in 10 will sock away the money, Doxo reported."}

{"original": "The Get My Payment site will also let people know if their checks were mailed, which could take between three to four weeks to reach their recipients, the IRS said."}
{"original": "The IRS says stimulus checks sent to accounts that were closed or are no longer active must by law be returned to the tax agency. In other words: The financial institutions can't hold and reissue the payments to their customers."}
{"original": "In that situation, people will need to wait for their 2020 tax refunds, this winter and spring, to receive their second stimulus checks, the IRS added. Taxpayers facing that possibility should file for their tax refund as quickly as possible via electronic filing and claim the check through the Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 tax returns. The money will be sent through their tax refund."}
{"original": "But the IRS hasn't yet opened its systems for 2020 tax returns. Typically, the agency is ready for tax filing at the end of January and accepts tax returns through April 15. That means people who haven't yet received a stimulus check are facing a wait of weeks or even months to get their payment."}

Now that the restaurant — along with all eateries in Pennsylvania — is moving to delivery-only, there are far fewer shifts to split among workers. His pay — roughly $16 an hour including tips — has fallen by nearly half. But the $1,400 he spends on rent, utilities, student loans and his car payment isn't shrinking."}
{"original": "It's stressful, Harvey told CBS MoneyWatch. Everybody who is working and an adult in my family works for the restaurant industry."}
{"original": "I had a moment of panic as soon as I woke up today, he added, and I checked my bank account and said, 'There's not enough in there for rent and for student loans.'"}
{"original": "Harvey spent $50 on groceries on Monday and has about enough food in the house to last two weeks. He's looked for side gigs in online writing to supplement his income. Meantime, he hopes that lender Sallie Mae, which holds some of his loans, will consider deferring payments. But for now he's in a holding pattern figuring out how to survive financially on a greatly reduced paycheck."}
{"original": "The uncertainty is the ultimate stressor in this situation, he said"}
{"original": "Pennsylvania is one of at least seven states telling restaurants to close its doors to patrons, discouraging crowds in order to contain the coronavirus. The closures, which are already hitting thousands of workers' paychecks, are expected to lead to layoffs for 4 million people, according to an estimate from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That would wipe out all U.S. job gains over the last two years."}
{"original": "Big drops in job listings already"}
{"original": "The impact of the virus on the labor market is already evident in job listings. ZipRecruiter, an online job marketplace, recently saw listings for restaurant and hotel jobs drop about 25% from their level a year ago. Catering jobs dropped nearly 40%. (Aviation, the hardest-hit industry, has seen a 43% drop.)"}
{"original": "Fully one-tenth of the jobs created in the current economic expansion has been in the leisure and hospitality sector."}
{"original": "This is an industry that's been largely responsible for drawing people into the labor force, off the sidelines, said ZipRecruiter labor economist Julia Pollak. And that's now in jeopardy. This industry is going to be hit really hard, and possibly for a long time."}
{"original": "For the broader economy, the concern is that sudden job losses would lead to a sharp fall in consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity in the U.S. An ensuing downturn could last through the end of the year, IHS Markit predicts."}

The global recession is here and now, added S&P Global, while Morgan Stanley predicted global growth to be at its lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis."}
{"original": "The coronavirus has already pushed U.S. factories into recession, according to one measure. Data on Monday from the Empire State Manufacturing Survey, a gauge of manufacturing activity in New York, fell to its lowest level since the financial crisis."}

{"original": "The speed of the downturn has taken many by surprise. When Susan Pitzer was on vacation in DisneyWorld last week, the parks were absolutely packed, she said. There was no one having any animosity, no anxiousness, no anything. Then, on Thursday, Disney announced it was closing its parks for the month, and Pitzer had to scramble to get home to Ohio."}
{"original": "It all unraveled, said Pitzer, a travel agent. After landing at 1 a.m. Friday, she spent the weekend on the phone canceling trips for 22 clients who were scheduled to fly to Orlando in the second half of March."}
{"original": "Most of her clients, who typically spend from $4,000 to $7,000 on a weekly Disney package, ended up canceling as they wait to see when the resort will reopen."}

{"original": "These older homes have to be remodeled at some point, and so many people want that Santa Fe-style glitz, Enright said."}
{"original": "Buying a historic property may be a bit of an adjustment for the modern buyer, Goff said."}

{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And other potential candidates near their own decisions."}
{"original": "All that, plus, analysis on the week's other news coming up now on FACE THE NATION."}
{"original": "Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Top White House officials and senior congressional aides will meet again today to try to find a way out of the shutdown. So far their talks have yielded nothing. Yesterday the administration stuck to its demand for 5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. Democrats insisted the government needs to reopen while negotiations continue. With no deal in sight, trash is piling up at the nation's national parks and some eight hundred thousand federal workers won't receive paychecks until the government reopens."}
{"original": "We begin today with Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin who is in Springfield, Illinois. Senator Durbin is among a group of senators talking to the White House about how to end this shutdown. Senator, welcome to FACE THE NATION. The President said this morning that he's considering declaring a national emergency depending on what happens in the next few days. If he tries to build this wall without congressional approval, what will Senate Democrats do?"}
{"original": "SENATOR DICK DURBIN (Minority Whip/@SenatorDurbin/D-Illinois): Well, I can tell you, first, there's no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate-- deliberate the future of any barrier whether it's a fence or a wall. This is the first President in history who shut down his own government. Unfortunately, there are going to be people who suffer. Look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes. As of next Friday, they'll miss a payday that may mean some problems for mortgage payments, problems and balancing the budget of their own families and households. This is totally unnecessary. And that's a point we've made over and over to this President, let's have this debate on the future of any barrier wall or border security but not at the expense of critical services for America."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President says he could bypass Congress by declaring this national emergency. So what would you do if he-- he went that route?"}
{"original": "SENATOR DICK DURBIN: I can just tell you, I don't know what he's basing this on, but he's faced so many lawsuits when he ignores the law and ignores tradition and precedent and just goes forward without any concern, he'll face challenge, I'm sure, if he's oversteps what the law requires when it comes to his responsibilities as commander-in-chief."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We described in your introduction your attempts in the past to broker agreements, you-- you've tried to be a deal maker. You were in the room with the President on Friday. Did you hear any points of agreement?"}
{"original": "SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, of course, there was agreement to continue the conversation. But what we've said is open the government and let's have a fulsome debate and deliberation. This gun in our head approach with closing down the government is the thing we most opposed, and-- and we wish incidentally that the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, would step up and be part of this conversation. He's used to-- he's going to stand on the sidelines and wait for instructions from the President. He is part of a branch of government and a leader in the Senate, he should be a participant in this conversation from the start. As of last night, three Republican senators have said they don't like this approach of shutting down the government and they're talking about joining in a bipartisan effort to end it."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So from what you're describing, it doesn't sound like there is any progress. How close are we to ending this shutdown?"}
{"original": "SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I can't say that we're close because President's made it clear he doesn't care. He's prepared to see a shutdown for months and he even said years, and reaffirmed that before the cameras. It was stunning to hear a President of the United States say that about his own government, the government we elected him to lead. But that is his position. Think about the hundreds of thousands of people who will be entitled to income tax refund checks who won't receive them because the Treasury Department has been shut down, the Internal Revenue Service is shut down, the unfortunate end and unfair results here are just across the board."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: According to the White House, so, you know, this centers on what they see as some hypocrisy among Democrats, right? They point to in 2006, there were about, you know, ninety Democrats who did sign on to a secure fencing act that talked about barriers and reinforced fencing at borders. Their argument is if you agree to it, then why can't you agree to something similar now? What-- what is your response to that?"}
{"original": "SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I would just say, do you remember the President's words, how could you forget, a concrete wall, two thousand miles long from sea to shining sea, paid for by the Mexicans. How many times did he say that to the American people? That is not what any of us have ever voted for in the past."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he now says--"}
{"original": "SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Talk about-- or--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --it doesn't have to be concrete."}
{"original": "SENATOR DICK DURBIN: --those fences and barriers. Well, he's changed-- he's changed his demand from time to time and he's changed the amount of money he is asking for dramatically from two billion to five billion to eleven billion to twenty-five billion, even to seventy billion dollars. And when we ask for specifics, how are you going to spend this money, what are you going to do with it? He basically says, well, shut down the government until you agree on it. That is not an approach that comes up with the safe border which Democrats certainly want."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you seen the more specific financial request that the White House says they were giving to Democrats?"}
{"original": "SENATOR DICK DURBIN: No. As a matter of fact, the meeting yesterday between Vice President Pence and the staff, they agreed that today they would produce it, finally produce documentation backing up what the President's latest demand might be. But Vice President Pence said at one point a few weeks ago, two billion will do it, 2.1. And then within a matter of hours, the President reversed and said, No, it has to be 5.6. That's what we're up against. There doesn't seem to be a consistent message and-- and it doesn't seem to be a message consistent with border security. If we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the United States overstayed visas."}
{"original": "SENATOR DICK DURBIN: They did not cross the border. The solution to that is not a concrete wall it's a computer program that needs to track these people who have received the visas. And this wall, incidentally, when you have people coming to the border looking for a border official to present themselves and they make their claim for asylum or refugee status, this wall is no deterrent."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you're saying you would be open to more border funding if it were spent in a different way, could you get to that five-billion-dollar number?"}
{"original": "SENATOR DICK DURBIN: I don't see that. But I will tell you we've offered 1.3 billion with very specific limits which would not include a concrete wall. The President could have taken this long ago and we could have moved forward. But he said, No, I'm going to shut down my own government. That's what he's done."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: There has been speculation and-- and our next guest, Senator Lindsey Graham, has proposed this idea of a wall for DACA, sort of, a trade here. The President stood in the Rose Garden the other day and said he wants to wait until the Supreme Court rules on DACA before he comes to any kind of proposal here. Do you agree that we need to wait on the courts there? And is there any room for that kind of swap, that kind of deal?"}
{"original": "SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Listen, Senator Graham and I could not be more different politically. He's a conservative Republican from South Carolina; I'm a progressive Democrat from Illinois. But we've teamed up time and time again to try to solve this problem. And a year ago-- a year ago, we presented to the President on January, the eleventh, 2018, I do remember the day, a bipartisan proposal to deal with DACA and many other aspects of the reform and the President rejected it. He said, I'll go with my approach. His approach ended up with thirty-nine votes in the United States Senate. It wasn't even accepted by his own party anonymously. So we're in a position now where when the President makes these claims and promises a lot of us, I hope I could speak for Senator Graham, are a little bit skeptical."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, thank you very much, Senator."}
{"original": "We will turn now to South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham who joins us from Clemson. Senator Graham is someone, as we've been describing, who-- who speaks to the President, often shares his advice. Senator, did you speak to the President this weekend about this shutdown?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina/@LindseyGrahamSC): Yeah. It was pretty clear to me that we're never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it. Dick Durbin is a reasonable guy, but he's not leading this parade. We're having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ICE, not support ICE. We're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers and we're negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though, it's immoral and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist. As long as the radical left is in charge we're never going to get anywhere. The President will compromise but he will not capitulate. So that's where we're at."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the people in the room are your colleague Senator Durbin along with--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He's not in the room."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --along with Speaker Pelosi. You don't--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He's not in the room. Neither one of them are in the room."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was on Friday. He was--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --on Friday with the President."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: They sent staff. They sent staff people to do the negotiation. The vice president's in the room with a bunch of staffers."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Dick Durbin is a good guy. He's a reasonable guy. But Nancy Pelosi has made progress. She's gone from not a penny to a dollar. Nancy Pelosi sees the border crisis as manufactured. President Trump sees it as real. Until we see the same movie you're never going to reach a conclusion. The President is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security. It will not be a concrete wall it will be steel barriers. And every plan I've supported in the past with Dick Durbin has had money for physical barriers--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --including walls and fences. Except now when Trump is President."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are about eight hundred thousand federal workers who are in this limbo not being sure--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --when they're going to get paid. So--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, with that in mind, with them in mind why can't you reopen the government while you argue about the things you just laid out?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Why would you negotiate with somebody who calls you a racist if you want a wall? Who gives you a dollar for a wall when the Democratic Party supported twenty-five billion dollars in the past? We're not going to negotiate with people who see the world this way. We'll negotiate with Dick Durbin but I'm not going to negotiate with somebody who calls the Border Patrol agents a bunch of Nazis when they're trying to defend the border against a mob. These caravans have changed everything. The reason you need five billion dollars now and not 1.6 is the border is deteriorating in terms of security. We've got eleven thousand unaccompanied minors coming from Central America."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And it cost us seven hundred and fifty dollars a day to house these minors and only God knows what they go through to get here. The Democrats see our law enforcement officers as the problem, we see the illegal immigrants, the coyotes, and the drug dealers as a problem--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --until that changes there's--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --those people who work for homeland security who are carrying out the policies you're talking about who are not going to get paid?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the Coast Guard? Who are not going to get paid."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. They're being held hostage. They're being held hostage by people who say you need one dollar to secure the border. They're being held hostage by people--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't want to--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --who accuse them--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --open the government and then continue talking?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I do want to open up the government but the goal is not to open up the government. The goal is to fix a broken immigration system to bring reality to this table. That ICE is not the problem, it's the solution. The goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. It's to implement policies--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --Democrats have voted for in the past on President Trump's watch. We're not going to give in to this radical left ever until we can find a rational way forward. We'll have wall as part of a border security plan. We're going nowhere. Wall plus DACA plus TPS makes sense. But you'll never convince me--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the President open to--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --that we don't need a wall."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is the President open--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah I think so."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --to that compromise you just floated there?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. I really believe that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: That DACA and TPS for a wall?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. But what he's not open to is a lecture by the Speaker of the House. I'll give you a dollar. He's not open to the people on the left accusing his border patrol agents of being Gestapo agents gassing children. He's not open to the idea that the wall is immoral. So if you bring Dick Durbin's to the table, we'll fix this."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. But let's dig into that--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: If the left is going to--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --because that's significant what you said there--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --if you think the President--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah I think he is open to it."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --is indeed open to a DACA for wall trade here because he stood in the Rose Garden the other day and said no you've got to wait till the court rules and we're some time out from that."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Okay. Here's what he's open to. He's open to getting his wall money. We need five billion dollars for the wall in light of the increased threats. He has always put on the table--he put 1.8 million illegal immigrants having a pathway to citizenship in his own plan. So how can you say he's not open minded to it. Here's what I think the deal would look like: given the money we need to secure our border in five billion-- five, six could be well spent. And I think we can put on the table TPS reform. There's four hundred thousand people going to lose their legal status soon who've been here for decades. I'd like to deal with that problem and I would--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: When is that going to be put on the table? That offer."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think we'll have offers on the table when we find somebody that's not crazy to deal with. We're not going to put any offers on the table as long as people in charge of these negotiations accuse all of us who want a wall of being a racist and see our border patrol agents as gassing children. Until you get that crowd put to the sidelines, I don't see anything happening."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've worked with the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner on criminal justice reform."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: He is cited as someone open to the deal you described of-- of DACA for wall."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, he is."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President really seemed to shoot that down in the Rose Garden the other day."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I am here to tell you--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: When would we see that put on the table? Is that-- that's a bigger immigration overhaul than what we're talking about right now which is simply the wall."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: When you see Dick Durbin and others in the room not a bunch of staffers. When you see this rhetoric that those who want to build a wall are racists stop. When you see the idea one dollar is enough for the wall. When that stuff ends, the real negotiations begin. Right now, the people running the show on the left are radical, liberal Democrats who don't see a border security problem. They see their own government being the problem--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --not the illegal immigrant. Until that changes we'll never get anywhere. There is a deal to be had here--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --but it will include a wall. And if there is no wall in this deal we'll never have a deal."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Syria. I know you watch the region and you had criticized the President's decision to pull out. The National Security Adviser John Bolton is in the region right now and is saying now there's no timeline for a U.S. drawdown and it'll be dependent on Turkey agreeing not to slaughter our Kurdish allies. It sounds like he's describing--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --an indefinite timeline of U.S. troops staying in Syria."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I had lunch with the President last week and I came away a bit encourage. There are three things that we want to accomplish as part of a withdrawal. We want to make sure that when we leave the Kurds do not get slaughtered. And I don't trust Turkey to take care of the Kurds. It'd be like Putin trying to police Assad. That didn't work well. We need a plan to protect the Kurds from Turkey and others. We need to make sure ISIS doesn't come back once they're defeated and Iran is not the biggest winner. If you can accomplish those three objectives by reducing our forces, which I think we can, then count me in. But those three things have to be--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --accomplished for us to successfully leave Syria. And the President's slowing down and he's re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives. Don't let Iran get the oil fields, don't let the Turks-- Turks slaughter the Kurds, and don't let ISIS come back. I think I share the goal of the President to withdraw our forces. Let's just do it smartly."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this an admission that the President made a mistake?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out. President Obama ended the operations in Iraq against sound military advice. The President's getting sound military advice about the status of the Kurds--what will happen with Iran if we leave too soon. And the-- bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that ISIS doesn't come back. And I applaud the President for re-evaluating what he's doing. He hasn't changed his mind but he's listening to a lot of good advice. And President Obama never would do that. And you saw what happened when a President shuts people out. This President's not shutting people out. He has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. I share that goal. Let's just do it smartly."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, thank you for joining us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back in a moment. Don't go away."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Four freshman Democrats joined us earlier this week to talk about their new jobs in Congress. We spoke with Representative Jahana Hayes, a former National Teacher of the Year from my home state of Connecticut and that state's first African-American woman to serve in Congress. Congressman Max Rose, an Army captain from New York who earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart in Afghanistan, he then went on to work in the Brooklyn district attorney's office. Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill represents New Jersey. She flew helicopter missions in the Navy then went to law school and became a federal prosecutor. And Representative Colin Allred, who's from Texas. He's a former NFL player who later worked for President Obama's Department of Housing and Urban Development. We started the conversation talking about the vote they took to reopen the government."}
{"original": "All of you just came to Washington at a time when a quarter of this government is shutdown. All of you took a vote to reopen the government but Leader McConnell in the Senate has said that is just a waste of time and political posturing. Where do we go from here, Congresswoman?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL (D-New Jersey/@RepSherrill): Well, I don't think it's a waste of time. We voted on the most bipartisan bill we could vote on, the one that was passed recently by the Senate, within the last month. And so I think what we're asking Congress to do is its job, and pass a bill that's going to re-open the government."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But passing a bill that re-opens the government comes up against this hard line position the President has taken which is he wants border security, specifically, a border wall, adequately funded. Do you see, Congressman, room to move beyond that existing level of 1.3 billion dollars, how do you get to the five he wants?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED (D-Texas/@RepColinAllred): Well, let's be very clear. He doesn't want border security. We have border security in this bill that we passed and we are willing to negotiate on border security. There is a difference though, between border security and then building a wall that we don't need and that will be a waste of money. A five-billion-dollar price tag is a lot of money. There's a lot of things we can do instead of that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it just a matter of semantics here? Border fence, some kind of barrier? I mean is there movement for Democrats to support what the President in some way is asking for?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, let me say, I'm from Texas. We have fencing in place, there is a significant amount of fencing, in fact, in place and there is a big difference between wasting money on something that maybe will be just a campaign promise versus something that will actually get the job done. Fencing in certain places is absolutely appropriate and we do have that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, what is the impact of the shutdown? I mean there is some calculation here that this could go on for weeks, if not months, because it's not really being felt. Are you seeing that in your district?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE (D-New York/@ RepMaxRose): Absolutely. Look we all are. We all have federal workers in our district. This is a national disgrace. There's a lot of talk here about national security and border control and we need that. But we also have to talk about the fact that a shutdown should never be used in this country as a negotiating tactic."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Speaker Pelosi has called the wall an immorality. She said, no way, no how, is the President going to get money for it. That's a pretty hard line position versus where the President is. Do you find any room for compromise in the middle?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: The room for compromise is talking about how we can deal with the crises that we are currently facing. Right now at our ports of entry fentanyl and other very serious drugs is just streaming right in. We don't--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think the ports are a bigger issue than the southern border?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I think that we have serious issues throughout the country. The point here is that what I'm not willing to do is spend billions of dollars on what amounts to a vanity project--a fifth century solution to a twenty-first century problem. What, you want to also bring horses back to the United States cavalry?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Bring some rowboats to the Navy? We can put Trump's name on it. This is far more serious than just political brinkmanship, okay? Let's get back to work. It's why we all ran and I know it's what the Republicans are interested in doing it-- doing as well. And I promise you, if they did that their voters will reward them, okay. This is not political suicide."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, if a compromise is reached in the Senate, where you see some kind of increased funding for border security, call it a wall, call it some kind of fence, but something put on the table for Democrats. Do you see your-- your fellow House members getting on board?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES (D-Connecticut/@JahanaHayesCT): Well I think-- I apologize I lost my voice yesterday. But I think the government shutdown is a sobering reality of where we are right now. We have to get to work. We cannot keep operating in hard lines. We cannot keep saying nobody's willing to move. We have to move. That's why we were elected. That's what we were sent here to do. We have to get back to work."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would be open--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --to voting for increased border security beyond the 1.3 billion that all of you signed off on already?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: I think we have to look at the bigger problem of immigration reforming our immigration system, not just a wall."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So would all of you--yes or no--vote for something that put an offer on the table for Democrats, like protections for DREAMers or protections for those coming here under extraordinary circumstances like temporary protected status."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, I think it's important to see what's in the package. And it's- I think it's hard for any of us to say. I think all of us at this table came to Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion, to get things done. We're trying as hard as we can right now to be bipartisan. We need some bend from the other side as well."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll continue that conversation in our next half hour. So, stay with us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has made a name for herself taking on Republicans in her own party. Tonight, she sits down with 60 MINUTES. Here's part of her interview."}
{"original": "ANDERSON COOPER (60 MINUTES): You're willing to compromise?"}
{"original": "ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (60 MINUTES): Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. It's just about what we choose to compromise. My personal opinion. And I know that my district, my community feels this way as well is that we as a party have compromised too much and we've lost too much of who we're supposed to be and who we are. And--"}
{"original": "ANDERSON COOPER (60 MINUTES): The Democratic Party has lost so much."}
{"original": "ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (60 MINUTES): I think so. I think-- I think we've compromised things that we shouldn't have compromised whether it's judgeships with Mitch McConnell, whether it's compromising on climate change I think we've-- there's some things that we've compromised a little bit too much on but am I open to compromise on-- on certain ways to get things done, absolutely. Absolutely."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you can watch more of that interview tonight on 60 MINUTES."}
{"original": "Next up on FACE THE NATION, we'll have more of our panel of new House members."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation now with our panel of new House members. Earlier this week we asked them about their priorities in Washington."}
{"original": "Another topic, of course, all of you haven't been on the job very long, but very quickly--we did see one of your colleagues introduce articles of impeachment. The House Oversight Chairman, Elijah Cummings, said that's premature. What do you all think? Is that too soon?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I-- I think so. I'm a former federal prosecutor and we certainly never made charging decisions before the FBI finished their investigation. I think we've got to let Mueller finish his investigation, see what evidence he finds, and then we can make some decisions."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're waiting on the Mueller Report?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: It's absolutely premature. This is way too early to be talking about this. We need to let the investigation run its course. And I just think that it's-- it's also something that can be used as a partisan lightning rod that we need to try to avoid."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the tone of this conversation? One of your colleagues, Congresswoman from Michigan, was speaking to supporters and used a profanity, and said you know, impeachment should be what we're talking about. What do you think of, maybe not the language, but the-- the premise of what's being talked about?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, I'm from Staten Island. I have no problem with profanity, okay? Well what-- what I have a problem with though is the fact that she is talking about this issue and urging action on this issue before the investigation has been completed, that will just continue this era of hyper-partisanship that we have to move away from. I-- I-- I certainly object to it."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: The gravity of that word is too big and too important to just throw it around."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to also ask you about some of the things you campaigned on. Congresswoman, as we said, you're from Connecticut. In your home state that was the site of the Sandy Hook shooting. I know you've talked a bit, given your time in the classroom, and you've thought a lot about this. What is it that you think can actually get done? What are you going to try to do about gun control?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Well, I think that, any conversation about arming teachers is not the response to gun control. I think we have to have background checks. We have to make sure that we are getting guns off the street."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So would you commend the Trump administration for this ban on bump stocks that recently happened?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: It's a first step."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a first step."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Rose, you served in Afghanistan as we said in your introduction. Both President Obama and President Trump have wanted to draw down troops--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --from that war zone. What do you think of that idea of a drawdown or a full withdrawal?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, there's been a larger problem in terms of the way in which we have tried to overcome twenty-first century threats, and that is that we are fighting sequential one-year engagements without any type of long-term strategy. So the key here in Afghanistan, because we saw in Iraq, the invasion of Iraq was absolutely foolish. But then we did a speedy withdrawal, which I believe was motivated by politics, and then we had to go right back in. We cannot afford to do the same thing in Afghanistan, but we also have to come to the realization that the only way in which we will stabilize that country is with some type of political reconciliation with the Taliban and it's our responsibility, as the part of an international coalition--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: --to provide the freedom and the space for that political reconciliation to be realized. And I intend on playing a part in trying to contribute to that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is not a small ask either to get diplomatic talks with the-- with the Taliban underway, and the administration is trying to do that--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: No. It-- it absolutely isn't. But we have been at war in Afghanistan now for seventeen years. To put things into perspective, people are now enlisting in the United States military who were born after 9/11. And we cannot just have perpetual war. But we also have to maintain our leadership on the global stage, which means that when we make a commitment, we stand by it, and we don't just try to exercise politics on the global stage. We need to have a long-term strategy not governed by tweets--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like what the Trump administration is suggesting."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, what I just saw was a announcement about a withdrawal like that, which took everyone by surprise. I believe that that's playing politics and that's a shame. I don't want to see Americans put at risk. I've watched loved ones get hurt. I don't want to see that if it's unnecessary. But I just want us to have a long-term strategy--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: --that realizes the fact that politics is what matters here, it's the United States military's job to provide that room for diplomacy to take its action."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, you've also served, as we said in the introduction. What do you think? Do you support not just Afghanistan, a drawdown but a withdrawal in total?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: You know what I would add to what Max is saying, and what I think is lost a little bit in the discussion of Trump's strategy, is this idea that we don't have a good plan with our allies. We are always at our strongest as a country when we are moving forward with our traditional allies and NATO, for example, that is when we're able to get the space to have diplomatic relations, which-- which when we bring world approbation to bear. And so when we're in an era where we're treating our traditional adversaries better than our allies, I think that is making it more and more difficult for us to operate from a point of power on the world scene."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you support a drawdown?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I think we certainly need to be talking about how we end these wars, but I don't think you can do it and say, you know, as-- as we just announced in Syria we're just pulling out."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: You have to have that long-term strategy and that is a piece that's missing."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, this week, not only a new week in Congress but also the beginning it seems of the 2020 presidential campaign season-- I know, get ready."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: If-- if-- you just finished your own campaigns, I know you're sort of, wow."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's exhausting, but it's beginning."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who do you think, as people who just ran competitive and successful races, how do you win as a Democrat in 2020 in a presidential race?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: You know, I-- I think that 2020 is going to be about 2020, and it's not going to be about 2018. And there are certainly lessons you can learn, I think, from some of our races. I think there--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: I think-- I think there is a hunger out there for people who are willing to speak honestly, who aren't, you know, just so poll tested and-- and holding back on what they're really thinking. I think there's also a hunger out there for people who are trying to solve problems instead of just carrying a partisan banner. I think the country needs to heal, the divisions are growing and I think that we need a uniter to be our nominee."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have anyone in mind from your home state?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, I certainly like my former boss, Julian Castro--"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: --who is a friend of mine and a mentor of mine. And-- and we have a lot of political talent in Texas, so."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the rest of you?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I'm supporting Mikie."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: But if I could just have one important thing. It's obvious that election season's starting again. But what we can't do is campaign in the halls of Congress. When it comes to things like infrastructure and reducing health care costs, we can't say Oh, I don't want to give this President a win because it might improve his chances in 2020."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that what you think is happening now in the House?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I think that there's the potential that it could happen. We've only been governing now for twenty-four hours. There's the potential that we could say, man, there's all this opportunity for consensus, think about draining the swamp, right? Everybody is running on anti-corruption now. But in order for us to do something we have to be bipartisan, which means everyone is going to win. If all we're thinking about is 2020, that's going to be a big, big problem and the American people are going to suffer."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I think if we're going to win as Democrats, we need to run the kind of races that form broad coalitions. The way we took back the majority of the House is through districts like mine. The eleventh district of New Jersey, where I ran on a-- with a broad coalition of people on issues that everyone in my district, from progressives to conservatives agree on. Things like infrastructure reform, things like bringing down health care costs, things like really, you know, focusing on our environment and how we move forward now, not in fifty years. Making sure we have universal background checks for gun purchases. These are things that the majority of Americans agree on and the Democrats are always at their strongest when they're focused on families and they're focused on issues that are going to move people forward."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And all of that requires working with a Republican Senate--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and a Republican President."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And all of you are willing to do that?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: But here's-- here's the shock-- here's the shocking thing, though--2016 and 2018 were not that different. It's just different political parties run-- won. If you think about what Donald Trump ran on, okay? If you put some of the racist stuff aside for a moment, which is difficult, I know. But he spoke about infrastructure, he spoke about drug costs, he wants to protect Medicare and Social Security, draining the swamp. We ran on many of those same things, the American people right now are united, that they want sensible solutions to deal with the things that really cause them pain and suffering. And now it's our responsibility to actually do something about it."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for this conversation. I wish you all luck as lawmakers. Welcome to Washington."}
{"original": "We'll be right back with our reporters' panel."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'd like to welcome our reporters' panel now for some political analysis, Dan Balz is the chief correspondent for The Washington Post, Ed O'Keefe is the political correspondent right here at CBS News, Shannon Pettypiece is a White House reporter for Bloomberg News and Mark Landler covers the White House and foreign policy for-- at The New York Times. So, Ed, I'll start with you. Did you hear any points of agreement or were Democrats and Republicans just talking past each other on the show?"}
{"original": "ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Two of their best spokespeople were talking past each other this morning, yes, and I think elsewhere as well. Look, the staff meetings that are happening this weekend that the vice president is chairing is usually the kind of thing you see on maybe day two or day three of a shutdown. We can forgive the holidays, we can forgive the fact that people weren't in town. Maybe that's the delay. But what are we on, day sixteen now? And-- and this continues to stretch out and-- and given that they're still at that very preliminary point, where they are still only beginning to define what border security means to everybody--"}
{"original": "ED O'KEEFE: --where they are still defining how 5.6, 5.7 billion dollars would be spent. We got a ways to go. Congress doesn't get back till Tuesday night, Wednesday morning that would suggest that you're going to have meetings and maybe some initial votes. I am thinking a week from today government's probably still shuttered unless something urgent suddenly arises that forces them to move faster."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You had Senator Durbin saying he doesn't see a way to get to five billion. You had Senator Graham saying no wall, no deal. Is there any point of agreement anywhere in here, Dan?"}
{"original": "DAN BALZ (The Washington Post/@danbalz): There's not at this point other than that both sides believe in border security."}
{"original": "DAN BALZ: And-- and whatever-- and-- and frankly-- and, yeah. So whatever that means. And I think it's-- it is remarkable that we have gone now two-plus weeks and there has been absolutely no indication of where the negotiating could actually take place. Every time they sit down, they seem to be farther away than they were and more dug in. It feels as though each side still believes that this can be a win-lose proposition. I win, you lose."}
{"original": "DAN BALZ: That's never the way these kinds of things end. We'll see whether this is a different situation."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and the Senate would say--such as, me winning or losing--this is all campaign 2020 that they're gesturing towards and immigration is one of those issues that divides people. But it makes them emotional and fired up, as well. Is that actually a conversation about border security or is it a conversation about politics?"}
{"original": "DAN BALZ: Well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for President Trump the wall has been central to his political message. And I know there are Democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. And so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. But with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. I mean, this can't go on indefinitely. President talked about this could go on for months or even years. It's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. But the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? And I think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, I don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Shannon, I mean, is that the calculus? We didn't really hear answers from either of the senators about what to do about these hundreds of thousands of American workers--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --who are waiting for paychecks."}
{"original": "SHANNON PETTYPIECE: Right. At this point, both side think they have a winning hand politically. No one is facing any real political pressure. And part of that, again the holidays, people weren't really paying that much attention. But for the White House, they see this (INDISTINCT) politically. Democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. So that changes at the end of this coming week when Friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. There are services. People will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. So then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up. But because the sides are so far apart, I don't think this ends without one side caving under political pressure, and right now no one's feeling it. So it goes on and-- and-- and there's no urgency."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, one of the other things that may not be breaking through but is a big headline today is the National Security advisor in Israel making an announcement that seems to be yet another change in the Syria policy. The President said he was pulling troops out in thirty days, then we stretched that to a hundred and twenty days. Now what's being described as a total indefinite stay of U.S. troops in Syria. What are people of the Pentagon actually being told to do?"}
{"original": "MARK LANDLER (The New York Times/@MarkLandler): Well, it's-- it is interesting. It's-- it's as though we have come full circle from where we are, where on December 19th when President Trump announced this pull out and put a thirty-day deadline on it. I think there's probably a great deal of confusion at the Pentagon and I think it's not an accident that we have not seen a single four-star general come out and speak publicly about what the strategy is in Syria. There's been a great lack of-- of-- of synchronicity between the White House and the Pentagon all along. The question I have now is, how in sync is the National Security advisor--"}
{"original": "MARK LANDLER: --with his own President. President Trump just a few minutes ago on his way to Camp David repeated what he has said over and over again, the troops are going to come out of Syria soon. That's a very different message than what John Bolton had in Israel a few hours earlier. Some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the Turks would go after our Kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, I think a lot of people in the Pentagon are skeptical the Turks can ever be relied on not to go after the Kurds. So I think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. But I have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from President Trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency. He will say something dramatic, indicate a desire to termination to pull out and then as the machinery of the national security--"}
{"original": "MARK LANDLER: --apparatus kind of grinds on, the timetable suddenly slow down, it's a lot more complicated. His words meet reality on the ground and I think that's the moment we're at but it must be a very confusing one for our allies and for our adversaries."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. It's not clear if the order has been given to troops to not pull out because they had been ordered to pull out."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we don't know who the secretary of defense will be, either."}
{"original": "MARK LANDLER: And that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against President Trump's troop pullout. Lindsey Graham being an obvious example. Tom Cotton expressed reservations about it as well. So some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. There are some other names that are being bandied about, but I am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and Mick Mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. I wouldn't be surprised if Pat Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that would mean we wouldn't get to hear congressional hearings and on the record an explanation to the American people. More to talk about on the other side of this commercial break."}
{"original": "We'll be right back in a moment."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with more from our reporters' panel. We saw this week campaign 2020 kick off even though we just started 2019. Dan. And Elizabeth Warren, senator, throwing her hat in the ring. How do you see Democrats defining themselves?"}
{"original": "DAN BALZ: That-- that is such an interesting question because I think we are going to go through a period in which there is great hunger among Democratic activists to figure out who the best person is to take on President Trump in 2020, and I think there is such a range of opinions on who that will be. We saw in Iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for Elizabeth Warren. I think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. I think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like Elizabeth Warren or Vice President Biden, Bernie Sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. But there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. And my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in Iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So lots of exploring without declaring, Ed?"}
{"original": "ED O'KEEFE: Yeah. I mean, Senator Warren was the first-- second to do it actually, Julian Castro, the former HUD secretary, was the first before Christmas, and will make it official next weekend. But where is everybody else? You might ask. And-- and they are still mulling it. I think we have at least seven Democratic senators who are thinking about it, some big city and small city mayors, Governor Inslee of Washington State said this week he's still thinking about it. So you will see in the coming weeks continued discussions about this people saying, yeah, I'm still thinking about it. Unless you think it's just empty talk, I-- I heard a story from somebody who met the former vice president at an event and said to him, my mother really wants you to run."}
{"original": "ED O'KEEFE: This is Biden. And Biden said in response to her, what's her name? Give me her number. He had an aide get her phone number. The next day he called this woman's mother and they talked for about ten minutes and he asked, so you think I should run? Yes, absolutely, you should, and if you do I will volunteer for you. And he asked her all these reasons why. That happens. And they're all doing this. It's got to be tremendous for their ego. But whether or not it actually results in them running and taking the plunge, you know, is another matter because they have to factor in, can I stand up against somebody like Elizabeth Warren--"}
{"original": "ED O'KEEFE: --who has a name ID in the network. Can I somehow distinguish myself in the field that will feature numerous women, several different minority candidates, I have to find a way to play in the south, at the same time I have to find a way to play in California, in Georgia and all these other places because of early voting. It's going to be a tremendous competition and one that I think a lot of people are surprised hasn't been joined by others yet but I think that's because they realize this-- this is going to be a tremendous exercise for them."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: It-- it sounds there-- Shannon, like, you're going to see some campaigning in the halls of Congress--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --based on the-- the rundown of candidates."}
{"original": "SHANNON PETTYPIECE: Well, yeah. Well, I mean, and-- we can talk about this. Meanwhile, at the White House, they are very clearly in 2020 mode. I mean, we could say they were in 2020 mode, you know, two years ago today, but the White House is transitioning into 2020 mode. And while you have these Democrats who are exploring, and making their first trip to Iowa, now you have a President Trump who has a real campaign infrastructure behind him. It's not the Trump Tower, you know, papers flying all over the place, no one know who's in charge, they have an actual campaign. They have raised millions and millions of dollars. They have a big data operation. They are out of the gate and running and the Democrats are still kind of trying to find where the starting line is or decided if they're going to show up at the race. So, I mean, that's what they're going to be up against. And they also feel like despite how much criticism and how unpopular the President might be, they also feel like they have something really to run on, the whole slogan for 2020 is this, promises made, promises kept. You might not like the promises that he kept but they are going to say that he did what he said he was going to do. He was not one of those politicians who came to Washington and-- and-- and, you know, did a flip flop."}
{"original": "SHANNON PETTYPIECE: He-- he did what he said. And they feel like that's a strong hand to run on."}
{"original": "ED O'KEEFE: You know, to your point about campaigning in Congress, that panel, discussion you had with those freshmen members, three of those four replaced Republicans and will go home in 2020 and run again in districts that favor Republican candidates. To-- to watch those kinds of Democrats now in Congress twist in the wind as candidates go out and talk about a progressive tax rate, Medicare for All, agreeing with the President maybe we should withdraw all our forces from Syria."}
{"original": "ED O'KEEFE: It's going to be really difficult for a lot of these people to somehow make a mark here and somehow deal with maybe fifteen, twenty people who are running for-- for President and their party. And it's going to make things quite uncomfortable for them."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, I mean, one of the things that-- to-- to pick up on what Shannon was saying, promises made, promises kept, that is something the President prides himself on doing, it has been a challenge for some of his aides, though, who say sometimes, you need to change with the information flow, when circumstances change. You can't just keep to the promise because it was part of the original brand. Afghanistan, when the President had that cabinet meeting in front of the cameras earlier this week, he made some unusual comments, Wall Street Journal came down pretty hard on him."}
{"original": "MARK LANDLER: Yeah. No, the President said in essence that the Soviet Union has been right to invade Afghanistan. He offered a series of reasons for that that were not factually based. He said it was an anti-terrorism move, it really wasn't. And-- and he also attributed the collapse of the Soviet Union to their misadventures in Afghanistan which is not right, it's not totally wrong but there were many other reasons for the collapse of Soviet Union. But to-- to get back to the political point you were raising, I think the troop withdrawal debate is an interesting one because it is true that he ran on withdrawing American troops from foreign conflicts. I think it's--"}
{"original": "MARK LANDLER: So did Obama. And so do-- as you say many Democrats. What I don't think has been tested maybe at least I'd love to see it--"}
{"original": "MARK LANDLER: --tested more is just how resonant an issue getting out of foreign wars is for President Trump's base. We know where his base is on the border wall, we know that's why he's sticking to the wall so hard."}
{"original": "MARK LANDLER: And I think that also explains this decision before Christmas to announce this troop withdrawal. I just would be interested to see a little more maybe researching to how much is-- how much his voters really care about pulling troops out."}

{"original": "TOLEDO, Ohio - Already facing a severe labor shortage, landscaping businesses that can't keep up with booming demand for backyard patios and fire pits worry that an immigration raid that rounded up over 100 people last week will make it even tougher to persuade Congress to allow more foreign workers into America for seasonal jobs."}
{"original": "Owners of landscaping companies near Tuesday's sting in the Lake Erie resort city of Sandusky, Ohio, and nearby Castalia, which targeted workers with forged documents in one of the largest workplace actions in recent years, said it sent a shiver of apprehension through their industry."}
{"original": "I believe most of us are doing things the right way, but every company is going to be worried that they're going to be raided, said Joe Drake, who runs JFD Landscapes in Chardon, also in northern Ohio."}
{"original": "Drake, who has been maintaining lawns for nearly 30 years, spent the past week in Chicago meeting with other seasonal employers to try crafting a strategy that would persuade Congress to ease restrictions on H2-B temporary visas, a type set aside for foreign workers who hold seasonal, nonagricultural jobs."}
{"original": "While many seasonal employers and tourism businesses were shut out of the program this year, landscapers were hit especially hard because they rely on the program more than many other industries to fill jobs they say nobody else wants."}
{"original": "I'm not condoning breaking the law in any way, shape or form, but we need a program that works, Drake said. How do you think this work is going to get done?"}
{"original": "This year, a federal lottery for the first time determined which employers would get their allotment, initially capped at 66,000 workers until the Department of Homeland Security announced two weeks ago it would allow another 15,000 visas."}
{"original": "That still leaves a shortage, though, after the elimination last year of a returning worker exemption that allowed employees to come back to their jobs without counting against the cap."}
{"original": "The number of temporary visas issued each year tends to fluctuate with the economy. And while the limit hasn't changed since the early 1990s, Congress has at times allowed exemptions to exceed it."}
{"original": "Joe Schill, president of Green Impressions in Sheffield near Cleveland, didn't get any of the 18 foreign workers he had been counting on this year, forcing him to turn down jobs that cost his business about $300,000 in just April and May."}
{"original": "Trying to find replacements has proved futile, he said. Five new hires quit last week, and what's left out there can't pass a drug test."}
{"original": "I don't want to hire illegal guys. We've got too much to risk, he said. But trust me, I can see why guys would want to go that way. I can totally understand these guys who might think they can beat the system."}
{"original": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it expects to charge the 114 workers arrested last week at Corso's Flower & Garden Center with identity theft and tax evasion. It said the employer is also under investigation."}
{"original": "Corso's released a statement Friday saying it demands proper documentation from its employees and ensures they pay taxes. It also said if anyone used false identification documents to get a job, the company was not aware."}
{"original": "Landscapers in Ohio were quick to point out that the workers were not among those with H2-B visas, who undergo background checks and are legally cleared to work."}
{"original": "Critics of the program say too many employers violate the program's spirit by filling jobs that aren't temporary or seasonal in nature, such as landscaping companies in warm weather states."}
{"original": "So it is easier and sometimes cheaper to hire H2-Bs than it is to find available U.S. workers, said Jessica Vaughan, director of Policy Studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors reducing immigration."}
{"original": "But Tamar Jacoby, president of business coalition ImmigrationWorks USA, said employers in immigrant-heavy industries have been crushed for labor as the economy has recovered."}
{"original": "Unlike other industries, landscapers can rely on H2-B visas to some extent, but jobs are still hard to fill. It's hot out there, it's wet, there are mosquitoes, there are brambles, Jacoby said."}
{"original": "Many landscapers are in a Catch-22 because they can't find enough domestic labor, said Amy Novak, a Colorado-based immigration attorney specializing in temporary worker visas. They have no option, really, other than to decrease their business contracts or use undocumented workers, she said, and that is not a good choice."}
{"original": "Immigration crackdowns could give Congress the impression that employers are trying to take advantage of the system by hiring unauthorized workers, Novak said — or it could help by showing that employers are not able to find the workers they need."}
{"original": "Because of immigration, H2-B has become a political football, said Jerry Schill, a co-owner of Schill Grounds Management in North Ridgeville, not far from Sandusky."}
{"original": "The companies that hire people in the country illegally only add to the negative perception of seasonal workers, he said."}
{"original": "It makes our battle that much more difficult, Schill said. When you're faced with adversity, it doesn't give you a license to cheat."}
{"original": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that aired Sunday, February 7, 2021, on Face the Nation."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to the former Fed chairwoman and new Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen. She joins us in Washington. Good morning to you, Madam Secretary."}
{"original": "TREASURY SECRETARY JANET YELLEN: Good morning and thank you so much for having me."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the U.S. is still 10 million jobs short of where we were before this pandemic. Many people have stopped looking for work. Is the jobs market stalling?"}
{"original": "SEC. YELLEN: Well, I'm afraid that the job market is stalling. We saw that in Friday's employment report, just 6,000 private sector jobs created, 49,000 overall, and that's after a month in which we actually saw job loss. So, yeah, we have 10 million people unemployed. Four million have dropped out of the labor market and another two million are working part time who really would like full time work. So we have- we're in a deep hole with respect to the job market and a long way to dig out."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically the unemployment rate for men and women is relatively similar. But the president's economic adviser, Jared Bernstein, said this past week the number of women who've left the workforce is of great concern and unusual in a recession. (00:01:24)"}
{"original": "What's driving that and how do you get women back into the workforce?"}
{"original": "SEC. YELLEN: Well, you know, women really are- many face just an impossible situation in which they have children they have to take care of who weren't in school and would be facing increasing demands on the job. And many, over two million, have dropped out of the labor force because it's so hard to manage that- that conflict. And the package, the American Rescue package that President Biden has proposed really addresses the problems that women face. It places huge emphasis on getting our schools open safely, getting children back into school, providing paid family and medical leave during this crisis so that women don't have to leave their jobs when they're faced with health issues or family issues that they have to address. There's emphasis on providing more childcare and- and payments, tax credits expanded for children to help families address these needs. And I think this is really necessary to get women back to work. They've faced a- a disproportionate burden because of this crisis, especially low wage women and women of color."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those emergency paid leave provisions would expire in September. During your confirmation hearings, you talked about the US needing to make these more permanent, essentially to stay competitive with the rest of the developed world. Is getting the US to adopt a legal mandate for expanded paid leave and childcare your ultimate goal?"}
{"original": "SEC. YELLEN: Well, it's certainly something that President Biden is interested in and, you know, the current package that he's proposed, the American rescue package, is intended to deal with the immediate crisis, the economic crisis and the healthcare crisis. But beyond that, he looks forward to proposing ideas to- to address long standing challenges that our economy has faced. And leveling off or even decline in women's labor force participation rate because they don't have access universally in the United States to paid family and medical leave and childcare is certainly something he's going to want to address. And he'd like to work with members of Congress to see if something can be formulated to address those needs."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a yes in the future. Let's talk about now."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: In this current rescue package, who- what should determine who is eligible for a stimulus check? Should it be your- your 2019 income level or your unemployment status?"}
{"original": "SEC. YELLEN: Well, you know, President Biden wants to make sure that the- the payments that he's proposed, $1,400 hundred payments to make good on the total $2,000 pledge, goes to families that really need it, that are struggling. And of course, it shouldn't go to very well-off family- families that don't need the funds and haven't been hard hit by the crisis. But if you think about an elementary school teacher or policeman making 60 or $ 65,000 a year, it certainly seems appropriate that they can use that help to address the extra burdens from the pandemic. So he's discussing the appropriate cutoffs and phase-ins with members of Congress and is open to negotiating on those. But there are a lot of families that are struggling with lower income and need- need those payments."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, sending people checks in the mail though, the criticism is that this is more about politics than economics. Some of your fellow economists have been very critical. Stanford's John Cogan claims 70% of stimulus payments from last year were either saved or used to pay debt. Mark Zandi of Moody's, who- who the President often references, said stimulus checks are not the most effective type of support and said much of it goes to households that don't need the funds. Given that, how do you justify writing these checks?"}
{"original": "SEC. YELLEN: Well, it has to go to people and households that do need the money and those are lower income households, and we need to make sure that the cut-offs are appropriate so that households that are doing really well maybe have seen their stock portfolios rise and make a lot of income and haven't lost their jobs, those households shouldn't be getting it. There is a lot more--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's your floor and ceiling on that?"}
{"original": "SEC. YELLEN: --targeted relief also. Well, I- I don't have specifics for you today. These are matters that President Biden is discussing with members of Congress and is open to reviewing what's- what's appropriate. But he is committed to providing the $1,400 of payments to those who qualify."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there's no jobs creation program in here. The president says he wants that massive infrastructure bill to be next. And- and job creation is what we need to see. Don't you risk spending your political capital now when you need to create jobs in this next bill?"}
{"original": "SEC. YELLEN: Well, there will be another bill that addresses job creation through infrastructure development, through investment in people, in education and training, addresses climate change, improves the competitiveness of our economy and is designed to create good jobs with good pay that involve create- careers for people. But right now, this package will do a huge amount to create jobs. The spending it will generate is going to lead to demand for workers, help put people back to work, especially when we can get vaccinations and the public health situation to the point where the economy can begin to open up again. (00:08:21) And it provides support and relief. And, you know, I'd point out, it includes aid to state and local governments. We've seen already 1.3 million workers fired off state and local payrolls because of shortfalls that they have in revenues. And they have- have mandates to balance their budgets. And this plan provides funds for state and local governments to be able to re-employ and hang on to their first responders, policemen, firemen, other essential workers."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, before I let you go, there's been some wild swings in the price of GameStop. Are markets functioning properly?"}
{"original": "SEC. YELLEN: Well, you know, we really need to look in detail to understand what happened in those- in those stocks over the last couple of weeks. I- I called a meeting last week of top regulators. The S.E.C. has promised to produce a report that will give us a better factual understanding of exactly what happened. And I think we shouldn't be drawing policy conclusions until we understand what happened. But I would say that the core infrastructure of the markets, the plumbing, ability to trade, clearing settlement, those infrastructures performed well. But we need to make sure that investors are adequately protected, that they understand the risks, and that we have fair and efficient markets. And we'll be looking into all of that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Secretary, thank you for your time. We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us."}
{"original": "The novel coronavirus-driven stock plunge that started less than a month ago has wiped out nearly 80% of the market gains that had accumulated since Donald Trump was elected president in November 2016. What's more, the S&P 500 is now up just 6% since Mr. Trump was inaugurated a little more than three years ago, in January 2017."}
{"original": "The latest flattening of what market mavens have called the Trump Bump came on Monday. The Dow dropped 2,997 points, falling nearly 13%, to 20,583 points. The broader S&P 500-stock market index slid 12%."}
{"original": "In all, stocks have now crashed nearly 30% since their peak on February 19. Highest Stock Market In History, By Far! Mr. Trump tweeted that day."}
{"original": "The market is still up since Mr. Trump was elected, but not by much. Since February 19, investors in S&P 500 companies and in S&P 500 index funds — a widely held investment in many Americans' 401(k) retirement savings accounts —have seen nearly $8.3 trillion of their money vanish. As a result, the S&P 500 is now up $2 trillion since Mr. Trump was elected, or up just 15% over three-plus years. That translates into an average annual gain of less than 5%."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump has regularly cited the rise of the stock market throughout his presidency as evidence that his administration's pro-business policies have worked. In late 2017, Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers pushed thought a massive tax cut that created a big boost in corporate profits that stoked stock prices but will cost the government roughly $2 trillion in lost revenue over 10 years."}
{"original": "It was never clear how directly Mr. Trump's policies were responsible for the rise of the stock market these past few years of an 11-year-long bull market. Similarly, it is unclear how much of the current fall is related to Mr. Trump's response to the coronavirus threat."}
{"original": "An exchange-traded fund called the Bridge Point GOP Stock Trader ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol MAGA, has fallen 33% since the February 19 peak, or slightly worse than the market in general has fared. According to Bridge Point's website, the MAGA fund invests in companies that will benefit from Republican policies."}
{"original": "Hal Lambert, who heads Bridge Point, said the fund had done worse than the rest of the market because it was weighted toward finance and energy stocks, two of the worst-hit sectors in the current downturn."}
{"original": "But Lambert said it's clear that Mr. Trump's policies had lifted the stock market."}
{"original": "The drop in the stock market of the past three weeks has been based on a forced shutdown of the U.S. $20 trillion economy that will cause a global recession, said Lambert, who believes stocks would be down even more if Mr. Trump had moved quicker to stop the spread of the virus and shut down the economy sooner."}
{"original": "Lambert thinks a market rebound will begin soon. I think stocks will higher by Election Day."}
{"original": "For most American workers, the only retirement benefit available to them is a 401(k) plan. This means they bear the responsibility for saving and investing wisely for retirement. They also bear the consequences if they do this poorly. How well you handle the do-it-yourself retirement saving system of today and avoid the pitfalls will determine whether you have a secure retirement."}
{"original": "An analysis by Fidelity Investments has come up with a list of savings factors that show how much you should have saved for retirement by the time you reach a certain age. For starters, workers should have saved at least 1 times their annual salary by age 30. So a 30-year old making $70,000 a year should have saved at least $70,000 by that age."}
{"original": "Here are the savings guidelines specified in Fidelity's report:"}
{"original": "By Age Multiple of annual salary saved for retirement 30 1x 35 2x 40 3x 45 4x 50 6x 55 7x 60 8x 67 10x"}
{"original": "Clearly, workers in their 20s need to get started saving for their retirement as soon as possible if they want to be on track by age 30."}
{"original": "But it's hard for workers that young to feel the urgency of saving for retirement. After all, they have a lifetime of working and earning ahead of them. The most common reason this group gives for not saving for retirement is not having extra dollars to put away. The financial pressure of college loans and credit card debt also play a role. No wonder only about 30 percent of younger workers who are eligible to join a 401(k) typically do so."}
{"original": "The first thing to do is to join your company's 401(k) plan as soon as possible -- if it has one. Also find out how much you need to contribute to receive the maximum matching contribution -- if any -- from your employer. Most will require you to contribute at least 6 percent of your pretax pay to get, say, a 3 percent employer match."}
{"original": "But even if a 401(k) plan isn't available, you still have retirement saving options. If you're self-employed, you can establish and contribute to a self-employed 401(k) plan. That allows you to make contributions to your own account as both the employer and employee for a total pretax contribution of $55,000 per year. If you're not self-employed and earn $5,500 or more, you can contribute up to $5,500 to an IRA."}
{"original": "Make it a point to contribute at least 15 percent of your pay each year into your 401(k) to have a reasonable chance of accumulating the savings you should have by age 30. Here's why: If you're 25, earn $40,000 per year and save 15 percent ($6,000 per year), and your employer adds an additional $1,200 in matching contributions, you could have saved over $43,000 by age 30, if your 401(k) investments grow at a 7 percent annual rate."}
{"original": "A common reason for not saving for retirement is to pay off extra principal on student loans. But by consolidating student loans, you should be able to lock in a low fixed interest rate and extend payment terms, thus lowering your payment -- and making room for retirement savings."}
{"original": "If you can't afford to save 15 percent of your pay now, begin with at least the amount required to receive the maximum employer matching contribution. Then automatically increase your contribution each year, coinciding with any annual pay increase. Some 401(k) plans have a feature called a contribution escalator that automatically raises your share by a defined amount on a preset date."}
{"original": "Some 401(k) plans include the ability to make Roth-type contributions, which are deducted from your after-tax pay instead of from pretax pay as in a traditional 401(k). The advantage is that all the growth on these contributions is tax-free at retirement when you withdraw the money. This can be a significant benefit to younger workers who'll be investing for a long time. If your plan offers this Roth feature, consider using it."}
{"original": "Finally, make sure to invest your newly started 401(k) plan for maximum growth. This means you should set your investment elections to include at least 80 percent stock funds, with the remainder in a mix of stable value and bond funds. Most employers' plans limit the number of stock and bond fund choices to a dozen or so. But because employers bear the fiduciary responsibility of vetting these funds, most are decent choices."}
{"original": "You can instead elect to invest all your contributions into a target-date fund, which aims to maximize your returns at a set future date, closer to your actual retirement. These funds are professionally managed and designed to be suitable even for investors with a 40-year time frame until retirement. A target-date fund will start out investing mostly in stocks and will gradually shift to a more conservative allocation over the years as you near retirement."}
{"original": "Getting a tax refund as quickly as possible is what taxpayers filing returns over the next two months are looking for. And why not: The average refund this year is expected to be about $3,200."}
{"original": "The fastest way to get your refund is to prepare and file your return electronically and elect to have your refund directly deposited into your bank account. You'll have your money in two to three weeks. Or you could wait four weeks or more to get your refund by paper check."}
{"original": "If you also want to be sure of getting the biggest refund you're entitled to, you could benefit from using a tax professional. A tax pro can help identify and claim additional deductions and credits, significantly boosting your tax refund."}
{"original": "But automatic deposit of a tax refund is a problem for those who don't have a bank account. Also, some people who would like to use a tax pro don't have the several hundred dollars to pay for these services up-front."}
{"original": "Companies offering tax prep services and software, such as Intuit (INTU), H&R Block (HRB) and Jackson Hewitt all offer products aimed at those without a bank account or the money to pay for tax prep fees. But while these products have some benefits, they also come with fees and other features that might mean you don't really get your money any sooner."}
{"original": "Here's a brief rundown of these products."}
{"original": "Intuit's TurboTax software offers to have your tax refund directly deposited onto Intuit's NetSpend Premier Visa Prepaid Card. According to its website, there's no fees to set one up, but fees do apply when you use the card for purchases, withdrawals or reloading card with additional cash. You'll also have to fork over $9.95 to replace a lost or stolen card. The NetSpend card targets those who don't have a bank account and don't want to wait a month or more for a paper check."}
{"original": "TurboTax users can also elect to have the TurboTax fees deducted from their federal tax refund, but beware that a refund processing service fee applies ... and prices are subject to change."}
{"original": "H&R Block also offers to direct deposit your tax refund onto a debit card, its Emerald Card MasterCard. There's no fee for this service, but Block clearly states that it doesn't result in faster delivery of your refund."}
{"original": "In response to the problem of not having the money up-front to pay for the tax prep fee, Block offers a Refund Anticipation Check, which deducts the fee from your federal tax refund. You'll pay an additional $34.95 for your federal tax refund and $13 for your state refund."}
{"original": "If you elect to have your RAC sent via paper, an additional $25 fee applies. Block says you can expect to get your RAC in about 21 days -- no faster than having a tax refund directly deposited from the IRS."}
{"original": "Jackson Hewitt recently announced it has teamed up with American Express (AXP) to give clients the option to receive their tax refund on an American Express Serve Card, which also has no setup fee. Jackson Hewitt is offering to add $50 on the Serve Card the same day you file your taxes with the firm -- but only for users paying tax prep fees of $150 or more."}
{"original": "Finally, Jackson Hewitt claims you can get your tax refund money deposited on the Serve Card up to two days faster than with automatic deposit into your bank account. That's because American Express adds the money to the card when it gets notification of the pending IRS refund deposit. Just be mindful that if you go this route, you'll want to use the card quickly -- it carries a $3 fee for every month it's active."}
{"original": "The fierce public debate over recent legislative proposals to sharply raise taxes on the rich in the U.S. tends to obscure one thing -- relatively few Americans would be directly affected by such a hike in the so-called marginal rate on top earners."}
{"original": "A proposal by freshman New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to tax incomes above $10 million at a rate of 70 percent would largely impact the tippy tops (in her words), or the top 0.1 percent of income earners. The IRS estimates there are about 140,000 tax filers in the top 0.1 percent. According to the agency, the top 0.1 percent of income earners have average annual adjusted gross income -- the metric that's used to determine your taxable income -- of $7.3 million."}
{"original": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren is proposing a wealth tax on Americans with more than $50 million. According to the Massachusetts Democrat, that would raise $2.7 trillion over a decade by levying an additional 2 percent tax on individuals with more than $50 million in assets and 3 percent on those with more than $1 billion. There are fewer than 600 billionaires in the U.S., according to UBS. Two leading scholars on inequality estimate that Warren's proposal would affect 75,000 American households."}
{"original": "Public support for higher marginal tax rates is surprisingly strong across party lines, Ocasio-Cortez said on Wednesday."}
{"original": "When I first brought up the notion of marginal tax rates as high as 70 percent for income earners above $10 million dollars, people thought it would be this very scandalous moment, she said at a panel to discuss tax policies hosted by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Just a few short weeks later we find out that 60 percent of Americans agree, including a majority of Republican voters."}
{"original": "About 6 of 10 voters say they support her tax plan, according to a survey from The Hill-HarrisX last month. About 45 percent of Republican voters support it, the survey found."}
{"original": "Are you in the top 1 percent?"}
{"original": "The income threshold to enter the top 1 percent of U.S. earners: $421,926. That's according to an analysis from the Economic Policy Center, which analyzed tax data on income."}
{"original": "But many of these earners won't pay the highest tax rate under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act because the top marginal rate for married couples -- 37 percent -- only kicks in on every dollar of income above $612,350."}
{"original": "Some U.S. states with a concentration of high-earning households have a higher bar for entering the top 1 percent of earners, EPI found. Connecticut has the highest threshold, with people needing to earn at least $700,800 to enter the top 1 percent. That's followed by New Jersey, at $588,575, and Massachusetts, at $582,774."}
{"original": "The state where it's the easiest to slip into the ranks of the top 1 percent is Mississippi, where the threshold stands at $254,362."}
{"original": "Are you in the top 0.01 percent?"}
{"original": "The income threshold for this group, and the Americans who would most likely feel Ocasio-Cortez's tax hike, is $9.8 million, according to EPI. Their average income -- $32.3 million per taxpayer."}
{"original": "Although that falls far below Sen. Warren's prescription for righting the tax system, it's still far greater wealth than the typical taxpayer can fathom. Across all 141 million taxpayers, the average adjusted gross income is less than $72,000, according to a recent IRS report."}

{"original": "In the last five years, threats made toward federal judges have increased 400%. Last year the threats totaled more than 4,200."}
{"original": "The FBI investigation into Daniel's murder revealed the 72-year-old shooter, Roy Den Hollander, had been stalking the Salas family. He had notes about routes the judge took to work, the school her son attended, and where the family went to church."}
{"original": "The FBI also told Judge Salas that the wounds sustained by Daniel appear to indicate he was trying to block Hollander from getting to her."}
{"original": "Police found Hollander's body the day after he killed Daniel Salas. He committed suicide."}
{"original": "The information obtained by Hollander was accessed legally on the internet. Judge Salas is now advocating for new legislation to provide additional protection for federal judges."}
{"original": "The proposed legislation calls for more than $250 million worth of home security upgrades and the hiring of 1,000 deputy marshals. It also calls for the online removal of personal data, including home addresses, driver's license information, and property tax records."}

{"original": "Partial returns showed the recall favored by 3,942,319 voters, or 54 percent, and opposed by 3,365,130, or 46 percent. Those results were with 14,275 of 15,235 precincts reporting, equal to 94 percent of the precincts."}

{"original": "The California secretary of state has until Nov. 15 to certify the election; the new governor can then immediately be sworn into office. He will serve the remaining three-plus years of Davis' unfinished term, which began last January."}
{"original": "Voters faced two questions — whether to recall Davis, and who among the other candidates should replace him if he was removed. On the first question, they voted a resounding yes."}
{"original": "The extraordinary spectacle of a recall election in the nation's largest state drew large numbers of voters to the polls. By late afternoon, Terri Carbaugh, a spokeswoman for the secretary of state, said a turnout of 60 percent appeared likely — higher than the 50.7 percent turnout in last November's gubernatorial election."}
{"original": "As colorless as his name, Gray Davis was also known as a canny politician with sharp elbows. Once chief of staff to Gov. Jerry Brown, he rose through the political ranks as a state assemblyman, controller and lieutenant governor, before becoming governor in 1999."}
{"original": "By contrast, Schwarzenegger's political inexperience seemed a virtue to many voters."}
{"original": "The campaign included a parade of bit players among the 135 candidates, including Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, former child actor Gary Coleman, a publicity-hungry porn actress who wanted to tax breast implants and an artist who dressed in all blue and described his candidacy as the ultimate piece of performance art."}
{"original": "The cast of characters and outsized ballot gave the campaign a carnival-like atmosphere and provided late-night comics with a stream of material."}
{"original": "But to many Californians, it was serious business."}
{"original": "I'm horrified at the thought that Schwarzenegger can be our governor, said Gretchen Purser, 25, of Berkeley, who voted against recall. I'm sick of Republicans trying to take over the state."}
{"original": "Ed Troupe, 69, of Thousand Oaks, voted yes for recall and for Schwarzenegger. As far as I'm concerned, he said, Gray Davis is one of the dirtiest politicians I've ever encountered."}
{"original": "Ultimately, the plot turned on the fates of two personalities who could not have been more different — the bland and uninspiring Davis, and Schwarzenegger, the exuberant bodybuilder-turned-action star."}
{"original": "Though Schwarzenegger held a commanding lead over his rivals going into the final week, his campaign was shaken by allegations published in the Los Angeles Times just days before the election from six women who said he groped them or made unwanted sexual advances. Allegations continued to surface over the weekend, and by Election Day a total of 16 women had come forward."}
{"original": "Schwarzenegger also was confronted with reports that he had praised Hitler as a young man — accusations he disputed."}
{"original": "Responding to the sexual misconduct charges, Schwarzenegger acknowledged he had behaved badly sometimes. But he attacked the newspaper and some of his accusers for what he called a last-minute effort to derail his candidacy."}

Earlier this month, Manafort's lawyers accidentally revealed in a court filing that Mueller has evidence Manafort shared polling data with an associate linked to Russian intelligence during the 2016 campaign."}
{"original": "The associate is Konstantin Kilimnik, who worked closely with Manafort for years promoting Russian-backed Ukrainian interests. As CBS News Washington correspondent Paula Reid reported, it was the first time a Trump official had been accused of sharing campaign information with Russian interests."}
{"original": "Vashukevich — also known on social media as Nastya Rybka — and her co-defendants were convicted of soliciting and conspiracy and given suspended 18-month prison terms. The group had said that they were conducting a class on sexual relationships."}
{"original": "Surachate said Russian self-styled sex guru Alexander Kirillov, Vashukevich's mentor in the sex training business, would take a Thursday night flight because no more seats were available earlier. In the early stages of their detention, the sex training group sent a note to the U.S. Embassy via an intermediary seeking help and political asylum."}
{"original": "Vashukevich indicated she would turn over the recordings she claimed to have if the U.S. could help secure her release, but later withdrew the offer, suggesting that she and Deripaska had reached an agreement. A public scandal erupted in early February last year when Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny published an investigation drawing on Vashukevich's social media posts suggesting corrupt links between Deripaska and a top Kremlin official, Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Prikhodko."}

The median home price in Oakland was $654,000 in January 2017, but by last fall that had surged to $758,000, according to Zillow data. Rent for a one-bedroom apartment as of November was just over $2,500."}

{"original": "The short answer: iPhone sales unit sales were down compared to fourth-quarter 2016, but revenues for the devices were up, thanks to their higher selling prices."}
{"original": "Overall, Apple's report was strong, showing a fiscal first-quarter profit of $20.07 billion. On a per-share basis, the Cupertino, California-based company said it had net income of $3.89."}

{"original": "The rules for deducting mortgage interest on home loans just got trickier under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA.)"}
{"original": "The new rules generally limit the deductibility of mortgage interest on up to $750,000 of debt for acquiring a home. In some cases, the new rules also disallow deducting the interest on home equity loans used in many common transactions."}
{"original": "If you have an existing mortgage acquired last year or earlier, don't be alarmed. These new limits don't affect up to $1 million of home acquisition debt taken out before December 16th, 2017 or incurred to buy a residence under a contract if the transaction closed before April 1st, 2018. Many homeowners with existing mortgages and home equity loans will be unaffected because this grandfather rule."}
{"original": "But if you are looking to take a home equity loan, buy a new residence or refinance an existing mortgage, you need to know how these new rules may impact you."}
{"original": "Let's take a closer look at a few examples."}
{"original": "First, home buyers need to understand that deductions for mortgage interest are now capped at home acquisition debt of $750,000. This can add to the costs of buying homes in expensive housing markets where home prices top that number."}
{"original": "It's interesting to note that the $750,000 limit applies to single taxpayers as well as married couples. According to a prior ruling of the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court, when two unmarried people buy a home together, they can combine their limits and deduct the mortgage interest on debt up to $1.5 million."}
{"original": "If you take out a home equity loan and don't use the proceeds exclusively for the purchase or to improve your home -- such as instead spending the money on buying a car or paying off credit card debt -- then the interest on the home equity loan isn't deductible."}
{"original": "But if the home equity loan was used to renovate or improve your home, then the interest is deductible, as long as when combined with your current mortgage, the debt doesn't exceed the $750,000 total loan limits under the new rules."}
{"original": "That may raise questions for home owners who are now considering a home equity loan."}
{"original": "Take a homeowner with a current mortgage of $800,000 that was taken out several years ago. The homeowner wants to take out a $100,000 home equity loan this year to improve their house. Would both the mortgage and loan interest be deductible?"}
{"original": "The interest on the $800,000 mortgage would still qualify because it's grandfathered under the old rules, which allows deductibility on interest for a mortgage of up to $1 million."}
{"original": "But because the home equity loan would be taken out in 2018 -- when the TCJA caps deductions at $750,000 of total acquisition debt -- none of the interest on the new home equity loan is deductible."}
{"original": "If the homeowner's current mortgage is $650,000, and they take out a $100,000 home equity loan in 2018 to remodel their home, all the interest on both loans should be deductible because the combined loans fall below the $750,000 cap."}
{"original": "The IRS bars the deduction of interest from home equity loans taken out on a primary residence if it's used to buy a vacation home. That's because that new loan is not secured by the vacation home. Instead, the better way to finance a vacation home is to use a mortgage secured by that second home, not through a loan on your primary residence."}
{"original": "Homeowners who refinance a mortgage will also need to consider how the new rules impact them. The TCJA includes a second grandfather rule for refinancing up to $1 million of home acquisition debt that was taken out before December 16th, 2017."}
{"original": "When you refinance a grandfathered mortgage, the mortgage interest remains deductible only if the principal balance of the new loan doesn't exceed the principal balance of the old loan."}
{"original": "Take a homeowner with a mortgage that was taken out last year for $1 million but now has a balance of $950,000. The mortgage interest on the refinancing should qualify as deductible as long as the new mortgage loan balance doesn't exceed $950,000."}
{"original": "But let's assume that in this example, the current mortgage balance is $300,000, and you want to replace that mortgage with a new loan with a balance of $400,000, in what's commonly called a cash-out refinance. In this example, only the interest attributed to $300,000 of the new refinanced mortgage will be qualified as deductible mortgage interest. The interest on the additional debt cannot be deducted."}
{"original": "The president of ride-sharing company Lyft said Tuesday the deadly crash in Arizona involving an Uber self-driving SUV could have been prevented. As Lyft continues trials of its own autonomous vehicles, its co-founder and president John Zimmer joined CBS This Morning to discuss how his own unique background influences the company's direction and what sets them apart from their main competitor."}
{"original": "I think everybody should take pause after what happened in Arizona, but it's important to zoom out and understand why companies are doing this and the fact is that 35,000 people every year are killed in a car accident. And the ultimate goal is to bring that to zero, Zimmer said."}
{"original": "His company's revenue crossed the billion-dollar threshold for 2017 – up 168 percent since the end of 2016, according to Lyft."}
{"original": "I think what's working well is our vision, which is to improve people's lives with the world's best transportation. The way we treat people, whether that's our drivers or our passengers…or our team members or employees, he said. To me, this was always a service business."}
{"original": "Zimmer credits part of the company's success with his background in hospitality and focus on service. Every New Year's Eve and on a monthly basis when possible, Zimmer drives on Lyft to get a sense of what the experience is like from all perspectives."}
{"original": "One of my first jobs was a phone operator in a hotel and I saw the obvious importance of taking care of people, to provide great service, and I think that's what's really paying off, he said. I learn the challenges of being a driver on the platform. The opportunities for us to improve the product for our drivers and I understand better the passenger experience."}
{"original": "Despite revenue hitting $1 billion in 2017, Lyft still isn't profitable. Instead, Zimmer said the company is focused on growth and capturing as much of the massive American transportation market as possible."}
{"original": "The opportunity here is that Americans spend $2 trillion every year on car ownership. We spend more money on cars than we do on food, he said."}
{"original": "Part Lyft's growth plan includes a goal of ending – or making impractical – personal car ownership in major cities by 2025."}
{"original": "It won't make financial sense. You spend $9,000 every year owning and operating a vehicle when you look at all the costs and you use the car just 4 percent of the time on average. That does not make sense. We can give you the equivalent of a $5,000 tax credit back to every household if we improve that efficiency, he said."}
{"original": "Changing the way cities operate is part of the reason Zimmer believes Lyft is superior to its biggest competition."}
{"original": "Lyft is better than Uber because we care about improving our cities. We care about improving people's lives and we care about the people that are behind the business, Zimmer said."}
{"original": "With lawmakers negotiating another round of coronavirus relief aid, many Americans are eager to learn if and when they'll receive a third stimulus check. Aside from Congress' time frame for passing the legislation, there's another factor that could influence stimulus payments: your 2020 tax returns."}
{"original": "The reason boils down to the confluence of tax-filing season and the expectation that Congress will pass the next relief bill by mid-March. The IRS officially started accepting tax returns on February 12, but said that the filing window will close on its customary date of April 15. The American Institute of CPAs earlier this month urged the IRS to announce by March 1 if it intends to extend the tax filing deadline for all taxpayers."}
{"original": "So far, the IRS has only extended the tax deadline for residents of Texas, who have until June 15 to file their returns due to the deadly storms that hit that state."}
{"original": "The current timeline effectively means the agency may start distributing stimulus checks in the middle of tax season, which could affect how much Americans get — especially households that lost income last year or who had a child in 2020. The reason: The IRS relies on each individual's most recent tax filing to determine their stimulus check payment."}
{"original": "If a taxpayer doesn't file their 2020 tax returns before Congress passes its next relief bill, the agency will likely rely on their 2019 tax return to calculate their stimulus check payment — and that 2019 return might not reflect income losses during last year's economic crisis or a new child, for example."}
{"original": "I would suggest that people file as soon as possible, especially with 75% of taxpayers last year receiving a tax refund close to $3,000, said Lisa Greene-Lewis, a tax expert at TurboTax. We are hearing a lot of people say, 'I had a baby in 2020, how will the IRS know this? When they issued the previous stimulus payment they didn't know that.'"}
{"original": "To be sure, there's another reason to file early: To get your tax refund as soon as possible, especially if you are owed some money from either one or both of the past stimulus checks. For instance, people who had a baby in 2020 would be entitled to an additional $1,100 in stimulus money ($500 from the first round, and $600 from the second round), which they can claim on their 2020 tax returns."}
{"original": "Any additional money owed from the past two stimulus checks will be sent through refund checks this year, the IRS said."}
{"original": "Currently, lawmakers are negotiating details of the next stimulus package, including what income thresholds should apply for the next round of checks, called Economic Impact Payments. Under one plan, Democrats could lower the annual income thresholds to qualify for a payment to $50,000 or less for single people and $100,000 or less for married couples, according to the Washington Post."}
{"original": "On February 8, however, House Democrats pushed back on those lower income limits, proposing to keep the income thresholds at the same level as for the previous checks. That would ensure the full $1,400 relief payments would go to individuals making $75,000 or less, while couples earning $150,000 would be entitled to $2,800 relief payments. The payments would ratchet down for incomes above those levels, phasing out entirely for single people earning $100,000 or more and couples earning $200,000 or more."}
{"original": "In a CNN Townhall in Wisconsin on February 16, Mr. Biden emphasized that he's committed to passing a large stimulus bill, noting that economists believe a significant investment can help the economy recovery in the short- and long-term. That overwhelming consensus is, in order to grow the economy a year, two, three and four down the line, we can't spend too much, Mr. Biden said. Now's the time we should be spending. Now is the time to go big."}
{"original": "Lawmakers could move forward with the bill in the next couple of weeks, sending it to Mr. Biden for his signature, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on February 18."}
{"original": "President Biden has discussed the checks with Republicans and members of Congress, she said. He wants to make sure that they're appropriately targeted so they go to people in need. You know, not to very high-income people who don't need it."}
{"original": "Why filing taxes ASAP could get you more"}
{"original": "Taxpayers should consider two issues: Their income in 2019 versus 2020 and whether they had a child last year, noted Mark Jaeger, director of tax development at TaxAct."}
{"original": "Take a single worker who earned $90,000 in 2019 but who lost her job during last year's massive layoffs and ended up earning $45,000 in 2020. If she doesn't file her 2020 tax returns by the time Congress passes the next relief bill, the IRS would likely base her third stimulus check on her 2019 earnings."}
{"original": "In that case, she would most likely receive less than $1,400 because the IRS would use her 2019 earnings of $90,000 to determine her payment. (The exact amount would depend on the phase-out amounts set by the legislation.) But if she files her 2020 tax return as soon as possible, the IRS will record her most recent annual income as $45,000 — qualifying her for the full $1,400 payment based on the income thresholds now under discussion."}
{"original": "The same situation could occur for people who welcomed a child into their family in 2020. If the IRS relies on their 2019 tax return, the agency won't be aware of the new family member. As a result, the claimant wouldn't get the proposed $1,400 payment for a dependent to which they're entitled."}
{"original": "There could be a downside to filing early, particularly for people whose income rose in 2020, compared with 2019, and exceeded the income threshold. If that's the case, Jaeger said, you may want to wait until after the legislation is passed to file your taxes."}
{"original": "Take a single taxpayer who earned $70,000 in 2019, but got a promotion and earned $90,000 in 2020 — which is $40,000 above the salary limit for the full stimulus payment."}
{"original": "You are now in that threshold of phasing out, Jaeger said. You are better waiting because the IRS will use your 2019 info to determine your third stimulus check."}
{"original": "To be sure, the details of the third stimulus checks are still fluid, and the rules could end up differing from the two previous stimulus checks, noted Eric Bronnenkant, head of tax at financial services firm Betterment. But, he added, It's more likely that someone's income went down in 2020 and that filing sooner would then help them qualify for more money."}
{"original": "It's possible the IRS could create a way to reconcile stimulus payments later this year, Jaeger said. For instance, if your income fell in 2020 but you don't file your taxes before the next relief bill is passed, that could allow taxpayers to claim the additional funds in the summer — rather than waiting until next year's tax filing."}
{"original": "The IRS is keeping an eye on the stimulus bill taking shape in Congress and building a number of contingencies based on any new legislation, said Ken Corbin, the new chief taxpayer experience officer at the IRS, in a February 11 conference call with reporters. We are thinking through what is that experience for taxpayers who might be entitled for more."}
{"original": "He added, If someone is able to file an accurate return sooner, then we encourage them to file that return as soon as they are able to."}
{"original": "Taxpayers who didn't receive their full stimulus payments in the first two rounds of checks may also want to file their 2020 tax returns quickly. By doing so, they'll be able to claim the additional money on Form 1040s through what the IRS calls the Recovery Rebate Credit, or an adjustment between what you received from the IRS versus what you should have gotten — such as if your income decreased or you had a child in 2020."}
{"original": "As of February 10, the IRS said it has issued all the first and second stimulus payments it is legally permitted to issue. On the February 11 conference call with reporters, IRS officials said they had issued more than 140 million payments for the second stimulus check, compared with 160 million of the first stimulus check."}
{"original": "The second stimulus check had a lower income phaseout, which means fewer households may have qualified for a check. But there could be instances where people didn't receive the check, such as if the IRS didn't have an active bank account for direct deposit or a current address for the recipient. In that case, the IRS says people can claim the second stimulus check on their 2020 tax return."}
{"original": "The IRS has published a Recovery Rebate Credit worksheet to walk through whether you could receive extra funds. The amount can then be entered on line 30 on IRS Form 1040. People who received the full amounts under the first two stimulus checks won't have to enter anything on their 2020 tax returns, the IRS' Corbin said."}
{"original": "The tax agency is urging people to file electronically this year and select direct deposit to ensure the fastest delivery of their refunds. Consumers may also want to avoid refund anticipation loans from tax preparers such as H&R Block."}
{"original": "While those refund anticipation loans can provide quicker access to refunds, the IRS had trouble with the previous two stimulus checks in directing the money to those RAL accounts, which are temporary accounts set up by intermediaries. In other words, relying on those accounts could delay the delivery of a third stimulus check."}
{"original": "Paper returns take longer to process because IRS workers must open the forms and enter the information into its systems, Corbin said. The IRS is still processing 6.7 million individual returns from last tax season, he added."}
{"original": "Anyone who is eligible for a [stimulus check], who didn't get one or didn't get full amount, may claim it on their 2020 tax returns, he noted. The credit will be paid as part of your refund."}
{"original": "MADRID- Spanish tax authorities say they are investigating allegations of tax irregularities involving soccer playerLionel Messi in documents released by an international probe of offshore accounts."}
{"original": "The Barcelona star was among those named in reports by international media who received a vast trove of data and documents leaked from a law firm based in Panama."}
{"original": "Still in the initial discovery stages as journalists pour through the 11.5 million files, the Panama Papers leak has implicated world leaders, businesses and celebrities in the practice of using shell companies to launder and hide money, avoid taxes, and other dealings."}
{"original": "Messi's family released a statement Monday denying wrongdoing and threatened to sue media outlets that released the information linking the Argentine player to accounts in Panama."}
{"original": "Last year, Spanish authorities charged Messi and his father with three counts of tax fraud for allegedly defrauding Spain's tax office of 4.1 million euros ($4.4 million) in unpaid taxes from 2007-09. They go on trial in late May and face nearly two years in prison if found guilty."}
{"original": "Prosecutors had said Messi -- a four-time world player of the year -- was not fully aware of his father's unlawful activities and should not have been charged, but the state attorney's office contended that the Argentina forward knew enough to also be named in the case."}

{"original": "The FIFA ethics prosecution chamber said Monday that it opened a preliminary investigation to review the allegations linked to lawyer Juan Pedro Damiani of Uruguay."}
{"original": "Damiani was identified in a vast trove of data and documents leaked from a law firm in Panama, Mossack Fonseca, which specializes in creating offshore accounts that can be used to avoid tax."}
{"original": "He heads his family's legal and accountancy practice in Montevideo founded by his late father, Jose Pedro Damiani. The FIFA case against Damiani was opened in March after ethics judges learned of his business relationship with former FIFA vice president Eugenio Figueredo, a fellow Uruguayan arrested in Zurich."}
{"original": "In addition to Damiani, suspended UEFA president Michel Platini said all his accounts and assets are known by tax authorities after he was named in leaked documents about offshore accounts from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca."}
{"original": "According to the Le Monde newspaper, Platini has been managing an offshore company funded in Panama in 2007 and named Balney Enterprises Corp."}
{"original": "Platini's advisers said in a statement Monday that the former France international soccer star wants to inform that, as he stated it many times to the journalists in charge of the investigation, all of his accounts and assets are known to the tax authorities in Switzerland, where he has been a fiscal resident since 2007."}
{"original": "Platini's advisers declined to confirm whether he actually managed the company. Platini was suspended from office in October by FIFA's ethics committee and is now serving a six-year ban over a $2 million payment that former FIFA president Sepp Blatter approved from FIFA funds in 2011."}
{"original": "Heidi Hutner, a writer and professor, likes to file her taxes as early as possible. This year, it didn't go quite to plan."}
{"original": "I started on time, and then found it hard to get online to track down a few things, Hutner said. Between working on a book, shooting a film and falling sick twice in March, she put off gathering some key documents later and later. She finally got the materials to her accountant on Thursday."}
{"original": "While rare for Hutner, this experience isn't so unusual in America. About one in five tax filers waits until the last two weeks before the filing deadline to file their taxes."}
{"original": "We process about a third of all volume in April, said a spokesperson for the Internal Revenue Service. That includes the people who file extensions in April and the return itself later in the year."}
{"original": "When is the last day to file taxes in 2018?"}
{"original": "The tax filing deadline this year is Tuesday, April 17. That's because the 15th is a Sunday and the following Monday is a federal holiday."}
{"original": "Last year, the deadline fell on April 18. That year, 17 million returns—11 percent of the total—were filed that very week. Another 10 percent came in the week just before. The back-loading could be even more extreme this year, as the filing season started nearly a week later and people receiving some tax credits couldn't file until mid-February."}
{"original": "The IRS processes about 152 million individual returns every year. As of April 6, just over 103 million had been filed. That means nearly 50 million taxpayers have either spent the last week scrambling to locate key documents and file their returns, or have scrambled to locate key documents and instead filed for an extension."}
{"original": "Nearly 1 in 10 tax filers takes advantage of an even further delay that IRS automatically grants: the 6-month extension. About 14 million Americans will get an extension this year, the IRS said in a press release."}
{"original": "An extension, however, only serves to delay any refund you have coming; any tax owed must be paid by Tuesday."}
{"original": "Florida cannot bar felons who served their time from registering to vote simply because they have failed to pay all fines and fees stemming from their cases, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday."}
{"original": "A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Tallahassee federal judge's preliminary injunction that the implementation of Amendment 4 – approved overwhelmingly by voters in 2018 to allow most felons who served their time to regain the right to vote – amounted to an unfair poll tax that would disenfranchise many of them."}
{"original": "A spokeswoman for Republican Governor Ron DeSantis said the state will immediately ask the entire 11th Circuit to reconsider the ruling. In addition, a full trial on the issue is set to begin this spring."}
{"original": "The GOP-led Legislature and DeSantis last year approved an implementation law for the constitutional amendment stating that only felons who have completed all conditions of their sentences should be allowed to vote.

{"original": "WASHINGTON --High fees. Conflicts of interest. Inappropriate investments."}
{"original": "The Obama administration is going after a host of perceived rip-offs with the new rules it's unveiling Wednesday for brokers who recommend investments for retirement savers."}
{"original": "No longer will brokers who sell stocks, bonds, annuities and other products be required just to recommend investments that are suitable for a client. They'll now have to meet a stricter standard that has long applied to registered advisers: They will be considered fiduciaries -- trustees who must put their clients' best interests above all."}
{"original": "Average Americans who scrimp and save to afford an independent and secure retirement should be able to trust that the financial professionals they turn to for advice will act in their best interests, said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection with the Consumer Federation of America, in a statement."}
{"original": "The new rules, which will be phased in starting a year from now, follow intense lobbying by both consumer advocates and the financial industry. Full compliance will be required by January 2018."}
{"original": "At stake are about $4.5 trillion in 401(k) retirement accounts, plus $2 trillion in other defined-contribution plans such as federal employees' plans and $7.3 trillion in IRAs, according to the Investment Company Institute."}
{"original": "The administration has said investors will save about $4 billion annually under the new rules. The industry has countered that investment firms will have to shell out more than that just to comply with the rules. Financial firms also argue that the stricter rules will likely shrink Americans' investment options and could cause brokers to abandon retirement savers with smaller accounts."}
{"original": "Americans increasingly seek guidance in navigating their options for retirement savings. Many professionals provide advice. But not all are required to disclose potential conflicts of interest."}
{"original": "This is a huge win for the middle class, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said Tuesday in a conference call with reporters. We are putting in place a fundamental principle of consumer protection."}
{"original": "Here are some questions and answers:"}
{"original": "Brokers? Financial advisers? What's the difference?"}
{"original": "It's significant. Brokers buy and sell securities and other financial products on behalf of their clients. They also can provide financial advice, with one key stipulation: They must recommend only investments that are suitable for a client based on his or her age, finances and risk tolerance."}
{"original": "So they can't, for example, pitch penny stocks or real estate investment trusts to an 85-year-old woman living on a pension. But brokers can nudge clients toward a mutual fund or variable annuity that pays the broker a higher commission -- even without disclosing that conflict of interest to the client."}
{"original": "Registered investment advisers, on the other hand, are fiduciaries. In that way, they're more like doctors or lawyers -- obligated to put their clients' interests even ahead of their own. That means disclosing fees, commissions, potential conflicts and any disciplinary actions they have faced."}
{"original": "Advisers must tell a client if they or their firm receive money from a mutual fund company to promote a product. And they must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, thereby opening themselves to inspections and supervision."}
{"original": "What do the new Labor Department rules do?"}
{"original": "They put brokers under the stricter requirements when they handle clients' retirement accounts. The Labor Department has grappled with the issue for years. The department withdrew an earlier proposal in 2010 amid an outcry from the financial industry, which warned that it would hurt investors by limiting choices."}
{"original": "The rules update the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA, enacted in 1975. That was a far different time. Traditional company pension plans were still the dominant source of retirement income. Now, traditional pensions are increasingly gone. In their place are 401(k)-type plans, which require workers to set aside pre-tax money but also add a new layer of risk: Employees themselves must decide how to invest their retirement money, and many seek professional advice."}
{"original": "What are the arguments for and against?"}
{"original": "Consumer, labor and civil rights groups have pushed for the new rules. They say the current system provides a loophole that lets brokers drain money from retirement accounts in fees they receive that can tilt the investment advice they give clients."}
{"original": "Ordinary investors with relatively small balances in their retirement accounts could especially benefit from the changes, according to Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America. These are the people who are now most likely to get a sales pitch dressed up as advice from brokers, Roper says."}
{"original": "Wall Street lobbying groups, mutual fund companies, life insurance firms and other industry interests have opposed the rules as proposed last year and pushed the Labor Department to revise them."}
{"original": "They say the stricter requirements could limit many people's access to financial guidance and retirement planning and their choice of investment products. They warn that that would fall especially hard on mid- and low-income employees with smaller retirement balances -- say, less than $50,000 -- who could be abandoned by brokers."}
{"original": "The new requirement to act in a client's best interest means, in many cases, that the practice of charging commissions on every trade would be replaced by a set fee for a broker as a proportion of a customer's assets. Some brokers may decide that the smaller fees aren't worth their trouble, opponents say."}
{"original": "Some financial companies and groups may take the government to court over the new rules."}
{"original": "College savings plans known as 529 accounts have earned widespread appeal among parents and families saving for a child's future education costs because they come with powerful tax advantages. Investment growth on money saved in these accounts is tax-free when withdrawn for specific expenses relating to a child's education."}
{"original": "Simply put, withdrawals from 529 Plan accounts can be tax-free when the money is used to pay for Qualified Education Expenses, or QEEs, as specified in IRS Publication 970. QEEs include tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment. For students pursuing a degree on at least a half-time basis, QEEs also include a specified amount of room and board."}
{"original": "Because the current rules don't specify a deadline or age as to when money in a 529 plan must be distributed, people who've stashed a considerable amount of money in these accounts are well advised to keep it there and growing tax-deferred as long as possible."}
{"original": "However, many individuals have asked if the timing of withdrawals from a 529 plan account has to coincide with the timing of paying the QEE. The reason for the question is that same powerful advantage of tax deferral: The longer money stays in a 529 plan and compounds tax free, the bigger the financial benefit."}
{"original": "Thinking about how to make the most of this advantage leads many to ask a question along these lines: If I use money from other sources to pay for my student's college costs incurred this year, but save the receipts and reimburse myself many years later by taking a 529 withdrawal, would that withdrawal still be tax-free?"}
{"original": "The answer is, it's not entirely clear. Surprisingly, the actual tax rules contained in section 529 and IRS Publication 970 don't spell out that the timing of expenses and distributions must match up in the same tax year. The IRS hasn't specifically said yes or no to that issue. But it approached the topic when it published Announcement 2008-17 in January 2008, which stated in part:"}
{"original": "Section 529 is silent regarding whether distributions must be made from a section 529 account in the same tax year as QHEEs (qualified higher education expenses) were paid or incurred. Concerns have been raised that individuals could allow the account to grow indefinitely on a tax-deferred basis before requesting reimbursement or use distributions in earlier years to pay QHEEs in later years."}
{"original": "The IRS and Treasury Department are now proposing to develop a new rule permitting recipients of 529 plan distributions to count only those qualifying expenses paid during the same calendar year as the distribution, plus expenses paid within the first three months of the following year. But that rule has yet to be implemented."}
{"original": "So although you won't find a rule on this explicitly stated anywhere in IRS publications or tax forms, the prevailing view by tax professionals is that 529 withdrawals must match up with the payment of the qualifying expenses in the same tax year. If you withdraw the money in December for a tuition bill that isn't paid until January, you risk taking a taxable withdrawal because you didn't have sufficient qualified education expenses during the year of withdrawal."}
{"original": "This position is based on longstanding tax-accounting principles known as cash basis, which nearly all taxpayers use."}
{"original": "But you do have some flexibility. When the 529 plan withdrawal is within any particular calendar year, the proceeds don't have to be traceable to a particular expenditure. So you can pay college bills today with whatever non-529 resources you have and wait until December before withdrawing from the 529 account."}
{"original": "Assuming your 529 funds are growing in value, this strategy at least maximizes your tax-free growth for the year."}
{"original": "ATHENS, Greece -- Greece's Parliament in a narrow vote has approved a bill reforming the debt-ridden country's pension and tax systems."}
{"original": "The bill, introduced as part of the requirements the country must meet under its third international bailout, is set to increase social security and pension contributions, and raise taxes for most people."}
{"original": "The bill was approved by the 153 lawmakers of the ruling Syriza/Independent Greeks government coalition in an early Monday vote. All opposition parties in the 300-member Parliament voted against it."}
{"original": "The vote took place amid a crippling general strike and protests that briefly turned violent Sunday."}
{"original": "The government now expects that its creditors, which include the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Stability Mechanism and the International Monetary Fund, will move to lighten its debt burden, and that this will dominate the agenda of a meeting of the EU finance ministers in Monday's Eurogroup."}
{"original": "But the creditors themselves, with the notable exception of the IMF, are against forgiving part of Greece's massive debt. At most, they appear willing to discuss cutting the higher interest rates that will prevail after 2022 and lengthening the repayment period."}
{"original": "All of the creditors have put pressure on Greece for further austerity measures costing billions of dollars, including ones that would kick in automatically should Greece fail to achieve agreed levels of a primary budget surplus in 2018."}
{"original": "For the government, which had hoped to divide the creditors to achieve more favorable terms and be excused from further austerity measures, the latest vote will not be the last."}

The latter, including engineers and doctors, warned that lawmakers who are also members of those associations will face disciplinary action and possible expulsion if they voted for the bill. Tsipras is a member of an engineers' association."}

{"original": "Did you know that not everyone is required to file a tax return? If your income falls below a certain level, the exemptions and deductions you're entitled to claim can be more than the income you've earned. In that case, you would have no taxable income to report and no need to file a return."}
{"original": "For example, if you're single and your total income in 2017 was $10,400 or less, you aren't required to file. That's because the personal exemption and standard deduction you can claim -- $4,050 and $6,350, respectively -- will reduce your taxable income to zero. A married couple can earn up to $20,800 in 2017 and have no taxable income to report."}
{"original": "However, in several situations you should file a return even if you don't have to. You may get money back just for filing. But that's the key: The only way to get this money is to file a federal tax return."}
{"original": "Here are two of these situations:"}
{"original": "If you've received tax credits to pay for health insurance that you bought from an exchange, you should file a return to continue getting these credits. This applies to those who receive a Form 1095-A, Health Insurance Marketplace Statement, showing they received the premium tax credit. In that case, you must file a return and include Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit, to report your premium tax credit and the actual premium tax credit you're entitled to."}
{"original": "If you fail to file, you'll receive a notice requesting repayment of the amount of the credit you got, and you'll be prohibited from getting any future tax credits for your health insurance."}
{"original": "Another reason to file a tax return is to claim a refundable tax credit, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, (EITC). This special tax credit is available to lower-income earners. And if you're eligible for it, you must file a tax return to get it. Otherwise, you can lose out on up to thousands of dollars -- even if you've paid no income taxes. For example, the maximum EITC allowed in 2017 is $510 per person with no qualifying children and up to $6,318, if you meet certain income requirements and have three or more qualifying dependent children."}
{"original": "During 2017, IRS said 27 million people received about $65 billion from claiming the EITC. The average EITC per person was more than $2,400. People who live in a state that offers a similar state credit can do even better."}
{"original": "But according to the IRS, only four of every five eligible people get the EITC amount they are entitled to. Anyone with earnings of $55,930 or less should use the EITC Assistant tool at the IRS website to check their eligibility."}
{"original": "To claim the EITC, you'll have to file a Form 1040, 1040A or a 1040 EZ and correctly report your earned income. If you're claiming a larger EITC due to having one or more qualifying children, you'll also have to attach a completed Schedule EIC to give the IRS additional information about those children."}
{"original": "Remember that if you file a tax return claiming the EITC, it may delay the return's processing and your refund by a few weeks. That's because tax returns claiming this credit have become a frequent target for tax ID fraud. So the IRS takes a close look at tax returns that claim the EITC."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON - The House sought Tuesday to undercut a 2005 Supreme Court ruling that gives state and local governments eminent domain authority to seize private property for economic development projects."}
{"original": "Sponsors of the bill, which passed by a voice vote, said it was needed because the 5-4 high court ruling skewed constitutional intentions that eminent domain apply only to land for public use projects."}
{"original": "That ruling, said bill cosponsor Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., justified the government's taking of private property and giving it to a private business for use in the interest of creating a more lucrative tax base. As a result, he said, the government's power of eminent domain has become almost limitless, providing citizens with few means to protect their property."}
{"original": "His legislation would withhold for two years all federal development aid to states or locales that take private property for economic development. It also bars the federal government from using eminent domain for economic development purposes and gives private property owners the right to take legal action if provisions of the legislation are violated."}
{"original": "Sensenbrenner, a conservative, was joined in sponsoring the legislation by Rep. Maxine Waters of California, a liberal Democrat and senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus. She said that economic development projects have all too often been used by powerful interest groups to acquire land at the expense of the poor and politically weak."}
{"original": "The ruling in Kelo v. City of New London allowed the Connecticut city to exercise state eminent domain law to take over the property of several homeowners for commercial use. Justices said the court had always given local policymakers latitude in determining the legitimate public interests of their area."}
{"original": "But the decision drew fire from lawmakers and others who said the ruling was a dangerous interpretation of the takings clause in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution that allows the government to seize property for public use, with just compensation."}
{"original": "Traditionally, eminent domain has been used to obtain property needed for highways, airports or schools."}
{"original": "The only lawmaker to voice opposition to the legislation was Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. He said that since the Kelo decision more than 40 states have taken steps to amend their eminent domain laws to prevent abuses and Congress should not now come charging in after seven years of work and presume to sit as a national zoning board."}
{"original": "He also noted that the bill exempts the Keystone XL pipeline from the eminent domain restrictions. That's the project that a Canadian company wants to build from Canada to Texas. President Barack Obama has rejected the pipeline, pending further review, but congressional Republicans have pushed hard for its construction."}
{"original": "The House passed similar legislation in November, 2005, five months after the court ruling, but the bill did not advance in the Senate. Senate action on this bill is unclear."}
{"original": "Senate Democrats on 11 committees are working to craft the components of the COVID-19 economic relief plan outlined by President Biden within the next two to three weeks, top Congressional aides say. Their goal is to pass the full bill and send it to the president's desk by early March."}
{"original": "The news comes as a group of 10 Republicans have been trying to push their own economic relief proposal. Democrats say they are open to incorporating some Republican ideas, but are prepared to move ahead with or without GOP support."}
{"original": "The Democrats' timeframe would prevent a lapse in federal unemployment benefits, which are due to run out on March 14. It would also give states one to two weeks to adjust their unemployment computer systems to reflect the increase in federal benefits from the current $300 per week to the $400 per week that Mr. Biden has proposed."}
{"original": "Unemployment computer systems have been a hurdle in allocating the previous increase. As one Democratic Senate aide noted, about a quarter of state unemployment systems still aren't fully processing the new federal benefits that Congress approved in December. Roughly another quarter of states just got their payments up and running in the past couple weeks."}
{"original": "Democratic senators, including (L-R) Sen. John Tester (D-MT), Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), Sen.

Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images"}
{"original": "Some parts of the original $1.9 trillion proposal may get tweaked in a bid to win Republican support, but the unemployment portion is unlikely to undergo much change. Democrats already view the dollar amount — $400 per week — as a concession, given that the benefits were originally pegged at $600 per week at the start of the pandemic. And Democrats feel strongly that offering those benefits for anything less than six months would force lawmakers back to the bargaining table again too quickly, especially given the creaky and outdated nature of most state unemployment computer systems."}
{"original": "The group of 10 Senate Republicans had proposed about three months' worth of unemployment benefits."}
{"original": "There also likely will not be much change in the $350 billion that Mr. Biden proposed for state and local government funding. Since the GOP alternative does not provide any state and local funding, Democrats are unlikely to sway Republicans simply by chipping away at the dollar amount in their plan."}
{"original": "I would expect it to stay very similar to what President Biden laid out, said one Senate Democratic aide. The aide noted that Democrats might tinker around the edges of the proposal to insure that hard-hit rural counties, or localities that are experiencing more pain than others — such as areas that experienced a severe drop in tourism dollars — get the help they need. This would require some kind of system for dispersing the funds that goes beyond a simple population-based formula."}
{"original": "Senate Democrats are considering a new earnings cutoff for the Americans who will receive the $1,400 stimulus checks. Mr. Biden originally proposed sending checks to all individuals making up to $75,00 a year and couples making up to $150,000. But Republicans have argued that earners at the upper end of the spectrum are more likely to put that money into savings, which would not stimulate the economy."}
{"original": "In an attempt to win Republican support, Senate Democrats are now considering a new earnings cutoff. Under the new formulation, individuals making up to $50,000 and couples making up to $100,000 would get the full $1,400. People who earn slightly more than those cutoffs would receive a reduced payout. Parents who meet the income requirements would also receive $1,400 per child, including adult dependents like a child in college or an adult dependent with a disability."}
{"original": "The new formulation is still a work in progress, and could change as legislation is crafted."}
{"original": "Because Democrats are hoping to pass the bill by the beginning of March – when most Americans still will not have filed their 2020 tax returns – the IRS would base its payouts primarily on filers' 2019 tax returns. This could prove problematic, since many people saw a significant reduction in income between 2019 and 2020. Anyone who thinks their 2020 income qualifies them for a larger check would be encouraged to file their return before the checks go out."}

{"original": "Relax. The IRS sends out millions of letters each year for a variety of reasons. An IRS letter doesn't necessarily carry bad news -- and if it does, ignoring it isn't going to make the situation any better. Take a deep breath, resist the urge to panic and follow these tips to help you get past your initial shock."}
{"original": "Read the letter promptly – Putting off opening it won't help you, and delaying can even cause you harm. In many cases, the IRS is simply seeking more information or clarification of some aspect of your tax return, which makes it time-sensitive by definition."}
{"original": "Check for incorrect information – Review the notice for any errors such as a misspelled name or an incorrect Social Security number, and compare any noted corrections or changes in your return with your original submission. These could be simple mistakes, modifications to correct errors on your original return. It's quite possible you didn't consider one of the latest tax changes when you filed."}

{"original": "Reply promptly when necessary – Not all IRS notifications require a reply, but when they do, it's important to reply quickly. Typically, you'll have 30 days to respond. Your response should be in writing, and you should retain copies of your correspondence, as well as any information you send along with the correspondence, for example, proof of a particular deduction that you've claimed."}
{"original": "Address any required payments – If you have underpaid your taxes and received a balance-due notice, you must address the issue immediately in order to avoid penalties.

Review your options in IRS Tax Topic 202 and contact the IRS to set up the payment options that work best for you."}

{"original": "Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg says he would pay more to Uncle Sam under his plan to raise taxes on wealthy Americans. What the former New York City mayor hasn't said: He'd pay as much as $3.5 billion less under his wealth tax than he would under similar proposals from Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, two of his rivals for the party's nomination. Bloomberg's plan would also generate far less government revenue."}
{"original": "Bloomberg, who released his tax plan last week, said the proposal targets the very rich. That includes him: Bloomberg is worth an estimated $61 billion, according to Forbes."}
{"original": "Much of that fortune is tied to Bloomberg LLC, the global financial data and media empire he founded four decades ago. The candidate owns 88% of the company, which generated an estimated $3.8 billion in income last year alone, according to industry consultant Douglas Taylor. And his nearly 90% ownership stake in the media enterprise entitled him to about $3.3 billion of that income stream."}
{"original": "Bloomberg would certainly pay significantly more in taxes under his tax proposals than what he is paying under the current tax code. But that's not unique. All of the major Democratic presidential candidates are proposing tax plans that would raise taxes on the wealthy."}
{"original": "What's more, even outside his proposed wealth tax, Bloomberg's broader tax plan could save him and his company millions versus what he would pay under plans proposed by his rivals. For instance, Bloomberg would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from a current 21%, but not all the way back to the 35% where it was before President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans lowered it in late 2017. (Rivals like Pete Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren would like to roll back Mr. Trump's corporate tax cut completely.) That 2017 corporate-rate change saved Bloomberg's company roughly $550 million last year."}
{"original": "Bloomberg's campaign declined to comment on what he would personally pay under his tax plan or that of other candidates."}
{"original": "We don't have nor discuss Mike's personal financials, a Bloomberg campaign spokesperson said. Mike is in the highest tax bracket now, and he would be in the highest tax bracket under the plan he released."}
{"original": "The Bloomberg campaign also hasn't released a detailed explanation of his tax plan, while independent tax experts have yet to evaluate it. Here's a breakdown of what we currently know — and don't know — about Bloomberg's wealth tax proposal and how it compares to what other Democratic candidates have proposed, including Sanders and Warren as well as Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar."}
{"original": "How much more Bloomberg would pay under his proposed wealth tax: $1.2 billion per year, compared to his current tax bill."}
{"original": "How it would work: A key in understanding Bloomberg's plan to tax the rich is that it isn't really a wealth tax — it's simply an income tax. That means it would be easier to administer than a wealth tax."}
{"original": "Bloomberg's wealth tax is an incremental change, and that's an advantage because it won't require the construction of a new administration of the IRS to put in place, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. But it will also create a lot less new tax liability for the wealthy."}
{"original": "Currently, the top tax rate for all income over $500,000 is 37%. Bloomberg's proposal adds a new tax of 5% on incomes over $5 million a year. He calls that a new surtax on high incomes, but it's essentially just adding a higher tax bracket."}
{"original": "Bloomberg also plans to raise that base rate — before the surcharge — for income above $500,000 to 39.6%, which is what it was under President Barack Obama. That would bring the highest income tax rate under Bloomberg's plan to 44.6%. That's still less than Sanders's top proposed income rate of 52%, but more than what the other campaigns are proposing."}
{"original": "How many people would pay Bloomberg's wealth surcharge: Income taxes generally hit a larger portion of the population than wealth taxes. But that might not be true for Bloomberg's wealth surcharge, even though it is structured as an income tax."}
{"original": "Roughly 11,000 Americans earned at least $5 million in 2017, according to the latest available statistics from the Social Security Administration. Include investment income from things like gains on stock sales or flipping houses, and many more people would pay Bloomberg's wealth surcharge — it just isn't clear how many."}
{"original": "As of 2017, there were 143,000 tax fillings that reported income of $2.4 million or more, and 14,300 with that nearly $13 million or more. So the number is likely somewhere between those two."}
{"original": "How much government revenue it would raise: Bloomberg's tax proposals would generate a total of $5 trillion in new government revenue over a decade, according to his campaign. But that is for all of his proposals — not just the wealth tax."}
{"original": "Based on earned income alone, Bloomberg's surcharge targeting the rich wouldn't raise much, maybe around $4 billion a year, or $40 billion over a decade. Consider all forms of income, however, and the potential haul could be roughly $1.8 trillion over a decade, based on the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model estimate of $200 billion a year from just raising the capital gains tax to 42% (slightly less than the 44.6% top rate that Bloomberg is proposing). About $140 billion of that would come from the top 1% of all earners."}
{"original": "How much more Bloomberg would pay under Sanders's proposed wealth tax: $4.7 billion."}
{"original": "How it would work: Sanders's plan is a true wealth tax. After that, it gets complicated."}
{"original": "Sanders is proposing eight wealth tax brackets that start at 1% for couples with wealth above $32 million, and goes up to 8% for wealth above $10 billion. Tax thresholds are cut in half for individuals, who would start paying his 1% wealth tax at $16 million."}
{"original": "The advantage of a wealth tax is that it taxes all types of assets, not just income. For instance, it would capture those who have inherited their fortune or got to eight figures from investments."}
{"original": "The disadvantage is that the government would have to create a whole new system to asses wealth — including real estate and private business ownership — and then tax it. That wouldn't be cheap. And many experts say it's even easier for rich people to avoid a wealth tax than an income tax as they can shelter much of theIr wealth overseas."}
{"original": "How many people would pay the wealth tax: The Sanders wealth tax would likely affect more Americans than those who would pay Bloomberg's surcharge. The Sanders tax would be paid by the 180,000 wealthiest American families, according to his campaign and an independent assessment from economists and income-inequality experts Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. That's about 40,000 more households than Bloomberg's wealth tax."}
{"original": "How much government revenue it would raise: The Sanders campaign says $4.4 trillion over a decade. Penn Wharton's analysis puts the revenue projection at $3.3 trillion, and possibly as low as $2.8 billion if the wealth tax slows the economy."}
{"original": "How much more Bloomberg would pay under Warren's proposed wealth tax: $3.7 billion."}
{"original": "How it would work: Warren's plan, like Sanders, is a direct tax on wealth. But her blueprint is simpler."}
{"original": "There are just two brackets for both couples and individuals: Warren is proposing that millionaires pay a 2% tax on all their wealth above $50 million. Billionaires would pay 6%. That should make administering a wealth tax slightly easier, but still more complicated than just raising income tax rates, as Bloomberg proposes."}
{"original": "How many people would pay: The Warren campaign, as well as economists Saez and Zucman, say her tax plan would affect 70,000 households. But another study by a trio of economists estimated that nearly 300,000 people would have to pay Warren's wealth tax for it to generate the total money Warren says it could."}
{"original": "How much government revenue it would raise: Saez and Zucman peg the expected revenue from her wealth tax at $4 trillion. Penn Wharton estimates it at $2.7 trillion, and $500 billion less, or $2.3 billion, if her wealth taxes slow the economy."}
{"original": "How much more Bloomberg would pay under the other candidates' proposed tax hikes: $1 billion."}
{"original": "How their plans would work: Neither Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg nor Amy Klobuchar are proposing a designated wealth tax. Of the three, only Klobuchar has said she is open to one. Buttigieg called Warren's wealth tax extreme."}
{"original": "In fact, Biden and Buttigieg are proposing to tax billionaires like Bloomberg less than what the media mogul has outlined. Klobuchar is proposing a 30% minimum alternative tax for those earning more than $1 million a year, but hasn't given many details on how it would work."}
{"original": "Instead, and like Bloomberg, all three want to raise income taxes on the wealthy, mostly by taxing investment gains at the same rate as wages. That would hit the rich more than average Americans who may not participate in the stock market beyond their 401(k)s, IRAs and other pre-tax retirement plans."}
{"original": "The candidates have also proposed returning income tax rates for top earners to where they were before President Trump took office. That would raise the tax on capital gains to 39.6% from its current top rate of 20%."}
{"original": "How many people would pay more tax: The Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar plans are by far the broadest because their additional tax revenue would come from raising the capital gains tax on all Americans, not just the super wealthy."}
{"original": "As of 2017, some 1.4 million American households had annual income of more than $500,000. Nearly all of them would likely pay more under the three candidates' plans."}
{"original": "How much government revenue they would raise: Penn Wharton has said Biden's total tax plan can generate $2.6 trillion over a decade. But that includes everything from raising the corporate income tax to eliminating tax breaks for companies that produce fossil fuels. About half of that, or $1.3 trillion, would be raised from top wage earners, according to Penn Wharton's calculations."}
{"original": "The Buttigieg and Klobuchar plans have not been analyzed by an outside group. Neither campaign responded to comment for this article."}
{"original": "Editor's note: CBS MoneyWatch Senior Reporter Stephen Gandel is a former employee of Bloomberg LLC."}
{"original": "Correction: An earlier version of this story said that candidate Mike Bloomberg wanted to maintain the current 21% corporate income tax rate. In fact, the candidate has said he would like to raise it to 28%."}
{"original": "Have you checked your child's credit report lately? You may want to. More than 1 million children had their identities stolen in 2017, according to new research."}
{"original": "Worse, because a child's credit report is a blank slate, crooks can use a kid's Social Security number to create an entirely new identity. By the time the child grows up and finds out he or she has been victimized, the crook has done so much damage that it's extremely difficult to correct, said Al Pascual, head of fraud and security for Javelin Strategy and Research, which conducted the study released today."}
{"original": "With every new account that the criminal opens, the criminal adds credibility to his claim to that [victimized child's] Social Security number and the credit report that goes along with it, said Pascual. That can make it extremely difficult for the victim to fix the record."}
{"original": "The theft is likely to go unnoticed for years. The study, which was sponsored by Identity Guard, found 66 percent of child ID theft victims are under the age of 8 -- more than 10 years away from being able to sign a legal contract."}
{"original": "Moreover, 60 percent of child victims know the crook. Indeed, 22 percent of these frauds are perpetrated by a parent or a stepparent. Other relatives, including uncles, cousins and siblings, account for 10 percent of the frauds. The most common perpetrators are family friends."}
{"original": "Since the child's guardians may have a personal relationship with the crook, these frauds frequently aren't reported to law enforcement, Pascual said. If it's Uncle Sal, the parents might be reluctant to report him to the police, he noted."}
{"original": "Kids who are bullied are far more likely to be victims of ID theft, the report adds. This may be because they're unprepared to protect themselves in person or online."}
{"original": "Cyberbullying is less prevalent than in-person bullying, the report notes. But it's more closely correlated with childhood ID theft. Minors who are bullied online are nine times more likely to be victimized than those who aren't. Those bullied in person, however, lose the most money. The average fraud amount for child victims who were bullied in person is an astounding $4,075 -- four times the overall average, according to the report."}
{"original": "What can you do to protect your child from ID theft?"}
{"original": "Check your child's credit report to see if any items are associated with his or her Social Security number. None should be."}
{"original": "Freeze the child's report until he or she is old enough to apply for credit."}
{"original": "Secure your child's Social Security number, keeping tax forms locked away and statements for, say, college accounts in secured files."}
{"original": "Report any inaccuracies on the child's file immediately and file a police report, if necessary. It's understandable that you may not want to recognize the larcenous nature of your new romantic partner, but he or she could be ruining your child's future chance at buying a house or car, or getting a credit card."}
{"original": "Be vigilant. The earlier fraud is detected, the easier it is to solve, Pascual said. Indeed, for the vast majority of child victims, proving that they didn't take out the loan that appears on their credit report is as easy as showing the credit bureau the child's birth certificate. Remember, if that fraud isn't discovered until the child is older, fixing the record can be a nightmare."}
{"original": "We have done studies on adult identity theft for 15 years, but this is a very different kind of crime, said Pascual. It's much more difficult to reconcile."}
{"original": "Washington — A bipartisan group of senators is pushing the White House for more details on its $1.9 trillion rescue plan, with some suggesting to administration officials on Sunday that President Joe Biden needs to provide more information on how money would be spent — and consider dividing up his ambitious legislation into smaller proposals."}
{"original": "Sixteen senators from both major parties and three senior White House aides met virtually on Sunday afternoon to discuss Mr. Biden's American Rescue Plan. The one hour and 15 minute call was set up by moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia."}
{"original": "Mr. Biden's proposed relief plan includes $400 billion for slowing the spread of COVID-19 and increasing vaccine capabilities; more than $1 trillion to assist families needing direct financial support; and $440 billion in emergency funds for cash-poor small businesses and communities."}
{"original": "Included in the package are $1,400 stimulus checks that, combined with the recent round of $600 payments, bring the total relief sent to Americans to $2,000. The amount of direct aid to send to individuals was a key sticking point in the negotiations of the relief package passed at the end of 2020. Other financial aid includes expanding unemployment insurance by $100, bringing the weekly total to $400, and increasing the child tax credit to $3,000 per child."}
{"original": "Participants in the meeting stressed they're pushing the administration for more details on how quickly it can distribute the vaccine nationwide, saying it's an urgent priority."}
{"original": "There were certainly a consensus that the number one priority is vaccination, said Maine Senator Angus King, an independent. And also testing and tracing, we can't let up on that. But a consensus that we need to identify the bottlenecks, whether it's production, distribution, administration of the vaccine, and move aggressively on that. Everybody believes that's the that's the number one priority, and there was absolute consensus on that."}
{"original": "Some of the participants signaled they'd like the Senate to work out a framework for a deal in the next two weeks — before former President Trump's impeachment trial begins on February 8. But others said the impeachment trial didn't come up on the call."}
{"original": "Although some participants called the meeting productive and a good first step, Republican Senator Susan Collins, who attended the meeting, called it premature to be discussing legislative action of this size and scope. She said she would be suggesting a more targeted package, especially focusing on vaccine distribution."}
{"original": "Representatives on the call from both parties said they would be pressing the Biden administration for more clarity on how it calculated the potential federal aid needed for schools, states and cities. Some senators are asking for more information on how aid could be distributed to cash-strapped municipalities and states."}
{"original": "King said there was a fair amount of discussion of the data to figure out how aid was calculated."}
{"original": "In other words, they have, I think, $130 billion for education, King said. Where does that come from? What's the basis of it? And there were questions about that. Another sort of detail question is, how much money is still in the pipeline? How much has been committed and stemmed from the prior relief packages?"}
{"original": "Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who was also part of Sunday's meeting, said more data would be helpful."}
{"original": "She said there was a lot of discussion on targeted aid at states, especially recognizing what states will have positive revenue and will require less aid."}
{"original": "The state and local needs is one of the things that has continued to be an issue, Shaheen said. It was an issue as we were trying to put together the last COVID package in December."}
{"original": "But Shaheen called it a really positive start."}
{"original": "The fact that we have a new administration not even a week on the job and they're reaching out to the bipartisan group of senators that were really important to getting the last COVID relief package done, Shaheen said. It was an opportunity to hear from the administration their reasoning behind what's in the COVID package and for us to ask questions and to express our views."}
{"original": "Congress passed a $900 billion relief package in December, which several senators mentioned when discussing Sunday's call."}
{"original": "Remember, we just passed almost a trillion dollar package less than three weeks ago, King said. So we need to know where that stands in terms of execution, how much has been distributed, how much is left, to what extent the money that hasn't been expended has been accounted for in the new proposal."}

{"original": "But some do use it for themselves, and sometimes their partners, to sell financial products like refinancing a mortgage, which they get a commission for. Those companies that share the information also said that they ask for the consumer's consent before doing so."}

{"original": "A tax incentive for businesses that could bring some relief to more than 44 million Americans saddled with student debt has been included in the $2 trillion stimulus bill the Senate is expected to vote on Wednesday. The provision was originally part of a bill reported on by CBS News in May 2019."}
{"original": "It appears in the stimulus bill in Section 2206 and gives employers the ability to help employees pay off their student loans without being taxed, whether the payments are paid to the employer or to a lender, of principal or interest on any qualified education loan...incurred by the employee for education of the employee."}
{"original": "Currently, a company can contribute up to $5,250 tax-free each year for tuition assistance, helping workers who are attending classes while on the job. But no such tax break is in the IRS code to help workers who are paying off student loans on degrees they've already earned."}
{"original": "Senators John Thune and Mark Warner introduced the bipartisan original bill to allow companies the tax credit. The measure already had the support of companies like Starbucks, Verizon and Hewlett Packard, and first daughter Ivanka Trump also liked the plan. Dozens of senators and over 140 House members backed the till, but because it's so difficult getting bipartisan legislation passed in this partisan climate, the bill was a little stuck — until the widespread economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus opened a window for it. That the measure offers fast help to both Americans struggling with their bills and companies that are trying to stay afloat likely made it an easy sell for inclusion in the stimulus."}
{"original": "One thing worth noting here — this is a temporary program. It would have to be renewed after January 1, 2021 to provide more lasting relief. It is likely to become part of the massive tax extenders package that is usually passed at the end of the year and fattened with all sorts of special-interest tax breaks. Supporters say they hope to make the program permanent and will fight to do so in the coming year."}
{"original": "Faced with at least two lawsuits accusing it of selling defective merchandise, apparel seller LuLaRoe is making it easier for consumers to get refunds."}
{"original": "Under what LuLaRoe describes as its Make Good Program consumers who bought an item between Jan. 1, 2016, and April 24, 2017, and are displeased with the quality of their garments can get a full refund, credit or exchange. Starting April 25, under its Happiness Policy, customers can get a refund, credit or exchange for up to 30 days after their purchase and may get a credit or exchange within 90 days. Certain restrictions apply, and receipts are required."}
{"original": "Some people continue to have questions specifically about the quality of LuLaRoe leggings. We are sorry if we haven't adequately addressed their concerns. We hope these policies will, LuLaRoe CEO Mark Stidham said in a statement announcing the new refund and exchange policy. We want everyone to be happy and believe they received a fair value from their LuLaRoe clothing purchase."}
{"original": "The policy marks a change in tactics for the Corona, California-based multilevel marketing firm, known for colorful leggings. LulaRoe has repeatedly said its defective merchandise rate was below average for the apparel industry and insisted that its products get multiple quality assurance checks before going on sale."}
{"original": "Despite those assurances, many customers have complained on social media and elsewhere that its leggings are prone to rips and tears after only minimal use."}
{"original": "A private Facebook group with more than 26,000 members is chock full of posts from irate LuLaRoe customers. The two customers who started the group, Julie Dean of Boston and Suzanne Jones of Lafayette, California, are the lead plaintiffs in a March 23 federal lawsuit in California that accuses LuLaRoe of knowingly selling defective merchandise. A similar case was filed April 17 in state court in Oregon that accuses the company of unfair trade practices. Both cases are seeking class-action status."}
{"original": "Stidham, who co-founded LuLaRoe with his wife DeAnne in 2013, sounded less contrite in an interview with Business Insider, insisting that while he sympathized with customers who have experienced problems, he didn't think a blanket apology was necessary."}
{"original": "Christina Hinks, a former LuLaRoe consultant who's a fierce critic of the marketer, argued on her blog that Stidham appeared to be waffling about whether the company owed anyone an apology."}
{"original": "Generally speaking as a businessperson, it's commonplace to issue an apology to a customer or group of customers that have felt betrayed and improperly served by a company, Hicks said. No, not LuLaRoe."}
{"original": "LuLaRoe sales have reached $1.8 billion over the past year, making it one of the world's largest multilevel marketers, an industry that includes companies such as Amway, Herbalife (HLF) and Pampered Chef."}
{"original": "A spokesman for LuLaRoe said neither Mark nor DeAnne Stidham were available for comment."}
{"original": "Besides the product defect cases, LuLaRoe also faces a lawsuit alleging that it charged customers sales tax in states that don't collect the fees on sales of clothing. LuLaRoe also has been accused of infringing on a lion design created by a Hungarian artist. The company has denied wrongdoing in both cases."}
{"original": "Another suit, by a Utah payments processor Complete Merchant Services (CMS), accuses LuLaRoe of violating a contract that made CMS the exclusive supplier of credit and debit payments to LuLaRoe. CMS provided the point-of-sale system that LuLaRoe had blamed for wrongly collecting sales taxes in states that didn't charge it on clothing purchases."}
{"original": "Current and former consultants have also accused LuLaRoe of understating the risks and overstating the potential rewards available to consultants. To join LuLaRoe, representatives are required to order a minimum of $5,000 worth of product, which is high for the direct-sales industry."}
{"original": "According to internal LuLaRoe data provided to CBS MoneyWatch, more than 70 percent of LuLaRoe representatives sold less than $5,000 worth of retail goods in February."}
{"original": "Valerie Jarrett, friend and longtime adviser of former President Barack Obama, said Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg needs to do a lot more than just apologize for the controversial stop-and-frisk policy while he was mayor of New York. Jarrett also said it was very important for 2020 candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign to win in South Carolina if he hoped to stay competitive."}
{"original": "Appearing on CBS This Morning on Thursday, Jarrett revealed that she had recently joined a call between Bloomberg and African American business leaders. She said the business leaders confronted Bloomberg over stop-and-frisk, a controversy that had recently been dogging his campaign. Under the policy, hundreds of thousands of people were stopped and searched by police without warrants, with the city's black and Latino population disproportionately targeted and the vast majority released without arrest."}
{"original": "We were very concerned about the impact that had on so many black families right here in New York, she said. He apologized as he had done publicly, and he said look, he inherited it, it got way out of control on his watch, and then he reduced it dramatically."}
{"original": "Jarrett said she encouraged Bloomberg's campaign to go further. One of the things I recommended is, why don't you sit down with some of the families who were impacted by it? And look, even families who weren't impacted were worried about what would happen to their son, and so I think there's a lot more conversation to be had."}
{"original": "She added that Bloomberg should be making the case of what else he had done during his tenure as mayor, and what he could do for the country."}
{"original": "When asked about Biden's lackluster performance in Iowa and New Hampshire, Jarrett conceded that Biden's poor showing was a gut punch, but that the former frontrunner has dealt with adversity in his life before."}
{"original": "Jarrett and Biden had worked together for nearly a decade during Mr. Obama's presidency, and she used the example of Mr. Obama's 2008 loss in the New Hampshire primary as a case for campaigns rebounding from adversity."}
{"original": "Jarrett also shrugged off the idea that it was awkward both Bloomberg and Biden used the former president in their political ads, citing Mr. Obama's enduring popularity. She called it political malpractice to not use President Obama in your ads."}
{"original": "Jarrett also said that the numerous candidates vying for the nomination all have the same values. She challenged the notion that having different wings of the party made it hard for Democrats to unite, instead calling it a strength stemming from the party's diversity."}
{"original": "They believe every American should have healthcare - it should be a right, not a privilege. They all believe in a woman's right to choose. They all believe we should have a tax system that's fair to those not at the top end, that creates opportunity for every young person to go to college, she said. So if you look at the core values, there's barely any difference. The difference is between that field and President Trump."}
{"original": "Although Mike Bloomberg's politics may remain murky to many Americans, they can be sure of one thing: He would be by far the richest president in U.S. history."}
{"original": "The media mogul made an estimated $3.5 billion last year in income alone from Bloomberg LP, the financial data and news company he founded in 1981 to serve Wall Street banking and trading clients. That's more than 56,000 times the median annual U.S. household income of nearly $62,000 in 2018, the latest year the number is available."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg's estimated total net worth of $64 billion equals the total net worth of nearly 660,000 American households, based on the latest available median net worth of U.S. households, which was around $97,000 in 2016. (The average American household's net worth is much higher, but it's skewed upward by the super-rich, like, well, Mike Bloomberg.)"}
{"original": "By comparison, Bill Clinton won the White House with 1992 household income of roughly $270,000, or 12 times what the typical American household earned back then. George W. Bush made $1.3 million the year before he ran for president, or 39 times the median household income in 2000."}
{"original": "Barack Obama's income, propelled by earnings from two best-selling books by the time he became president, was 135 times the median household's when he became president. Bloomberg even far eclipses Donald Trump, whose financial filings show he earned more than 6,500 times the median household income in 2016."}
{"original": "Here's what we know about how much Bloomberg is worth and how he made it."}
{"original": "How much Mike Bloomberg is worth"}
{"original": "Forbes estimates Bloomberg's net worth at $64 billion and ranks him No. 8 on the publication's famed rich list."}
{"original": "But the Forbes figure is a little misleading. Much of Bloomberg's wealth is tied up in Bloomberg LP, in which he owns a commanding 88% stake. A December report from industry consulting firm Burton-Taylor estimated the financial media company is worth as much as $60 billion. That values Bloomberg's stake in his company at nearly $53 billion and suggests his more free-flowing wealth not tied to his company is a mere $11 billion or so."}
{"original": "That's still a lot of money, and more than enough to run a generously funded presidential campaign all on his own. But it also means that Bloomberg's spectacular wealth is largely dependent on Bloomberg LP retaining its value."}
{"original": "Bloomberg owns homes in Bermuda, London and New York, where he was mayor from 2002 to 2013. He has put much of his money into his nonprofit Bloomberg Family Foundation, which at the end of 2018 reported assets of just under $9 billion, according to a filing with the Internal Revenue Service."}
{"original": "Bloomberg's foundation reported donating $435 million in 2018 to dozens of organizations and local governments. In 2017, the last year for which the foundation filed a detailed list of donations, it gave $5.5 million to support education for low-income families in Washington, D.C., and $5 million to the gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety. It made numerous donations focused on battling climate change and reducing tobacco use, two favorite Bloomberg causes, but also for such diverse missions as $2 million to help improve driver safety in developing nations."}
{"original": "The board of the foundation includes former Wall Street chief executives Kenneth Chenault and John Mack, who headed American Express and Morgan Stanley, respectively. The foundation reported about $460 million in contributions in 2018, including $7 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The rest came from Bloomberg himself."}
{"original": "The Bloomberg foundation's latest available IRS filing shows that it earned $727 million in income from investments in 2018. It doesn't provide any more detail on how the foundation's assets were invested. The money is managed by Willett Advisors, which is headed by Steven Rattner, who was appointed by President Obama to oversee the auto bailout following the financial crisis."}
{"original": "How Mike Bloomberg made his money"}
{"original": "Bloomberg's career and wealth really took off after he was laid off from his job as head of systems development at the Wall Street bond-trading powerhouse Salomon Brothers in the early 1980s. He plowed his $10 million severance into a financial data company that Bloomberg eventually named after himself."}
{"original": "Bonds, unlike stocks, were traditionally traded from broker to broker instead of on centralized exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. That made getting information in the bond market tough even for traders."}
{"original": "Bloomberg, coming from Salomon, which dominated the bond market at the time, knew this. His company created computer terminals — originally boxy machines — reminiscent of early Apple home computers, that gave traders the ability to share bond prices directly with each other, as well as the tools and background information needed to price all types of bonds."}
{"original": "It was information that many bond traders had never had before and certainly not all in one place. Within a decade the so-called Bloomberg terminals, which cost each subscriber about $25,000 a year, were ubiquitous on Wall Street. Bloomberg's company added a news division in 1990, but the bulk of its revenue still comes from its terminals, which also offer stock market quotes, copious economic stats and even sports and general news."}
{"original": "As electronic trading has replaced phones on Wall Street, more and more bonds trade hands by way of messages over the terminals' chat function. At the end of 2018, Bloomberg had 330,500 subscribers."}
{"original": "The company's revenue rose an estimated 6% to $10.5 billion, according to the December Burton-Taylor report. How much of that money ends up as profit is a closely guarded secret, but Burton-Taylor estimates the company made $4 billion in operating earnings. As 88% owner, Mike Bloomberg would get about $3.5 billion of that."}
{"original": "This may be the best place to note that this reporter is a former employee of Bloomberg News. A number of former Bloomberg executives who were contacted for this article and declined to comment told CBS MoneyWatch they never saw a financial statement for the company that included its profits. But most everything at Bloomberg gives off the vibe that the company is incredibly profitable. Free food is abundant at all Bloomberg offices, for instance. A former manager of one of Bloomberg News's largest bureaus said top managers readily signed off on expense reports that topped $100,000 a year for several employees."}
{"original": "A few years ago, Douglas Taylor, who was the head of Burton-Taylor at the time and who had long followed Bloomberg LP's rise, got called into a meeting at the company. He had recently put out a report saying that about 30% of Bloomberg's revenue ends up as profits. That's about three times the average profit margin of companies in the S&P 500."}
{"original": "But in the meeting, the Bloomberg executives told Taylor he was wrong. The company's profit margin was closer to 40%."}
{"original": "Bloomberg's success comes from its focus on market data for Wall Street, Taylor told CBS MoneyWatch. The company wandered a bit a few years ago, but when [Mike] Bloomberg returned from being mayor he refocused the business on the terminal."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg's deep pockets, and his seemingly unlimited campaign budget, has helped power his surge in the race for the Democratic nomination. But it could also become a liability. The biggest problem may be how much of his wealth comes from one industry — an industry that doesn't have a great reputation with the average American."}
{"original": "Burton-Taylor estimates that about 75% of the company's revenue comes from companies in the financial sector. Government agencies, including foreign ones, are some of Bloomberg's other customers. Advertisers make up much of the rest, touting their luxury goods and services for wealthy financial services workers."}
{"original": "This week, Bloomberg pledged that as president he would push for a tax on financial transactions. He has also proposed a wealth tax. He even said he would consider selling his company through a blind trust."}
{"original": "Such proposals could help deflect accusations that he is too cozy with Wall Street. But it remains to be seen whether a billionaire whose company is still very much tied to the fortunes of Wall Street can win over Main Street."}
{"original": "Rookie lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is making a splash in Congress by championing everything from sharply higher taxes on the rich to immigrant rights. But arguably her biggest challenge -- one that could conceivably affect every American -- is to breathe life in Washington for the Green New Deal."}
{"original": "The initiative's audacious goal: Convert the entire U.S. economy to renewable energy within 12 years, while also sparking a massive burst of job-creation and technological innovation. Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey, D.-Mass., are introducing their plan on Thursday, with Ocasio-Cortez telling NPR that a larger solution is needed to deal with the challenges of climate change."}
{"original": "The plan, outlined in a non-binding resolution posted via NPR, is meant to provide a framework for the initiative. A non-binding resolution doesn't constitute a formal legislative proposal, but rather signals a lawmaker's intent."}
{"original": "Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us, Ocasio-Cortez told NPR Thursday."}
{"original": "Here's a look at what the proposal consists of:"}
{"original": "The push comes just as a new annual federal climate report concludes that the last five years have been the hottest on record, with scientists linking that trend to the surge in human-related greenhouse gases. According to the non-binding resolution, initiatives include:"}
{"original": "Net-zero greenhouse gas emissions via a fair and just transition for communities and workers"}
{"original": "Creation of millions of good, high-wage jobs"}
{"original": "Prevention and repair of historic oppression to frontline and vulnerable communities"}
{"original": "A goal for 100 percent renewable energy in the U.S."}
{"original": "Clean air and water, climate resiliency, healthy food, access to nature, and a sustainable environment for all for generations to come"}
{"original": "Investments in buildings to make them more energy efficient"}
{"original": "Eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible"}
{"original": "The proposal's name deliberately echoes President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the label for a sweeping group of federal programs enacted in the 1930s to end the Great Depression. In the Green New Deal's case, proponents are outlining a group of policies to shift the U.S. economy toward mitigating climate change and its impact."}
{"original": "The Sierra Club, a major supporter, puts it this way: A Green New Deal is not a single law, but a suite of economic policies to deliver better job opportunities, less climate pollution, cleaner air and water, and more resilient communities."}
{"original": "Progressive activists are hoping that support for the ambitious deal will become a litmus test of sorts for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who's mulling a presidential bid, said the issue should be an integral part of his party's agenda going forward."}
{"original": "On CBSN's Red and Blue, Merkley outlined what he believes should be the key components of a comprehensive Green New Deal."}
{"original": "The core objectives are some things such as let's drive a fast transition from fossil fuel, carbon transmission-creating energy sources to renewable energy so that we save our planet. Second principal is: Let's create tens of millions of jobs as we renovate our energy economy, he said Tuesday. A third principal: A just transition for fossil fuel workers so that no one is left behind and so we show respect and gratitude for all the work they've done to power economy is the decades past."}
{"original": "The short answer to 'how we will pay for' the Green New Deal is easy, Robert Hockett, a Cornell public policy and law professor and adviser to Ocasio-Cortez, wrote in a piece for Forbes last month. We'll pay for it just as we pay for all else: Congress will authorize necessary spending, and Treasury will spend. This is how we do it -- always has been, always will be."}
{"original": "Critics point to estimates of the cost of converting to 100 percent renewable energy reaching into the trillions. So far, Ocasio-Cortez has only floated ideas for how to pay for it -- including a fee or tax on carbon emissions and her idea for a marginal tax rate of 70 percent on earnings of more than $10 million for wealthy Americans, a proposal she outlined for CBS's 60 Minutes last month."}
{"original": "The idea for the Green New Deal has multiple sources, including environmentalists and scientists looking for ways to combat climate change. Ocasio-Cortez championed the concept, vaulting the phrase Green New Deal into headlines and news broadcasts during her campaign and since the 2018 elections."}
{"original": "Mother Nature has awakened so many Americans to the urgent threat of the climate crisis, and this proposal responds to the growing concern and demand for action, former Vice President Al Gore, now an environmental activist, said in a statement on Thursday."}
{"original": "A December poll of registered voters conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University showed 92 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans support the idea. And many Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls have reportedly signed on to the idea, according to Axios."}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez and Markey are drumming up support as they draft specifics for legislation. It's happening, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted after Axios reported some details of her memo seeking support from colleagues."}
{"original": "As a member of the House in 2009, Markey was the lead author of the American Clean Energy and Security Act, which sought to address climate change issues. It included a renewable energy standard and a carbon cap-and-trade system. It passed the House but never made it out of the Senate."}
{"original": "The lawmaker brought Varshini Prakash as his guest to President Donald Trump's the State of the Union address on Tuesday. Prakash is executive director and co-founder of Sunrise, a group dedicated to ending climate change that's currently holding livestream events to support the Green New Deal."}
{"original": "Markey's office is now working on companion Green New Deal legislation for the Senate to Ocasio-Cortez's House plan, though that's not yet finalized, according to a recent report from the Boston Globe."}
{"original": "President Trump released a farewell address on Tuesday in his final full day in office as he attempts to cement his legacy, after the assault on the Capitol that followed weeks of his false claims about the election and after he became the first president in history to be impeached twice. Mr. Trump is scheduled to depart the White House at 8 a.m. on Wednesday."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump's recorded address touched on themes his administration and campaigns have pushed from the beginning, including American greatness and reaching the forgotten man and woman. The outgoing president tried to make the case that he's kept his promises."}
{"original": "We did what we came here to do, and so much more, Mr. Trump said."}
{"original": "The president did acknowledge the new administration taking over the White House, but did not mention President-elect Joe Biden by name. He has yet to call Mr. Biden the president-elect."}
{"original": "This week we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck — a very important word, Mr. Trump said in a speech that was clearly scripted but with small insertions of Trump flair."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump thanked his family, the Pences, his chief of staff Mark Meadows, the Secret Service and law enforcement."}
{"original": "Most of all, I want to thank the American people, Mr. Trump said. To serve as your president has been an honor beyond description."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump said it never failed to move him when Americans flocked to wave at his motorcade, not just to see him but out of honor for the country."}
{"original": "The president did mention the violent attack on the nation's Capitol, even as he has denied that his rhetoric was remotely responsible for it."}
{"original": "All Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated, the president said in his address."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump reminisced on his policy agenda items, from withdrawing from the Paris climate accord to replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement, to increasing the child tax credit. He also touted his foreign policy, saying he's especially proud to be the first president in decades to start no new wars."}
{"original": "I did not seek the easiest course. By far, it was actually the most difficult, Mr. Trump said, claiming he sought the tough path for the American people."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump is bucking the tradition of attending his successor's inauguration, instead leaving the White House Wednesday morning for a farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews. The White House sent out invitations for an 8 a.m. ceremony."}
{"original": "Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration, at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There's never been anything like it, Mr. Trump said in his address. I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country, and for our children, the best is yet to come."}
{"original": "The Social Security system's costs will exceed its income this year, the first time that has happened since 1982."}
{"original": "Plenty of workers may take this development with a grain of salt because of the widespread belief that they'll never see a Social Security check in their lifetime. More than half of working Americans don't think they'll receive a benefit when they retire, according to a Gallup poll in 2015."}
{"original": "Yet that common belief -- that Social Security won't be around when today's workers retire -- is far from the truth, and it could very well undermine the political will to fix a system that currently supports 67 million Americans. The report from the program's trustees on Tuesday underscore that lawmakers need to act now to stabilize and expand the program, said Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, at a Thursday hearing to discuss the development."}
{"original": "We need to act, Johnson said. Workers and their families need the certainty that we've gotten Social Security on the right track."}
{"original": "Lawmakers have taken steps to shore up Social Security in past decades. In 1983, a bipartisan effort stabilized the program by gradually raising the full retirement age to 67 and requiring government employees to pay into Social Security, a first."}
{"original": "Lawmakers say new fixes are now needed, especially as a major demographic shift is underway. About 10,000 baby boomers each day are claiming Social Security for the first time, while many millennials are so far opting to sit out on parenthood, leading to a 30-year low in U.S. births."}
{"original": "It's largely about the demographics, said Stephen C. Goss, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, at the hearing. It's like the tide is inevitable."}
{"original": "Those demographic shifts may be impossible to change, but Social Security is not. Here are five misperceptions many Americans hold about the program."}
{"original": "A trust fund holds my Social Security investments"}
{"original": "The Social Security Administration refers to the program as operating two trust funds, one for disability and one for the Social Security pension program. Yet they aren't trust funds in the traditional sense, meaning money socked away in an account that's dedicated to your personal investments."}
{"original": "The term creates much unintended confusion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities."}
{"original": "In fact, the Social Security trust fund operates more like an accounting ledger, according to the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation. The Treasury estimates its tax receipts, then credits that amount to the Social Security trust fund. Next, it subtracts the money paid in monthly Social Security benefits from the balance of the trust fund. No money actually changes hands, it noted. Remaining funds are then invested in special Treasurys."}
{"original": "It will be bankrupt by the time I retire"}
{"original": "That's simply untrue. While the program faces a funding shortfall by 2034, it isn't going broke."}
{"original": "One key issue is the Social Security reserves, which the program will dip into this year because its payments will outstrip its income. That $2.9 trillion surplus is on hand to fund benefits in case of situations like the one facing the program this year. The reason lawmakers are concerned is that the reserves will be depleted by 2034 for the Social Security program and 2032 for disability -- if nothing changes."}
{"original": "That will leave the program unable to pay full Social Security benefits."}
{"original": "Today's workers won't receive any benefits"}
{"original": "That's a commonly voiced fear, but it's far from the truth. If nothing is changed and the Social Security reserves run out by 2034, the program will still be able to pay three-quarters of its benefits."}
{"original": "Granted, that's harmful to seniors, especially for the millions of Americans who rely on Social Security as their primary source of income. But Social Security will still be paying out benefits for today's workers at least through 2092, which is as far as the Social Security administration has forecasted its operations."}
{"original": "It's impossible to fix Social Security"}
{"original": "Actually, there are plenty of ideas for how to fix it."}
{"original": "They include raising the income cap on which workers pay Social Security tax, currently $128,400, or raising the tax rate that workers currently pay."}
{"original": "The latter could cost you 50 cents a week, and would help replenish the Social Security reserves, said Rep. John Larson, D-Connecticut, at the hearing. Larson's proposal would boost the contribution rate gradually from 6.2 percent to 7.4 percent by 2042. He also proposes boosting the payroll tax to wages higher than $400,000."}
{"original": "The government dips into Social Security to fund other programs"}
{"original": "Not true. Washington doesn't raid the Social Security program to spend on pork-barrel projects or if it's running low."}
{"original": "Instead, as CBS MoneyWatch columnist Steve Vernon explains, the reserves are invested in special U.S. Treasurys and become part of the government's overall funding. Other investors are also buying U.S. Treasurys, of course. The government mingles the proceeds from those bonds with other revenue, including the Social Security's special bonds."}
{"original": "Here's another way to think of it: When you buy newly issued stock from a company, the business then invests that money across its operations. The special Treasurys Social Security buys are legally obligated to pay the stated market interest rate and to prepay the principal at maturity."}
{"original": "The Supreme Court on Monday cleared another hurdle in the Manhattan district attorney's long quest to obtain former President Donald Trump's tax records, rejecting a last-ditch attempt by the former president to shield his financial records from prosecutors."}
{"original": "The court denied Mr. Trump's request to issue a stay on lower-court rulings in an unsigned order with no noted dissents, meaning the justices will not hear arguments for the second time in the case. The Supreme Court ruled in July that the subpoena of the Republican president's records was constitutional, but their release was held up by an appeal arguing the subpoena is a bad faith overreach borne from political animus."}
{"original": "The order clears the way for a New York grand jury to obtain Mr. Trump's tax records."}
{"original": "Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, first began investigating Mr. Trump in 2018, and initially targeted hush-money payments made during the Republican's 2016 campaign to adult film star Stormy Daniels by former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. Vance's office has since indicated in court filings that the investigation has widened to look at possible crimes as wide-ranging as fraud and tax evasion."}
{"original": "Vance issued a one-line statement in response to the Supreme Court's move, saying, The work continues. His office indicated in a September court filing that it would move to enforce a previously issued subpoena of Mr. Trump's accounting firm if the Supreme Court denied the former president's request."}
{"original": "In a statement to media outlets, Mr. Trump accused prosecutors of pursuing the investigation for political reasons."}
{"original": "The Supreme Court never should have let this 'fishing expedition' happen, but they did. This is something which has never happened to a President before, Trump said."}
{"original": "Beth More, spokesperson for Mazars USA LLP, an accounting firm subpoenaed in the case, said the company cannot discuss matters related to individual clients. More would not say if the Manhattan district attorney contacted Mazars Monday after the Supreme Court issued its order."}
{"original": "We are aware of the Supreme Court's order. As we have maintained throughout this process, Mazars remains committed to fulfilling all of our professional and legal obligations, More said."}
{"original": "Vance's investigation is one of two known criminal probes focused on Mr. Trump. On February 10, the District Attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, launched an election fraud and racketeering investigation into Mr. Trump's attempts to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia."}
{"original": "On February 3, Vance's office swore in as a special assistant district attorney Mark Pomerantz, a former federal prosecutor with deep experience in complex financial and organized crime cases, according to Danny Frost, a spokesperson for the office. Pomerantz is working solely on the Trump case."}
{"original": "Filings by Vance's office in Mr. Trump's appeal indicate that prosecutors are examining wide disparities in how Mr. Trump's company valued properties in its portfolio. For instance, prosecutors wrote in September that in the past decade, Mr. Trump's valuation of the Seven Springs estate in suburban New York ranged from between $25 million and $50 million, to between $261 and $291 million."}
{"original": "Subpoenas in the probe suggest the investigation is scrutinizing the expansive 200-acre property that straddles the affluent New York towns of Bedford, New Castle and North Castle. Ralph Mastromonaco, an engineer who worked on the Seven Springs estate property for Mr. Trump, told CBS News on February 11 that he recently received subpoenas for his work. Mastromonaco said he quickly complied, turning over maps of the 200-acre property, and other documents he produced for the Trump Organization nearly a decade ago."}
{"original": "Mastromonaco's subpoena came weeks after Manhattan investigators sent a subpoena to the town clerk of Bedford. The grand jury subpoena, which was obtained by CBS News, requests documents related to Seven Springs valuations and tax assessments, tax appeals, and conservation easements."}
{"original": "Vance's office has not said why it is interested in the Bedford and Mastromonaco documents."}
{"original": "Scott Walker didn't want to go out like this."}
{"original": "The once-rising Republican star who made his name kneecapping public sector unions as governor of Wisconsin leaves office in defeat Monday. He was narrowly beaten by Democrat Tony Evers, the state education superintendent who marched with teachers in protest of Walker's policies."}
{"original": "After watching Evers take the oath to replace him, the 51-year-old Walker will depart the governor's mansion and face life outside of elected office for the first time in 25 years. Walker said that in the days since the loss, his most fervent supporters have approached him, some in tears, concerned about what he's going through."}
{"original": "It's almost like it was after my dad passed where they expect you to be a wreck and you're like, 'We're going to be OK, you're going to be OK, the state's going to be OK,' Walker told The Associated Press. We're going to be just fine going forward."}
{"original": "Just eight years ago, the college dropout rose to the highest elected office in Wisconsin. Two years later, following massive protests over his bill going after public sector unions, he became the first governor in U.S. history to defeat a recall election."}
{"original": "But Walker wanted more. He wanted to be president of the United States."}
{"original": "Running on the promise to do for the country what he did for Wisconsin, Walker was an early leader in neighboring Iowa. But after a series of missteps, his hopes and fundraising plummeted when Donald Trump got in the race."}
{"original": "Walker came home and refocused on winning a third term as governor. Instead, voters decided eight years was enough."}
{"original": "Walker, suffering defeat for the first time since a 1990 run for state Assembly, plans to hit the road as a speaker advocating for conservative issues, positioning himself as Trump's biggest booster in Wisconsin. Trump narrowly carried the state in 2016 and it will likely be a key part of any roadmap to victory in 2020."}
{"original": "Walker also won't rule out a future run for U.S. Senate or even governor again in 2022 , although he acknowledged that Republicans would probably want a new face."}
{"original": "Regardless of what Walker does next, he leaves the governor's office having fundamentally altered the state."}
{"original": "Governor Walker devolved power away from Madison and public sector unions, giving local governments the ability to balance their budgets and Wisconsin businesses the ability to grow and create better opportunities, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said in an email. He leaves office with the tax burden at a 50-year low and unemployment near record lows, and every employer I talk to tells me there are more jobs available than there are people to fill them."}
{"original": "To his critics, Walker divided and deeply scarred Wisconsin."}
{"original": "Scott Walker is without a question the most significant governor of Wisconsin in modern times, said Democratic strategist and former state party chairman Mike Tate. His legacy will be of a governor that actively sought and succeeded in dividing Wisconsin by race, class, geography, and station in life; pitting citizens against each other in a brazen effort to further his own political ambition and reward his donors. His conduct and that of those like him laid the groundwork for the modern Republican Party led by Donald Trump."}
{"original": "Walker signed into law a litany of Republican priorities. His boldest and most disputed move came right out of the gate, when he effectively eliminated public sector collective bargaining while forcing state workers to pay more for health care and pension benefits to help solve a budget shortfall."}
{"original": "The fight over that brought protests as large as 100,000 people and made Walker a national conservative star. His profile only grew when he defeated the 2012 recall effort."}
{"original": "Other Walker achievements are long and far-reaching."}
{"original": "They include making Wisconsin a right-to-work state and requiring a photo ID to vote. He tightened restrictions on abortions, loosened limits on gun purchases and worked with Trump to land a Foxconn Technology Group factory and campus that could result in up to 13,000 new jobs and a $10 billion investment."}
{"original": "Critics say Foxconn won't deliver on its promises and that the $3 billion Walker pledged to the company was too much."}
{"original": "There were failures and distractions along the way. Walker didn't deliver on his signature 2010 campaign promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term. He faced investigations, first into aides and political allies from his time as Milwaukee County executive, then into his recall campaign. While the first probe resulted in six people being charged with a variety of crimes, the conservative-dominated state Supreme Court ended the second one determining that Walker's campaign had done nothing wrong."}
{"original": "Just three weeks before leaving office, Walker signed Republican legislation weakening the powers of his successor as well as the incoming Democratic attorney general."}
{"original": "He brushed off bipartisan warnings that he was staining his legacy, saying he will be remembered for other things. He pointed to a fresh deal to save nearly 400 jobs at a Kimberly-Clark Corp. plant near Appleton. He tweeted about having eliminated the state property tax, landing the Foxconn project and increasing services for veterans."}
{"original": "But to his detractors, Walker was leaving office just as he came in: bowing to his most partisan interests and worsening the state's partisan divide."}
{"original": "Through it all, Walker stands by his record."}
{"original": "I hope, over time, people could see that our interests, our motivations were earnest and we were trying to do the best that we could for the people of the state of Wisconsin, Walker said. People don't have to necessarily agree with it to respect it, and I hope people would respect that over time."}
{"original": "Washington — Judge Merrick Garland, President Biden's nominee for attorney general, will sit before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing on Monday. In his opening statement, Garland says he will make civil rights, confronting extremist attacks, and upholding the independence of the Department of Justice some of his top priorities."}
{"original": "If I am confirmed, serving as Attorney General will be the culmination of a career I have dedicated to ensuring that the laws of our country are fairly and faithfully enforced, and that the rights of all Americans are protected, Garland will say, according to prepared remarks that were released Saturday."}
{"original": "After demonstrations protesting the deaths of African Americans at the hands of police and systemic racial injustice swept across the country last year, Garland will make clear the role the department plays in addressing civil rights matters, acknowledging we do not yet have equal justice."}
{"original": "Communities of color and other minorities still face discrimination in housing, education, employment, and the criminal justice system; and bear the brunt of the harm caused by pandemic, pollution, and climate change, Garland's statement says."}
{"original": "Monday's hearing comes five years after Senate Republicans blocked Garland's Supreme Court nomination without even granting him a confirmation hearing. Garland was nominated by former President Barack Obama to fill the seat previously occupied by the late-Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016."}
{"original": "As the nation's top law enforcement officer, Garland will inherit the ongoing investigations into the rioters who took part in the Capitol insurrection on January 6. News of Mr. Biden's intention to nominate Garland broke on the same day as the deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol."}
{"original": "Garland is no stranger to extremist violence. He is known for earlier work at the Justice Department, where he oversaw the prosecution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and lone wolf bomber Ted Kaczynski, widely known as the Unabomber."}
{"original": "150 years after the department's founding, battling extremist attacks on our democratic institutions also remains central to its mission, Garland's remarks say. If confirmed, I will supervise the prosecution of white supremacists and others who stormed the Capitol on January 6 — a heinous attack that sought to disrupt a cornerstone of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power to a newly elected government."}
{"original": "At an event held the day after the Capitol riot to announce the nomination, Mr. Biden addressed Garland and other nominees for top Justice Department positions, saying, You won't work for me. You are not the president or the vice president's lawyer."}
{"original": "Your loyalty is not to me. It's to the law, the Constitution, the people of this nation to guarantee justice, Mr. Biden added."}
{"original": "Garland will also oversee several ongoing politically sensitive investigations, such as the one looking into the tax affairs of Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, as well as Special Counsel John Durham's probe into the origins of the 2016 Russia investigation."}
{"original": "However, in his prepared remarks, Garland makes clear that as attorney general, his job will be to uphold the rule of law, and do so by reaffirming... norms."}
{"original": "Garland will highlight the importance of existing policies that protect the independence of the department from partisan influence in law enforcement investigations and strictly regulate communications with the White House."}
{"original": "Several Senate Judiciary Republicans said Wednesday they would press Garland during his confirmation hearing to commit to investigating COVID-19 nursing home deaths, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's controversial reporting of nursing home death totals in his state."}
{"original": "Garland's hearing is scheduled to take place Monday and Tuesday, and the committee will vote on whether to advance his nomination to the Senate floor on March 1."}
{"original": "On Friday, letters of support for his nomination were submitted to the committee from a bipartisan group of officials. The group included 61 former federal judges, as well as over 150 former U.S. attorneys and senior DOJ officials, including former Attorneys General Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch and Michael Mukasey."}
{"original": "Judge Garland has dedicated much of his life to the American justice system, the letter read. And we can unequivocally state that Judge Garland is the right person to ensure that the rule of law remains, in our national consciousness, one of our most deeply-held values."}
{"original": "Garland was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1997 by former President Bill Clinton and served as chief judge for seven years. Before he was a judge, he served within the ranks at the Justice Department as an assistant U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., deputy assistant attorney general for the criminal division, and as principal associate deputy attorney general. He graduated from Harvard College summa cum laude in 1974 and Harvard Law School magna cum laude in 1977."}
{"original": "U.S. consumer confidence tumbled this month to its lowest reading in a year and a half, tested by the partial government shutdown and roiling financial markets. Still, consumer spirits remain robust by historic standards."}
{"original": "The Conference Board, a business research group, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell to 120.2 in January, down from 126.6 in December and the lowest level since July 2017."}
{"original": "The index measures consumers' assessment of current economic conditions and their expectations for the next six months, both of which dropped in January. Consumers' expectations for the future dropped to the lowest point since October 2016."}
{"original": "The month before, the index dropped 9.8 points, making for the biggest two-month loss in over a decade, Oxford Economics noted. If history is any guide, this will partially reverse, the research firm wrote."}
{"original": "The government reopened Monday after the 35-day shutdown, the longest federal closure in U.S. history. The shutdown is expected to cause slight permanent harm to the economy — about $3 billion in lost economic activity — according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office on Monday."}
{"original": "The January decline is more the result of a temporary shock than a precursor to a significant slowdown in the coming months, said Lynn Franco, the Conference Board's senior director of economic indicators. He noted that shock events such as government shutdowns tend to have sharp, but temporary, impacts on consumer confidence."}
{"original": "Moody's Investors Service predicted that the shutdown would have a limited impact on U.S. GDP. But if the government shuts down again in three weeks, which President Donald Trump has threatened, the economic hit could be more severe."}
{"original": "Looking forward, although the government shutdown has ended, the temporary nature of the three-week funding agreement and the continued impasse on border security mean that uncertainty and political gridlock will persist for some time, continuing to weigh on consumer confidence, David Deull, principal economist at IHS Markit, said in a note."}
{"original": "The U.S. economy is healthy. Economic growth clocked in at a brisk 3.4 percent annual pace from July through September after surging 4.2 percent in the second quarter. At 3.9 percent, the unemployment rate is near its lowest level in five decades."}
{"original": "The U.S. stock market is steadier after its wild gyrations and heavy losses late last year. Still, investors have a lot to worry about. The Federal Reserve has gradually been raising interest rates. A government report issued Monday predicts that U.S. economic growth will slow as the effects of President Donald Trump's tax cuts for businesses begin to drop off. The Congressional Budget Office report sees the economy growing by 2.3 percent this year, a marked slowdown from 3.1 percent in 2018."}
{"original": "Global growth is sputtering. And the U.S. and China — the world's two biggest economies — are locked in a trade war that threatens to disrupt global commerce."}
{"original": "Washington — The group of 10 Republican senators seeking to negotiate with President Biden on a new round of COVID-19 relief unveiled details of their proposal on Monday, hours before the lawmakers are set to meet with the president at the White House."}
{"original": "The proposal by the group, led by Senator Susan Collins of Maine, totals roughly $618 billion, or about a third of the size of the $1.9 trillion plan put forward by the president and Democratic leaders in Congress. The counteroffer from the group comes as congressional Democrats are preparing to move forward with the administration's proposed plan, with or without GOP support."}
{"original": "Mr. President, we recognize your calls for unity and want to work in good faith with your Administration to meet the health, economic, and societal challenges of the COVID crisis, the senators said in a joint statement. We look forward to discussing our proposal in detail with you this afternoon at the White House."}
{"original": "The GOP plan calls for another round of stimulus checks paid directly to taxpayers, but would cap the income level of those who are eligible to receive them at a lower level than previous rounds of aid. Individuals making less than $40,000 would receive $1,000, with the amount tapering off for those making between $40,000 and $50,000."}
{"original": "Couples filing jointly would receive double that amount, with the amount tapering off for those making more than $80,000, up to $100,000. An additional $500 would be provided for every dependent child and adult. Previous rounds of direct payments were based on income reported on 2019 tax returns. Mr. Biden's plan calls for $1,400 checks for most low- and middle-income earners."}
{"original": "The proposal would also extend expanded federal unemployment insurance to $300 per week through June 30, on top of state benefits. Mr. Biden has sought an extension of unemployment aid of $400 per week through September."}
{"original": "The plan includes $160 billion for a national vaccine program, personal protective equipment production and expanded testing, as well as a $40 billion injection into the Paycheck Protection Program to provide loans to small businesses. It would also allocate $20 billion in an initiative to get children back to school, and extend expanded SNAP benefits through September at a cost of $3 billion."}
{"original": "The GOP proposal does not include any funds allocated for state and local governments, and does not mention increasing the federal minimum wage, both key priorities in the administration's package."}
{"original": "The senators who have signed onto the proposal include Collins, Rob Portman of Ohio, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Todd Young of Indiana, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Thom Tillis of North Carolina."}
{"original": "Mr. Biden is planning to meet with the group on Monday to discuss the proposal and his administration's plan. The White House said the president is open to a full exchange of ideas."}
{"original": "Bernie Sanders may have apologized to Joe Biden for an op-ed a surrogate wrote calling Biden corrupt, but the two are continuing to argue over their records on Social Security. Late Tuesday night, Sanders tweeted, Let's be honest, Joe. One of us fought for decades to cut Social Security, and one of us didn't. But don't take it from me. Take it from you."}
{"original": "He attached a video clip of then-Senator Biden on the Senate floor from 1995 making this statement:"}
{"original": "When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans' benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once — I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time."}
{"original": "The video Sanders tweeted seemed to come in response to a video released by the Biden campaign earlier in the evening, which argued that the former vice president has always looked to protect social security. The video also took direct aim at Sanders, saying that he had dishonestly misrepresented Biden's record."}
{"original": "Biden tweeted Tuesday night, I've been fighting to protect — and expand — Social Security for my whole career. Any suggestion otherwise is just flat-out wrong. The tweet was accompanied by a video defending Biden, with op-ed headlines accusing Sanders of negative and dishonest attacks against Biden. Bernie's campaign is not telling the truth, the video says, concluding, Bernie's negative attacks won't change the truth: Joe Biden is still the strongest Democrat to beat Donald Trump."}
{"original": "Appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe from Iowa Wednesday, Biden said he accepted Sanders' apology for calling him corrupt. Biden said of Sanders' comments about his record on Social Security that at a minimum, it was taken out of context and insisted he has always been a significant supporter of Social Security."}
{"original": "After the appearance, CBS News' Ed O'Keefe asked Biden why he said he had accepted Sanders' apology but continued to attack him. Biden turned around and mocked the question, Why why why why why, he asked, tapping O'Keefe on the lapels, then smoothing them, he told O'Keefe, You're getting nervous, man! Calm down! It's ok."}
{"original": "Biden then added, He apologized for saying that I was corrupt. He didn't say anything about whether I was telling the truth or not about Social Security."}
{"original": "In 1995, Bill Clinton was president and trying to balance the federal budget. It was a time when a number of politicians — Republicans, along with centrist Democrats — thought it would be prudent to cut the nation's spending and secure the future of entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. At the time, Biden was among the deficit hawks who agreed with that approach."}
{"original": "Now, even though Social Security's insolvency may be looming — it could only be able to pay 80% of the benefits due by 2035 — few politicians care to reckon with what they view as the toxic politics of tweaking entitlement spending. Medicare is in worse shape, staring at possible insolvency by 2026."}
{"original": "Biden is now pledging that he won't cut Social Security or Medicare if he's elected and in fact, he'd even increase benefits for some. According to his campaign website, Biden would provide a bigger benefit for the oldest Americans. Workers who spent 30 years of working would receive a benefit of at least 125% of the poverty level."}
{"original": "Despite the increasingly shaky status of Social Security's medium-term prospects, Sanders and Elizabeth Warren want to increase benefits for workers. Both have said they'd collect more taxes from the wealthy to pay for their expansion, raising the caps on payroll tax income that's subject to Social Security taxes."}
{"original": "The newly-tweeted video wasn't the first time in recent days that Sanders and his team have critiqued Biden's past remarks on Social Security funding. A few days ago, the Sanders campaign was pointing out a 2012 video that takes a Biden remark out of context and appears to show him agreeing with former Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan about privatizing the program. It didn't show the part of the footage that makes it clear that Biden was being sarcastic."}
{"original": "He accused the Sanders campaign of releasing doctored footage and asked Sanders to apologize."}
{"original": "On Sunday, Sanders told CBS News: [Joe] is a decent person. He is a friend of mine. People like him. And we're not going to make personal attacks on Joe Biden but I think the record shows that Joe's history in the Senate and my history in Congress are very different."}

{"original": "Kansas City, Mo. — Tax-filing season officially begins next Monday. The Trump administration has ordered thousands of furloughed IRS employees back to work without pay to process returns, but hundreds are defying that order."}
{"original": "Shannon Ellis said she can no longer afford to go to work."}
{"original": "It's too expensive to put gasoline in. We just don't drive a lot, she said."}
{"original": "As an IRS customer service representative, Ellis is one of the 800,000 federal workers furloughed without pay by the shutdown. She is among 36,000 from the IRS who the White House ordered back to their desks without pay last week."}
{"original": "But Ellis declined, citing a union contract provision which allows her to miss work if it would be a hardship to show up. Not getting paid for her work qualifies."}
{"original": "Ellis estimates 60 percent of her colleagues at the Kansas City office are taking advantage of the hardship exemption. That's a problem with the tax filing season almost upon us."}
{"original": "At this point, I mean, I'm hoping there's enough employees to do the job. Our employees don't have the money to go to work. Period, she said."}
{"original": "Along with the IRS, the Transportation Security Agency is experiencing increased sick-outs. The same goes for meat inspectors at Department of Agriculture and guards at federal prisons."}
{"original": "The shutdown hits the lower paid workers at the IRS who process tax refunds the hardest. Some make $12 an hour and they'll miss a second paycheck Monday unless the government reopens."}
{"original": "Now the fate of Americans' tax refunds is up in the air. As the president of her union local, Ellis said she gets dozens of calls a day from worried IRS workers, including one of whom who attempted suicide."}
{"original": "Washington — The Senate will begin debate over President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package on Friday morning, kicking off a flurry of activity aimed at getting a final bill to the president's desk before several key relief programs expire on March 14. The 628-page bill enjoys support from all 50 Senate Democrats, but Republicans are aiming to make its passage as difficult as possible by forcing votes on a dozens of amendments in a grueling process that could extend into the weekend."}
{"original": "The so-called vote-a-rama will serve as a test of the ability of newly minted Senate Majority Chuck Schumer to keep his caucus in line."}
{"original": "A vote on the motion to proceed to 20 hours of debate succeeded in a party-line vote on Thursday afternoon, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the 50-50 tie. Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska who had said she is undecided about whether she will vote for final passage, voted against moving forward with debate."}
{"original": "GOP Senator Ron Johnson immediately asked the Senate clerk to read the entire bill aloud, a process that took almost eleven hours and had to be completed before the debate could begin. The Senate adjourned shortly after 2 a.m. Friday, and is scheduled to reconvene later in the morning."}
{"original": "We all know this will merely delay the inevitable. It will accomplish little more than a few sore throats for the Senate clerks who work very hard day in, day out to help the Senate function, Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday, before the bill was read. We Democrats want America to hear what's in the plan. And if the senator from Wisconsin wants to read it, let everybody listen, because it has overwhelming support."}
{"original": "The bill is broadly popular, with recent polling showing that a majority of Americans support it, particularly the provision that provides $1,400 in direct checks to earners making under $75,000."}
{"original": "The Senate is going to move forward with the bill. No matter how long it takes, the Senate is going to stay in session to finish the bill this week. The American people deserve nothing less, Schumer said."}
{"original": "Both parties will have up to 10 hours each to debate the bill, although it is unclear whether all 20 hours will be necessary."}
{"original": "The House passed a version of the bill last week, but the measure considered by the Senate is slightly different. Democrats were still finalizing the bill shortly before the vote to begin debate on Thursday afternoon."}
{"original": "Some recently added measures, according to a Senate Democratic aide, include $510 million for FEMA and $750 million for states and communities impacted by job and revenue loss in the tourism, travel and outdoor recreation sectors. Another provision sets aside funding for education, including $1.25 billion for evidence-based summer enrichment, $1.25 billion for after school programs and $3 billion for education technology. It would also make COVID-19 student loan relief tax-free."}
{"original": "Congress is using the budget reconciliation process to pass the bill, which limits time for debate and allows legislation to pass with a simple majority, a workaround that avoids the 60-vote threshold that most bills require to advance in the Senate. If every Democrat supports the final bill, with Harris casting a tie-breaking vote, it would pass without any Republican support."}
{"original": "But Republicans are critical of the size of the bill and frustrated that Democrats are using the reconciliation process, arguing that they are taking a partisan route rather than working across the aisle. Democrats reply that they don't need to waste time negotiating with Republicans to reach the 60-vote threshold and pass a smaller package."}
{"original": "In retaliation, Republican senators aim to make the debate and amendment process politically painful for Democrats. The most excruciating part of the process is the vote-a-rama, wherein senators will vote on dozens of amendments in quick succession. Vote-a-ramas typically take several hours, often ending early in the morning. Johnson told reporters Thursday that he was setting up a three-shift schedule to ensure that all the amendments that are offered are actually voted on, possibly extending the vote-a-rama for several more hours."}
{"original": "It seems like we've always offered a couple of hundred amendments on the Republican side. You get a couple of those voted on and people tire out. I'm just setting up a process that keeps us from tiring out, Johnson said. Johnson has also suggested reading out every amendment, which could extend the process for days."}
{"original": "However, it's unclear how popular this strategy will be with his fellow Republicans. GOP Senator James Lankford told reporters that Republicans would make decisions as we go to determine how long senators would be voting on amendments."}
{"original": "At some point, there has to be an end. And we're trying to be able to determine what that end is, Lankford said."}
{"original": "Senator John Thune, the minority whip, told reporters that the vote-a-rama could go on for an indefinite amount of time. He said it was possible that the Senate clerks would finish reading the bill at around midnight, and the Senate would go home to sleep while the debate clock was ticking. Then they could return to Senate on Friday with a few hours of debate left, followed by the vote-a-rama."}
{"original": "That seems reasonable, seems possible. Requires some level of cooperation, Thune said."}
{"original": "The vote-a-rama process allows the minority party to force the majority to go on the record with politically painful votes. However, amendments require support from a simple majority to be added to the bill, and most amendments proposed by Republicans are expected to fail."}
{"original": "My guess is it's not likely that many of our amendments will get any Democrat support, so I think it's very unlikely that that any Republicans will support the final bill, GOP Senator Mitt Romney said."}
{"original": "The Senate parliamentarian ruled last week that the Senate could not include a provision raising the minimum wage to $15 under budget reconciliation rules, but Senator Bernie Sanders has said he will introduce an amendment to do so during the vote-a-rama. Sanders also announced Thursday that he would offer an amendment to raise the tipped minimum wage, which is currently $2.12, to $14.75 over seven years. However, some Democrats have expressed opposition to raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, meaning the amendment may fail."}
{"original": "As tax-filing season gets underway, one of the first questions Americans ask is: How quickly will I get my refund?"}
{"original": "The good news: The IRS expects to issue over 90 percent of refunds in less than 21 days. And if you file electronically and request direct deposit, you could get your money in as little as 14 days."}
{"original": "But not if you're among the 28 million taxpayers who'll claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the 20 million who'll claim the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). In those cases, your refund will take much longer to receive."}
{"original": "By law, the IRS must hold these refunds until Feb. 15, even if you filed at the earliest date possible in January. The delay gives the IRS additional time to review returns claiming these credits. The law requires the IRS to hold the entire tax refund -- not just the portion associated with these tax credits."}
{"original": "The IRS said the earliest it expects to process these refunds is Feb. 27. A few additional few weeks of delay will hit those who get their refund by check or have errors on their returns."}
{"original": "This slowdown may create a cash flow glitch for those who rely on a quick refund to help pay off holiday bills."}
{"original": "The extra review the IRS gives returns with these tax credits aims to give the agency more time to detect and halt tax refund fraud. Tax fraudsters know how simple it is to file a fake return with no income, claim the EITC and ACTC, and receive a big check from the Treasury. So these credits have been a hot target for fraud."}
{"original": "The EITC is a refundable tax credit, meaning you can get a refund even if you don't pay or owe any income tax. The credit is available for people who work and don't have a high level of earned income"}
{"original": "For people with no children, the credit can be about $510. The maximum credit allowed on 2017 tax returns is $6,318, which is available if you claim three or more qualifying dependent children. For 2017, the EITC is available to those who had the following amounts of adjusted gross income and number of children:"}
{"original": "$48,340 (single or head of household filers) or $53,930 (married filing jointly) and three or more qualifying children"}
{"original": "$45,007 (single or head of household filers) or $50,597 (married filing jointly) and two qualifying children,"}
{"original": "$39,617 (single or head of household filers) or $45,207 (married filing jointly) and one qualifying child,"}
{"original": "$15,010 (single or head of household filers) or $20,600 (married filing jointly) and no qualifying children."}
{"original": "The Child Tax Credit is worth as much as $1,000 per qualifying child depending on your income. If the amount of your Child Tax Credit is reduced below $1,000 per child (because it can't be more than the amount of the income tax you owe), you may be able to claim the ACTC."}
{"original": "The eligibility rules for claiming the EITC are in Publication 596. The IRS also provides an EITC Eligibility Assistant tool on its website."}
{"original": "Who will get stimulus checks, and how much?"}
{"original": "Who will get stimulus checks, and how much?"}
{"original": "Who will get stimulus checks, and how much?"}
{"original": "Millions of Americans are eagerly awaiting their second stimulus checks, which provide $600 for each eligible adult and child. The IRS said last Tuesday that it had started to distribute the checks via direct deposit, a process that will extend into this week."}
{"original": "The tax agency added that it started mailing paper checks on December 30 to people who don't have their bank account info on file with the IRS. But even so, the timeline leaves many people wondering when exactly the check will land in their accounts — especially as the IRS' website for checking one's payment status is unavailable."}
{"original": "The second stimulus check follows a rocky rollout this spring for more than 160 million stimulus payments directed by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. That relief effort, which directed $1,200 for each eligible adult and $500 for each eligible child, encountered a number of problems, such as a delay in payment to people who didn't have their bank account information on file with the IRS, as was the case for some Social Security recipients."}
{"original": "The IRS will use the same method to get the money to people as it did in the first round, said Mark Steber, chief tax information officer at Jackson Hewitt."}
{"original": "If taxpayers received a direct deposit then, they will again; if they received a mailed check or debit card then, they will again, he said."}
{"original": "But the IRS' Get My Payment website is currently offline. The agency said it expects its Get My Payment tool to be operating again in a few days, although it didn't specify a date."}
{"original": "That's a problem, although the site should be up by next week, based on the IRS' statement, Steber noted. The updated website should include information on both the first and second stimulus payments, he said."}
{"original": "That website allowed people this spring to provide or update their bank account data to the IRS. It also informed people when their checks would be landing in their accounts. But it, too, had glitches. Some people reported getting error messages such as Payment status not available, while others got locked out of the site."}
{"original": "On December 29, the IRS said the payments are automatic for people who filed a 2019 tax return, as well as for people who receive Social Security benefits, Railroad Retirement benefits or Supplemental Security Income and Veterans Affairs beneficiaries who didn't file a tax return."}
{"original": "The IRS added that people who successfully used the Non-Filers tool by November 21 — a site created to make sure that people who don't normally file tax returns would get a payment — would receive their second stimulus checks automatically."}
{"original": "The payments won't be taxed because they are not considered earned income, Steber said. But, he added, taxpayers should keep their Notice 1444 from the IRS, which shows the exact amount they received, to reconcile their payments so they can receive any additional amount due on their 2020 tax return."}
{"original": "The IRS is sending $600 to each eligible adult and child — not the $2,000 that had been pushed by President Donald Trump."}
{"original": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday blocked an attempt to vote on the $2,000 stimulus checks approved by the House, but resurrected the higher payments in a new bill that includes other items on Mr. Trump's wish list, including the repeal of Section 230, which shields social media companies from lawsuits."}
{"original": "While it's unlikely the stimulus checks will get bumped up to $2,000, the Treasury Department said it would be able to handle that possibility. If additional legislation is enacted to provide for an increased amount, Economic Impact Payments that have been issued will be topped up as quickly as possible, according to a Treasury statement on December 29."}
{"original": "The second round of payments directs $600 for single people who earn up to $75,000 and $1,200 to married couples who earn up to $150,000."}
{"original": "The amount then declines for people earning above those thresholds, and completely phases out for single people who earn over $87,000 and married couples with earnings over $174,000. Children under 17 years old will receive $600 each. Children who are 17 are ineligible, as are adult dependents, such as college students and some disabled people claimed as dependents on their relatives' tax returns."}
{"original": "More people are eligible for the second round of stimulus checks than in the first, the IRS added."}

{"original": "TOKYO - Mitsubishi Motors Corp., the Japanese automaker that acknowledged last week that it had intentionally lied about fuel economy data for some of its models, said an internal investigation found such tampering dated back to 1991."}
{"original": "President Tetsuro Aikawa told reporters Tuesday the probe was ongoing, suggesting that more irregularities might be found."}
{"original": "We don't know the whole picture and we are in the process of trying to determine that, he said at a news conference at the transport ministry. I feel a great responsibility."}
{"original": "Aikawa said so much was unknown that it's uncertain what action the company will take. He said he didn't know why employees resorted to such tactics to make mileage look better."}
{"original": "Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Motors had repeatedly promised to come clean after a massive scandal 15 years ago involving a systematic cover-up of auto defects."}
{"original": "The inaccurate mileage tests involved 157,000 of its eK wagon and eK Space light passenger cars, and 468,000 Dayz and Dayz Roox vehicles produced for Nissan Motor Co."}
{"original": "In this June 6, 2013, file photo, visitors check out Nissan's compact car DAYZ after a press conference in Tokyo. AP Photo/Koji Sasahara, File"}
{"original": "The models are all so-called minicars with tiny engines whose main attraction is generally great mileage. They were produced from March 2013. The problem surfaced after Nissan pointed out inconsistencies in data."}
{"original": "The automaker found the company's mileage goal for the minicars that had been set in 2011 was suddenly raised in 2013. Why that happened is unclear, according to officials."}
{"original": "Aikawa also said it was unclear how customers were going to be compensated because the extent of the cheating was still under investigation."}
{"original": "Mileage fraud is a violation of Japan's fuel efficiency law for autos because buyers are eligible for tax breaks if a vehicle model delivers good mileage. Possible penalties are still unclear due to the uncertainties over the investigation's outcome, according to the transport ministry."}
{"original": "Mitsubishi Motors released two diagrams explaining how road tests were manipulated."}
{"original": "The company, which also makes the Outlander sport-utility vehicle and the i-MiEV electric car, has arranged for a panel of three lawyers, including a former prosecutor, to further investigate the mileage scandal from an outsider's point of view, with a report expected within three months."}
{"original": "Production and sales of all affected models have been halted."}
{"original": "Japan is periodically shaken by scandals at top-name companies, including electronics company Toshiba Corp., which had doctored accounting books for years, and medical equipment company Olympus Corp., which acknowledged it had covered up massive losses."}
{"original": "Mitsubishi Motors struggled for years to win back consumer trust after an auto defects scandal in the early 2000s over cover-ups of problems such as failing brakes, faulty clutches and fuel tanks prone to falling off dating back to the 1970s. That resulted in more than a million vehicles being recalled retroactively."}
{"original": "The Mitsubishi brand was tarnished seriously when a wheel rolled off a Mitsubishi truck in 2002, killing a woman who was walking down a sidewalk. That truck had not been recalled but parts had been changed on it under free inspections."}
{"original": "Washington — A bipartisan group of senators, many of whom helped craft the framework for the most recent coronavirus relief package, is planning to meet with a top White House economic adviser in the coming days to discuss the next round of federal aid, according to lawmakers and sources familiar with the matter."}
{"original": "I expect that we will be meeting with one of the new President's economic advisors within a week, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said in a statement. One source told CBS News that the group will have a call with Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council and President Joe Biden's top economic aide."}
{"original": "Mr. Biden has proposed a COVID-19 relief package that includes funds to support vaccine distribution efforts, extend unemployment benefits and expand federal aid to families, small businesses and communities. The White House's plan, which Mr. Biden said he plans to Congress soon, includes additional $1,400 direct payments to most Americans, on top of the $600 payments approved in December under the previous Congress."}
{"original": "The formula for distributing direct payments in the first two rounds of direct payments has been based on income reported on recipients' 2019 tax returns, raising concerns about whether aid is reaching every American who needs it, given the massive job losses during the pandemic."}
{"original": "There's been a concern about the cash payment and whether or not there ought to be a different criterion for passing it out and distributing it, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin told reporters."}
{"original": "The new group of senators overlaps with members of the so-called 908 Coalition, a group of lawmakers who crafted a bipartisan $908 billion relief proposal last December after months of stalemate in Congress. That proposal formed the basis for negotiations over the relief package that passed alongside an omnibus spending bill late last month."}
{"original": "As you take a closer look at your financial footing amid the headwinds of a pandemic, it's an excellent time to examine the possible impact of a Joe Biden presidency on money matters."}
{"original": "The balance of Congress has shifted following the Georgia runoffs, providing possible momentum for President Biden's agenda. A new COVID-19 stimulus check, taxes, health care — it's all on the line. Here's how it may impact your wallet."}
{"original": "Look for a third round of pandemic relief shortly after Biden's inauguration, said Bernard Yaros Jr., an economist with Moody's Analytics. Analysts expect the new administration to roll out direct payments of $1,400 to millions of Americans."}
{"original": "In February, we expect that there's going to be a COVID-specific relief package, Yaros said. That measure will likely once again extend unemployment insurance benefits, with enough support for another round of checks issued to Americans, whether it's 2K or slightly lower, he said."}
{"original": "Small businesses are likely to receive more grants and forgivable loans, as well."}
{"original": "And we're also thinking, you would probably get some additional funding for rental assistance, Yaros added."}
{"original": "With Democrats gaining two seats in the Senate from the Georgia runoffs, there is now a greater possibility of moving from relief to stimulus mode in late 2021."}
{"original": "That's because now that the Democrats have a simple majority in the Senate. They can pass changes to the tax code as well as implement changes in spending, Yaros said."}
{"original": "Moody's Analytics economists expect the Biden administration will dedicate increased funding for enhancements to social safety nets, possibly including:"}
{"original": "Rolling out paid sick leave protections."}
{"original": "Offering universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds."}
{"original": "Providing some kind of student debt forgiveness."}
{"original": "But on these initiatives, Democrats will have to pick and choose, Yaros said."}
{"original": "Among the more moderate Democrats, they're not going to want to increase the deficit too much. That's obviously going to be a limiting factor, he adds."}
{"original": "And while Vice President Kamala Harris holds the deciding vote in the event of a Senate tie, the 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans doesn't constitute filibuster-proof power."}
{"original": "Higher taxes are expected to partially fund the widening of these social safety nets."}
{"original": "Yaros says Biden is likely to succeed in reversing Trump's tax cuts, raising the corporate income tax rate to 28%, increasing the tax rate for taxable incomes of more than $400,000 and eliminating some tax breaks for those making more than $1 million."}
{"original": "But the tax hikes may be smaller than widely anticipated, says Michael Zezas, head of U.S. public policy research at Morgan Stanley."}
{"original": "In a Senate where Democrats have the slimmest majority possible, any one Democratic senator effectively has a veto. And when it comes to taxes, we expect many of the Biden administration's proposed taxes won't pass muster with Democratic moderates, Zezas said in an analysis."}
{"original": "We estimate about $500 billion of tax increases are possible, obviously a smaller number than another potential COVID stimulus round, and also smaller than the $1 trillion-plus spending now in play for each of health care and infrastructure, Zezas added."}
{"original": "Even if Biden can swing the tax hikes, they aren't expected to kick in until 2024, Yaros said, to make sure that there's no fiscal drag, at all, on the economy in these next couple of years when we're still digging ourselves out of the pandemic."}
{"original": "Joe Biden also has some ideas to reshape employer-sponsored retirement plans."}
{"original": "One of those proposals is to equalize the tax benefit of contributing to a retirement plan so that higher-income earners aren't getting more of the benefit than the lower-income workers, that it's standard across the board, said Anne Tyler Hall, founder and principal of Hall Benefits Law."}
{"original": "For example, someone in a 37% tax bracket is able to deduct the full amount of a retirement plan contribution, so $37 for every $100 pre-tax contribution. That's a greater tax benefit than someone in a lower tax bracket, such as 20%, who would receive a $20 deduction for each $100 pre-tax contribution."}
{"original": "The idea proposed by the Biden administration is to offer a tax credit to low- and moderate-income workers, resulting in an equal tax benefit."}
{"original": "Democrats are also pushing for employers to make retirement saving easier for the U.S. workforce."}
{"original": "Employers who don't offer retirement plans would be required to allow employees to make contributions to individual retirement accounts, IRAs, Hall said. Contributions to the IRAs would come directly from paychecks."}
{"original": "With the shift of balance in Congress, Hall says such changes may be more likely. Plus, some of these provisions have bipartisan support, she added."}

{"original": "It's all just ahead this Super Bowl Sunday here on FACE THE NATION."}
{"original": "Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. More than a hundred million people are expected to tune into Super Bowl LV later today. Either on the CBS broadcast or streaming networks. And another COVID record will be set, that of the least number of in-stadium spectators for a Super Bowl. Just twenty-five thousand fans will see the game in person, including seventy-five hundred vaccinated health care workers. Senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann reports from Tampa."}
{"original": "MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): Super Bowl LV in Tampa faces one known threat: COVID-19, the NFL blitz with adjustments, a stadium one-third full, cardboard-like cutouts will outnumber people. Mandatory face masks."}

Concerns already realized overnight in North Carolina. Now some good news: COVID America's various benchmarks suggest transmission has dropped to pre-Thanksgiving levels. This week new cases fell below one million nationally, at least a ten-percent drop at nineteen states, more than twenty-five percent in twenty others.

{"original": "One Super Bowl tradition that is going on as planned this year, the pre-game interview with the President. Our Norah O'Donnell sat down with President Biden on Friday. She talked to him about China and also about the challenges of reentering the nuclear deal with Iran, which has begun enriching nuclear fuel close to weapons-grade levels."}
{"original": "NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS EVENING NEWS): The U.S.-China relationship is probably one of the most important in the entire world. Why haven't you called Xi Jinping?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN (CBS EVENING NEWS): Well, we haven't had occasion to-- to talk to one another yet. There's no reason not to call him. I probably spent more time with Xi Jinping, I'm told, than any world leader has because I-- I had twenty-four, twenty-five hours of private meetings with him when I was vice president, traveled seventeen thousand miles with him. I know him pretty well."}
{"original": "NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS EVENING NEWS): There is a lot to talk about?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN (CBS EVENING NEWS): A lot to talk about, a whole lot to talk about. And he's very bright. He's very tough. He doesn't have-- and I don't mean this is a criticism, just the reality, he doesn't have a democratic, small D, bone in his body. But he is-- the question is I've said to him all along that we need not have a-- a conflict. But there's going to be extreme competition. And I'm not going to do it the way that he knows and that's because he's sending signals as well. And I'm not going to do it the way Trump did. We're going to focus on international rules of the road."}
{"original": "NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS EVENING NEWS): Will the U.S. lift sanctions first in order to get Iran back to the negotiating table?"}
{"original": "PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN (CBS EVENING NEWS): No."}
{"original": "NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS EVENING NEWS): They have to stop enriching uranium first?"}

Overnight Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran will not scale back its atomic work until the U.S. removes all sanctions.

{"original": "We want to go now to Senator Lindsey Graham in Clemson, South Carolina. Good morning to you, Senator."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina/@LindseyGrahamSC): Good morning. Thank you for having me."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran has threatened to kick out U.N. inspectors within the next three weeks if sanctions are not lifted. You heard the President. Where do you think the stalemate goes from here?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, the Trump administration put Iran in a box. As a result, you got four or five Arab nations doing peace agreements with Israel. I think Iran is weaker today than they've been since the regime was started about forty years ago. So if I were President Biden, I would keep the sanctions on until Iran changed its behavior. I would not want to go into an old deal with Iran because they've been up to no good for too long. So he's going to have three problems here: what to do with Iran differently than Trump, what to do with China different than Trump and how to change Trump immigration policies without creating a run on the border. I would caution President Biden because Trump did it doesn't mean it's wrong."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So I would slow down if I were President Biden and re-evaluate some of these Trump policies and keep them in place if they make sense."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've known the Biden family for years. Have you spoken to the President since inauguration?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No, I haven't. Congratulations"}
{"original": "to-- to him. He's the legitimate President. I talked to Secretary Blinken two days ago. I'm very pleased with what the Biden administration is proposing for Afghanistan. We're going to keep troops there on a conditions-based approach."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: The Afghan study group came out with a good-- say again?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Past May, which is when the Trump deal would call for conditions-based drawdown?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think it's-- I think it was-- yeah, I think we're not going to leave in May. We're going to leave when the conditions are right. The-- the Taliban have been cheating. They haven't been complying. And so I like what Tony Blinken and the Biden administration is doing. They are reevaluating our presence in Afghanistan to keep the footprint low, but not to walk away and lose all the gains we've achieved. If we leave too soon without a conditions-based withdrawal ISIS and al Qaeda will come roaring back. Women will suffer greatly. So they're in a good spot, I think, on Afghanistan. When it comes to Iran, I would caution the Biden administration to go back into the Iranian deal. There's a proposal by myself and Senator Menendez--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --that the Iranians can have all the nuclear power they want. They just can't enrich. And I think Arabs would sign up for that deal, which would be a good deal for the world."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll stay tuned for-- for what the policy is. I want to ask you about what's happening here at home with the scheduled trial that is supposed to begin on Tuesday of former President Donald Trump. You voted against holding that trial, but you said this on the morning after the siege of the Capitol:"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (Jan 7, 2021): When it comes to accountability, the President needs to understand that his actions were the problem, not the solution, that the rally yesterday was unseemly. It got out of hand. It breaks my heart that my friend, a President of a consequence would allow yesterday to happen. And it will be a major part of his presidency. It was a self-inflicted wound. It was going too far."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, it's not a crime. I mean the House is impeaching him under the theory that his speech created a riot. When you look at the facts, many people had already planned the-- to attack the Capitol before he ever spoke."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the trial memorandum from the--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: The President said at the rally I think was--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The trial memorandum from the House impeachment managers actually lays out a pattern of behavior. They say it wasn't just the speech. They say this was cultivated over time."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah, well, here's what I would say, that if you believe you committed a crime, he can be prosecuted like any other citizen. Impeachment is a political process. We've never impeached a president once they're out of office. I think this is a very bad idea. Forty-five plus Republicans are going to vote early on that it's unconstitutional. It's not a question of how the trial ends. It's a question of when it ends. Republicans are going to view this as an unconstitutional exercise. And the only question is, will they call witnesses? How long does the trial take? But the outcome is really not in doubt. That doesn't mean what happened on January the 6th was okay. It means his impeachment, in the eyes of most Republicans, is an unconstitutional exercise."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: The President's behavior, in my view, is not a crime, but he can be charged with one if people think he committed it because he's now a private citizen."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some Republicans, your colleague, Pat Toomey, a Republican, believe that this is constitutional since the President was impeached while he was still in office. But, you know, people can look at this and say, look, when you can't argue a case on its merits, you argue on process. And that's what Republicans are doing right now. Because I want to ask you to clarify this. You said on January 7th, this about Mike Pence:"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: The things he were-- he was asked to do in the name of loyalty were over the top, unconstitutional, illegal, and would have been wrong for the country."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unconstitutional and illegal sounds a lot like high crimes and misdemeanors."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah, well, he wasn't charged with that. The bottom line is the impeachment articles, I think, are unconstitutional because the President is in Florida. He's not in office. Impeachment for a president requires the chief justice to preside over the trial. He's not at the trial because President Trump is not the President. So this is not process. The Constitution, I think, is being flagrantly violated because, when it comes to Trump, there seems to be no end to all of this. So, the trial is going to result in an acquittal. Most Republicans, I don't know what Senator Toomey is going to do, is going to view this as unconstitutional and the President's behavior is not incitement under the law. And the longer it takes, the worse off for the country, I believe."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said if the President committed a crime, he should be charged. Do you think any of the President's actions, the tweets calling for the rally, the language leading up to the rally, the lying to the public about the ability to overturn the election, what you described he said about Mike Pence, does any of that deserve a reprimand?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I mean, he's going to have a place in history for all this, but the point of the matter is that we're in Congress. We're not prosecutors. Impeachment is never meant to be a prosecution."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you have oversight of the Justice Department."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We don't do bill of attainders."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah, I think I'm ready to move on. I'm ready to end the impeachment trial because I think it is blatantly unconstitutional. I'm ready to get on with trying to solve the nation's problems. And as to Donald Trump, he is the most popular figure in the Republican Party. He had a consequential presidency. January the 6th was a very bad day for America, and he'll get his share of blame in history. But I do believe that in 2022, the Republican Party is going to come roaring back because our friends on the Democratic Party-- on the Democratic side are going to change immigration policy to have caravan after caravan hit our borders."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you still believe he is the head of the Republican Party?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: They're going to raise our taxes, and they are going to weaken us across the board. Excuse me again? I'm sorry."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You still believe President Trump is the best face for the Republican Party? Yes or no?"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think he's-- I think he's the-- yeah, I think, yeah. I think-- I think Donald Trump's policies served the country well. I think Donald Trump has to rehabilitate--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --himself as a politician. But here's what I think. I think--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --most Americans are going to look--"}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --at the Biden administration and--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm-- I'm sorry we are-- we are out of time."}
{"original": "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I'm sorry go ahead."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I'm sorry here to--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --cut you off, I have to take us to a commercial break. Thank you for your time this morning. Stay with us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to the former Fed chairwoman and new Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen. She joins us in Washington. Good morning to you, Madam Secretary."}
{"original": "JANET YELLEN (Treasury Secretary/@JanetYellen): Good morning, and thank you so much for having me."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know the U.S. is still ten million jobs short of where we were before this pandemic. Many people have stopped looking for work. Is the jobs market stalling?"}
{"original": "JANET YELLEN: Well, I'm afraid that the job market is stalling. We saw that in Friday's employment report, just six thousand private sector jobs created, forty-nine thousand overall, and that's after a month in which we actually saw job loss. So, yeah, we have ten million people unemployed. Four million have dropped out of the labor market and another two million are working part time who really would like full-time work. So we have-- we're in a deep hole with respect to the job market and a long way to dig out."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, the unemployment rate for men and women is relatively similar. But the President's economic adviser, Jared Bernstein, said this past week the number of women who've left the workforce is of great concern and unusual in a recession. What's driving that and how do you get women back into the workforce?"}
{"original": "JANET YELLEN: Well, you know, women really are-- many face just an impossible situation in which they have children they have to take care of who weren't in school and would be facing increasing demands on the job. And many, over two million, have dropped out of the labor force because it's so hard to manage that-- that conflict. And the-- the package, the American Rescue package that President Biden has proposed really addresses the problems that women face. It places huge emphasis on getting our schools open safely, getting children back into school, providing paid family and medical leave during this crisis so that women don't have to leave their jobs when they're faced with health issues or family issues that they have to address. There's emphasis on providing more childcare and-- and payments, tax credits expanded for children to help families address these needs. And I think this is really necessary to get women back to work. They've faced a-- a disproportionate burden because of this crisis, especially low-wage women and women of color."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those emergency paid leave provisions would expire in September. During your confirmation hearings you talked about the U.S. needing to make these more permanent, essentially, to stay competitive with the rest of the developed world. Is getting U.S. to adopt a legal mandate for expanded paid leave and childcare your ultimate goal?"}
{"original": "JANET YELLEN: Well, it's certainly something that President Biden is interested in and, you know, the current package that he's proposed, the American rescue package, is intended to deal with the immediate crisis, the economic crisis and the healthcare crisis. But beyond that he looks forward to proposing ideas to-- to address longstanding challenges that our economy has faced."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a yes in the future. Let's talk about now. In this current rescue--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --package, who-- what should determine who is eligible for a stimulus check? Should it be your-- your 2019 income level or your unemployment status?"}
{"original": "JANET YELLEN: Well, you know, President Biden wants to make sure that the-- the payments that he's proposed, fourteen-hundred-dollar hundred payments to make good on the total two-thousand-dollar pledge, goes to families that really need it, that are struggling. And, of course, it shouldn't go to very well-off family-- families that don't need the funds and haven't been hard hit by the crisis. So, he's discussing the appropriate cutoffs and phase-ins with members of Congress and is open to negotiating on those. But there are a lot of families that are struggling with lower income and need-- need those payments."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know sending people checks in the mail, though, the criticism is that this is more about politics than economics. Some of your fellow economists have been very critical. Stanford's John Cogan claims seventy percent of stimulus payments from last year were either saved or used to pay debt. Mark Zandi of Moody's, who-- who the President often references, said stimulus checks are not the most effective type of support and said much of it goes to households that don't need the funds. Given that how do you justify writing these checks?"}
{"original": "JANET YELLEN: Well, it has to go to people and households that do need the money and those are lower income households, and we need to make sure that the cut-offs are appropriate so that households that are doing really well maybe have seen their stock portfolios rise and make a lot of income and haven't lost their jobs, those households shouldn't be getting it. There is a lot more--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's your floor and ceiling on that?"}
{"original": "JANET YELLEN: --targeted relief also. Well, I-- I don't have specifics for you today. These are matters that President Biden is discussing with members of Congress and is open to reviewing what's-- what's appropriate. But he is committed to providing the fourteen hundred dollars of payments to those who qualify."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's no jobs creation program in here. The President says he wants that massive infrastructure bill to be next. And job creation is what we need to see. Don't you risk spending your political capital now when you need to create jobs in this next bill?"}
{"original": "JANET YELLEN: Well, there will be another bill that addresses job creation through infrastructure development, through investment in people, in education and training, addresses climate change, improves the competitiveness of our economy and is designed to create good jobs with good pay that involve create-- careers for people. But right now this package will do a huge amount to create jobs. The spending it will generate is going to lead to demand for workers, help put people back to work, especially when we can get vaccinations and the public health situation to the point where the economy can begin to open up again."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, there's been some wild swings in the price of GameStop. Are markets functioning properly?"}
{"original": "JANET YELLEN: We really need to look in detail to understand what happened in those-- in those stocks over the last couple of weeks. I would say that the core infrastructure of the markets, the plumbing, ability to trade, clearing settlement, those infrastructures performed well. But we need to make sure that investors are adequately protected, that they understand the risks, and that we have fair and efficient markets. And we'll be looking into all of that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Secretary, thank you for your time."}
{"original": "And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up in our next half hour, a Super Bowl preview with our own James Brown. Stay with us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, so stay with us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Vaccine efforts around the world are also picking up speed. Senior foreign correspondent Liz Palmer reports from London."}
{"original": "ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@CBSLizpalmer): Good morning. There was a good news milestone this week: The number of vaccinations given worldwide was greater for the first time than the number of new recorded COVID cases."}
{"original": "ELIZABETH PALMER: That's partly due to aggressive public health action. Like here in Brazil teams pushed into the Amazon to vaccinate people in remote villages who wouldn't have a hope of getting to an ICU, and the very first vaccine shipment arrived in South Africa this week. Such a big deal that officials, including the president, came out to welcome it in the pouring rain. But wherever there is vaccine in both the developing and the developed world there are plenty of takers. From Morocco to Sweden, where the majestic hall normally used to award the Nobel Peace Prize was being repurposed as a vaccination center. In spite of the progress, though, this pandemic is more lethal now than it was last spring. Twice as many people are dying daily than in mid-April 2020. With terrifying local surges, the worst of them at the moment in Portugal. It's got the highest death rate anywhere in the world. And it had to welcome German doctors and equipment to help. COVID has reminded millions that life in fleeting and precious. Take Rosario, hospitalized with COVID in Madrid, she was wheeled to see Fernando, her partner of fourteen years. He'd finally proposed to her, by text, from his bed, and she joyfully replied."}
{"original": "ELIZABETH PALMER: It's also worth noting, Margaret, that in this push to vaccine, there are some deliberate holdouts, notably New Zealand and Australia. They closed their borders early on. They have virtually no COVID cases. And so for now they have decided just to watch and wait."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Liz Palmer in London, thank you."}
{"original": "We want to go now to the World Health Organization's COVID-19 lead. That's Doctor Maria Van Kerkhove. She joins us from Geneva, Switzerland. Good to have you with us, Doctor."}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE, PhD (World Health Organization COVID-19 Lead/@mvankerkhove): Hi, Margaret. Thanks for having me."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're an epidemiologist. You specialize in zoonotics, which means you know a lot about how these viruses jump between species like COVID did. These new variants, you've described them as a combination of mutations all at the same time. What does that mean?"}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: Mm-Hm. Well, these viruses change all the time, and-- and every time they replicate, the more they spread, the more changes that they can have. These are called mutations. These are individual changes in the genome itself. These variants have had a combination of mutations, which mean a number of mutations identified at the same time. And so that means that this clustering of these-- of these mutations happening at the same time are quite different than individual-level mutations. And we've had three such variants being reported, actually four such variants being reported in the last few months. The first in Denmark, the second reported from the United Kingdom, the third from the-- South Africa and the fourth from Brazil."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So which countries have actually been successful in-- in containing the virus and is there a common approach to their success?"}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: Well, that's a great question. There's-- there is a common approach that many countries have taken to control the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including these virus variants that have been detected. And it's a combination of factors. It's in-- it's individual levels that we've-- individual-level measures that we've seen people take, you and I, in terms of our physical distancing, our mask wearing, our avoiding of crowded spaces, our opening of windows, our sneezing into our elbow. All of those measures are really critical, as well as government-led responses where we have all-of-government, all-of-society approach, where we're conducting active case finding, where we know where the virus is. We can support people who are infected through good clinical care. We make sure that those individuals are isolated. Any contacts of confirmed cases are provided supported quarantine so that if they are infected themselves, there is no opportunity for them to pass the virus to others, making sure that we open up our workplaces safely, our schools safely. It's a combination of factors, and many countries have done well in-- in having an aggressive approach to making sure that they have the testing, the tracing, the clinical care and really strong, empowered, enabled, and engaged communities. It's all of this. You hear us say a lot, do it all. This is what we mean by when we say do it all."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you're talking about things like enforcing quarantine, I-- it sounds like you're talking about Australia, New Zealand. Are those the best examples?"}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: We have great examples all over the world of how countries have used these-- these combinations of factors. When I use the word quarantine, I'm using this in the sense of contacts of confirmed cases. So when you have a case that is infected, that individual who is infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus needs to be provided with good clinical care, and they need to be isolated from others so that they don't have the opportunity to pass it to someone else."}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: But before they go into isolation, they may have many contacts, and those contacts of individuals who-- of cases need to be provided supported quarantine, which means they're separated from others and provided food and care and safety and security for fourteen days while they wait and make sure that they're not infected themselves, they get a test themselves, but they don't have the opportunity to pass to others. South-- South Africa is-- is a good example where they got through their first peak, countries across Asia and the Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand. But, in fact, we've actually seen really strong responses across Europe during their first peak--"}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: --where over the summer months in Europe cases were down to single digits. And they showed us, and many countries across Africa, across Europe, across the Americas, have shown that they can drive transmission down. And this is really, really critical now that we have these virus variants being detected because the more opportunities this virus has to spread--"}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: --the more opportunities it has to change. So we need to make sure we prevent as many infections as we can."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which part of the world is going to be most complicated to vaccinate?"}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: Ooh. That's a great question. We need to vaccinate people at-risk all over the world. So, I think there are different complicating factors in-- in different parts of the world for different reasons. But what we want to make sure that we do is, number one, that we have multiple safe and effective vaccines that are in production, that continue to be tested, continue to be studied, to continue to come online--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you concerned by this AstraZeneca report?"}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: That we have good production capacities all over the world. Say that again-- say that again."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you-- are you concerned by this reporting that AstraZeneca's vaccine may not be effective against the South African variant, B1351?"}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: Yes. So the B1351 variant was identified-- first identified in South Africa, there's a number of studies that are underway to look at the response of the body, the immune response of the body, but also the impact of vaccination. There are some preliminary studies suggesting reduced efficacy, but, again, those studies aren't fully published yet. And our group, our-- our independent panel group on vaccinations, is meeting tomorrow to specifically discuss the AstraZeneca vaccine, as well as the results coming out of South Africa to determine what does this mean in terms of the vaccines going forward. But this is why it's really, really critical that we have more than one safe and effective vaccine. We cannot rely on only one product, and that is not the goal of anyone around the world. So, that is definitely something we need to continue to push forward. But, again, vaccines are not just enough. It's vaccination that's really critical. We need to make sure everyone who is at risk, you know, the old-- elderly, people who are most at risk for severe disease, receive the vaccine--"}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: --in all countries around the world, as well as health workers all around the world, as opposed to everybody in just a handful of countries."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: World Health Organization investigators a year after the outbreak began in China have now been allowed in to look at what happened on the ground. Is this just a show by the Chinese government?"}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: No, it's not. In fact, we have a team of ten international scientists. You called them investigators, but, indeed, they're-- they're scientists from a number of different technical fields, as well as people from WHO, my colleagues. And we have colleagues from FAO and OIE who are supporting the mission, as well. And this is-- these are studies that are ongoing to find the virus origins and understand the intermediate hosts. You know what were the zoonotic origins of this pandemic? And this is really, really critical from a public health perspective so that we know and we can take steps further to prevent this from happening again. They're very good discussions that are having on the ground. There are constructive exchanges between this international team from ten different countries, as well as the Chinese counterparts, looking at the earliest cases, looking at studies from the markets. They've had visits to hospitals. They've had visits to two laboratories, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology--"}
{"original": "MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: --as well as visiting different levels of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control. So, we're hoping for the reports as soon as possible, and that will be made available as soon as it can be."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Doctor, thank you for your time this morning. Good luck to you."}
{"original": "We'll be right back with Doctor Scott Gottlieb."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He sits on the board of Pfizer as well as Illumina, and he joins us this morning from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard from Doctor Van Kerkhove, and-- and she outlined all the mutations here. What is the bottom line from what she was laying out? I mean she did seem to indicate there are concerns about this AstraZeneca vaccine and its efficacy against B1351 out of South Africa."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think there's a rule of thumb we can assume that the vaccines are probably going to be about twenty percent less effective against these new variants from Brazil and South Africa, which has mutated some key regions of the protein that we target with our vaccines. We've seen that now in a Novavax trial, in the J&J trial, as well as with the AstraZeneca vaccine. The mRNA vaccines-- and I'm on the board of Pfizer, which developed one of those, are very efficacious. And so even if we see a reduction in the efficacy of those vaccines, and it may not be as profound with those vaccines, you're still getting very good protection with those vaccines. And, frankly, you're getting very good protection with the J&J vaccine as well. So I do think that the existing vaccines are going to offer reasonable protection against these new variants. And we also may be able to develop in a timely fashion, maybe in four to six months, a consensus strain that bakes in a lot of the different variation that we're seeing to have boosters available for the fall. So I think that there is a reasonable chance that we're going to be able to stay ahead of this virus as it mutates. Trevor Bedford at the Hutch has done some good work on this, and some people are speculating right now that this virus may have gone-- undergone a really significant evolutionary leap, if you will."}
{"original": "It's mutated a lot all at once in different parts of the world, but it's not going to continue to mutate at the same rate. It may have reached a new fitness level, but-- but it's going to slow down. It's not going to continue to change as much. So we're going to be able to keep up with it."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I asked the doctor about the probe underway in China. From your view, how important is it to know the origins of the first strain that-- that we learned of with COVID-19 in China?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think it's important from a political standpoint, and I think it's important from a public health standpoint, so we know what the risk is for future transmission, for future jumps from zoonotic sources into-- into the human population. And we kind of better understand the risk from coronaviruses more generally. I don't think we're going to find out and we're certainly not going to be able to find out with any level of certainty that's going to put to rest some of the speculation that this could have been a lab source. Now, most people believe that this was a zoonotic source. You know as well as I do, there's still speculation even in the government that it could have been from an accident in a laboratory. We know that that Wuhan laboratory was doing a lot of experimentation. It had a big repository of coronaviruses. I don't expect that the WHO mission is going to firmly put that to rest. We would need access to the source strains. I suspect they're not going to get that. That information, if it's available, the Chinese government would have that. And so far they have not made that available."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You told us on this program last Sunday that it was Miami and Southern California that you were most concerned about as hot spots for this B117 strain detected in the U.K. Are there-- are those still the areas of greatest concern for you?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, and Florida's growing pretty significantly right now, between five and ten percent of the infections in Florida are B117, that U.K. variant, the more contagious variant and that's centered in southern Florida. I think that what's going to happen in Florida right now, they're continuing to show declines in new infections like the rest of the country. I think as the rest of the country continues to come down that curve, you're going to see a leveling off in Florida. And while I don't think that they're going to have another surge of infection, they could have persistent high infection because B117 is gaining a better-- better foothold in that part of the country. Southern California is probably right now about five percent of infections are B117. So they're a little further behind Florida. For the rest of the country, it's probably less than one percent all around the country. Now, there could be localized hotspots--"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --particular counties where you have an outbreak of B117 but I think for the most part around the country it's probably too little, too late. We'll probably be able to get ahead of it with our vaccines and the seasonal effect from the warming weather."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Getting ahead of it's a good thing. The CDC is expected to release guidelines this week on how to safely reopen schools. The CDC director said vaccination of teachers is not a prerequisite. What should be a prerequisite?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think the prerequisite is putting in place mitigation steps in the schools. The school districts that have reopened successfully and it was good data out of North Carolina where they did some sys-- systematic research looking at the experience in those schools which were open, showed that when they wear masks, when they distance, when they try to take precautions in the classroom, there's very little transmission within the classroom. The schools are not a vector of transmission and especially children under the age of fourteen are less likely to both get infected and transmit the infection. I think it certainly would be good to be able to prioritize teachers to get them vaccinated so they're not at risk from contracting the infection and spreading the infection. But I don't think it's necessarily a prerequisite. I think schools have demonstrated that they can open safely if they take precautions in the classroom."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to getting vaccines out there, we know retail pharmacies will begin receiving shipments this week. The Biden administration is sticking with that Trump plan of giving doses based on population. Is this the best way to get doses into the arms of the public?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think for now. You know they've made a lot of progress. We've had some days where there's two million vaccines that have been delivered. I think we're going to see that more consistently. That's going to be the run rate. As we get into March, by the end of March, we'll have delivered two hundred and fifty million vaccines onto the market if the J&J vaccine gets authorized and in April we'll probably deliver another hundred million vaccines onto the market. If you assume a sixty-forty split between first doses and second doses, you assume about sixty percent of the supply that's coming onto the market is going to first doses--"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --by the end of March we'll have delivered a hundred and fifty million vaccines and in April, another sixty million, we're going to run out of demand. I mean I think we need to start thinking about the demand side of this equation soon."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Doctor Gottlieb, good to talk to you as always."}
{"original": "And we'll be back with a preview of Super Bowl LV. Stay with us."}
{"original": "KENAN THOMPSON (SNL/Broadway Video): Hello, and welcome to the Super Bowl, four hours of television for eleven minutes of action. I am James, no, not that one, Brown. As everyone at home knows, this year has been anything but normal. The pandemic, racial and political divisions, Armie Hammer, but today we come together in a spirit of unity to watch football and murder billions of chickens for their delicious wings."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: That, of course, was not CBS, but about last night's Saturday Night Live. And we want to go now to the real James Brown. JB is CBS News special correspondent and host of the NFL Today. But really, JB, you don't need any introduction here. How are you doing?"}
{"original": "JAMES BROWN (CBS News Special Correspondent/@JBsportscaster/Host, The NFL Today): Margaret, I didn't see the beginning of SNL. My text messages started blowing up as I'm trying to go to bed last night, but that's an appropriate opening to say the least. So I'm looking forward to it. And thank you for giving me a little bit of levity to start."}
{"original": ". This is your tenth Super Bowl, I understand. But, I mean, you-- I have no doubt, have never seen anything quite like pulling this off in the midst of a pandemic. What is going to be different this year?"}
{"original": "JAMES BROWN: Well, the fact that we won't have a packed house, that adds immeasurably to any big event, the pomp and circumstance of it and the excitement of the fans, we won't have that. But the players will be thrilled to have at least the twenty-two to twenty-five thousand who will be there. That really does influence them significantly. Obviously, a lot of the pomp and circumstance surrounding the Super Bowl, the parties, the celebrations and all of those things have been nonexistent. So it's a little different that way, but we're glad to get to this point. Heavens, who would've thunk it that we would have gone through seventeen weeks of the regular season, getting two hundred and fifty-six games in, and now we're at the Super Bowl, but that's a real tribute to the players, the teams, and the coaches who have-- who have adhered to the COVID protocols, by and large, throughout this season. Margaret."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's significant that there even is a Super Bowl. But I'm wondering, JB, what are you hearing about what comes next for the league? Are we going to see athletics get vaccinated or be part of sort of a public relations push to encourage Americans to go get that shot in the arm?"}
{"original": "JAMES BROWN: Excellent question. A number of players are doing that at present. And I'm certain, given that you're involved in news full time, you know that there has been a bit of a challenge in communities of color to embrace the vaccinations. So you see a number of the athletes, especially those of color, who are doing PSAs to encourage people. You know, personally, it's-- I say it's a personal decision, do your homework and examine it to see what makes sense for you. But there is a push. I would think we'll see a lot more of that. However, the other elephant in the room is I've been told by league officials that they will not advocate for having a priority position in terms of being vaccinated, because as you well know with the sobering news surrounding this, there are far more people who are in need of that as opposed to athletes trying to move to the front of the line."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. We spoke to the head of the Players Association about that question the other day, DeMaurice Smith. And-- and he shared with us something else that I want to get your reaction to, and that is frustration, frankly, among many players, with the lack of diversity among coaching staff in particular. And he said, Unfortunately, we've had some former coaches of color who I think have given excuses, or cover, for the league in this. There's some sharp words. What do you make of that assessment?"}
{"original": "JAMES BROWN: Well, you know, today on our pre-game show, I'm going to address that very issue with a commentary of my own, coming off of an excellent but sobering piece that's entitled Before Jackie, meaning before Jackie Robinson. And that would be in the four o'clock hour of our pregame show. And it addresses, sadly, part of the history was there were a number of owners back in 1953, who collaborated and consciously deliberately made a decision to eliminate Black players from the league. And it was thirteen years later before when the team moved to California, Los Angeles, specifically, playing in a stadium that was in a minority community, meaning they paid taxpayer dollars, and they said they weren't going to allow it. And that's when Kenny Washington broke the color barrier. So the fact is, sadly, there is a history that I know definitively, that Roger Goodell, the commissioner, Troy Vincent, the highest ranking African-American, have done everything possible to create an environment and a culture to that. And the bottom line is equality of opportunity is all that is sought. Male and female, there's no division. I'm so happy to see full-time female assistants on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that you'll get a chance to see. And bottom line, there's a McKinsey report that came out in May 2020 that said, Diversity wins; inclusion matters. We have a wonderful mosaic here in America, people of all hues and stripes."}
{"original": "And excellence comes in all hues and stripes, so why not take advantage of that to improve the bottom line and the culture and winning with that attitude."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know-- you know, football and activism really became a-- a hot topic in the past few years. Where does that conversation go next? Is it coaches or is it in another direction?"}
{"original": "JAMES BROWN: Coaches, quite frankly, are low-hanging fruit. Look, when the league was opened up to diversity, it's not surprising that half the number of players who are in the Hall of Fame are players of color, Black players, specifically. The same thing I'm going to be talking with Amy Trask who is, has been and still is, sadly, the only female CEO of a team. It's going to continue to move forward because I think people see that and embrace it, and it only makes sense."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: JB, it's always good to get your reflections. Good luck to you today. Thanks for joining us."}
{"original": "JAMES BROWN: Hey, by the way, Margaret, Kenan Alan-- Kenan on SNL, he had a better hairline than me, and his mini Afro looked a lot better than my micro Afro. But thank you for having me on, anyway."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I like the real JB."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's more from the head of the NFL Players union, DeMaurice Smith, on our latest podcast. We hope you'll listen and enjoy today's game safely. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan."}

{"original": "Click here to browse full transcripts of Face the Nation."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on FACE THE NATION, as the President declares a national emergency over the coronavirus, we'll take a special look at the two areas Americans are most concerned about. The health and economic risks posed by the disease. As the COVID-19 pandemic takes hold across the country, the nation's top expert on virus, Doctor Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health will be here. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb will also join us. And then we'll turn to the impact on our now uncertain economy as Americans struggle to adjust to the new reality. Is a recession ahead? Will the stock market recover? How will the hard hit airline industry cope with new travel restrictions and more Americans staying home? We'll talk with White House economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, and also the head of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan."}
{"original": "First, an update on the virus and its toll. In the U.S., forty-nine states and the District of Columbia have reported over three thousand cases of coronavirus. The death toll stands at least at sixty. Globally, at least one hundred and forty-two countries have reported over a hundred and fifty-six thousand cases with the international death toll now at over five thousand eight hundred. And there are now travel restrictions on non-Americans coming into the U.S. from twenty-eight European countries, including new restrictions on incoming travel from the U.K. and Ireland that will go into effect Monday night."}
{"original": "We begin with three reports from around the world. First up, White House correspondent Paula Reid. Paula."}
{"original": "PAULA REID (CBS News White House Correspondent/@PaulaReidCBS): Good morning, Margaret. This is a critical moment for the Trump administration but one that has been marred by mixed messages and missed opportunities to prepare and make tests widely available. After days of saying he didn't need one, President Trump revealed that he has been tested for coronavirus."}
{"original": "PAULA REID: The White House revealed yesterday that the President has tested negative for coronavirus after coming in close contact with at least two foreign officials who have tested positive."}
{"original": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I decided I should, based on the press conference yesterday, people were asking, Did I take the test?"}
{"original": "PAULA REID: But Friday night when the President says he was tested, the White House released a memo from his physician insisting …testing for COVID-19 is not currently indicated. It's the latest in a series of mixed messages from the administration as it continues to defy its own guidance on shaking hands."}
{"original": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because it almost becomes a habit."}
{"original": "PAULA REID: And social distancing. But on Saturday, members of the press had their temperatures checked before attending a presidential briefing. Over the weekend, the House passed legislation that includes free testing, paid sick leave, food assistance, and expanded unemployment benefits. But no cost estimate has been provided for the bill which now heads to the Senate. The President has also declared a national emergency, freeing up to fifty billion dollars to combat the outbreak. That announcement made alongside top business executives in the Rose Garden helped stocks rebound Friday after their worst day in thirty years."}
{"original": "PAULA REID: In addition to those new restrictions on travel from the United Kingdom and Ireland, the President said he may also consider restricting travel here in the U.S. He encouraged Americans not to travel even domestically if they don't have to. Margaret."}
{"original": "We go now to the heavily impacted community of New Rochelle, New York, and CBS News correspondent Meg Oliver. Meg."}
{"original": "MEG OLIVER (CBS News Correspondent/@megoliver): Margaret, this drive-through testing site is open twelve hours a day and has been testing hundreds of patients. It's the state's effort to keep people who could be sick out of health care facilities where they could potentially infect more people."}
{"original": "MAN #1: Are you here to be tested?"}
{"original": "MEG OLIVER: A steady stream of residents drove up and lined up for coronavirus testing just north of New York City. Seventy-year-old Michael Myers (ph) told us he got tested as a precaution."}
{"original": "MEG OLIVER: He takes care of his forty-one-year-old son who has a spinal cord injury."}
{"original": "How are you coping with all of this?"}
{"original": "MICHAEL MYERS: Day by day it's, you know, everyday things change."}
{"original": "MEG OLIVER: In Kirkland, Washington's Life Care Center, the emergency has only grown. The number of positive cases jumped to forty-seven more employees at the center Friday night. Hospitals are racing to respond, setting up triage and evaluating how many patients they could handle if there's an onslaught of new cases."}
{"original": "MAN #2: We would get them right into the (INDISTINCT), be treated right away without-- without a second thought."}
{"original": "MEG OLIVER: Coast to coast, drugstores and grocery stores are no match for consumers who rushed to store shelves for supplies. Apple and Nike both announced drastic action closing most of their stores around the globe until March 27th. Back in the containment zone in New Rochelle, Jerry-Day Jesus (ph) is struggling to keep his restaurant open. He's lost twenty-five percent of his customers."}
{"original": "JERRY-DAY JESUS: People in this area wants to just be get back to normality. Right now there's panic in the air."}
{"original": "MEG OLIVER: For now, this is the new normal. The governor's office tells me they plan to open a new mobile testing site in Long Island in a few days. Their goal is to test six thousand people a day by next week. Margaret."}
{"original": "We turn now to London and CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer for an update on what's going on in Europe."}
{"original": "ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@elizaplamer): Good morning. Italy still has by far the highest number of positive coronavirus cases in the world. But just last week the WHO named Spain as the new epicenter of the pandemic because the number of cases there suddenly rocketed up tenfold."}
{"original": "ELIZABETH PALMER: Normally, crowded Spanish streets are empty. The government has ordered people to stay home unless absolutely necessary. And Spain's prime minister confirmed on television that his own wife has tested positive. All across Europe, cities are eerily quiet. In France, Italy, and Belgium as well as parts of Germany, cafes, bars, and restaurants are closed as officials scramble to slow the spread of the virus. Schools are closed, too, and even the great landmarks like Rome's Trevi Fountain and the Eiffel Tower. Though Paris being Paris, the tough new rules didn't slow down left-wing protesters yesterday, facing off of a police. It's Iran that has the second highest number of cases on Earth. And it's now struggling to treat victims in ill-equipped hospitals. But, notably, nowhere is there panic. Instead, displays of solidarity--"}
{"original": "ELIZABETH PALMER: --like locked-down Italians singing from their windows. And in Spain, a mass ovation for health care workers manning the hospital frontlines."}
{"original": "ELIZABETH PALMER: Here in the U.K., we've still got far fewer positive cases than in most of Europe so the government hasn't, yet, closed the pubs and the restaurants and the schools. But it is clearly hedging its bets. For example, it's announced that it's planning to buy as many ventilators as it can get its hands on. Margaret."}
{"original": "And we've just learned that the U.K. is now advising against non-essential travel to the U.S. We turn now to Doctor Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH. Doctor Fauci, thank you for making time. I know you're quite busy. You said this week we are not at the peak."}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI, MD (Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases): Right."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is going to get worse. How much worse?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What are the numbers?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, I can't give you numbers because it's really going to depend on the effectiveness of our response, and our response-- I mean, if you just leave the virus to its own devices, it will go way up like we've seen in Italy. That's not going to happen if we do what we're attempting to do and are doing. And that's--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do we get ahead of it?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, the-- the way you get ahead of it is that as I-- as I try to explain to people, that I want people to assume that I'm over-- or that we are overreacting, because if it looks like you're overreacting, you're probably doing the right thing, because we know from China, from South Korea, from Italy, that what the virus does, it goes-- percolates along and then it takes off. So what we've got to do is a couple of things, and we're doing it. One is preventing new infections from coming in, hence the travel restriction. And the other is doing containment and mitigation within the country. And it is correct that the infections are going to go up. Our job is to make sure it doesn't do the maximum peak and actually blunts. Within that blunt, there will be many new infections. We want to make sure we don't get to that really bad peak."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Americans' lives have changed dramatically--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --in the week we just went through and they are going to continue to change. People aren't supposed to be visiting nursing homes."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: People are being told to work from home. Schools are shutting down."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Give us the reality check, though. What is the mortality rate and what is the recovery rate?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Right. Well, the issue is, if you look, historically, right now in the United States, we're collecting data, looks similar to what we've seen in some other places. If you look at the totality, China dominated that previously, the mortality was about three percent. Okay? That's quite high for any kind of respiratory disease. If you look at the other countries, it's somewhat less. If you count all the people who are getting infected and are not being counted because they're not coming to the attention of a health care provider, then mortality will likely come down to somewhere around one percent or less. But even that is serious. And that's why we've got to take this seriously, because if you look at the typical seasonal flu, it's 0.1 percent. So this is a virus that transmits readily. It's a virus that has a high degree of morbidity and mortality. And that's the reason we've got to do all of our forces. Now, if you look at the recovery rate, the recovery rate is minus what the mortality is. So if-- if the mortality is one percent it's ninety-nine percent recovery rate. If the mortality is even less, overwhelmingly, more people recover from this than get into serious trouble. There's no doubt about that. But we want to make sure that we not only decrease the rate of infection we protect the vulnerable people who are within that percentage that have a much higher degree of morbidity and mortality."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President indicated that he is looking at travel restrictions, including--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --within the country. Should Americans get on a plane right now?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, it depends on what the reason for getting on the plane. Anything that's to my mind, particularly if you are a person who's elderly or who falls within the category of underlying conditions, you should really think twice before putting yourself in a situation where you're in a crowded place for an extended period of time."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You wouldn't get on a plane?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Right now. Me? For-- there are a number of reasons why I wouldn't get on a plane, but if I were not doing the job that I'm doing because of my age, I would very seriously think about not doing any travel like that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should Americans get up and go to the office tomorrow?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, you know, it depends on the situation that you're in. To the extent possible, teleworking should be done to the extent that you could do it. I mean there are some jobs you can't telework. Let's be real. But if you can, you should. You should avoid crowded places. And then that's the things that we've been talking about all along right now. The CDC has a nice website. You go in, you talk about the different kinds of mitigations at different levels of involvement."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Don't go to crowded places. France is trying to close down restaurants--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and cafes, and bars."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should that happen here in the United States?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: You know every single day we meet with the task force, and we take a look at what's going on. And you don't want to make a pronouncement that no one should ever go into a restaurant. I mean I think that might be overkill right now, but everything is on the table. It may come to the situation where we strongly recommend. Right now, myself personally, I wouldn't go to a restaurant. I just wouldn't because I don't want to be in a crowded place. I have an important job to do. I don't want to be in a situation where I'm going to be all of a sudden self-isolating for fourteen days."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: For those Americans who are now returning from Europe, how do we make sure that that doesn't allow for further spread?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you screen them?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: You know I think the issue is if you look at what's happening now for people who are coming back from-- like the European countries, when they get back in here, they're having en- enhanced screening when they come back."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? Taking their temperature?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, no, actually, just looking at them, seeing if they're sick, giving them a piece of paper. Here's a telephone number. Here's what you need to watch out for. Watch out for these symptoms. And, importantly, fourteen days of self-isolation if you come from one of those countries that are on that list."}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Period. You come back, fourteen days of voluntary self-isolation."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, the federal government could invoke authorities to do things like quarantine--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --for places that are hotspots like New Rochelle--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you like to see that?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, it depends on the individual circumstance. The problem, Margaret, with my making a pronouncement what should be done you've got to look at what the situation is at the local level. I mean, for example, in New York City, in-- in New Rochelle, it's a very difficult situation up there. So Governor Cuomo made some important decisions, which in my mind, looking at what he did, were the right decision."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The American College of Surgeons has told hospitals that they need to prepare to cancel particularly elective surgeries."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: That implies that hospitals are about to get overwhelmed."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do we have the hospital capacity to deal with what is coming?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And if we don't, what is the plan?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it to use military hospitals?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Well-- well, first of all, again, you've got to look at what the-- the bracket is of the possibility. If in a worst-case scenario, and I don't want to scare people, that you always got to consider. There's a worst-case scenario. There's a best-case scenario and there's something in the middle. We're doing everything we can to not allow that worst-case scenario to happen. If it happens, which I don't think it will, because I-- I can see the effort that we're putting in--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think hospitals will be overwhelmed?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: No-- no, I don't say that. I say it's possible that they could be. But when you say that people get frightened, but concentrate on what you can do to not make that happen. But if, in fact, there's a scenario that's very severe, it is conceivable that will happen. And that's the reason why you have things like strategic national stockpile for-- for ventilators and things like that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's concern about shortages of key supplies like that, ventilators--"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Margaret, we would be unrealistic if we were not concerned that that possibility exists. What we need to do is to--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can you reassure the public that there is planning for those eventualities--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I know you're saying it's the worst case."}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: --planning. There's absolute, hundred percent take that to the bank. There's planning to address that, but we would be unrealistic to not pay attention to the possibility that it could happen."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So millions of children across this country are looking at the possibility of not being able to go to school for at least a few weeks--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Their parents are going to try to figure out what to do with them."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can they take them to playgrounds? Is that safe?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, you know, it depends. If you have a bunch of kids in the playground, I don't think it's a good idea to congregate anybody anywhere to the extent that you--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of any age, period?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes, of course. Yes."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there is that perception that if you're younger--"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes, indeed, but if a-- if a young individual, a child, gets infected, they may do perfectly well from a physical standpoint, but they may bring it home to a person who is susceptible. So we can't discount the-- the issue of children need also to follow certain of these rules."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So if I were standing next to someone who was later diagnosed with the coronavirus--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --what do I do? Do I have to wait until I'm exhibiting symptoms, actually ill--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --before I can get a test?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: No. Right now, if you feel-- if you are in a high-risk situation, and remember just being in the room, you know, six feet apart or whatever from someone--"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, see, dinner is different. It depends. If you're having dinner for multiple hours with someone who has symptoms and finds out that that person is sick, that puts you in a higher risk. That's something that you really need to, essentially, hunker down, get a physician, call them up, get instructions of what to do. If you walk into a room and you find out three days later that somebody in that room was infected and was asymptomatic when they were infected. Your risk is very low, very low."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in the circumstance, I need that test--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: When will it be available? I know you've made the point. It's not just shipping them out it's getting them operational."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: How long before that happens?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, I would hope, based on what we've heard from the CEOs of the companies that are now getting involved, that they're going to be getting those tests out there in an easy way, not only to be out there, but to actually get them quite soon. They're talking within a several days to a week to start to see it rev up."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that means testing within several days or a week?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Right. But that doesn't mean you're going to be maximum because nothing goes from zero to maximum. So if the companies are going to get involved, the laboratory groups that do this for a living, when they get involved, it's going to go like this so that you're going to start seeing tests more and more available until pretty soon they're going to be quite available. But in the next day or so, you're going to find people are going to say, you know, I wanted to get a test--"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: --and I couldn't get it. That's going to happen. But the future, as opposed to looking back the future is going to be like this as opposed to the inhibitions we've seen before."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Several days or a week?"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: --the problem with the pinning down to days--"}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: -- it's going to be gotcha if you don't have it."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, no we-- we-- we hear from a lot of viewers on Twitter and elsewhere saying they are concerned about being able to get this."}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: And-- and they should be concerned. But what we can say that now that we have the private sector involved, we're going to see an entirely different scene than we've seen the weeks previously, for sure."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Fauci, thank you for your time."}
{"original": "ANTHONY FAUCI: Good to be with you."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be back in a moment with Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Stay with us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with former FDA commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Good to see you here. Back for another week."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Thanks."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you've been telling us sort of what to prepare for next. And I want to dive into some of that with you. You heard Doctor Fauci say they're coming, but they're not really here, yet, in terms of kits and availability to actually go and have it processed if you need a test. What's the timeline?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think we're going to see a dramatic increase in diagnostic capability this week. So I think by the end of the week tests are going to be readily available. They were- they approved tests on what we call high throughput systems, meaning systems that can run, literally, tens of thousands of tests a day inside academic labs or the large clinical labs like LabCorp and Quest. Once those facilities have those systems online, they're going to be able to process an awful lot of tests, and they'll have them online at some point this week. So by Friday, I think tests-- testing is going to be pretty ubiquitous."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now hospitals are trying to plan for the future here. How are they positioned? Are there enough medical supplies?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Not if we have a Wuhan-style outbreak in a major city or multiple cities, which is my concern, that we can have outbreaks of that proportion in multiple U.S. cities. If you look at Wuhan at the peak--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're saying the numbers that we are seeing and have seen in China?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. In-- in a major U.S. city. Remember, Wuhan was the size of New York City. At the peak of that epidemic, they hospitalized about twenty thousand people. Ten thousand were in serious or critical condition and two thousand were intubated. To give you a basis of comparison, New York State, the entire state, has fifty thousand hospital beds and about three thousand critical care beds and about twenty thousand of those beds are in New York City. So if we have a Wuhan-style outbreak in New York City, that's going to overwhelm the system. So they need to be building surge capacity right now in anticipation of that possibility. Now, there's ways to avert it, but that's the risk that we face right now."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: We'll certain-- we'll hit-- we'll certainly hit tens of thousands of cases in the U.S. Hopefully, we won't hit hundreds of thousands of cases. But right now, if you look at some of the good research out of the Hutch by Trevor Bedford and others, they're-- they're saying that there's probably ten to forty thousand cases right now distributed across the U.S. I think the risk that we have in the U.S. is we're a much more mobile population. China was able to confine their out-- their epidemic largely to Wuhan. The risk here is that we have multiple cities that are seeded right now. And so we'll have multiple Wuhans. That's the bad-case scenario."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Multiple Wuhans is an incredible thing to say. The Pentagon came out and put travel restrictions on U.S. troops traveling domestically. They can do something like that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect to see other government agencies and should Americans be expected to, essentially, be on lockdown?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, there-- there's no question that the steps we're taking right now or is changing the course of this epidemic. We're already impacting this. But I think we need to do much more. And so think steps like banning government employees from nonessential travel or state employees that will have an additional impact. We need to be doing all of these things leaning very hard into this. The best-case scenario is we look back a month from now and we say to ourselves, well, we overreacted. You want to be in a position and Doctor Fauci made this point as well. You want to be in a position to say we-- we-- we overreacted. It wasn't as bad as we thought it was going to be. But this is a once-in-a-generation pathogen. We have never seen anything like this before in modern times. This is going to-- this is going to be historic right now."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So should cities like Seattle and New Rochelle that are hot spots be on lockdown?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I don't think we can quarantine a U.S. city and lock it down and deny people their liberty in this country. I think what we can do is slow economic activity to a point where people have no place to go. If you close the theaters and you close the restaurants, you close large gatherings, you tell people not to have dinner parties, you tell businesses to have nonessential workers telework, people stay home. There's no place to go. I think that's the solution in the United States not to-- not to put a city on lockdown. I don't think we're going to get there. We might. I hope not."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is a-- is what New York state doing a model for the rest of the country?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think Andrew Cuomo has been leading very far ahead. I think he's been very aggressive in doing a good job. I'm concerned that the city hasn't closed public schools. Private schools are closed. Public schools are not."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And you do start to worry that people's ability to protect themselves is going to break along socioeconomic lines where lower income Americans will not have the same opportunities that middle-wage and higher-wage earners will because they can telework, they send their kids to private school, they're in suburban districts that closed."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's got to be a concern."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will talk about that ahead with-- with Larry Kudlow and others. But I want to take a quick break and come back. On the health risks, more conversation with Doctor Scott Gottlieb. And some of your questions answered ahead. Stay with us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: For more information on what you can do to stay safe during the coronavirus crisis please go to our website, FACETHENATION.com or check with the CDC."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up, more on the health risks of coronavirus, plus, a look at its impact on the economy. Stay with us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We are back now with more from the former head of the FDA Doctor Scott Gottlieb. And then we will take a look at the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis as lives across this country have changed in the course of this week."}
{"original": "Doctor, we were talking about hospitals being, basically, able to help people if they get the virus or anything else. Are they going to be overwhelmed? We are starting to see things like pictures of tents set up outside of hospitals. Is that something other hospitals should be doing, either isolating or changing triage, or is this about simply not having enough beds?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, hospitals have emergency protocols, and they're implementing those right now. And that's very prudent, trying to build facilities to offload some of their capacity from the hospital on to other sites so that ERs don't get overrun. We have about a million hospital beds in this country, about a hundred thousand are critical care beds, fifty thousand of those are medical intensive care unit beds. At any one time, most of those ICU beds are filled. And hospitals are about seventy-eight--- seventy percent occupied. So we don't have a lot of excess capacity. We also don't have a lot of capacity with excess respirators. There is about sixty thousand full-featured respirators in the country, about eighty-nine hundred in stockpile. So if we do have multiple epidemics in multiple large U.S. cities, the system will become overwhelmed. I think we can handle a-- a Wuhan in one major U.S. city and pulse resources into that. What I worry about, again, is multiple cities having that kind of an outbreak."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because if you don't have enough ventilators or other equipment, doctors have to start making choices about who gets what."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you do that?"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --there's about a hundred thousand other ventilators that aren't full-featured ventilators, but could be used in a pinch. And so what we need to do is try to free up capacity right now. And that's what you see hospitals doing. And that's what they're doing with these tents and these surge facilities. They need to start discharging patients where they can, not doing elective procedures so they're not bringing in patients. These are hard economic decisions for the hospitals, but this is absolutely what they have to be doing. And we have time to do it. We-- we do have three or four weeks if we're going to be on that trajectory that China was on to build that surge capacity right now. China did just about everything wrong leading into their lockdown and they still were able to get control of their-- their epidemic there. We do have an opportunity now, but every day counts. Every day matters."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the White House listening to you? The President mentioned you by name this week."}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I've had-- I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to talk to officials in the White House all through this. Some-- some of the calls that I was making to and the conversations I was having go back to January. They've been on top of this. I mean they have been concerned about this. I've been talking to White House staff--"}
{"original": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --and the staff has been concerned about this and so I'm going to continue to try to provide whatever help I can."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Doctor Gottlieb, thank you."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you with us once again."}
{"original": "And we're going to turn now to the director of the White House National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow. Good to have you here."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW (National Economic Council Director/@larry_kudlow): Thank you, Margaret."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: American lives changed dramatically. There is an economic impact to all of this. People are worried about paychecks and the like."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, specifically, about the bill that the House has passed that would provide paid leave and other assurances. When do you expect the Senate to vote and for the President to actually sign it into law?"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: Well, it would be a big help. It may not be a perfect bill, but it gets done. Essentially, what we wanted to get done, take care of individuals, people on hourly wages, families, kids home. If your spouse is home. A lot of people may have to stay home in the weeks ahead. We want them to get paid. And--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the Senate already scheduling a vote? And will it be on the President's desk within days?"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: This-- this-- well, I think the Senate is going to work on it tomorrow. I-- I hate to predict that legislative calendar, but I think there is an urgency to this, something we've pushed from the very beginning. You know, again, it's about-- it's about helping families and middle-income- and blue-collar-type folks. They should not be penalized financially. And we don't want to force them to go outdoors when they should be indoors. So I-- I think this would be a big plus. And, yes, I think the Senate will get it done pretty rapidly."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Some big corporations already have paid leave policies."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this bill doesn't apply to--"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: This is really impacting--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you have five hundred employees and above, you're not impacted by this bill. Why? How do you guarantee that the people who fall into these categories will still be able to take leave, go home, and put food on their table--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and afford to do what the government is telling them to do?"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: Fall into which categories, Margaret, the lower category?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have-- if you're fifty employees or less, you can have a hardship exemption--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --if you're five hundred or more employees, this doesn't--"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: You qualify for-- if you're five hundred or less--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you're in that middle range, you're impacted--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you're above that, you're not required--"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: And that includes self-- that includes self-employed people also. It's very important. Well, look, the last word on that, we don't know, yet. I mean if larger companies get into trouble, we will be looking at the possibilities using the full powers of the federal government, which are quite substantial during an emergency declaration like this. We will be look to helping any individuals who might get left behind or might have a danger of getting left behind. You know, in this bill, free testing, I think is a very big thing. And I also think the food stamp additions, particularly, if kids have to come home because the schools are closed down. So we will-- we have lots of ways and means to make sure nobody falls through the cracks here."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President speaking to grocers today I saw on the schedule. If you go into a lot of grocery stores, there are empty shelves right now. What is the supply line like? Can you guarantee people that they will be able to stay home and feed themselves?"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: Well, I'm going to say yes. Knowing there may be some exceptions to this. I've now-- I've read about some situations where this is a difficulty, but most of our supply lines are working pretty well in the domestic United States. If I may make a point. I mean, there's a huge economic challenge here. Do not get me wrong, a huge economic challenge. On the other hand, most of America is still working. There was a good story in the journal yesterday about this. Factories are not shutting down across the country, at least not yet."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: The employment story, which may become more tenuous in the weeks ahead. I understand that. Nonetheless, a lot of CEOs I talked to, they are doing everything they can. I-- I've just talked to somebody, a CEO of a big car company not to lay off anybody. So, I--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have projections on possible layoffs? What is the White House preparing for?"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: I'm not going to put numbers out this morning. I would just say--"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: We're-- we're looking at everything right now--"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: --as best we can. You know, so much of this-- because of the unusual nature of this virus, so much of this is new. It's very hard to model stuff--"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: --you don't have much experience with. We're going to-- my view, we go day by day, fact by fact, report by report, phone call by phone call. But I do want to make this point: across the board in order to assist, I call it fiscal assistance, in order to assist individuals and families and small business, we've put on the board four hundred billion dollars already."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: And that includes the paid family leave that you're talking about before."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: It also includes small business assistance."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: Very large significant sum. It also includes deferred tax payments with no interest penalties."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the travel-related industries?"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you looking at a bailout--"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: But let me also-- but let--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --for airlines? Like loan guarantees?"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: Before I get to the bailout, I also want to mention some other important areas here. President is going to-- by executive order I reckon, we will defer the interest on student loans--"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: --for the rest of the year. Also because of the mishmash between Saudi Arabia and Russia, we want to put our energy people out of business. They never will. We are purchasing--"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: --seventy-five million barrels from the Strategic--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you said-- I just want to clarify, you did use the word bailout."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: No, I did not."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is-- well, what is it that you were preparing to do for the travel-related industries? Is it loan guarantees? Can airlines plan on that?"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: It could be. Look, we're talking to the airlines. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is deeply involved. We talk every day."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: We're going to go up to the Hill this week. We will have a number of new proposals with respect to the airlines."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: We've got issues on cruise ships. We've got issues on the whole leisure story. But I-- I just feel, look, this is a story that will be very challenging in the short run."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: But, Margaret, this is not a story of years. This is a story of weeks and months."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: We come in-- strong economies by all accounts."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: And I think by the end of this year we will be back to a strong economy. But we're taking these fiscal assistance measures just to make sure. And please--"}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: --I don't want to leave out, the President strongly supports the payroll tax holiday."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, which is not his bill."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: Which would be enormous benefit--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we'll talk. Okay."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: --to the middle-class and blue-collar workers."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll have to see."}
{"original": "LARRY KUDLOW: It would be an enormous benefit."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll look for you to put that to Congress. It's not in the current bill. We have to leave it there."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we come back, the CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, will join us."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with the head of America's second largest bank, Bank of America's CEO Brian Moynihan. Good to have you here."}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN (Bank of America CEO): Great to be here, Margaret."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: You run one of the biggest banks in the country. You met with the President this week. This has been a swift change in Americans' lives. Are we on the brink of a financial crisis?"}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think let's step back and think about what we have here. Number one, this is a health care crisis and a humanitarian crisis. And we can't forget that we have to take care of people and handle that first. And, by the way, that's the answer to the large-- larger question. And I think I'd think about three things. This is a war. We're in a war to contain this virus. The interesting thing is everybody has the same common enemy across the whole world. So the question of how we do that as employers, as private sector, public sector, everybody is key. And so we have to drive that. The second thing going to your question of banking industry is big bank industry comes in with capital liquidity that is so different than the last crisis. The question is we have to use it wisely. And we have to manage the companies well in times of stress. And this is a quick change from what was going on as a solidly growing economy. And the third thing is as a company, we have to take care of our own. So our teammates and our customers and clients, we have to continue to provide the services we do. We have forty-three hundred branches open every day."}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: The markets are trading every day. The wires have trillions of dollars moving through the system every day, are going on. But at the same time, as employer, we have to take precautions to meet our part of the war, which is to get our teammates socially distanced, to go back to central operations to make sure we work. So it's those three key points. And you can't forget that this is a health care crisis, and we care that, the economic issues will go away quickly."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And-- and it's that uncertainty of not knowing when and where that is-- is weighing on everyone so much. You said your bank is going to treat this like a natural disaster--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and help consumers. What, specifically, does that mean? If someone can't make their mortgage payment or pay their credit card, what are you doing for them?"}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: They call the number on the card and they say, I am affected by the disease, and I can't make my payment. We defer the payment. We've done it. We did it for the employee-- government employees that were shut down. We've done it for every natural disaster. But we're not alone as a company. The whole industry does this. This is what we do. And then with small businesses and others, when they have, you know, issues in terms of cash flow, they come to us and we help work through it. So the idea is you don't want people to be penalized, much like the bill in Congress is trying to take care-- if you think about you're in a war and you have to deal with the people who are going to fall out of that, and-- and the question is the people in Congress, as Larry was just talking about, they are trying to deal with that more systematically--health care or health leave benefits, unemployment benefits. We're trying to deal with the other side which is I can't make my payment. Call us, and we'll make it right."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then the consumers are the engine of this economy."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not just looking at the market. When they're told to go home--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --when they can't get food at the grocery store, when they don't know when their next paycheck is coming, how is it that you can be confident the economy is going to come back when we don't know when this is going to end? We don't know how many jobs are going to be lost."}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, there's-- there's some interesting things to think about. One is what's really going on as of today. So we see the data of consumer spending and-- on things and goods and services and we watch it every day. And the aggregate number year over year is still up ten percent plus--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But people are just now--"}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: And so-- so what you're going to say is what happens next?"}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: And, obviously, travel, the cruise industry, movies, things like that are-- are, you know, changing dramatically. Restaurants, you're hearing the reports of that. So that-- so that's all in front of us. But right now, it hasn't had the impact people think. And so that's the question. But if you asked yourself, what are we trying to do? You heard Doctor Fauci talk about sort of flattening the curve."}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's the inverse of that for us as bank-- the banking system we're trying to make sure the trough stays as high as it can. That it doesn't go down as much that--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: But other banks are-- are predicting a recession. That's two quarters--"}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Right. And I think, you know, our-- our experts who are the leading research firm in the world. You know, it's, basically, a 1.2 for the U.S. Now, that will be a tale of four-quarters that are different--"}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: You'll have growth in the first quarter then it'll go down, you know, maybe flat. But although they've gone from 1.7 percent to 1.2 percent, so they've come down. But they're saying it recovers given the health care crisis being solved. But one-- and one of the things you're going to look at is what's happening in China. We talk to our clients in China, and we had teammates in China, in Hong Kong and places like that. This was an issue in January of social distancing and separation. Eighty percent of employees are back to work at our--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The factories are-- are-- we see propaganda photos. You're saying it's real? China is going back to work?"}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: I'm-- I'm talking about clients of ours who employ, have factories in China are back sixty, seventy, eighty percent, which is good news because the supply chain of goods is there. The question then, is will the demand--"}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: --in the United States and Europe be there? And that's coming down to solving the health care crisis."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and that all matters because that's the second largest economy in the world. It is huge to how our-- our global economy functions. The Federal Reserve, the-- the President said yesterday he wants more action to be taken."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you expect to happen? What needs to happen to stabilize the markets because they are--"}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: --they need to provide-- provide liquidity and-- and continuous liquidity. And so, in these situations, that's what dries up. People back up and-- and-- and the liquidity dries up. So, the Treasury markets, again, they've started-- they've done major things there. Other government guarantee markets, the money funds, potentially, commercial paper. There's a lot of things that are on the table. The central banks around the world have to both provide monetary help, accommodation help, rates, they drop rates fifty basis points. The package of things to do are all known. The question is doing it at the appropriate time, and-- and, more importantly, all the central banks around the world are to have the same impact. Meanwhile, we got to solve the healthcare crisis."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very, very quickly, what Larry Kudlow was talking about was providing help potentially to the airlines. Does that need to happen? Does there need to be some version of a bailout?"}
{"original": "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: I-- I think in a time of, you know, a time of war against this virus, if industries are affected in a way that are strategic industries, we ought to help them."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Thank you very much."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a look at how the coronavirus is impacting the travel industry."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of many industries taking a hit from the coronavirus crisis is the travel industry. So there is no better reporter to turn to than our own Kris Van Cleave. He is CBS News' transportation correspondent. Good morning to you, Kris."}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE (CBS News Transportation Correspondent/@krisvancleave): Good morning."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Overnight we saw these incredible photos of lines, people packed into airports in Chicago, there were some in Texas. These are the kind of crowds we're supposed to be avoiding. What-- what is behind this? Why is this happening?"}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: This was at the-- the customs area at at least two airports, Chicago and Dallas. And this I think came from the-- the rush of people coming back from Europe, you know, the-- the new travel restrictions have gone into effect there. The U.K. restrictions are going to go into effect Monday night. And some of this had to do, we're hearing, with a new form that-- a new health form that people have to fill out, that was rushed into use and didn't necessarily get on the airplanes, that you normally would fill out the form as you're--"}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: --inbound. That didn't happen. Plus, you have the health screening, which is basically a temperature check. But that adds about a minute a person. So between the form that no one knew about that they got handed at some point and this temperature check it caused substantial backups. It raises questions about the staffing and what was Customs and Border Protection prepared for the number of people that are going to be impacted when you put in a travel restriction to most of Europe."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And when it comes to those travel restrictions, the President from the podium at the White House yesterday said they were looking at domestic travel restrictions. What are they looking at?"}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: I think right now it's probably a case-by-case situation. This has escalated very quickly. On Thursday the President was asked about domestic travel restrictions. And he said hasn't been something we talked about but wouldn't rule it out, sort of referencing hot spots like New Rochelle and Seattle. By, you know, Friday, the-- the treasury secretary said he'd fly to Los Angeles if he could, and that it's safe to travel domestically. Saturday, the President said he wouldn't travel domestically if he didn't have to. And now they're talking about travel restrictions. So would-- would it be something that probably gets phased in?"}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Yes. Is it possible as this goes on and there are-- there are more outbreaks if that happens, that you could see sort of a lockdown? I think it's possible. I don't think we're there yet. I think they're still trying to figure out what is an appropriate response."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this matters for the financial health of the travel industry, which has a trickledown effect on whether people even keep their jobs. I mean you-- your reporting this week had such incredible statements from the CEOs of some of these firms. British Airways CEO said this is a crisis of global proportions like no one we have known. This is after going through 9/11."}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Every single airline executive I have talked to has said this appears to be worse than the impact that 9/11 had on their business. You're seeing airlines with more cancellations than bookings for the next several weeks. That's money going out the door and not coming in. It's just not a sustainable be business model. You've-- Delta talking about parking forty percent-- cutting forty percent of their capacity, parking three hundred planes. Americans cut seventy-five percent of its international flying. They announced that overnight. Parking all of their wide body airplanes, nearly all of them. This is an unprecedented challenge for the airline industry. And it-- it makes the business model likely unsustainable."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you had Bank of America's CEO said if they need help, give it to them. Larry Kudlow said they're talking about it. What is it that the airlines are asking for? Is this like a bailout like we saw the auto industry or is this something different?"}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: You know, it has a lot of the same feel as we saw with the auto industry in 2008, where things just keep getting worse. And I think what the conversation was on Monday of last week, and what it was by Friday, is evolving. And-- and if domestic flight restrictions go into place, that conversation is going to continue to change. It's hard to see that there's not going to be some kind of a bailout if you want to see the number of airlines we have today in a year."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's just a difference of whether the government takes an ownership stake and then those companies repay it--"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --or whether that's a loan guarantee or some kind of help with--"}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: And I think at this point that conversation is evolving and continuing to go on. But the airlines are going to need help."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are subways still open?"}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: So cities view mass transit as critical, as an essential service, because it links people to jobs and services. And if you were to cut it off, you also tend to impact certain segments of your population, lower-income folks, working-class people who maybe don't have other options to get around. So the belief is that that's important to keep that running. We've seen ridership numbers come down."}
{"original": "KRIS VAN CLEAVE: So in some ways fewer people riding makes it easier to spread out, but they don't want to shut it down if they don't have to."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kris Van Cleave, you will be busy, as will all of us. Thank you very much for your time."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: The events in the last week have tested and touched every American, and we have no idea when things will return to normal or even what that new normal will look like. But as we found out here at CBS News, challenging times do often bring us together."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Life dramatically changed this week."}
{"original": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't want people dying. That's what I'm all about."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Forget any physical contact greetings. Bow in an Eastern-- Eastern style."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: As the rest of America began to learn what social distancing really means. At least fifty-seven thousand schools are closed affecting at least twenty-five million students, leaving working parents wondering how they'll manage it all and others asking if that daily commute is just too risky. Basketball, soccer, and hockey seasons were suspended. Tournaments, marathons, and baseball's opening day were also postponed or cancelled outright as crowds became something new to fear."}
{"original": "MAN: It's kind of a weird circumstances right now."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Disneyland and Disney World shut down. The lights went out on Broadway and at Carnegie Hall. The President has called for a National Day of Prayer, but many churches are closed. And Wall Street's unprecedented eleven-year bull market run officially ended last week. Military exercises were also scaled back and protective measures taken to help those serving overseas. Those on the front lines at home, the doctors, nurses, and first responders continued to show up and serve. As did the journalists who need to keep the public informed. That hit home for all of us at CBS this week. Our New York headquarters shut down after four of our colleagues tested positive for the virus, leaving us all scrambling to get the news on by remote. That meant it was all hands on deck in our network bureaus and at our stations around the country, but especially here in our Washington bureau which always punches above its weight, but last week had to produce all CBS News broadcasts. That happened with the strong assist of the scrappy FACE THE NATION team which has covered this mysterious virus for months. Journalists never should become the story but like many Americans, we're all finding ourselves in some extraordinary moments. And those promise to continue."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I'd like to say thank you to everyone at CBS for their work navigating the news during these tumultuous times. We also wish our colleagues in New York a swift recovery. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan."}
{"original": "Cybersecurity experts are worried that the United States is at greater risk of cyberattack due to the federal government shutdown."}
{"original": "Maintaining the nation's robust cyber-defense infrastructure—including hardware and software systems—relies on thousands of now-furloughed employees. With fewer trained professionals monitoring U.S. digital systems, the country is at greater risk of attack, data theft, and falling behind in the cyber arms race, experts say."}
{"original": "A large percentage of workers at two of the nation's most important cyber-defense agencies are not working due to the partial government shutdown. According to the MIT Technology Review, approximately 45 percent of employees at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Agency, a part of the Department of Homeland Security, and 85 percent of staffers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the department in charge of maintaining cybersecurity standards, are on furlough."}
{"original": "We have laid out the welcome mat to any and all nefarious actors, said Mike O'Malley, VP of strategy at cloud defense firm Radware. Unfortunately, we know all too well from experience that hackers, especially nation-state sponsored, have a high level of patience and are willing to lie in wait for the most opportune moment to strike."}
{"original": "And a government shutdown, he said, is the perfect moment to strike. With our defenses down attackers will try to quietly exfiltrate data or plant malware that snoops on U.S. computer systems."}
{"original": "Any department that has sensitive information that can be used in espionage or fraud would be hit hardest by an attack, O'Malley said, such as the Department of Homeland Security, State Department, and all of the intelligence services. The risk is not only for short-term data theft but also injection of longer-term persistent attacks."}
{"original": "Short staffing also leaves the IRS exposed to hostile and covert cyber activity, said Bryson Bort, CEO of cyberdefense firm SCYTHE and a fellow at the National Security Institute. Cyber vulnerabilities at the IRS could prevent millions of Americans from receiving their tax refunds on time."}
{"original": "Monitoring is probably not happening at 100 percent of usual operations, which means that there is an increased chance that malicious activity may not be spotted, said Bort, noting the timing of the shutdown right as we move into tax season."}
{"original": "Bort is primarily concerned with two interconnected types of threat actors: for-profit hackers and organized nation-state groups. For-profit hackers will either want to sell data back to nation-states, or are looking for personal identity records to use in fraud and identity theft. Nation-state actors may include China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, said Bort. But I don't think they will 'attack.' I do think this is a good opportunity to step up iterative campaigns to compromise, gather intelligence, and place something quiet for the future."}
{"original": "A cyberattack or data breach targeting government agencies during the shutdown could also cost taxpayers millions of dollars. In its annual data breach analysis report, IBM estimated the average total cost per breach to businesses was about $3.86 million in 2018, up 6.4 percent from the previous year. The cost to the government could be significantly higher because without proper monitoring during the shutdown, digital holes could persist for weeks or longer."}
{"original": "The shutdown will also impact agencies' ability to upgrade existing systems, repair hardware, and build new cyber defense capabilities, said Dave Mihelcic, federal chief technology and strategy officer for Juniper Networks and the former chief technology officer of the Pentagon's Defense Information Systems Agency."}
{"original": "Many projects were likely already on hold due to the continuing resolution affecting numerous agencies, said Mihelcic. With the shutdown, even previously funded efforts have been slowed. For example, the upgrading of desktop operating systems to the most recent and secure versions. The shutdown could have lasting impacts in the cyber-readiness longer term."}
{"original": "Ray DeMeo, co-founder and COO of cyber-defense firm Virsec, is concerned that the government shutdown could have negative long-term consequences on government staffing and recruiting for important cybersecurity jobs in the future. These jobs, DeMeo says, keep Americans safe."}
{"original": "Even at full capacity, resources are at a bare minimum for the mountain of work at hand just to get the government's IT infrastructure up to minimum levels of resiliency, all while working against the nonstop firehose of hour-by-hour attacker assaults, DeMeo said. Attempting to parse critical and non-critical cyber personnel is not possible. It's quite literally dismissing the people who are building your fort while you are in the middle of fighting a war."}
{"original": "FRESNO, Calif. -- The bill to repair California's crumbling roads, dams and other critical infrastructure hammered by an onslaught of storms this winter could top $1 billion, including nearly $600 million alone for damaged roadways that more than doubles what the state budgeted for road repair emergencies, officials said Friday."}
{"original": "Adding to the problems, many communities have drained their emergency budgets and are looking to the state and federal government for help. But on top of the latest damage, the nation's most populated state is struggling with a $6 billion annual backlog of repairs for roads, highways and bridges that leaders can't agree on a way to fund."}
{"original": "Winter storms have dumped enough rain and snow on the northern part of the state to end a five-year drought. But with the wet weather, comes a host of problems for crumbling infrastructure."}
{"original": "A section of mountain highway between Sacramento and South Lake Tahoe has buckled, with repairs estimated to cost $6.5 million. In the Yosemite Valley, only one of three main routes into the national park's major attraction is open because of damage or fear the roads could give out from cracks and seeping water, rangers said."}
{"original": "On central California's rain-soaked coast, a bridge in Big Sur has crumbled beyond repair, blocking passage on the north-south Highway 1 through the tourist destination for up to a year. Until it is rebuilt, visitors can drive up to view the rugged coastline, then turn back."}
{"original": "The total cost for responding to flooding, storm damage and repairs statewide in the first two months of 2017 will probably exceed $1 billion, Gov. Jerry Brown's finance director, Michael Cohen, said Friday. Much of it will be covered by the federal government, which is helping the state recover from severe storms, he said."}
{"original": "The tally includes $595 million to clean up mudslides and repair state highways. Costs for evacuations and non-highway damage, as well as for repairs at Oroville Dam, whose spillways threatened to collapse and flood communities downstream, have not been precisely tallied, he said."}
{"original": "Early estimates put the fixes at the nation's tallest dam as high as $200 million."}
{"original": "Several more weeks remain in California's wet season, which brings the potential for more costly infrastructure damage."}
{"original": "The California Department of Transportation, which is responsible for maintaining highways, roads and overpasses, has a reserve fund of $250 million that's far short of what it would cost to fix recent storm damage."}
{"original": "This is for 2017, Caltrans spokeswoman Vanessa Wiseman said. So, essentially we're talking only two months."}
{"original": "Storms across the state have wrecked more than 350 roads, shutting down traffic on at least 35 that await rebuilding or shoring up of stretches that washed out, sunk or got covered in mud and rocks, officials said."}
{"original": "To cover the shortfall for emergency repairs, Caltrans will ask for more money next month from an appointed board that allocates state cash for road projects, Wiseman said."}
{"original": "Aside from emergency road repairs, Gov. Brown said Friday that California has $187 billion in unmet needs for water and transportation infrastructure. He suggested tax increases may be required, but he wasn't prepared to offer the full answer to raising enough money to shore up infrastructure."}
{"original": "That's bad news for local communities hardest hit by the storms. They say rebuilding will cost millions of dollars they don't have."}
{"original": "In San Jose, where storm flooding forced 14,000 residents from their homes this week, officials say they have not yet calculated the cost of the damage. Some people have not even returned home yet."}
{"original": "Storms in January cost Sonoma County, north of San Francisco, $12.5 million, mostly for road work. Spokeswoman Jennifer Larocque said the county is requesting federal emergency relief funding."}
{"original": "Dennis Schmidt, Butte County's public works director, said storms that led to the emergency at Oroville Dam tore out two roads and left potholes that will cost more than $1 million to repair. He said that will wipe out the county's emergency budget."}
{"original": "I'm looking out the window, and it's blue skies and sunny, Schmidt said. We need it for a couple days to get out and patch some potholes. Our residents will greatly appreciate that."}
{"original": "Here's some good news about the labor market: The cannabis industry is creating jobs at a rapid pace, a new study from employment site Glassdoor finds."}
{"original": "The industry has more than 1,500 open jobs, a jump of 76 percent from a year earlier."}
{"original": "The median salary is $58,511 annually, almost 11 percent higher than the U.S. median."}
{"original": "More than half the jobs are for professional and technical workers, such as accountants and marketing experts."}
{"original": "The upshot: Cannabis businesses are creating new jobs for a wide range of professionals."}
{"original": "Legal pot has grown from a fringe business into a rapidly expanding industry in need of workers, prompting Glassdoor to examine hiring trends for companies like Green Thumb Industries and Surterra Wellness."}
{"original": "As of December, the industry had 1,512 openings in the U.S., Glassdoor found. Many of those jobs are in locations where cannabis is legal, such as California and Colorado, but one surprising finding is that the jobs span the gamut of skills, from retail salespeople to accountants."}
{"original": "We know that cannabis is a hot topic, and we were curious if it was reflected in our jobs data, said Glassdoor economist Daniel Zhao, the study's author. It's a really strong indicator of employer confidence because they're really only going to make investments in hiring if they think they think it's going to grow."}
{"original": "The median base salary was surprising, partly because smaller businesses with passionate followings don't always offer competitive pay, Zhao added. For people who want to join the industry, they don't need to sacrifice pay, he said."}
{"original": "The cities with the highest concentration of jobs are San Francisco, Los Angeles and Denver, with 13 percent, 12 percent and 7 percent of all cannabis jobs, respectively."}
{"original": "The most frequently advertised position is brand ambassador, with a 5 percent share of all openings in the cannabis industry, Glassdoor found. This job involves promoting cannabis products to stores, customers and patients. Sales associates and store managers are the second- and third-most in demand."}
{"original": "Even though the top jobs are related to retail, the majority of openings -- at 53 percent -- are for professional workers such as marketers, lab technicians, accountants and tax experts, the study found. Even though cannabis is legal in 33 states and Washington, D.C., it remains illegal at the federal level."}
{"original": "As these employers need to handle complex set of taxes and legal issues, Zhao noted, they need to hire accountants and lawyers."}
{"original": "One-size-fits-all financial advice isn't supposed to work. We're all as unique as snowflakes, so the financial rules that guide us should be molded to our individual situations."}
{"original": "Except it turns out that rules of thumb can be really helpful."}
{"original": "A study of West Point cadets, for example, found teaching rules of thumb was at least as effective as standard personal finance training in increasing students' knowledge and confidence as well as their willingness to take financial risks. Researchers found money rules of thumb actually were more effective than teaching accounting principles to small-business owners in the Dominican Republic."}
{"original": "Besides, we all have busy lives -- sometimes, we just want an answer. If you're tired of the on the one hand this, on the other hand that approach to financial advice, check out these guidelines I've collected over the years. Perhaps you'll find some one-size-fits-all advice that suits you."}
{"original": "1. Car buying: Buy used and drive it for 10 years"}
{"original": "New cars are lovely, but they're expensive and lose an astonishing amount of value in their first two years. Let someone else pay for that depreciation and take advantage of the fact that today's better-built cars can run well for at least a decade if properly maintained. You can save hundreds of thousands of dollars over your driving lifetime this way. (See How to Buy a Used Car.)"}
{"original": "2. Car loans: If you have to borrow, use the 20/4/10 rule"}
{"original": "Ideally, you wouldn't borrow money to buy an asset that loses value, but you may not always be able to pay cash for a car. If you can't, protect yourself from overspending by putting 20 percent down, limiting the loan to four years and capping your monthly payment at no more than 10 percent of your gross income. A big down payment keeps you from being underwater, or owing more on the car than it's worth, as soon as you drive off the lot. Limiting the length of the loan helps you build equity faster and reduces the overall interest you pay. Finally, capping the size of the payments prevents your car from eating your budget.

{"original": "Retirement saving is more important, but get in the habit of putting at least $25 a month aside for college soon as your child is born. Your kids can always get student loans, but as you've probably heard, no one will lend you money for retirement. Your children will not thank you if the price for their education is your having to move in with them because you're 70 and broke. The good news is that even small contributions to a 529 college savings plan can add up over time. Starting early can mean the difference between choosing the college that is right for your child as opposed to the one that offers the best financial aid package, says Joe Hurley, founder of SavingForCollege.com."}
{"original": "If you carry a balance, look for a low-rate card to help you pay off your debt. If you pay in full each month (as you should), find a rewards card that returns at least 1.5 percent of what you spend. Don't mess with rewards cards if you're dragging around credit card debt. Focus on paying it off fast with a low-rate card. If you pay in full, though, you should regularly review your rewards programs to make sure you're getting enough value from them. The programs can change, as can your spending and the way you use rewards. Even if you don't want to 'play the game' and manage a complicated wallet, there's no excuse for earning less than 1.5 percent back for all of your purchases, says NerdWallet credit card expert Sean McQuay.

{"original": "You need to be able to get your hands on cash or credit equal to three months' worth of expenses. The classic emergency fund advice -- that you need three to six months of expenses saved -- is great, but it can take years to save that much and you have other priorities that are more important (see retirement, below). While you build up your cash stash, make sure you have a Plan B. That could be money in a Roth IRA (you can pull out your contributions at any time without paying taxes or penalties), space on your credit cards or an unused home equity line of credit."}
{"original": "Cover yourself for catastrophic expenses, not the stuff you can pay out of pocket. Insurance should protect you against the big things -- unexpected expenses that could wipe you out financially, such as your home burning down or a car accident that triggers a lawsuit. You want high limits on your policies, but high deductibles, too. Making a series of small claims doesn't make financial sense in the long run. You may gain some small insurance payments, but you risk a rate increase that could more than cancel out your gains, says NerdWallet insurance expert Amy Danise."}
{"original": "If you can't afford the payment on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, you can't afford the house. You may be able to save money by using another kind of mortgage, such as a hybrid loan that offers a lower initial rate. But if you're using an alternative loan because that's the only way you can buy the home you want, you may have set your sights too high. A budget-busting mortgage puts you at risk of spiraling into ever-deeper debt, especially when you add in all the other costs of homeownership. (Read The Huge, Hidden Costs of Owning a Home.)"}
{"original": "Fix the rate for at least as long as you plan to be in the home. Plans can change, obviously, but you don't want a big payment jump to force you out of a home you hoped to live in for years to come. If you're pretty sure you'll be moving in five years, a five-year hybrid could be a good option. If you think you may stay for 10 years or more, though, consider opting for the certainty of a 30-year fixed rate. (Compare rates on different types of mortgages.)"}
{"original": "You have better things to do with your money than prepay a low-rate, potentially tax-deductible mortgage. Shaving years off your mortgage and saving money on interest sounds great. But before you consider making extra payments to reduce your mortgage principal, make sure more important priorities are covered. You should be saving enough for retirement, for one thing, and have paid off all other debt, since most other loans have higher rates and the interest isn't deductible. It would be smart to have that emergency fund built up as well and to be adequately insured. If you've covered all of those bases and still want to pay down your mortgage, have at it."}
{"original": "If you got a late start or want to retire early, you may need to save more. Run the numbers on your retirement plan. For most people, 15 percent including any company match is a good place to start. Even if you can't save as much as you should, start somewhere and kick up your savings rate regularly. Retirement should be your top financial priority, by the way. You can't get back lost company matches, lost tax breaks and the lost years where your money isn't earning tax-deferred returns."}
{"original": "Leave retirement money for retirement. When your retirement fund is small, you may feel like spending it doesn't really matter. It does. Taxes and penalties will cost you at least 25 percent and likely more of what you withdraw. Plus, every $1 you take out costs you $10 to $20 in lost future retirement income. Once your retirement fund is larger, it may be easy to convince yourself there are good reasons to borrow or withdraw the money. There really aren't. Leave the money alone so it's there for you when you need it. (See How to Write a Retirement Plan.)"}

What if you didn't limit your borrowing and are now struggling? You have options. If you have an overwhelming federal loan balance, income-driven repayment plans are there for you, says NerdWallet student loan expert Brianna McGurran.

{"original": "The IRS says individuals and businesses can delay filing and paying federal tax bills for 90 days, to July 15 from April 15, as part of an emergency relief plan amid the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a breakdown of the delay and its potential impact on your taxes and the economy."}
{"original": "Do I still need to file?"}
{"original": "Yes. Initially, only the payment due date was delayed past the traditional April 15 deadline. The Treasury later announced that it would also grant a 90-day extension for filing federal taxes as well. That means both the delayed filings and payments are due July 15. Taxpayers who are facing difficulty filing by the new deadline still have the option to request an extension."}
{"original": "The IRS said the deferment applies to all taxpayers, including individuals, trusts and estates, corporations and other non-corporate tax filers as well as those who pay self-employment tax."}
{"original": "Will I be penalized for waiting?"}
{"original": "No. During this unprecedented delay, taxpayers will not be subject to interest or penalty payments, regardless of how much they owe, the IRS says."}
{"original": "What if I am expecting a refund?"}
{"original": "If you are expecting a refund, file as usual. The IRS is still processing returns and issuing refunds. Most refunds are issued within 21 days."}
{"original": "Does this apply to states taxes, too?"}
{"original": "Not necessarily. Check with your state to see about any changes to due dates. Some are following the federal model, but some are not extending their deadlines. Others are creating exceptions only for certain groups impacted by the virus."}
{"original": "How will this help the economy?"}
{"original": "It's unclear. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin estimates taxpayers will be able to keep $300 billion rotating through the economy for now. Some tax and economic experts say any extra cash in the hands of Americans is helpful because many will struggle to get by."}
{"original": "However, some say the tax delay will not provide widespread financial relief."}
{"original": "Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said the extension will have limited impact. That is in part because about three-quarters of Americans get refunds in any year and won't benefit from a delayed tax bill."}
{"original": "Those who file early tend to be low- and middle-income individuals who are getting a refund. Higher-income individuals, or those with complex taxes who owe money to the government, tend to file later, Gleckman said."}
{"original": "This move will provide some relief for those higher paid tax filers, but Gleckman warns that most higher income individuals have extra cash, and they tend to save it not spend it. That leaves lower-income individuals, who need it most and are more likely to go out and spend it, without much relief from this move."}
{"original": "When the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, the stock market usually goes up. But the novel coronavirus appears to have contaminated the rules on Wall Street along with much of the planet."}
{"original": "The Fed on Tuesday lowered its short-term interest rates by 0.5 percentage points in an emergency move aimed at protecting the economy against the disease known as COVID-19. That was the biggest single cut in the Fed's benchmark interest rate since October 2008 at the start of the financial crisis."}
{"original": "And yet, the market plunged. The Dow dropped 750 points on Tuesday, on top of what has mostly been a pretty terrible two weeks for stocks. The broader S&P 500 stock index was down 2.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped nearly 3%."}
{"original": "The market did rebound some Wednesday morning, although pundits are attributing the day's rally to growing odds that Joe Biden will be the Democratic nominee after Super Tuesday voting results. Many market watchers are still scratching their heads, wondering if the Fed can ever cut rates enough to protect the economy from pandemic — and even if the Fed made a mistake with its dramatic rate-lowering move."}
{"original": "I think that was a waste, said Robert Eisenbeis, a vice chairman of the investment firm Cumberland Advisors and a former top Fed economist. People are looking right beyond this cut to what happens next — and there is a lot of uncertainty."}
{"original": "So what happened? Some think the Fed acted too fast, while some think the Fed had no choice."}
{"original": "If the Fed hadn't cut interest rates, the market would have been down even more, said Jim Bianco, a top Wall Street strategist who heads his own independent research firm. We are headed for a massive economic disruption, and if the Fed doesn't do something, March will end up being when the recession started."}
{"original": "The biggest issue is that the market hates uncertainty, as the old saying goes. And the coronavirus itself is a massive unknown — as is its potential impact the economy. But that's just one likely explanation. Here are three more reasons why investors didn't react well to the Fed's medicine on Tuesday."}
{"original": "1. Maybe the Fed made the market panic worse"}
{"original": "What has helped drive up stocks the past few years is something market watchers call FOMO, or fear of missing out. Now the market seems to be sliding because of a new fear — that Fed officials may know something scary the rest of us don't."}
{"original": "The Dow rebounded by more than 1,000 points on Monday and was up on Tuesday morning. But within 20 minutes after the Fed announced its rate cut, stocks were headed down. The central bank typically cuts or raises interest rates at regularly scheduled meetings. It also usually cuts only a quarter of a percentage point. The Fed didn't stick to any of those habits."}
{"original": "That happens rarely, and typically only when the Fed is trying to head off a bad economic fall. When it's clear that is about to happen, a Fed rate cut can calm investors and boost businesses and the broader economy."}
{"original": "But when investors are not yet fretting that the economy is headed for trouble, a big surprise Fed move like the one Tuesday can create more fear, not less. And since the Fed often says it is data dependent, some investors may be wondering what data the Fed may have seen that caused policy makers to opt for an emergency rate cut."}
{"original": "The Fed acting made investors' worries more real, said Tim Duy, a noted Fed watcher and economics professor at the University of Oregon."}
{"original": "2. Maybe lower interest rates won't work this time"}
{"original": "There are a number of reasons why lower rates tend to lift stocks. But the simplest has to do with lending. When interest rates drop, it's cheaper to borrow money. When it's cheaper to borrow, people and business tend to take out more loans. They spend and invest some of that money, which drives economic growth."}
{"original": "What's not clear is that this standard monetary remedy is the right cure for an epidemic-induced economic downturn, according to David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management."}
{"original": "One reason is that a coronavirus-led decline could be particularly hard on service sector companies, like restaurants and stores, as opposed to construction firms and factories. The latter are typically the types of businesses that borrow a lot and would benefit the most from lower interest rates. But even for manufacturers, it's not clear how much the lower interest rates could help, Kelly wrote in a note to clients."}
{"original": "Many years of very low interest rates suggest that there is very little economic activity that is being held in check by financing costs anyway, Kelly said."}
{"original": "Fed Chairman Jerome Powell declined to say at a brief press conference following the rate cut news whether he thought other stimulative measures, like a tax cut or major federal spending on health care materials and infrastructure, would do a better job of rescuing the economy from a recession."}
{"original": "But if the coronavirus turns Americans into a nation of shut-ins for a prolonged period of time, even tax cuts won't help that much."}
{"original": "Economic theory doesn't tell you what to do, former Fed economist Eisenbeis said. This is what uncertainty is about."}
{"original": "3. Maybe coronavirus might spread inflation"}
{"original": "There's still a possibility that the coronavirus outbreak might not turn out to be as bad as it is appears. But some market watchers said the Fed slashing interest rates may be stoking a new investor concern: inflation."}
{"original": "The number of coronavirus cases appears to be dropping in China. If the outbreak turns out not to be a pandemic, the economy is likely to snap back in short order. And if the Fed doesn't move quickly to raise interest rates, then the pent-up demand is likely to drive a sharp increase in economic activity — driving up prices and otherwise fueling inflation."}
{"original": "Even if that doesn't happen, more inflation in the wake of the coronavirus is likely headed our way, if only because the combination of more people shut in and spending and fewer people outside and working could stoke demand for goods and lead to rising prices."}
{"original": "Even if the coronavirus outbreak ends up being not all that bad, meanwhile, it will likely change corporate behavior. More companies may not be comfortable relying on China or other countries for their supply chains. If more manufacturing comes back to America, that likely will increase the costs of production and boost prices."}
{"original": "The best case is that the virus will go away, but it will still have lasting implications, Bianco said. There will be less globalism and more inflation."}
{"original": "The University of Oregon's Duy said that while Tuesday's stock drop will lead many people to conclude that the Fed messed up, it might not mean that at all. There is an adage on Wall Street: Buy on the rumor, sell on the news. In other words, the stock market jumped on Monday on the rumor that the Fed was set to lower interest rates, and it dropped on Tuesday when the bank delivered the cut."}
{"original": "And that's all we may be seeing — not investors carefully making a call on whether a rate cut was needed or not. What's more, stock movements increasingly are propelled by momentum following computerized trading that buys and sells millions of shares in mere seconds. That may increase how much stocks rise and fall, but it may not make those moves any more meaningful."}
{"original": "It's dangerous to try to get too inside the mind of traders, Duy said. It could be nothing more than positioning. The pressure to sell is quite large right now."}
{"original": "BEAU VALLON, Seychelles -- Beneath the crystal-clear waters of the Indian Ocean island nation of the Seychelles, a fight is growing to save the coral reefs that shelter a range of creatures -- from tiny invertebrates to the sprawling octopus -- from climate change. The fragile reefs act both as a protective barrier for coastlines and an attraction for the tourists who keep the country's economy going. But the reefs are also one of the first victims of rising ocean temperatures."}
{"original": "The Seychelles in some areas lost up to 90 percent of its coral reefs in 1998 in an environmental event known as bleaching, where coral in warming waters expel the colorful algae that live within their skeletons and, without their nutrients, starve. Another bleaching event occurred in 2016 after the reefs had partly recovered, said David Rowat, chairman of the Marine Conservation Society Seychelles."}
{"original": "With further threats including overfishing and pollution, coral reefs around the world will reach their tipping point before the end of the century, disappearing more quickly than they can restore themselves, according to a study published in the journal Science last month."}

{"original": "In this Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2018 file photo, a small island is seen above and below the water in the Seychelles. The Ocean Agency via AP"}
{"original": "Already, conservationists have launched a number of coral reef restoration projects around the nation's 115 islands. In one, more than 50,000 coral fragments have been nurtured and transplanted by a local charity, Nature Seychelles, in what the organization calls the world's largest coral restoration program."}
{"original": "The Marine Conservation Society has both land- and ocean-based coral nursery sites."}
{"original": "On a recent afternoon, an employee at one site in Beau Vallon painstakingly cleaned a nursery tank with a toothbrush. She and project leader Chloe Pozas spent the morning transferring tiny coral fragments, once collected from the sea floor, from the tanks to an underwater rope nursery, or improvised skeleton."}
{"original": "When the corals are going to reach a suitable size, when they are big enough, they are going to be outplanted back on the reef, Pozas said."}
{"original": "About 2,800 kilometers -- 1,700 miles -- away off the island of Curieuse, the Seychelles National Park Authority has been moving corals grown in another rope nursery."}
{"original": "Divers delicately transfer the tiny corals to a degraded reef in a national marine park, then attach them using non-toxic epoxy resin."}
{"original": "After the 2016 bleaching event, experts noticed that some corals were more resilient than others. Those super corals were chosen for regrowth and transplanting."}
{"original": "Restoration is really only a tool to try to help the reef to recover faster, especially because coral bleaching is projected to happen annually by 2050, Pozas said."}
{"original": "The Seychelles government is working with Nature Seychelles to secure funding for a proposal to upscale coral farming efforts to a larger operation using new methods. The aim is to commercialize part of the operation so that it can financially sustain reef restoration well into the future, according to Nature Seychelles."}
{"original": "Those whose livelihoods rely on tourism are watching the efforts with interest."}
{"original": "Obviously we have divers and snorklers and if we can continue to have healthy reefs and lots of fish, we got happy divers, they do lots of dives, the dive center makes more business, the government gets more tax money and everybody is happy, said Glynis Rowat, who has managed one of the oldest diving centers in Beau Vallon for over 30 years."}
{"original": "The idea of hiking taxes on the richest Americans is having its moment. Leading Democrats in Congress, including some expected to run for president in 2020, are floating proposals. Respected experts on inequality are preaching the gospel of redistributing wealth. Even the country's most prominent banker, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, endorses the concept."}
{"original": "And the public? They're game, too -- and by a wide margin. The issue is rekindling an old debate between advocates for a progressive wealth tax who say it would raise federal revenue while shrinking the gap between rich and poor, and detractors who argue it would demoralize job creators and discourage investment."}
{"original": "The question now: Will the debate over raising taxes on the rich crystallize into a serious policy push or crash on the shoals of partisanship in Washington?"}
{"original": "Seventy-six percent of registered voters agree that the wealthiest Americans should pay more in taxes, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll released this week. A recent Fox News survey found that 70 percent of respondents -- including 54 percent of Republicans -- expressed support for raising taxes on those who earn more than $10 million a year."}
{"original": "Potential presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren is among the high-profile Democrats who have drawn support for their proposals to increase taxes on the rich. Her Ultra-Millionaire Tax, aimed at the richest 0.1 percent of Americans, would impose a 2 percent wealth tax on individuals with average gross annual income of $7.3 million and net worth more than $50 million; people worth $1 billion and up would see a wealth tax of 3 percent."}
{"original": "For decades, a small group of families has raked in a massive amount of the wealth American workers have produced, while America's middle class has been hollowed out. The result is an extreme concentration of wealth no seen in any other leading economy, the Massachusetts Democrat said in introducing the bill."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, on Thursday articulated the perspective found among many conservatives."}
{"original": "The top quarter of income earners pays 87 percent -- please don't tell me they don't pay their fair share, he told reporters outside the White House. The top 1 percent pays more than the bottom 90 percent. Pardon me for this editorial. But I do not want to see prosperity killing job killing incentive killing policies."}
{"original": "A salve for inequality, backers say"}
{"original": "Backers of Warren's proposal say it would help curb inequality, which has been on the rise in the U.S. since the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan began hacking tax rates."}
{"original": "The result has been a boom in top incomes of the richest Americans, Eileen Applebaum, co-director of the Center for Economic Policy and Research, a liberal-leaning think tank, said Wednesday at a panel in Washington hosted by the Congressional Progressive Caucus to discuss tax policy."}
{"original": "University of California Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two of the leading scholars on inequality, estimate that Warren's wealth tax would affect an estimated 75,000 American households and would raise around $2.7 trillion over 10 years."}
{"original": "The point of high top marginal income tax rates is to constrain the immoderate, and especially unmerited, accumulation of riches, they wrote last month in a New York Times op-ed."}

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, in January said the government should tax incomes exceeding $10 million at a rate of 70 percent, a policy she said would help fund a Green New Deal in the fight against climate change."}

{"original": "A Hill-HarrisX survey shows that 59 percent of Americans support Ocasio-Cortez's proposal."}
{"original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, is another progressive voice calling for increasing federal tax rates for the wealthiest Americans. Sanders, who many expect to run for president in 2020, favors a top tax rate of 77 percent on estates worth more than $1 billion; that would affect the wealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans."}
{"original": "We are not taking care of ourselves... and we are falling farther and farther behind what normal countries all over the place are achieving, Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs said at the Congressional Progressive Caucus event, pointing to Canada and to Scandanavian countries, where the top marginal tax rates exceed 45 percent."}
{"original": "Some wealthy Americans are weighing in, too -- in favor of higher taxes. JPMorgan Chase's Dimon, who is reportedly a billionaire, said people in his income bracket can and should pay more, as long as the revenue is used effectively."}
{"original": "Individuals earning the most can afford to pay more, and I have no problem paying higher taxes to address some of the fundamental challenges and inequities in our society, Dimon recently told Bloomberg."}
{"original": "Investor Warren Buffett has also long called for a tax hike on the wealthy. In a 2011 op-ed for The New York Times, he wrote that most of his mega-rich friends wouldn't mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering."}
{"original": "He also dismissed detractors' notion that higher tax rates discourage investment. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off, he said."}
{"original": "Despite the recent hubbub over proposals to jack up tax rates on the rich, they're probably not going anywhere, according to economist Martin Sullivan."}
{"original": "It's highly unlikely that there is any chance of enactment, he said. The only scenario in which it could be enacted is if in 2020 the Democrats took control of both houses and the White House. And even if that did occur, it would still be highly unlikely because of better alternatives and because of the inability to administer such a tax as a wealth tax, he said."}
{"original": "He outlined some of the challenges associated with enforcing a wealth tax, including closing loopholes and accurately assessing how much individuals are worth."}
{"original": "It's politically useful for Democrats to talk about taxing the rich more, and this is a dramatic way of drawing attention to that, Sullivan said. However, as a practical matter I wouldn't waste much time on it."}

{"original": "Staffing reductions through mid-year, including hundreds of executives and managers, are projected to total approximately 4,000 positions -- none of which involve involuntary layoffs. We've been able to reduce staffing levels through attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, and voluntary layoffs. We'll only use involuntary layoffs as a last resort."}

{"original": "He is in poor health. He is 81 years old, David Markus, the attorney for cocaine kingpin Gilberto Rodriguez-Orejuela, wrote in emergency court papers this week seeking his release after serving about half of a 30-year drug-trafficking sentence.

{"original": "In New York, public defenders asked judges to release older and at-risk inmates from the city's beleaguered federal jails, saying pretrial confinement creates the ideal environment for the transmission of contagious disease. The motions cite a provision of the Bail Reform Act allowing for the temporary release of pretrial inmates under compelling circumstances."}
{"original": "I truly believe the jails are ticking time bombs, said David Patton, executive director of the Federal Defenders of New York. They're overcrowded and unsanitary in the best of times. They don't provide appropriate medical care in the best of times, and these certainly are not the best of times."}

{"original": "In Los Angeles, the nation's largest jail system has trimmed its population by more than 600 since Feb. 28, allowing many inmates with fewer than 30 days left on their sentences to be released early. In Cleveland, judges held a special session over the weekend to settle cases with guilty pleas and release more than 200 low-level, non-violent inmates. And in Miami, the top state attorney has urged the release of all non-violent felons and those being held on misdemeanors."}
{"original": "No judge wants to have a dead prisoner on his conscience, said Bill Breeze, a Miami defense attorney."}
{"original": "New York City's Board of Correction this week called for the immediate release of all high-risk inmates after an an investigator assigned to the jail system died over the weekend of the coronavirus. The 56-year-old man was said to have a pre-existing health condition and only limited contact with inmates. The city's jail system has about 8,000 inmates, most at notorious Rikers Island."}
{"original": "However, accommodating the surge of requests poses its own challenge. Courts around the country are shutting down, with only a skeletal staff working. The chief federal judge in Brooklyn on Monday postponed indefinitely all criminal and civil jury trials, encouraging judges to conduct court business via telephone or video conferencing when possible, and to delay in-person proceedings."}
{"original": "Prosecutors said in court filings that the Federal Bureau of Prisons has been planning for the outbreak since January, including by establishing a task force with experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The BOP on Friday suspended visitation for all federal inmates, facility transfers, staff travel and training for 30 days. Newly arriving inmates are being screened for COVID-19, and even asymptomatic inmates deemed to be at risk are being quarantined. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it would take similar steps."}
{"original": "Public health officials stress that older people and those with existing health problems are most at risk from coronavirus but that the vast majority of people will only suffer mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, with recovery in a matter of weeks."}

{"original": "General Electric (GE), for decades an industrial bellwether in the U.S., is considering breaking up."}
{"original": "In a special call with analysts on Tuesday to discuss the company's lackluster results, CEO John Flannery acknowledged that a breakup is one strategic option GE is exploring."}
{"original": "I would categorize it as an examination of options and it's [the] kind of thing that could result in many, many different permutations, including separately traded assets, really, in any one of our units, if that's what made sense, he said when asked about the company's previously announced plans to disposed of poorly performing businesses."}
{"original": "He cited two GE units that are now independent: Baker Hughes, an oilfield services company that is majority-owned by GE, and Synchrony Financial, which became an independent financial company in 2015. That's something we'd consider for other parts of the company, whether that's power, aviation or health care, he said."}
{"original": "Flannery, who took over as CEO in August, said late last year that GE planned to shed business units worth more than $20 billion over the next year or two. The company has been sell underperforming and non-core assets for over a decade now in a return to its industrial roots. It is the only component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average that was part of the original index."}
{"original": "GE's stock has had a dismal year, falling 40 percent while the S&P 500 rose nearly 23 percent. Shares of GE were down 3.4 percent in early trading Tuesday. The company is set to report results for the fourth quarter of 2017 next week."}
{"original": "The company is taking a $6.2 billion after-tax charge in the fourth quarter tied to its review and reserve testing of GE Capital's runoff insurance portfolio. GE Capital will also suspend its dividend to GE for the foreseeable future."}
{"original": "GE said last year that it would review its insurance reserves, particularly long-term polices generated by primary insurers, which were then re-insured by GE Capital and the holdings of its North American Live and Health. GE Capital plans to make statutory reserve contributions of about $15 billion over seven years. It will contribute about $3 billion in 2018's first quarter and approximately $2 billion annually from 2019 through 2024."}
{"original": "Flannery reiterated that the focus of the Boston company remains on making GE Capital smaller and more focused."}
{"original": "His words showed that the CEO was now open to a more transformative breakup scenario than the one he had previously communicated, Deane Dray, analyst for RCB Capital Markets, wrote in a note after the call. Our view is that investors are looking at a wholesale breakup as the logical conclusion of this extended GE saga, though whether or not it transpires will depend on how successfully GE is able to address the ongoing structural challenges in Power."}
{"original": "President Biden urged the Senate to move quickly to pass his American Rescue Plan, hours after the House narrowly approved the $1.9 trillion legislation. In brief remarks on Saturday morning, Mr. Biden said he had spoken to Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the passage of the bill."}
{"original": "Now, the bill moves to the United States Senate, where I hope it will receive quick action. We have no time to waste, Mr. Biden said. If we act now, decisively, quickly and boldly, we can finally get ahead of this virus. We can finally get our economy moving again. And the people of this country have suffered far too much for too long. We need to relieve that suffering. The American Rescue Plan does just that."}
{"original": "Two Democrats, Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Jared Golden of Maine, voted with Republicans in the 219-212 vote early Saturday morning. Not one Republican voted for the bill. The legislation includes $1,400 in direct checks for Americans making under $75,000, a $400 per week supplemental unemployment bonus, money for vaccine distribution, and funding to aid schools and state and local governments."}
{"original": "The House bill also includes a provision raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, even though the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the bill could not include an increase of the federal minimum wage if Congress uses the budget reconciliation process. Congressional Democrats opted to use the procedural maneuver known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, allowing it to be approved by only a simple majority in the Senate."}
{"original": "In the wake of the parliamentarian's ruling, Senate Democrats are now racing to finalize a new tax provision that would penalize large companies that pay low wages. The plan being drafted by aides to Senate Finance Committee chair Ron Wyden of Oregon — in close consultation with Senate Budget Chair Bernie Sanders of Vermont — would impose a 5% payroll tax penalty on very large companies that do not pay workers a certain amount."}
{"original": "Congressional Democrats hope to get the finalized package to Mr. Biden's desk by mid-March, before the expiration of several critical relief programs that were established by Congress at the end of last year."}
{"original": "California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a $7.6 billion coronavirus relief package on Tuesday that will give at least $600 one-time payments to 5.7 million people while setting aside more than $2 billion in grants for struggling small businesses."}
{"original": "Newsom signed the law as Congress is debating a much larger stimulus package for the nation, a proposal that could also put money into the pockets of most Americans. And it comes as the first-term governor is facing a recall effort fueled in part by widespread anger over his handling of the coronavirus, particularly its impact on businesses."}
{"original": "The backbone of our economy is small business. We recognize the stress, the strain that so many small business have been under, Newsom said at a bill-signing ceremony at Solomon's Deli in Sacramento. And we recognize as well our responsibility to do more and to do better to help support these small businesses through this very difficult and trying time."}
{"original": "The Newsom administration still bans indoor dining in most of the state while limiting how many people can enter retail stores at the same time. Newsom has said Tuesday the state will ease those restrictions in five counties, with more to come in the coming weeks as the number of new infections have fallen in recent weeks along with coronavirus-related hospitalizations."}
{"original": "Newsom used his emergency powers in November to set aside $500 million for small business grants. In the first round of funding, the program received more than 334,000 applications totaling more than $4.4 billion in requests."}
{"original": "The law Newsom signed on Thursday puts another $2 billion into that program. Businesses with annual revenues between $1,000 and $2.5 million are eligible for the money, with a priority given to businesses owned by women and minorities and businesses in areas with high unemployment rates."}
{"original": "The Legislature will likely approve more aid for businesses next week. Lawmakers had planned to pass a bill on Monday that would have let businesses deduct up to $150,000 in expenses covered by federal loans from their state taxes - a $2 billion benefit over six years. But they decided to amend the bill to let businesses deduct more than $150,000 from their taxes, raising the price tag for the state to about $2.3 billion, Newsom said."}
{"original": "Once that law is passed, it will bring the total state stimulus package to just under $10 billion."}
{"original": "That's big even for California standards, Newsom said."}
{"original": "The package includes $3.7 billion to pay at least $600 in one-time payments to about 5.7 million people. Most of these people will get the money by claiming the California earned income tax credit on their tax returns. In general, those are people who make $30,000 per year or less."}
{"original": "The money will also go to people who earn under $75,000 per year and use an individual taxpayer identification number to file their income taxes. These are people who don't have Social Security numbers, including immigrants who were ineligible for the federal stimulus payments Congress approved last year."}
{"original": "For millions of Americans, the beginning of the year means that tax time is right around the corner, and the majority of households will be receiving a tax refund. Tax season starts a little later this year than in recent years, but Americans who file their returns electronically and choose to have their refund directly deposited could get their refund as soon as mid-February."}
{"original": "The IRS filing season start date is Jan. 29"}
{"original": "The IRS recently announced that tax filing season will start on Jan. 29, 2018, for 2017 tax returns. This is the date when the IRS will begin accepting individual tax returns that are electronically submitted."}
{"original": "It's also important to note that while both electronic and paper tax returns will be accepted beginning Jan. 29, the IRS doesn't anticipate processing paper tax returns until mid-February due to system updates that have not yet been completed. Most people file electronically these days, but if you still file a paper tax return, be aware that the processing of your return could be delayed, in addition to the other time delays that come with filing a paper tax return, such as the time it takes to mail it."}
{"original": "Another point to note is that just because you can file on Jan. 29, doesn't mean that you'll be ready to do so. Some tax documents don't even need to be sent to individuals until mid-February, so be sure you've received all of the documentation you need before submitting a return."}
{"original": "Refund times and delays beyond the typical 21 days"}
{"original": "Obviously, if you want to get your refund as quickly as possible, you need to file as soon as possible after the Jan. 29 tax season start date."}
{"original": "While the IRS doesn't commit to a specific refund time based on when you submit your return, the agency does say that it anticipates more than 90% of refunds will be issued within 21 days. In other words, most people who submit their returns at the start of filing season can expect their refunds in mid-to-late February. However, there are several factors that could cause your refund to take longer, such as the need for the IRS to review or verify certain information. Also, after the IRS processes a refund, it can take additional time to be processed by your financial institution."}
{"original": "If you want an estimate of when you might receive your tax refund, my colleague Dan Caplinger recently made an excellent refund estimation chart for different filing dates, filing methods, and refund methods. As you might expect, the combination of electronic filing and direct deposit typically results in the fastest possible refund."}
{"original": "For the most accurate estimate, after you submit your return and it is accepted by the IRS, the IRS's Where's My Refund tool can give you a good idea of when you can expect your money."}
{"original": "In addition to the processing delay for paper tax returns that I discussed earlier, there are some other factors that could cause your refund to be delayed, especially if you file soon after tax season begins."}
{"original": "Specifically, if you claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), the IRS cannot issue you a refund until mid-February at the earliest. According to a recent bulletin from the IRS, the earliest date the agency anticipates refunds being available in bank accounts of households claiming these credits is Feb. 27."}
{"original": "One other reason to file as soon as possible: the Equifax breach"}
{"original": "In addition to the obvious motivation of getting your tax refund as soon as possible, filing your tax return as soon as possible after filing season begins can also help you avoid becoming a victim of identity theft."}
{"original": "Specifically, one major variety of identity theft involves criminals filing phony tax returns under the names of unsuspecting Americans with the purpose of claiming a refund to which they aren't entitled. And while the IRS has gotten much better about detecting and preventing fraudulent returns over the past few years -- improved safeguards helped it stop 787,000 fraudulent returns in 2016 -- this is still a major threat, especially considering the recent massive Equifax data breach."}
{"original": "Here's where filing early can help. The IRS only accepts one return per Social Security number, so if you get your return in as soon as possible, thieves who attempt to steal a refund using your name could find themselves out of luck."}
{"original": "The bottom line is that it can be smart to file your tax return as soon as you can, even if you aren't entitled to a refund. If you end up owing the IRS money, you still have until the April 17 tax deadline to pay the balance, and doing so can prevent the headaches involved with finding out that someone other than you has already filed under your name."}

{"original": "PARIS -- French authorities are investigating the taxes of designer Karl Lagerfeld, who a French magazine claims used offshore tax havens to avoid paying millions of euros to the French government."}
{"original": "The case is the latest involving allegations of high-end tax evasion in France, where the finance ministry has cracked down on fraud in recent years to ease budget strain."}
{"original": "Lagerfeld had no wish to evade the law, and trusts his financial advisers to work out the situation with the tax authorities, Caroline Lebar, a spokeswoman for the designer, said Thursday. She would not comment on the specific allegations in L'Express magazine, saying only that a tax procedure is under way."}
{"original": "The national tax service would not comment on an ongoing case."}
{"original": "The case does not concern Chanel, where Lagerfeld has been chief designer since the 1980s, and Chanel would not comment Thursday."}

{"original": "Pronounced market volatility of late has resulted in some panicky trading. But rather than get alarmed by the frenzied activity, investors should learn to embrace the zigs and zags and make it work for them."}
{"original": "Although volatility could remain a staple of the markets in 2018, There is no need to panic, said Joseph P. Quinlan, head of Market & Thematic Strategy at Bank of America Global Wealth & Management & US Trust. Non-recessionary market pullbacks tend to be relatively short-lived, he said in a research note, while major one-day market selloffs, historically, are typically followed by better than average returns."}
{"original": "Despite the recent market swings, the U.S. remains in good shape and the global economy is firing on virtually all cylinders, Quinlan said. For now, he added, stronger economic growth, the tailwinds from tax reform and a currently weak dollar all point to higher corporate earnings."}
{"original": "He reiterated that investors need to diversify and rebalance portfolios where appropriate after last year's robust gains in equities. Quinlan also noted that market downdrafts are generally frequent, typically shallow in duration, and often result in higher returns down the road."}
{"original": "A lot of the recent market volatility stems from computerized trading systems and some cockamamie algorithm–driven ETFs, noted market analyst Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, who says he remains bullish on stocks despite the wild market action."}
{"original": "We remain focused on the outlook for earnings, which remains fundamentally sound for stocks, Yardeni said. With the benefit of hindsight, We are thinking that perhaps the melt-up scenario in the S&P 500, which we had been anticipating since early 2013, might have ended at this year's January 26 record high, when the index was up 57.1 percent, measured from February 11, 2016 (that's year's low), Yardeni said."}
{"original": "So what now that the market's melt-up/melt-down scenario may have already played out?"}
{"original": "We are lowering the odds of another melt-up in stocks, to 30 percent from the 70 percent melt-up odds we have since January 16 (when we we had raised the odds from 55 percent), Yardeni said. And we are keeping the melt-down scenario at 25 percent."}
{"original": "So the odds of a more leisurely-paced bull market are now the greatest of the three scenarios, at 45 percent, Yardeni said."}

{"original": "With children possibly gone from the home and maybe out of school, you may have more money on hand now, and it's tempting to spend it. After all, your friends may be living it up, and you've worked hard to get here. Have fun. But don't shortchange retirement goals. If you are well-employed, your 50s are a gift — probably the best earning years of your life. Double down on savings, as retirement may last a long, long time."}
{"original": "Also, start thinking about how you'll change your spending after retirement."}
{"original": "Set a concrete goal for your retirement savings. Just do it. The kids will find a way to pay for college if it matters to them. They have years to get on their feet financially. You do not. Set a retirement income goal now so that, if you're short financially, there's time to improve things."}
{"original": "There are a couple of approaches. One is to shoot for saving six to nine times your annual household income by your mid-50s to early 60s, says Walter Updegrave, at Real Deal Retirement. Example: If you earn $60,000 a year, your IRA, 401(k) or other account should approach $360,000 to $540,000 as you near 60."}
{"original": "Another is to see how far your current retirement savings will take you. This KeyBank calculator shows that a nest egg of $1 million will last 21 years if you withdraw $50,000 a year (assuming inflation is 2.5 percent and investments earn 3 percent after tax and inflation). Only have $100,000 saved? It'll buy you two years of retirement at the same rate of spending."}
{"original": "4. Retirement contributions: Inching up steadily"}
{"original": "Now that you have a goal, keep increasing the percent of each paycheck saved for retirement. Make the increases so small they're hardly noticeable. If you're diverting 12 percent to savings now, bump it up to 13 percent, or 13.5 percent. Six months later, give your savings another tiny raise and keep it going until you're at goal. Ditto if you're saving 6 percent: Inch it up to 7 percent, and then onward."}
{"original": "Some experts recommend saving 15 percent to 20 percent or more of before-tax salary. Automate the deductions, so you'll never see the money. Getting a bonus? Put a hefty chunk into retirement savings."}
{"original": "The rock-bottom line: Even in the worst times, save at least enough to earn your employer's maximum matching contribution."}
{"original": "5. Social Security: On track for the max"}
{"original": "You may be pessimistic about Social Security's chances, and you could be right to expect cuts in payouts or a change in eligibility ages. But Social Security isn't going bust. Before long, though, Congress must either find more funding or shrink benefits."}
{"original": "But don't bet against this retirement lifeline. It still is likely to be one source of income in your retirement, and there are things you can do now to maximize your payout."}
{"original": "Go to SocialSecurity.gov and set up a My Social Security account. Use it to estimate your future benefits at various retirement ages. Social Security benefits are based on your best 35 years of earnings, so plan to work longer if you need to boost those earning years."}
{"original": "Fees paid to manage retirement savings may appear low. What's 3.5 percent but a drop in the bucket? you think. Wrong!"}
{"original": "Many savers unknowingly pay far too much in mutual fund fees, losing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars they could have used in retirement. This chart offers an example, from an informative video by the U.S. Department of Labor, showing how fees affect two accounts that started with identical balances of $25,000 -- given no additional contributions. One pays 1 percent more in fees than the other -- but the resulting difference in balance after 35 years is $64,000."}
{"original": "Check your plan statements to see the fees you are charged. Time Magazine explains:"}
{"original": "… you can minimize fees by opting for the lowest-cost funds available — typically index funds, which tend to be less expensive than actively managed funds. And if your IRA is too pricey, move it elsewhere."}
{"original": "You don't need a will. If you don't have one, a probate court will decide what to do with your assets."}
{"original": "If you want control over what happens to your money and property, though, you'll need one. And your spouse should have a separate will."}
{"original": "A will gives voice to your decisions and requests after you're gone. Use it to say what you want for your children and pets after you're gone. Use it to determine what happens to possessions with financial or sentimental value. You can name an executor who will be in charge of following your directions and include provisions for your remains and a funeral, if you want one."}
{"original": "Committing to doing good in the world is a part of maturing. With a small budget or a large one, philanthropy allows you to express your values and connects you to the world on new terms. There's the personal satisfaction, and there's also a helpful tax deduction."}
{"original": "9. Long-term care: A plan in mind"}
{"original": "By our 50th birthday, it occurs to many of us that maybe -- just maybe -- we really will get old. Since many of us will end up needing skilled nursing care in old age, at least for a short time, managing your finances requires considering how to pay for it. Long-term care insurance can be an excellent tool. But whether it's right for you depends on several things."}
{"original": "Entering retirement with a paid-off mortgage is a smart goal. Tearing up the mortgage before retirement was commonplace a couple of generations ago. Not everyone can pull it off these days, but the rewards are great. You'll require less income. If your mortgage eats a quarter or a third or more of your monthly pay, you'll enjoy a raise of that much, just when your paychecks stop. What's more, it's a tax-free raise."}
{"original": "11. Insurance: Reviewed and adjusted accordingly"}
{"original": "Life changes, and so should your insurance. If your children or spouse would be lost without your salary, get enough life insurance to carry them through if you die. Stick with cheaper term insurance (low-fee index funds, not life insurance products, are a cheaper way to save for retirement)."}
{"original": "Likewise, if losing your salary would be financially devastating, cover the risk with disability insurance."}
{"original": "When children are launched in careers and you and your spouse are nearer retirement, you may be able to drop life insurance."}
{"original": "Take a look at your home and auto insurance limits, too. Is the coverage still appropriate?"}
{"original": "As for heath insurance, enlist an insurance broker -- it should cost you nothing -- to review your health insurance needs and costs. If you have a high-deductible plan, total your most recent year's out-of-pocket expenses to make certain that you still are coming out ahead."}

{"original": "Support for clean energy in the U.S. has risen to record highs in recent surveys, but adoption of those clean energy sources is lagging far behind."}
{"original": "While a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, their energy production was mostly replaced by natural gas instead of renewable energy like wind or solar, according to a report by independent research provider Rhodium Group. The report estimates that in 2018 the U.S. posted the largest increase in heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions since 2010, up 3.4 percent."}
{"original": "Before 2018, the U.S. had three straight years of emissions declines despite economic growth. But last year the economy grew faster, illustrating the difficulty of kicking our addiction to fossil fuels when our economic engine revs up. Rhodium Group explains, Some of this was due to unusually cold weather at the start of the year. But it also highlights the limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies."}
{"original": "Many Americans support making that transition. A March 2018 study, Politics and Global Warming, by researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities, finds majority support across party lines for developing cleaner energy."}
{"original": "In that survey, 87 percent of registered voters (94 percent of Democrats and 79 percent of Republicans) favor funding more research into renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power."}
{"original": "These views are echoed in a recent Pew Research Center study which found large majorities of Americans favor expanding at least two types of renewable sources to provide energy: solar panel (89%) and wind turbine (85%) facilities."}
{"original": "At a time when political polarization divides Americans on so many issues, these points of agreement may seem surprising. But agreement is not enough. For an energy transition to happen, policy and incentives are needed."}
{"original": "For people, corporations, and governments to take action they're going to have to have incentives, William Nordhaus, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on putting a price on carbon, wrote in a recent Yale Alumni Magazine article."}
{"original": "Incentives require specific government policy action. We can find clues to why this is tough to come by deeper in the Pew study. While Democrats are generally supportive of policies to combat climate change, most Republicans are skeptical. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans or Republican-leaning voters say these policies either make no difference or do more harm than good, and 57 percent think such policies harm the economy."}
{"original": "But there are signs of growing support for market-driven solutions among younger conservatives. According to the Pew study, Republican Millennials are less inclined than their elders in the GOP to support increased use of fossil fuel energy sources through such methods as offshore drilling, hydraulic fracturing and coal mining. For example, 75% of Republicans in the Baby Boomer and older generations support the increased use of offshore drilling, compared with 44% of Millennial Republicans."}
{"original": "Former Congressman Ryan Costello (R-Pennsylvania) just left the U.S. House of Representatives and is now the new managing director of Americans for Carbon Dividends, an advocacy affiliate of the Climate Leadership Council. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed this week he laid out the case for a Republican plan to tackle climate change, citing, in part, the need to keep younger Republicans on board."}
{"original": "In his new work, Costello is aiming to advance a plan by former GOP Secretaries of State James Baker and George Shultz, fine-tuning the details of a bill which would put a fee on carbon dioxide emissions and return the proceeds to individuals and families on a quarterly basis."}
{"original": "The plan claims, Over two-thirds of American households would be financial winners under a carbon dividends program, including the most vulnerable. The aim is to increase the cost and disincentivize use of products that generate carbon pollution, encouraging industries and consumers to opt for greener alternatives instead."}
{"original": "Even though the group says its carbon fee plan would return money to Americans' pockets, it may still be seen as a tax. In reply, Costello says, I learned in Congress that no major policy solution comes without simplified rebuttals, which often aren't accurate. If families are receiving a check every three months and carbon emitters are transitioning to the cleaner energy, everyone comes out ahead."}
{"original": "Ed Maibach is a professor at George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication and co-author of the Politics and Global Warming study. Commenting in general on policy, not specifically on the Climate Leadership Council plan, he says his public opinion research finds strong support for a range of climate solutions policies, even when we mention the costs explicitly. Sometimes, policy support actually increases when we mention the estimated cost per household, for example, about 50 cents per day, probably because the projected costs strike people as a good deal."}
{"original": "Besides work on the bill, Costello plans to spend his time on education, advocacy and building grassroots coalitions that allow people to kick the tires on climate policy."}
{"original": "He recognizes he has an uphill battle selling this to Congress. But he says, You can't solve big challenges without ambitious solutions. That's what this seeks to do."}

{"original": "In an accompanying Facebook post, the officer explained that the stop was legitimate -- he said the driver had been traveling 11 miles over the speed limit in an 80 mph zone -- but that he was a salaried employee and the prank was carried out on his own time. He said his decision to give the driver a warning was also legitimate."}
{"original": "No tax payer dollars were spent in relation to this video, he wrote. ...My sweet cat Froo Froo was not injured during this incident."}
{"original": "The union representing thousands of IRS workers warn that furloughed employees may not be able to return to work next week when taxpayers start filing their tax returns and seek refunds on their 2018 taxes."}
{"original": "Under their contract, IRS employees who are asked to work during a government shutdown can claim financial hardship, allowing them to remain furloughed. It's unclear how many IRS workers have asked for the exemption, but the union said Wednesday its members are experiencing real hardship as the shutdown enters its fifth week"}
{"original": "The IRS recalled tens of thousands of furloughed workers earlier this month as tax season kicks off Jan. 28. Trump administration officials have vowed that tax refunds will go out on time, but the record shutdown -- 33 days as of Wednesday -- has caused financial stress for many IRS workers, the union said. That raises questions about whether processing of returns and refunds will be slowed when filing begins on Monday."}
{"original": "After a month with no pay, real hardship does exist for IRS employees including not having the money needed to get back and forth to work or to pay for the child care necessary to return to work right now, Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. The NTEU represents about 70,000 IRS workers."}
{"original": "The IRS said it is continuing its recall of furloughed workers, but declined further comment. The IRS is continuing its work in preparation for next week's filing season, it said in a statement. We continue to assess the situation at this time."}
{"original": "The agreement between the IRS and the NTEU covers work policies during government shutdowns. The contract notes that most IRS employees will be furloughed, but those who are asked to work without pay can request a hardship exemption."}
{"original": "The employer will consider an employee's request not to work due to a hardship, the contract stipulates."}
{"original": "While the NTEU didn't disclose how many IRS workers have applied for exemptions, hundreds have received them, according to the Washington Post. To be sure, that's a small number compared with the thousands of workers who have been recalled, yet it's unclear whether more workers may claim the exemption if the shutdown continues."}
{"original": "The longer employees go without pay, more face financial hardships, Reardon said. NTEU does not support employees using it as a form of protest, but we do support people using it for true financial hardship."}
{"original": "With four days to go until Monday's Iowa caucuses, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is ramping up his rhetoric and taking direct shots at two of his top rivals for the Democratic nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders."}
{"original": "CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman says Buttigieg has tried to position himself as the candidate who can offer bold policy proposals while also unifying the country. His attacks on Biden and Sanders come as recent polls show him lagging behind Biden and Sanders, albeit narrowly."}
{"original": "I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, Buttigieg said Thursday at a town hall in Decorah. But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind. Buttigieg then pivoted to Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who favors Medicare for All and free college tuition at public universities."}
{"original": "I hear Senator Sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts, Buttigieg continued. And it's coming at the very moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just aligned around what it is we're against, but agreeing on what it is we're for."}
{"original": "Buttigieg's campaign has also recently sent out fundraising emails that say nominating Sanders would be a risk at a time when Democrats are desperate to reclaim the White House from President Trump."}
{"original": "Buttigieg has remained in the top tier of Democratic presidential hopefuls in early state polls, although his position may have slipped since the start of the year. The most recent Des Moines Register poll found him to be the first choice of 16% of likely Iowa caucus-goers while Sanders was the first choice of 20%. The same poll in November found Buttigieg leading the Democratic field in the state with 25% support."}
{"original": "The millennial veteran has acknowledged in recent weeks that he needs to show versus tell that he's the best candidate to face Mr. Trump with strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, which holds its first-in-the-nation primary on February 11th. He hopes that a solid finish in the first two contests will help him compete in Nevada and South Carolina, where is currently polling well behind Sanders and Biden."}
{"original": "While maintaining that the current campaign should not focus on re-litigating past issues, Buttigieg did reference the ongoing spat between Sanders and Biden over Social Security. The Vermont senator has accused Biden of being open to cutting Social Security in the past, a charge the former vice president's team disputes."}
{"original": "This is no time to get caught up in reliving arguments from before, Buttigieg said. The less 2020 resembles 2016 and our party, the better. After his town hall in Decorah, Buttigieg told reporters he is trying to clarify to caucus-goers what he stands for. We're competing, Buttigieg told reporters. It's a respectful but important competition, about what the best approach is going to be. I admire and respect everybody running for president, but we've got to make sure that we win."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson notes that at a speech in Newton, Iowa, Biden spoke about the importance of 2020 Democrats focusing on Mr. Trump and not swinging at each other. The former vice president said we shouldn't let this Democratic race slide into negative attacks. The temptation is too much for some Biden added, while highlighting President Obama's comments a few months back about 2020 hopefuls avoiding a circular firing squad."}
{"original": "Earlier in the day, Biden delivered a speech in Waukee, Iowa where he didn't name a single rival Democrat and kept his focus solely on the president. In the home stretch, Biden is making a similar pitch to the one he had from the start: The soul of the nation is at risk due to Mr. Trump's actions and moral turpitude."}
{"original": "As Joe Biden goes up on the air in Nevada with several new ads in a buy totaling $167,503 this week, per Kantar CMAG data, the former vice president's campaign is also rolling out several new endorsements in the state, according to CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Among them are two former Clark County party chairs, the vice president of the Washoe County School District Board of Trustees, and online betting CEO Joe Asher, who was listed last year as a top fundraising bundler for Biden."}
{"original": "Thursday Democratic presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg released his Super Bowl Ad, in a spot that the campaign says highlights the urgent need to prevent gun violence in America, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry."}
{"original": "The 60 second spot, titled George, will air Sunday February 2 during Super Bowl LIV. It features the story of Calandrian Simpson Kemp, a mother whose son, George Kemp Jr., was shot and killed in 2013."}
{"original": "In the aftermath of her son's death, Kemp has been an active member of Moms Demand Action. I chose to devote the entire sixty-second ad to gun safety because it matters to communities across the country and it will be a top priority for me as president, Bloomberg said in a statement released by the campaign."}
{"original": "Calandrian's story is a powerful reminder of the urgency of this issue and the failure of Washington to address it. People will be rooting for different teams in the Super Bowl, but virtually all Americans — including people in both parties and a majority of gun owners — support universal background checks and other common sense gun laws."}
{"original": "Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman, has used his enormous fortune to self-fund his campaign. Despite a late entrance into the race and his decision to skip the first four voting states, including Iowa where voting begins Monday, Bloomberg is on track to spend more than $275 million on television, radio and digital ads by the end of the week."}
{"original": "Equality California, the state's largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, and its recently-launched Nevada partner Silver State Equality announced Thursday they would be backing Pete Buttigieg after an unanimous vote by the groups' endorsement committee. CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin says the former South Bend mayor can use all the help he can get as early voting kicks off in California, where Buttigieg has failed to crack double digits in recent polls of the Super Tuesday contest."}
{"original": "While we did not endorse Mayor Pete simply because he's gay, the historic nature of his candidacy has already had a transformational impact on the LGBTQ community, Rick Zbur, the groups' executive director, said in a statement, also praising Elizabeth Warren and Tom Steyer for their extremely strong platforms."}
{"original": "Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's long-shot campaign for the presidency is betting big on a strong performance in New Hampshire, where the primary historically rewards outsiders and underdogs, on occasion. Over 42% of the state's voters here are registered as undeclared, which allows them to vote in either party's primary in February. And while other candidates focus on next week's Iowa caucuses, Gabbard has all but moved to New Hampshire, spending more days in state (a sum total of 34) than any other Democratic candidate across December and January."}
{"original": "A recent analysis by the New York Times reveals just one-fifth of Obama-Trump voters returned to the Democratic Party in the 2018 midterm elections, while three-quarters voted Republican. Roughly half of the New Hampshire towns Gabbard has visited backed Mr. Trump in 2016. Her populist, anti-war message attracts fans from both ends of the political spectrum, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and former Democratic Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. But she has struggled to attract much of any support from mainstream Democratic voters who pick their party's nominee."}
{"original": "[S]he's pulling from Trump voters. It could make it even tougher for Trump to win, particularly in states like Michigan and New Hampshire, Bannon told CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga."}
{"original": "Bernie Sanders' first TV ads to air in Super Tuesday states are up today in California and Texas. In a 30-second ad aired in Dallas and Los Angeles this morning for the first time, Sanders talks about the rich getting tax breaks while the middle class continue to struggle. That's what happens when billionaires are able control the political system, Sanders says on camera."}
{"original": "CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says he goes on to talk about his campaign being funded by the working people and says those are the people he will represent. In another ad aired in Dallas and San Francisco, a narrator talks about Sanders fighting to raise wages and for health care."}
{"original": "Our country is at a turning point. Hard working people betrayed by Trump struggling to survive, the narrator claims. In this moment, we need a fighter. Bernie Sanders, we know he'll fight for us as president because he always has, the voice concludes. According to Kantar/CMAG tracking, Sanders is on track so far to spend $1.5 million in California and more than $160,000 in Texas through February 25th, but more ad buys are likely. On Tuesday, the campaign announced it would me making $2.5 million in ad buys in the two states this week. Super Tuesday is March 3rd."}
{"original": "The Trump Campaign released one of two ads set to air during the Super Bowl on Thursday, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. The 30-second ad released Thursday morning called Stronger, Safer, More prosperous highlights the record unemployment numbers the United States has seen during the first three years of the Trump administration. According to the campaign, the other 30-second ad will not be released prior to the game."}
{"original": "With the Iowa caucuses quickly approaching, rumors are swirling around Des Moines about campaigns making alliances if their candidate doesn't hit the 15% viability threshold. I think some campaigns have reached out to our team, Andrew Yang told reporters at an event yesterday, CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe reported."}
{"original": "A source close to the Yang campaign with knowledge of the situation tells CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster that former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign reached out about a deal. The rules of the Iowa caucuses require candidates to have 15% support in a room to win delegates, meaning some people have to settle for their second or third choice. Yang said yesterday that he isn't inclined to instruct his supporters where to go if he doesn't enough support in a caucus room. I frankly think I'd have a hard time getting them to do anything that they're not naturally inclined to do, Yang said. In Waukee today, Biden ignored questions about whether his campaign is trying to make deals with other campaigns and one of his top surrogates, former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack, also sidestepped questions on the issue, according to O'Keefe."}
{"original": "A popular clergyman has announced his bid to run as a Democrat in the special election for U.S. Senate in Georgia. CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson reports that Reverend Ralphael Warnock, the pastor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Ebenezer Baptist Church, announced his U.S. Senate bid Thursday in a Twitter video. Warnock is the first high-profile candidate to enter the race."}
{"original": "Matt Lieberman, the son of former Senator Joe Lieberman, and Ed Tarver, a former attorney, are also competing for the Democratic nomination. Nevertheless, Warnock's entry could rally Democrats ahead of a fight with what may be a divided Republican Party in the Peach State."}
{"original": "The special election is being held to fill the seat held by former Senator Johnny Isakson, who resigned at the end of last year. Governor Brian Kemp appointed financial executive Kelly Loeffler to Isakson's Senate seat following his resignation at the end of 2019. Loeffler will run in the special election in November to carry out the final two years of Isakson's term, and she has the support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund. However, Congressman Doug Collins announced his bid for the seat on Wednesday, setting up what could be a bitter primary fight within the GOP."}
{"original": "Democrats are targeting a number of House seats in Georgia, as well as the state's two Senate seats. Georgia has been a Republican stronghold for decades, but Democrats hope the state's changing demographics could help them win it back this year."}
{"original": "The House Democrat campaign arm is confident in using healthcare as their central message for 2020, but didn't specify any immediate plans for any specific ads in some of the most competitive districts they have to defend, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro."}
{"original": "In a meeting with reporters on Thursday, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Cheri Bustos detailed the party's million-dollar national cable ad buy, which is meant to set a dialogue about healthcare and the Senate's inaction on the House's H.R. 3 bill, which aims to lower prescription drug prices."}
{"original": "The ads will run in 14 cable markets across the country, including in areas that overlap with competitive Democrat districts. Bustos pointed to good fundraising numbers from 2019 and the length of the election cycle, as to why no district-specific ads are currently being run. Let's just remember the election is nine months off, Bustos said. We want to make sure that going into November 2020, we've got everything we've got at our disposal when people are paying very close attention and making those decisions of who they're going to vote for."}
{"original": "Despite setting their own off-year record, the Republican campaign arm was outraised by the DCCC by more than $40 million in 2019, and vulnerable Democratic members raised $92 million in the off year. Two such members, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina and Anthony Brindisi of New York, both released their first 2020 ads this week, one of the first direct responses in these districts to months of ads from outside Republican groups about impeachment."}
{"original": "Bustos, a Democrat from a district won by Mr. Trump, said any member being targeted by outside ads should run on their records, and listed off a number of Democrats she says have compelling arguments. They've got the stories to tell they're getting the job done. Cindy Axne's done 57 town hall meetings, Joe Cunningham has closed more than 1,500 cases…Lauren Underwood working to bring down the cost of insulin, she said. When you see somebody going after you, you can also use that as motivation. And I think they're doing that, but they're doing all the right things."}
{"original": "Bustos also said after he dropped out, Beto O'Rourke reached out to the DCCC offering his help if needed. The DCCC themselves have reached out to several former presidential candidates, such as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and Secretary Julian Castro, about potential involvement in the House election cycle. Where ever it makes sense, you bring people in where they're going to resonate well, she said."}
{"original": "Parts of the government that were shut for 35 days are now open again – at least for the next three weeks. According to Standard & Poor's, the shutdown has cost the U.S. economy $6 billion – more than the $5.7 billion President Trump requested for the border wall that's at the heart of this dispute."}
{"original": "The federal watchdog National Taxpayer Advocate determined it could take the IRS at least a year to get back to normal after five million pieces of mail went unopened during the shutdown, reports CBS News correspondent Nancy Cordes. In the first week of tax season, the IRS is struggling to get Americans their refunds on time."}
{"original": "It's going to be massive catch up at this point, Michelle Harris of the IRS said. She is one of thousands of IRS workers who were furloughed for 35 days. She put off emergency dental work and car repairs in the last month and still hasn't gotten her back pay."}
{"original": "Harris said some of her colleagues quit."}
{"original": "I know that it was more than people could handle and they put in their notice, Harris said. I don't blame 'em."}
{"original": "In a weekend interview, President Trump said the chances of congressional negotiators reaching a budget deal are less than 50-50. He also said he wouldn't rule out another shutdown if Congress doesn't give him the $5.7 billion he wants for a border wall."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of lawmakers from both chambers is scrambling to strike a deal against the odds. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney warned there will be consequences if the two sides don't cut a border deal fast."}
{"original": "He's willing to do whatever it takes to secure the border, Mulvaney told Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan."}
{"original": "Is the President really prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks? Brennan asked."}
{"original": "Yeah. I think he actually is, Mulvaney said."}
{"original": "Seventeen congressional leaders – eight Republicans and nine Democrats – have less than three weeks to fulfill a vague mission: beef up border security funding by an unspecified amount."}
{"original": "The president said Friday that if Congress doesn't approve the wall, he'll declare a national emergency or allow another partial shutdown, even though many in his party still feel burned by the last one."}
{"original": "Shutdowns are never good policy, ever, Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins told Face the Nation."}
{"original": "The White House said federal workers will start to get their back pay early this week and that all overdue checks should go out by Friday. As for President Trump's State of the Union address, CBS News learned Feb. 5 is being discussed as a possibility, but the date still remains uncertain."}
{"original": "The IRS this week started accepting tax returns for the 2019 tax year. So when should you file your taxes? As early as possible, most accountants say."}
{"original": "There are good reasons to submit your return as soon as you've gotten all the necessary documents: You'll get any refund faster, you'll know if you owe money, and you'll enjoy having a year's worth of paperwork over and done with before tax season really gets going. But filing early isn't possible for everyone. Those with complex investments might find themselves waiting until March, or later, to get the forms they need to do their taxes, for example."}
{"original": "Here's how to file your tax return early — as well as when it pays to wait."}
{"original": "If you're among the two-thirds of U.S. taxpayers who expect a refund this year, it's best to file as soon as possible. The earlier you file, the sooner you'll get any money due you, accountants say."}
{"original": "If you're a wage earner and you don't have a lot of investments, I'd say get in as early as you can — late January, said Joel Grandon, an Iowa accountant and president of the National Society of Accountants."}
{"original": "By January 31, employers are required to send out W-2 forms telling their workers what they earned last year; by mid-February, 1099 forms covering everything from freelancer payments to investment income are made available. For most people, getting those forms means you can file for your return."}
{"original": "Last year, 72% of filers got a refund, with the average refund just under $2,870. (Note that if you're claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit, as 25 million lower-income Americans did last year, the government is required by law to hold your refund until February 15, no matter how early you filed.)"}
{"original": "Even if you don't need to spend your refund, you can invest it or stash it in a savings account. While the interest it earns will be low, that's a better option than the zero percent the government offers for holding your refund from February until April."}
{"original": "If you plan to consult a tax professional, you're likely to get more of their time and attention in the first week of January than if you wait until April, when clients are piling up in the annual dash before tax day."}
{"original": "If you think you're going to switch or use a preparer for the first time, January is a good time to make that initial call, Grandon said."}
{"original": "And the earlier you see your preparer, the faster they'll typically be able to do your taxes. Waiting just one week can make a huge difference. For Grandon, the onslaught start around February 8 or 10. I might go from having 50 or 60 returns to work on to 3,000 in a matter of weeks. It's like a traffic jam, he said."}
{"original": "Filing early gets you more than financial benefits — it can also help guard against identity theft."}
{"original": "Every year, the IRS rejects some electronically filed returns, with taxpayers receiving a notice that there's already a return on file for that Social Security number — a sure sign the person has been the victim of a scam. When the agency gets two returns for the same number, it will notify the taxpayer by mail and investigate the incident. But if a scammer files a fraudulent return on your behalf before you file, getting your rightful refund can turn into a long, painful process."}
{"original": "One way to lock down your Social Security number is to file your taxes as early as possible — beating any would-be scammers to the punch. That means if someone else tries to file a return later using your information, that return will be rejected, and you'll receive a notification by mail from the IRS."}
{"original": "If you need to document your income"}
{"original": "Taxpayers may consider filing earlier if they anticipate needing to document their income early in the year. College students applying for financial aid will need their tax return information or their parents' details, with the deadlines for many financial aid applications coming early in February or March."}
{"original": "Also consider if you plan to rent a new house, apply for a mortgage or ask for a personal loan. All of these are good reasons to fill out your return early so you can supply the information as needed to landlords or lenders."}
{"original": "Generally, taxpayers who expect to owe money to the IRS tend to file later during tax season, unlike those who expect refunds and so file earlier."}
{"original": "For some of my clients, we'll prepare the returns just to get the number, but we'll hold the filing until April 15, Medows said."}
{"original": "If you do find you owe money, though, the IRS gives you until April 15 to pay any tax due, even if you file early in the season."}
{"original": "Filing early won't work for everyone. If you have any sort of investments, before filing you'll need to wait for your financial institutions to send you earnings forms. Some of these, like a 1099-INT form that lists interest earned in a savings account, typically arrive at the end of January. But more complex investments can take a long time to report their earnings."}
{"original": "If you have certain types of investments, you may not want to file early, said Jonathan Medows, an accountant based in Manhattan. Some types of investments, like limited partnerships, have until mid-March to issue an earnings statement to their investors, known as a K-1. And it's not uncommon for these statements to be revised after they're issued — meaning taxpayers who filed using the earlier information would be forced to revise their tax returns."}
{"original": "In American retailing, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are the two giants battling it out for consumers' wallets, with the former representing low-cost convenience and the latter the promise of style at affordable prices."}
{"original": "While shoppers might think of themselves as either die-hard Target fans or Walmart patrons, there's another way the two retailers are dividing America: real estate prices. Homes located near Walmart stores may be getting a bit of the Walmart slogan rubbing off on them -- always low prices -- while houses near Targets experience much higher appreciation, according to a new study from RealtyTrac."}
{"original": "Homeowners near Walmarts who sold their properties in 2015 saw a 16 percent price appreciation since they first bought their houses, with the average value of a Walmart-area home $178,249, the study found. So what about homes located close to a Target? The tar-zhay glamour apparently extends to nearby residential properties, given that homeowners saw a 27 percent price appreciation and average property values of $307,286, or 72 percent higher than homes near Walmart locations."}
{"original": "Of course, this could be a chicken-and-egg question, in that it's debatable about whether the retailer is influencing nearby home prices, or whether the home values influenced the retailer's decision to build in that location."}
{"original": "Both retailers target price-conscious consumers, but there are some serious differences in their typical shoppers. Take a look at the average shopper at Walmart: she's white, 50 years old, and has annual household income of more than $53,000. The typical shopper at Target, on the other hand, is 45 years old and has annual income of about $65,000."}
{"original": "Target, then, may be choosing more upscale locations for its stores, while Walmart might be looking to move closer to its shoppers, who might live in lower-priced houses given their lower income than Target customers."}
{"original": "Then again, the Walmart/Target effect on home prices might reflect a trend in American communities toward economic segregation, which is when the wealthier tend to cluster together, making it tougher for lower-income Americans to find entry into those communities. Wealthier consumers might pay more to be closer to their favorite shops, including Target and expensive grocery stores like Whole Foods."}
{"original": "Buyers who are concerned about their housing valuations might want to look for homes near Whole Foods or Trader Joe's, given they tend to have more rapid price appreciation, housing-data company Zillow found last year."}
{"original": "Still, if you don't live near a Target or Whole Foods, don't despair. There's actually an upside to living near a Walmart, RealtyTrac found: lower property taxes. Walmart-adjacent homes have an average property tax of $3,146, or less than half of what homeowners near Target pay."}
{"original": "Suddenly, crisis management is an urgent issue in the presidential campaign. Coronavirus has infected world financial markets. And now, Wall Street is calculating the chances of a recession. Into this, a new name will appear on primary ballots for the first time. Michael Bloomberg, the 78-year-old billionaire and former mayor of New York City, skipped the early contests. But he's already spent almost $500 million, much of it aimed at this week's Super Tuesday. We spoke to Mike Bloomberg Saturday, and earlier in the week, about how he would lead, his reputation with women and minorities and the virus crisis."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: How do you view this emergency?"}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: I find it incomprehensible that the president would do something as inane as calling it a hoax, which he did [Friday] night in South Carolina."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: He said that the Democrats making so much of it is a Democratic hoax, not that the virus was a hoax."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: This is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. And it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, We don't know, but we have to prepare for the fact that, if it is, we have the medicines and the structure and the knowledge to deal with it."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: The president's proposed budget would have cut 16% from the budget of the Centers for Disease Control, and about 8% from the National Institutes of Health."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: I would have raised it rather than cut it."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: I should say that the Congress didn't allow that to happen, so the cuts didn't happen. But what do you make of the effort to cut those budgets?"}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: We have to spend money to make us safe and protect this country. It's like saying I'm not going to fund the military. I'm not gonna fund the local fire department. We're not gonna have fires. I don't believe-- fires are hoaxes. This is about the level that he's talking."}
{"original": "Spending money is what the Trump administration has in mind now. It's asking for nearly $2 billion for a virus response led by the vice president. Despite that, markets plummeted about 10% last week."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: What about Wall Street?"}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: Wall Street does not do well with uncertainty. And it's-- the worst thing is nobody knows how bad this is going to get. I can just tell you, in my company, we're splitting in all our big offices into two different buildings, even if it's just a temporary thing. If this flu does strike, and strikes our employees, it won't strike all of them, because we have to continue to provide a service."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Friday evening, the president announced his selection for director of National Intelligence. His principal qualification for that job appears to be fierce loyalty to the president."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: That's all of the president's appointees, have that one characteristic."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: And I'm curious, how would you fill the top jobs in government?"}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: Plain and simple: You get some experts. You put 'em in a room and say, Okay, now who should we go hire to do this job? Who's the best person in the world? We'll start there. Asking what party they're a member of, how they voted the last time, it is so nonsensical. If you are sick, do you really wanna go to a doctor who was politically correct? Or somebody that knew how to treat your disease? I'll rest my case."}
{"original": "Bloomberg is pressing his case after a late start and poor showing in his first debate last month. This past Wednesday, after a better, second debate, he slept three hours before heading to his Times Square headquarters to phone voters. He's opened more than 200 offices with 2,400 staff."}
{"original": "Bloomberg and Scott Pelley outside Bloomberg's childhood home."}
{"original": "That same morning, he met us for a flight to his boyhood home."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: You told everybody who would listen that you're not running for president."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: I started watching and listening to the candidates. And they had ideas that made no sense to me whatsoever. Donald Trump is gonna eat 'em for lunch."}

{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: I have been training for this job for close to 20 years there is nobody else running that has any management experience whatsoever in any of these things, but you have to have somebody that's been there done that and will do it right and will guide us through the tough times particularly day one."}

They wanted a change. That explains Donald Trump. Now, people seem to have changed. This cycle, people want stability."}

{"original": "His political career began in 2001. He won the mayor's office three times as a Republican, then once as an independent. His strategy was the one he is using right now: he massively outspent his opponents in self-funded campaigns. In 12 years, Bloomberg helped rebuild Ground Zero, helped the city survive the Great Recession. He banned smoking in restaurants, improved schools and balanced the budget. But there was controversy. Bloomberg expanded a police tactic called stop and frisk. More than 80% of those stopped were minorities. Less than 1% were carrying guns."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: You defended stop and frisk right up to the point that you announced you were going to run for president. What have you learned?"}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: We should've, in retrospect, been more careful and keep it from-- and keep the numbers from growing and we did not and for that I am very sorry."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: It was a mistake, the way that it rolled out--"}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: Well, yeah, there's no argument about it. It was a mistake. I erred. It was a mistake. I've took-- I haven't walked away from my responsibility for it."}
{"original": "Bloomberg is divorced with two daughters and two grandchildren. He still owns his boyhood home in Medford, Massachusetts."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Your parents bought this house through an intermediary because the owner wouldn't sell to a Jew."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: Correct. 1946, and the guy who sold it to us said his sister would never forgive him."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Do you think America's ready for a Jewish president?"}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: Nobody's-- virtually nobody's mentioned it and I think in this day and age, yes. We've moved on. It's a better world than it was back then."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg is the ninth richest person in the world, worth about $60 billion. His success began in 1981. Before PC's or the internet evolved, Bloomberg created a data and communications network for Wall Street. Today, the Bloomberg Terminal is the central nervous system of world finance. But he told us, if he wins the presidency, he'll sell the company."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: What does a multibillionaire know about people who are living paycheck to paycheck and hoping that the car doesn't break down?"}

My parents took a mortgage out on the house, I think it was $11,000, if I remember, to help my sister and I go through school. I worked as hard as anybody. Not better. I wasn't any better or worse, I was luckier, I think than other people."}

{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: Well, I didn't write the book. So--"}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: Did you say these things?"}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: I don't remember saying it. I can tell you that years ago on the trading room floors, things were different. I apologize for that, I'm sorry if somebody was hurt."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: If I annoyed somebody or hurt somebody I apologize. I can't go rewrite history. I can only tell you now it is a different world."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: It's a different world, but the question is, is it a different man?"}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: Oh, I think, for sure. You evolve with times. We're all a product of the world we live in. Shame on you if you don't learn and try to be better."}
{"original": "Bloomberg was named in lawsuits three times in the 1990's by female employees offended by his alleged comments. One suit was settled, two were dismissed."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: How can you be the standard-bearer for a party that claims the high ground on the rights of women and minorities?"}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: Because I brought down the murder rate. I doubled the, or cut the gap between rich and poor education. I created 500,000 jobs, 175,000 units of affordable housing. We did all the things to reduce poverty that anybody could possibly do. And when I left, I think it's fair to say most people, women, minorities, they would say it was the best 12 years the city has had in modern memory."}

{"original": "Scott Pelley: You have already spent twice as much on this campaign as President Trump has raised. How much are you willing to spend?"}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: Well, I'm making an investment in this country. My investment is I'm going to remove President Trump from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue or at least try as hard as I can."}
{"original": "Scott Pelley: So it's a blank check? You'd spend $1 billion?"}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: Well, I don't know if it's a blank check, but, when they come to me and they wanna spend more, I've so far said yes."}
{"original": "He said 'yes' to starting a new company to analyze voter data for targeting ads and social media. This was President Trump's big advantage in 2016 and Bloomberg is spending heavily to catch up."}

{"original": "Mike Bloomberg: The middle of the road doesn't want extremism. They want evolution rather than revolution. And if Bernie Sanders is the candidate, Donald Trump will win. Donald Trump not only will win, but the House will go back to being in Republican hands, the Senate will stay in Republican hands. Downstream, a lotta the state houses will flip back Republican. And when that happens, you're gonna have gerrymandering at the local level and judicial appointments at the federal level that will last for decades. And so, what's really at stake here is the future of this country for a very long time. And that's why I'm running."}

{"original": "While White House officials were on the Hill with lawmakers hammering out legislation on a massive economic stimulus bill, the president told reporters at the White House that the measure would involve much more than a $1,000 check for Americans, and said that there could be more phases. He also praised Americans and vowed the U.S. would defeat the virus."}
{"original": "Americans from every walk of life are coming together, Mr. Trump said at Friday's coronavirus briefing, and thanks to the spirit of our people, we will win this war and we are winning...America will triumph."}
{"original": "During the briefing, reporters asked about the possibility that a malaria drug could be used to treat coronavirus. Evidence that the drug will work as an effective treatment for COVID-19 is anecdotal and needs more research, leading infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said, after President Trump expressed optimism that the drug could provide a solution."}
{"original": "A day earlier, as well as today, Mr. Trump spoke at length about the drug Hydroxychloroquine, suggesting it has tremendous promise. Fauci insisted Friday there isn't distance between his message and the president's feeling about how the drug might play out. Health officials have pointed to the need for more thorough clinical studies of the drug on coronavirus patients."}
{"original": "There really isn't that much of a difference in many respects with what we're saying. The president feels optimistic about something — his feeling about it, Fauci said on Friday. What I'm saying is that it might, it might be effective, I'm not saying that it isn't. It might be effective. But as a scientist, as we're getting it out there, we need to do it in a way as while we are making it available for people who might want the hope that it might work, you're also collecting data that will ultimately show that it is truly effective and safe under the conditions of COVID-19. So it really isn't different, it's just the question of how one feels about it."}
{"original": "On Friday, the president reiterated that he feels good about the drug's possibilities. It may work or it may not, he said, but what the hell do you have to lose?"}
{"original": "On Friday, Mr. Trump announced he's temporarily closing the U.S.-Mexico border to non-essential traffic, as the U.S. and Mexico both look to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

{"original": "The restrictions go into effect at midnight, but Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said border patrol will immediately return all migrants attempting to cross both the Mexican and Canadian borders without delay."}
{"original": "On another front, Mr. Trump, announced that last night he put the Defense Production Act into gear to boost the manufacturing of ventilators and masks, and he disclosed that General Motors would be helping with production. Mr. Trump had said as recently as Thursday he would only do so if necessary, but Democrats and governors had urged him to implement the DPA, which he invoked earlier this week."}
{"original": "Moments before the briefing, a spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the senator urged Mr. Trump to implement the DPA, and the president directed someone in the room to do so immediately. Health care workers are sounding the alarm that they need more ventilators, more masks and more respirators now, not weeks or months from now."}
{"original": "We have millions of masks that we've ordered. They will be here soon, we're having them shipped directly to states, Mr. Trump said on Friday."}
{"original": "The president also announced standardized testing requirements won't be enforced for students in grades K-12, as schools across the nation shutter due to the coronavirus pandemic. The administration is also pushing back Tax Day, to July 15."}

{"original": "There's tremendous spirit to get something done, so we'll see what happens, Mr. Trump said Friday."}
{"original": "While McConnell has said he wants to move at warp speed to negotiate and pass the bill, he is facing some opposition from members of his own party, as well as Democrats. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, an ally of the president, voiced opposition to the idea of direct cash payments to Americans on Thursday."}

I'm not gonna blame anybody, but, well let me just say the facts: There's a little doctored video going around ... put out by one of Bernie's people ... saying that I agreed with Paul Ryan, the former vice presidential candidate, about wanting to privatize Social Security, Biden said."}
{"original": "Biden noted that Politifact determined the video takes his comments out of context and said his campaign will show the full video."}

{"original": "It is worth noting that despite Biden's repeated use of the words doctored and fake, the video is neither of those things.

His debate sessions are being run by Bradley Tusk, who ran Bloomberg's 2009 mayoral race and currently serves as an outside adviser. This will be the first time Bloomberg has appeared on a debate stage since October 2009."}

{"original": "CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman: After the first two nominating contests, Buttigieg has a narrow delegate lead over Sanders. The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana polled well in Iowa and New Hampshire, but his success there has not appeared to give him much of a boost in the next two states to vote, Nevada and South Carolina, both of which have more diverse electorates."}
{"original": "In the week leading up to the Nevada caucuses, Buttigieg has drawn contrasts with Sanders, although not as sharply as in the days leading up to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary."}
{"original": "I mean, look, Senator Sanders, I think speaks to a lot of ideals that we all share, Buttigieg said at a Las Vegas town hall on Tuesday. But right now we've got to make sure we're drawing as many people as we can into our coalition."}

{"original": "Look, my campaign wouldn't exist if all that mattered was how much money and fame you start with and how you get yourself on the air, Buttigieg said Tuesday night. We built this thing from, from nothing, and we built it by having those conversations and letting voters pick apart what you have to say, and to try to just go around that by throwing colossal sums of money on television shows you what's wrong with our system."}
{"original": "WHAT TO WATCH: Will Buttigieg criticize Bloomberg on spending millions of dollars in the presidential race? Can he make an effective appeal to minority voters?"}
{"original": "CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson: With another $12 million in her campaign coffers since the last debate in New Hampshire, Klobuchar is still introducing herself to voters in Nevada. Rather than using her television ads to talk about specific issues in depth, she runs through her bio in an effort to raise her name ID in the state."}
{"original": "As has been the case in previous debates, Klobuchar's team sees the debates as her greatest opportunity to make a positive impression — and earned media is free and has been very effective for her recently. Case in point, her third-place finish in New Hampshire, which her team credits to her highly lauded debate performance."}
{"original": "In previous debates, Klobuchar has taken every opportunity to jump in when two other candidates start to bicker, to state her belief that American voters are exhausted by the infighting. She uses these moments to pitch her plan to bridge the divides that separate Americans, boosting her message of success through passing bipartisan bills in the Senate. As her biggest rivals preview their attacks on Bloomberg in his debate debut tonight, it'll be interesting to see whether Klobuchar will insert herself to stop the noise or let the others fight it out with the former New York mayor."}
{"original": "And how will try to connect with minorities? This is currently a weak area of support for her campaign, which says that diverse voters throughout the country do not know her yet."}

{"original": "CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte: This debate feels like it could be the most consequential for Sanders to date. National polling has him ahead, putting him in his best position since Biden entered the race last summer. Sanders took New Hampshire and the popular vote in Iowa. Now, he's poised to perform well in Nevada and is rising in South Carolina."}
{"original": "Then, there's Super Tuesday, where in California alone there are more delegates at play than twice the first four states combined. Sanders is leading there, too. Over the course of President's Day weekend, Sanders addressed some 50,000 supporters in Super Tuesday states. The 78-year-old democratic socialist is now the front-runner."}
{"original": "Sanders has been fortified by his grassroots support of passionate followers and has benefited from the lack of a single moderate opponent. The heart attack he suffered in the fall does not appear to have affected his campaign, although the information the electorate has about his health remains incomplete, since the 78-year-old candidate has steadfastly refused to release his medical records. After his heart attack, Sanders emerged with an endorsement from progressive rising star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the largest fourth-quarter fundraising in the field."}
{"original": "Critics have hammered Sanders' policies are too far left and say he'll alienate moderates. But given that there has been no single moderate to emerge from the pack, Sanders seems to have a solid path to winning the Democratic nomination, as an internal Bloomberg memo pointed out today."}
{"original": "In response to the memo, Sanders' national campaign co-chair Sen. Nina Turner told CBS News, It's no surprise that Bloomberg and his team are sounding the alarm about the realities of the Sanders' campaign—it is a multi-racial, multi-generational justice movement that can't be bought by the billionaire class. I'm glad he got the people's memo!"}
{"original": "Sanders is very strong when he has a foil. For much of this race it has been the establishment, which Sanders defines on the stump as the media, Republicans, and even neoliberal, traditional Democrats. His supporters roar in support when he rails against the corporate elite and billionaire class that, in his words, are getting pretty nervous about his campaign's success."}
{"original": "This bloc, according to Sanders and his supporters, is not only the biggest problem in American politics but his biggest obstacle to winning the nomination."}
{"original": "Bloomberg and others have said that Sanders' hasn't done enough to calm supporters and surrogates online, which can be projected into a larger critique in his ability to unite the party, should he win the nomination. At the same time, Sanders' platform is unmistakably pro-working class and anti-elite, something he will surely emphasize when debating Bloomberg."}
{"original": "WHAT TO WATCH: How will these two foils play inside the debate hall? A candidate who rails against the type of privilege that got one opponent to the stage, or a candidate who has unlimited resources to deploy in the fight against President Trump."}
{"original": "CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak: Warren needs momentum, and the debate stage in Nevada may offer her a fleeting chance to regain it. In the last debate, Warren spoke less than any candidate who will be on the stage on Wednesday, except Bloomberg, who did not debate in New Hampshire. And after coming in third place in Iowa and fourth in New Hampshire, attention to Warren has been dwindling, with a national press corps that's now reduced to major outlets."}
{"original": "But Warren will also be joined for the first time by the single Democratic candidate she's shown no hesitation to criticize, Bloomberg. Warren, whose campaign message is centered around getting money's taint out of politics, has gone so far as to suggest that the billionaire Bloomberg is running solely to try to avoid paying the wealth tax she's proposed."}
{"original": "After Bloomberg made the debate, Warren tweeted that at least now primary voters curious about how each candidate will take on Donald Trump can get a live demonstration of how we each take on an egomaniac billionaire. That said, Bloomberg has been a target for several of the candidates who will be on the stage, and Warren is likely to be drowned out if she doesn't find a way to get more speaking time."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Warren has literally lost her voice over the past few days and has been recovering from a cold. In order to get some rest, Warren's events have been briefer than they typically are. But by the time she addressed a culinary union event in Las Vegas Tuesday night, she had mostly regained her voice."}
{"original": "WHAT TO WATCH: Will Warren be able to reenter the conversation when her anti-corruption platform is juxtaposed with Bloomberg's money-first campaign?"}
{"original": "In a briefing with reporters late Tuesday, the Nevada State Democratic Party showcased a new caucus calculator Democrats hope will smooth tabulation and reporting for Nevada in the wake of Iowa Democrats' failure to report any of their caucus results on the night of their voting contest two weeks ago."}
{"original": "However, CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin says key questions remain unanswered about the party-run process here in the final days before the caucuses on Saturday, February 22. As first detailed by The Nevada Independent, the tool consists of a series of Google Forms and links to read-only previews of Google Sheets that assist caucus chairs in determining viability and realignment at each precinct."}
{"original": "Accessed through links on iPads provided by the party, the tool is supposed to instantly combine volunteers' entries of in-person results at each precinct with early votes already tabulated by the state party, displaying them in spreadsheets accessed through the embedded 4G connections for each tablet."}
{"original": "The state party has begun to train volunteers and campaigns on using the tool in person and through training slides posted online by the state party. The iPads will be distributed through site leads in the coming days. The tool will not be able to interact with live results until Saturday, the day of the caucuses."}
{"original": "Volunteers began practicing with the calculator Tuesday night, party officials said, with some 80 training sessions scheduled through the rest of the week. The party said that results from the four days of early voting are being scanned similar to a scantron, and the scans would be audited to ensure the results are being recorded accurately."}
{"original": "Party officials on Wednesday said they were unaware of any errors in the automatic scanning process. CBS affiliate KLAS reported Tuesday that some ballots for early caucus voting had been invalidated, in some cases because they were missing a signature. The party said Tuesday that 65 ballots had been invalidated because voters had not selected the minimum three candidates, as required for early voters."}
{"original": "As a backup, officials said precinct chairs will be provided with a printed, anonymized list of ballots for their precincts summarizing the scanned preferences for each caucus-goer. Chairs will not have access that allows them to see original early votes or photocopies."}
{"original": "The state party said Wednesday that 70,000 Democrats had voted early in the state, suggesting turnout could be high on Saturday. In 2016, a total of 84,000 participated in the Nevada caucuses. Some campaigns reported delays in receiving early voting turnout data supplied through a data service called VAN, complaining that the service lagged publicly announced figures. Nevada Democratic Party officials declined to answer questions on this."}
{"original": "Multiple campaign aides told CBS News they suspect the delay was due to a manual data entry step in tallying the early votes, when preference cards were attached to their home precincts. The party also denied reports of iPads crashing at the early vote sites, which some blamed for contributing to hours-long lines at locations throughout the state."}
{"original": "The state party has chalked up the delays to unprecedented voter engagement and security checks. But volunteers said a shortage of volunteers, an inefficiently designed process, and poor information-sharing between sites also led to the frustrating wait times."}
{"original": "And the party declined to answer most of the specific questions about the reporting process, a key factor in the Iowa results snafu. It did, however deny that the caucus calculator would play a role in reporting results, despite the fact that it appears to populate a spreadsheet in the state party's cloud with results from caucus sites. In fact, the reporting process is set up to be fairly low-tech."}
{"original": "In memos released to the press and in caucus training sessions, chairs have been instructed to report results on the day of the caucuses by calling a reporting hotline with a secret passphrase and texting a photo of their documents to the state party."}
{"original": "Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang is putting his money where his mouth is: He's giving families $1,000 a month to promote his proposal for a universal basic income -- a recurring, government-funded stipend for all American adults with no strings attached."}
{"original": "The 44-year-old New York City entrepreneur turned presidential hopeful will distribute $1,000 of his personal fortune to one family in Iowa and one in New Hampshire -- the first two states on the presidential caucus and primary calendar -- every month this year to prove the efficacy of his so-called Freedom Dividend."}
{"original": "This would enable all Americans to pay their bills, educate themselves, start businesses, be more creative, stay healthy, relocate for work, spend time with their children, take care of loved ones, and have a real stake in the future, Yang says on his campaign website."}
{"original": "A handful of countries including India, Canada, and most recently, Finland, have experimented with versions of a universal basic income (UBI), which some studies show help boost an economy and allow workers to find better jobs. Preliminary results from Finland's nationwide test show that it did not lead to gains in employment, but did improve beneficiaries' health and well being."}
{"original": "On the basis of an analysis of register data on an annual level, we can say that during the first year of the experiment the recipients of a basic income were no better or worse than the control group at finding employment in the open labour market, said Ohto Kanninen, Research Coordinator at the Labour Institute for Economic Research."}
{"original": "But the handout reduced recipients' stress levels. The recipients of a basic income had less stress symptoms as well as less difficulties to concentrate and less health problems than the control group. They were also more confident in their future and in their ability to influence societal issues, said Minna Ylikanno, Lead Researcher at social services agency Kela."}
{"original": "In the U.S., the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, or SEED, this month will begin testing a program in Stockton, California, that distributes $500 a month to approximately 100 residents -- making it the first American city to experiment with free money."}
{"original": "A UBI at the level Yang proposes would expand the U.S. economy by 12.6 percent to 13.2 percent -- or $2.5 trillion by 2025 -- and would increase the labor force by 4.5 million to 4.7 million people, according to the Roosevelt Institute."}
{"original": "The most direct and concrete way for the government to improve your life is to send you a check for $1,000 every month and let you spend it in whatever manner will benefit you the most. The government is not capable of a lot of things, but it is capable of sending large numbers of checks to large numbers of people promptly and reliably, Yang says on his website."}
{"original": "Yang cites advances in technology -- automation is expected to displace one-third of American workers by 2030 -- as the main force behind the idea. He also said putting money directly into the pockets of American consumers will turbo-charge the consumer economy."}
{"original": "The Fassi family in Goffstown, New Hampshire, was selected from a pool of applicants to receive the first handout, Fox News reported. They're two months into the experiment, while an Iowa family has yet to be selected, according to the report."}
{"original": "Yang said his UBI would be funded by a 10 percent value-added tax, or VAT, on the production of goods and services that would generate $800 billion in revenue."}
{"original": "But critics of the funding mechanism argue that it would disproportionately burden low-income families. Marshall Steinbaum, one of the authors of the Roosevelt Institute report, said a regressive VAT would work in direct opposition to a UBI's goal."}
{"original": "If the point of the universal basic income is to rectify wage stagnation, poverty, or to have some sort of response to rising inequality, that's great. But if we pay for it with a VAT, you undo all of those gains because you're causing poor people to pay for this, which undermines the argument for why we need a UBI to begin with, he told CBS MoneyWatch."}
{"original": "Instead, he thinks taking on government debt would be a better way to fund the program. It's much more expansionary if you have the government take on debt to pay for it, he said, because then you have transferred household debt to the government."}
{"original": "California Sen. Kamala Harris is throwing her hat into the Democratic primary for president, bypassing the formal exploratory stage and going all-in. Harris made it official Monday with a social media video that also introduced her campaign slogan: For the people."}
{"original": "I'm running for president, she said in a Twitter post. Let's do this together."}
{"original": "Harris is the third U.S. senator and the fourth woman to join the 2020 fray. She is also the first African-American candidate to enter the race, and her campaign rollout speaks to that significance: Her announcement comes on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and her campaign logo was inspired by Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to run for president nearly five decades ago."}
{"original": "Truth. Justice. Decency. Equality. Freedom. Democracy. These aren't just words. They're the values we as Americans cherish. And they're all on the line now, Harris says in her campaign video. The future of our country depends on you and millions of others lifting our voices to fight for our American values. That's why I'm running for president of the United States. I'm running to lift those voices. To bring our voices together."}
{"original": "Harris will host an official campaign kickoff rally Jan. 27 in Oakland, California. Her campaign headquarters will be based in Baltimore, with a second location in Oakland."}
{"original": "Harris is finishing up a book tour where she has been road-testing potential campaign themes. She had said she would make a decision about running after consulting with family during the winter holiday. And her campaign will be family affair: her sister Maya Harris, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and served as the executive director of the ACLU of Northern California, will serve as Harris' campaign chair."}
{"original": "In December, Harris hinted that a campaign could be imminent and acknowledged the challenges ahead. Let's be honest. It's going to be ugly, Harris said at the Know Your Value conference in San Francisco. When you break things, it is painful. And you get cut. And you bleed."}
{"original": "Elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016, Harris has quickly made a name for herself in the upper chamber, seizing her perch on the Judiciary Committee as a national platform for issues related to the Supreme Court, criminal justice reform, and immigration. In October, she unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6,000 a year in refundable tax credits, which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail. And she spent much of the 2018 midterm election cycle campaigning for colleagues around the country and building a network of candidates."}
{"original": "But her experience as a prosecutor could help set her apart from other candidates and provide a clear contrast with President Trump, whose administration is at the center of multiple investigations. Harris served as district attorney of San Francisco before being elected as California's attorney general--the first African-American and woman to serve in that post. She is expected to invoke her experience in that post on the campaign trail, in particular, pointing to lawsuits she brought against banks in light of the mortgage crisis and against for-profit colleges for predatory practices. Her prosecutorial record, however, will also come under scrutiny as she pursues the nomination. There has already been some criticism of that record, including an op-ed written in the New York Times questioning her credentials as a progressive prosecutor."}
{"original": "Harris brings additional diversity to the field, as the daughter of immigrants from India (her mother) and Jamaica (her father). Harris also identifies as the first South Asian-American senator in history, according to her Senate website."}
{"original": "Harris could also have a geographical advantage, as California is moving its primary up to March 3, 2020. The Golden State figures to play an outsized role in helping to determine the Democratic nominee for president, compared to previous elections in which the state voted much later in the cycle when fewer candidates remained in the running. Harris has won three statewide elections in California, giving her a potential leg up over opponents planning to compete in the vast and expensive state."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON -- The incoming Trump administration is looking to unleash the potential of private investors to boost the national transportation networks that underpin the U.S. economy, Transportation Secretary-designate Elaine Chao told lawmakers Wednesday."}
{"original": "Economic gains are being jeopardized by aging infrastructure, rising highway fatalities, growing congestion and a failure to keep pace with emerging technologies, Chao testified before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee."}
{"original": "Chao, 63, is expected to be easily confirmed by the Senate. She was labor secretary during George W. Bush's administration and deputy transportation secretary under President George H.W. Bush. Her husband is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky."}
{"original": "When McConnell introduced Chao at the hearing, he stole a line from former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole: I regret I have only one wife to give for my country. Dole's wife, Elizabeth, is a former transportation and labor secretary."}
{"original": "Chao joked, I will be working to lock in the majority leader's support tonight over dinner."}
{"original": "But she hasn't been immune from criticism. Unions say that as labor secretary, she mostly sided with industry when enforcing labor and safety rules."}
{"original": "Chao advocated using innovative financing tools that can take full advantage of the estimated trillions in capital that equity firms, pension funds and endowments can invest. She said private investment should be encouraged with a bold, new vision."}
{"original": "She didn't detail those incentives, but a paper written by two economic advisers to President-elect Donald Trump recommends providing $137 billion in tax credits to infrastructure investors. His advisers predict that will generate about $1 trillion in investment over 10 years."}
{"original": "But transportation experts note that investors are interested only in transportation projects that produce revenue, such as toll roads, and there are relatively few large projects like that. They say states need financial help from the federal government to help with a growing backlog of maintenance and repair projects for aging highways, bridges and transit systems. Providing tax incentives also runs the risk of providing a windfall to investors for projects that would have been built anyway."}
{"original": "Trump repeatedly promised during the campaign to spend $1 trillion on roads, bridges, railways, airports and other types of infrastructure. It's one of the main ways he said he would create jobs. But he has said little about this since the election."}
{"original": "Republican congressional leaders have said they'll wait to see what Trump proposes before tackling a public works bill. Trump has said he expects to be occupied early in his administration with cutting taxes and repealing President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. Infrastructure isn't expected to be dealt with until late spring."}
{"original": "As transportation secretary, Chao would be responsible for regulating auto, truck, train, transit, pipeline and aviation safety. The department frequently faces pressure from industry to relax safety rules and block new ones."}
{"original": "Chao, who has been associated with conservative think tanks, is likely to lend a sympathetic ear to industry pleas for less regulation."}
{"original": "It's the miracle of compound interest -- growing interest in Powerball, but no winners -- has pushed the jackpot to an all-time record, nearly $1.5 billion. The next chance to win is on Wednesday."}
{"original": "Playing a game you're likely to lose may sound counter productive, but even the slimmest of chances to become one of the wealthiest people in the world, has 2 million people per hour trying to cash in on a dream. And it had people all across the country contemplating what they would do with the money."}
{"original": "I would probably save some for my family and then no one really needs that much money so there are a lot of good causes to share it with, said Ashley Chang."}
{"original": "Gambling may be legal in Nevada, but Powerball isn't. So thousands have traveled over the California border to buy tickets. Even Canadians are heading South to get in on the game."}
{"original": "The Powerball has also provided a business boom to convenience stores. Mukesh Sahi said his sales have tripled in the last two weeks."}
{"original": "People buying sodas, smoke products, cigarettes, vaporizers, he said. My sales are increasing day by day."}
{"original": "Attorney Michael Kosnitzky has been hired by a dozen lottery winners over the last decade. He said it's not only hard to win the money -- it's hard to keep it."}
{"original": "Customers wait in line at The Last Stop to buy Powerball lottery tickets Sunday, Jan. 10, 2016, in White Hills, Ariz. AP"}
{"original": "I think the big mistake lottery winners make is they rush, he said."}
{"original": "How many of them are still millionaires?"}
{"original": "Studies show over 40 percent of lottery winners lose all their winnings within five years."}
{"original": "Kosnitzky recommends taking the projected lump payment of more than $860 million, hire an accountant, tax attorney, and financial advisor."}
{"original": "After all, they don't make a mattress big enough to hide this fortune under."}
{"original": "A number of catalysts were in play on Thursday that hit U.S. equities hard, with the major indexes on the cusp of breaking their seven-week-plus uptrends."}
{"original": "For one, normally dovish Chicago Fed President Charles Evans raised expectations of two rate hikes this year (vs. market expectations for just one). Regulatory worries remain acute as the White House clamps down on corporate tax inversions, dampening M&A activity."}
{"original": "Plus, overseas European bank stocks were under pressure on fears over European Central Bank rates cuts deeper into negative territory. And Japan was suffering as Prime Minister Abe and the Bank of Japan look increasingly toothless to reinvigorate the Japanese economy."}
{"original": "All of this is bad news for financial stocks, which suffered some big breakdowns. Negative interest rates pinch banks' net interest margins (the difference between their cost of money and the interest rate they lend at) and in particular put further pressure on already vulnerable eurozone banks. A more aggressive Fed rate hike schedule threatens to destabilize global markets and rattle currency valuations."}
{"original": "Stocks in the banking sector lost 1.9 percent to lead Thursday's decliners."}
{"original": "After seven weeks in which the bulls pretty much had it all their own way -- capped by last week's super-dovish speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen -- investors are coming back to reality as the start of the first-quarter earnings season looms on April 11 when Aloca (AA) reports."}
{"original": "Analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to decline 8.5 percent over last year's first quarter -- on track for the fourth consecutive period of falling profitability. Corporate profits peaked in the second quarter of 2015. Recessions typical start five to seven quarters afterwards."}
{"original": "The current U.S. economic expansion is looking old and feeble. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracking estimate of first-quarter growth recently got cut to just 0.4 percent (chart above), and Fed policymakers admit that despite strong job gains, they don't feel confident enough yet to raise rates again. Factory activity remains tepid, with new orders and shipments on the decline since late 2014."}
{"original": "The technical and fundamental outlook still looks challenging for stocks as the Dow Jones industrials contend with major overhead resistance near the 18,000 level (chart above)."}
{"original": "The price-to-sales ratio of U.S. stocks hasn't been higher since the subprime bubble blew. Debt-funded corporate stock buybacks -- a major source of buying demand for equities -- look vulnerable as buybacks as a percentage of operating income has reached a record high. Net debt-to-equity ratios have jumped out of their historic range as balance sheet leverage amps up."}
{"original": "Strategists from JP Morgan warned clients this week to brace for the end of the seven-year bull market: This is not the stage of the U.S. cycle when one should be buying stocks with a six- to 12-month horizon. We recommend using any strength as a selling opportunity."}
{"original": "NEW YORK — DMX and his attorney feel that the artist best expresses himself through his rap songs, even in court. DMX is counting on a little rap to help him beat the rap at his tax evasion sentencing."}
{"original": "Attorney Murray Richman said in a court document made public on Monday that he wants to play a few DMX compositions at Thursday's sentencing in Manhattan for the rapper also known as Earl Simmons."}
{"original": "The lawyer said the music will help U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff understand him genuinely in his voice since DMX may be too emotional to speak."}
{"original": "DMX, 47, has been incarcerated since his bail was revoked in January by Rakoff, who scolded him for failing to obey bail conditions."}
{"original": "DMX, whose hits include X Gon' Give it to Ya, has appreciated his time at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and is sober now and invigorated, Richman wrote."}
{"original": "It was a salvation of sort to shut out the noise, Richman said. The lawyer sent the judge lyrics to Slippin' and The Convo, among other compositions. The lyrics to Slippin' include lines like, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up, while The Convo includes lines, Thou shall not steal, but I will to eat. I tried doin' good, but good's not too good for me"}
{"original": "It is raw Earl, the lawyer said. We are not here or desirous of molding him into what some may want to see; Earl is uniquely him and that is both his beauty of mind and his genius."}
{"original": "Richman suggested a unique resolution, including an up to 60-day study of his client by qualified consultants rather than prison, might help Simmons be deemed rehabilitated and enable him to return to the stage, where he can earn money to pay back $1.7 million in taxes and support his 15 children."}
{"original": "DMX had a busy concert schedule booked through July when his bail was revoked."}
{"original": "He pleaded guilty to a tax evasion charge in November, the culmination of a federal investigation that determined he had failed to pay taxes on millions of dollars in income amassed from 2002 through 2005 as his hip-hop records sold millions."}
{"original": "In papers filed last week, prosecutors called DMX's crime brazen and sought a five-year prison sentence."}
{"original": "They urged Rakoff to use the sentencing to send the message to this defendant and others that star power does not entitle someone to a free pass."}
{"original": "The government said DMX was trying to shift blame for his tax payment failure to managers and attorneys."}
{"original": "It said he earned more than $2.3 million from 2010 through 2015 but paid nothing toward tax liabilities. Prosecutors said he arranged for hundreds of thousands of dollars of music royalties to be deposited into the bank accounts of managers and then portions disbursed to him in cash or used to pay his expenses."}
{"original": "They said he also demanded that his $125,000 payment in 2011 and 2012 for participating in Couples Therapy, a reality TV show, be reissued without withholding taxes."}
{"original": "Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate who narrowly lost the race for Georgia governor in 2018, will deliver the Democrats' rebuttal to President Trump's State of the Union address Feb. 5. The response is traditionally delivered by member of Congress or a sitting governor, making Abrams an intriguing choice given that she doesn't currently hold a political office. However, as a progressive black woman who was defeated by one of Mr. Trump's endorsed candidates, party leaders may be hoping that she can deliver a speech which demonstrates the stark differences between Republicans and Democrats."}
{"original": "Abrams, who is one of six siblings, was born in 1973 in Wisconsin, although her family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, during her childhood. Both of her parents later became Methodist ministers. Abrams graduated from Spelman College, a historically black liberal arts college for women in Atlanta, and studied public policy at the University of Texas at Austin as a Harry S. Truman Scholar. Abrams received her law degree from Yale Law School in 1999."}
{"original": "While serving as a private tax attorney, Abrams was appointed the Deputy City Attorney for Atlanta at age 29. She was elected to the Georgia General Assembly in 2006, and became the first black woman to serve as minority leader in 2011. She became known for her ability to work across the aisle, and worked with GOP Gov. Nathan Deal on criminal justice reforms, public transportation packages and a scholarship for low-income Georgia students."}
{"original": "In 2018, Abrams ran for governor of Georgia. She prevailed in a primary against Stacey Evans in part because she opted to focus on drawing out like-minded liberal voters instead of attempting to broaden her appeal to swing voters. The strategy was an outgrowth of her work with the New Georgia Project, an officially nonpartisan organization she helped establish that registered tens of thousands of mostly minority voters across the state beginning during the 2014 election cycle."}
{"original": "Abrams was defeated by Republican Brian Kemp in November. She initially did not concede the race to Kemp, due to concerns over voting irregularities, but acknowledged that Kemp had won later in the month. If she had won, Abrams would have been the first black female governor in the country. She remains a popular politician among Democrats, and a leader on the grassroots left. In late November, the Abrams-backed group Fair Fight Action filed a federal lawsuit challenging the way Georgia's elections are run."}
{"original": "Since losing her gubernatorial bid, Abrams has said she is open to running for political office again. In recent days, she was spotted in Washington lunching with California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, and met with other party leaders about a potential 2020 U.S. Senate bid against GOP Sen. David Perdue, of Georgia, one of Mr. Trump's closest allies on Capitol Hill."}
{"original": "Abrams has also published several romance novels under the pen name Serena Montgomery."}
{"original": "There were several voting irregularities during the campaign, and Abrams accused Kemp, who oversaw Georgia's election system as secretary of state, of dropping more than a million voters from the rolls since 2012 and closing polling places in African-American communities."}
{"original": "He is someone who is tilting the playing field in his direction and in the direction of his party, Abrams told CBS News' Nancy Cordes in October. It is absolutely voter suppression."}
{"original": "The biggest controversy surrounded the new exact match law that put the registrations of 53,000 voters, most of them African Americans, on hold because of discrepancies in the way their names are spelled in state databases."}
{"original": "Kemp's office suspended processing the registrations under the auspices of a 2017 state law passed under his urging, which requires an exact match between a voter registration form and government documents. If a person's voter registration form differs from government documents -- even by a hyphen or a misspelling -- their registration form is considered suspect. However, the voters with pending applications could still vote on election day, if they presented photo identification at the polls."}
{"original": "Kemp promoted several measures during his tenure as secretary of state which Democrats claim are intended to suppress minority votes. Abrams called on him to step down several times, given that Kemp oversees the state's electoral system. Kemp's office has canceled over 1.4 million voter registrations since 2012, including over 600,000 since 2017 alone, according to the Associated Press."}
{"original": "Kemp was the only secretary of state in the country to refuse the Department of Homeland Security's aid against electoral hacking before the 2016 election, and he is being sued for failing to secure the state's voting system and allowing a massive breach into the records of 6 million voters. He and Gwinnett County are also being sued due to the Georgia county's rejection of 595 absentee ballots this year, over half of which belonged to African Americans and Asian Americans."}
{"original": "FRANKFURT, Germany - The European Central Bank has left its stimulus program unchanged as it waits for the continent's political situation to settle down. On Thursday it also refrained from signaling any plan to taper off its support for the economy despite evidence that growth is picking up sharply."}
{"original": "The stand-pat decision comes days ahead of the second round of France's presidential election, in which anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen is battling pro-EU front-runner Emmanuel Macron. A Le Pen victory on May 7 could unsettle financial markets since she has advocated taking France out of the shared, 19-country currency."}
{"original": "The statement from the central bank's 25-member governing council on Thursday gave no fodder for additional market speculation that would ruffle financial markets, which already have enough on their minds with the French election. The statement omitted any hint of when the bank might taper off its extraordinary support measures."}
{"original": "Speculation of such a taper has grown as surveys show the eurozone economy accelerating sharply this year. The latest such report was a measure of economic conference by the European Commission, which hit its highest level in almost a decade."}
{"original": "The ECB does not seem to want to take any chances still. At 1.5 percent, inflation remains below the ECB's goal of just under 2 percent, and unemployment is elevated at 9.5 percent."}
{"original": "Its statement on Thursday repeated past wording that indicates it even stands ready to increase stimulus if the outlook for growth and inflation worsens. Analysts consider that wording a way of discouraging investors from speculating about the end of the stimulus -- which might prematurely drive up market interest rates, blunting its intended benefits."}
{"original": "Markets are waiting to see whether ECB President Mario Draghi drops any more hints at his post-meeting news conference. Betting is that he may acknowledge that the economy is improving but stay away from clear hints about when the stimulus will end."}
{"original": "The 60 billion euros ($65 billion) per month in bond purchases push newly printed money into the economy in an effort to boost inflation, which is considered too weak at 1.5 percent annually. The ECB has trimmed the purchases, which started in March 2015, from 80 billion euros a month as of April. But it insists they will continue at least until the end of the year, and in any case until inflation shows signs of turning convincingly upward."}
{"original": "Draghi has said they won't be suddenly shut off after that but instead gradually reduced, but has not said when that taper will start."}
{"original": "Printing money and adding it to the economy can raise inflation, lower interest rates and make it easier for businesses to get the credit they need. It is considered an extraordinary step undertaken to keep Europe from falling into a chronic spiral of falling prices after the shock of the debt crisis that started in 2009 with financial trouble in Greece."}
{"original": "The eventual withdrawal of the stimulus will have a wide-ranging impact on businesses, governments, investors and consumers. An end to the purchases will let longer-term interest rates rise, meaning governments will have to spend a bigger part of their tax revenues on interest costs, while mortgage payments will tend to increase. Higher rates would make it easier in some cases to save for retirements or fund a pension plan, and would make bonds and bank time deposits more attractive compared to stocks."}
{"original": "The ECB is lagging far behind the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is already raising interest rates after the U.S. economy recovered faster from the Great Recession. ECB officials have said they won't start raising benchmark rates until after the bond purchases end."}
{"original": "Several analysts think the central bank will change the wording of its statement in its June or July meetings to signal that the European economy is less in need of help. That could lead to an announcement in September on the timing of the taper to the stimulus."}
{"original": "Key wording currently includes the bank's statement that economic risks are tilted to the downside, meaning it's more likely the economy and inflation will grow less than expected rather than more than expected. Another key statement is the promise to increase the stimulus if things worsen."}
{"original": "Other stimulus measures include keeping the bank's interest rate benchmark at a record low of zero. That rate largely steers short-term rates and keeping it that low makes it cheaper for banks to borrow money on the interbank market, which in turn would mean in lower borrowing costs for businesses."}
{"original": "The ECB has also imposed a minus 0.4 percent interest rate on deposits it takes from commercial banks. That is in essence a tax aimed at pushing banks to lend the money rather than leave it at the ECB's super-safe overnight deposit facility."}
{"original": "Former Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx expressed skepticism Thursday that President Trump's $1 trillion infrastructure plan involving public-private partnerships will be able to cover all of the needed repairs."}
{"original": "When you read the fine print, what he's talking about is basically a set of tax credits that generate about $137 billion in tax credits that he believes will produce $1 trillion of investment, Foxx said in an interview on CBS This Morning."}
{"original": "Foxx added that he thinks the plan would only cover some projects."}
{"original": "Asked where he thinks the money should be spent first, Foxx said, I think the money needs to be spent on where the clogs are the greatest -- where the traffic and congestion is the most."}
{"original": "A lot of time we spread money like peanut butter in transportation across the country, he said, adding that the U.S. should be more data-driven in how it distributes money. Go where the problems are and start to build around them."}
{"original": "In terms of Mr. Trump's claim that his infrastructure plan would create millions of jobs, Foxx said that could only happen if the administration makes smart investments."}
{"original": "You have to have smart investments in transportation in order to get those second and third-level benefits, he said."}
{"original": "Foxx served as President Obama's transportation secretary from 2013 through the end of his administration. He previously served as the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina."}
{"original": "DUBLIN- British Prime MinisterDavid Cameron published his income tax returns for the past seven years Sunday in hopes of defusing criticism over his investment in an offshore trust run by his late father. The move was among the latest in the widening fallout from the massive Panama Papers data leak on secretive offshore accounts."}
{"original": "Cameron became the first British leader to document his financial affairs hours after he told a meeting of Conservative Party activists that he was wrong to have been so slow to acknowledge his investment in Blairmore Holdings. His father Ian, a millionaire stockbroker, organized the Bahamian investment fund with help from the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca."}
{"original": "The three-page summary of the prime minister's earnings and tax payments since 2009 showed that Cameron made 9,501 pounds ($15,297 at the time) in profits from his 2010 sale of his stake in Blairmore shortly before he became prime minister. His wife recorded an equal share of profit, allowing both narrowly to avoid paying capital tax on the shared gain."}
{"original": "The documents, produced by English accountancy firm RNS and published by Cameron's Downing Street office, show that Cameron paid 75,898 pounds on taxable income of 200,307 pounds (about $310,000) in the most recent tax year."}
{"original": "His 2014-15 income included prime minister's salary and expenses of 150,356 pounds, 46,899 pounds from annual rental of the Cameron family home, and 3,052 pounds in interest earned from savings on deposit in a London bank."}
{"original": "Cameron also announced plans Sunday to create a so-called task force to scrutinize the involvement of U.K. consortiums and individuals in funds and companies registered by Mossack Fonseca. In a statement, he said investigators led by taxation authorities and the National Crime Agency would deal with any wrongdoing relating to the Panama Papers."}
{"original": "Earlier, Cameron issued a public mea culpa for his initial failure to confirm his investment in Blairmore. He had spent four days sidestepping questions about the issue before detailing his investment Thursday in a television interview."}
{"original": "I could have handled this better. I know there are lessons to learn, and I will learn them. And don't blame No. 10 Downing Street or nameless advisers. Blame me, he told Saturday's event in central London."}
{"original": "The prime minister is among scores of political leaders, celebrities and sports stars who have been linked to last week's leak of 11.5 million pages of client files at the Panama City-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, which specializes in registering offshore companies."}
{"original": "Still, Cameron's financial records published Sunday do not clarify whether he profited from other tax-avoidance vehicles overseas before 2010. And British newspapers found fresh angles to criticize his financial disclosures, including his failure to include 500,000 pounds in cash received from his family estate in three tax-free payments following his father's death in September 2010."}
{"original": "The Mail on Sunday's front page blared Cameron Tax Bill Dodge as it noted that he avoided paying 70,000 pounds in capital gains tax by taking his inheritance in multiple cash payments over two years rather than in a single lump sum."}
{"original": "Cameron has made the closure of global tax loopholes a focal point of his government, a position that fired cries of hypocrisy outside the Conservatives' meeting Saturday."}
{"original": "Dozens of police formed a human barrier at the event entrance as thousands of left-wing protesters demanded Cameron's ouster. Many protesters waved placards portraying Cameron as an out-of-touch elitist, while others held signs mocking the Panama firm with the slogan Mossack Fonseca: Because taxes are for poor people."}
{"original": "Labour Party lawmakers already have demanded that Cameron publish details of all his investment holdings since he became Conservative leader in 2005. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and other leading opposition figures said they would press Cameron on the issue when Parliament reconvenes Monday."}
{"original": "Corbyn said he would publish his own tax returns very soon and there'll be no surprises there."}
{"original": "Washington — The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday approved the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland for attorney general, paving the way for the full Senate to vote to confirm President Biden's pick to lead the Justice Department in the coming days."}
{"original": "The committee advanced Garland's nomination with a bipartisan vote of 15 to 7. All seven senators who opposed Garland are Republicans: Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas, Josh Hawley of Missouri, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Mike Lee of Utah and Ben Sasse of Nebraska."}
{"original": "Mr. Biden announced Garland, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as his nominee to helm the Justice Department last month, and he appeared before the Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing last week. He is expected to be confirmed by the Senate with broad bipartisan support."}
{"original": "Garland is poised to step into the position of attorney general as the Justice Department emerges from a tenuous period under former President Donald Trump, during which it was involved in politically charged investigations involving Mr. Trump's closest allies and beset by allegations of politicization. The former president's last attorney general, William Barr, was accused by Democrats of doing the president's bidding, while Mr. Trump claimed some in the department aimed to undermine his presidency and were biased against him."}
{"original": "Garland, however, has vowed to act in the interests not of the president, but of the American people, and pledged to senators that he would fight efforts to make prosecutions or investigations partisan or political."}
{"original": "I am not the president's lawyer. I am the United States' lawyer, he said."}
{"original": "In addition to restoring the Justice Department's independence, Garland said prosecuting those who participated in the January 6 assault on the Capitol would be his foremost priority. Garland will assume the post atop the Justice Department as it continues several politically sensitive probes, including one involving Hunter Biden and his tax affairs, as well as the ongoing examining from special counsel John Durham into the origins of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election."}
{"original": "Garland's nomination for attorney general comes five years after former President Barack Obama tapped him to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court in 2016. But Republicans scuttled his nomination, as they argued the vacancy arose too close to the presidential election, and voters should have a voice in the president who fills Scalia's seat."}
{"original": "All the hullabaloo about President Donald Trump's tax plan wound up drawing a yawn on Wall Street, mostly because of how little detail it contains -- and the usual gripe on Main Street about the 1 percent getting all the gravy. And let's not forget that any tax reform plan has to get through Congress, not an easy task."}
{"original": "So instead of looking forward to tax cuts for relief, investment pros and individual investors will have to continue relying on fundamentals and the power of savvy stock-picking. Some market analysts argue that a lot of value is available in the small-cap sector, where many stocks remain undiscovered or underappreciated."}
{"original": "The prospect of earning a premium for investing in small-cap companies is compelling, said Karen Wallace, senior editor at Morningstar.com, who discussed in a recent report the merits of investing in small-caps with wide economic moats, or structural barriers that that help protect companies from competition."}
{"original": "She said the so-called small-firm effect argues that companies with smaller market capitalizations tend to outperform the market as a whole."}
{"original": "Wallace pointed out that in 2015, AQR Capital conducted a study that showed the key to harnessing small-cap outperformance is to focus on quality firms that have demonstrated consistent profitability growth and solid balance sheets. In other words, no junky companies."}
{"original": "Wallace noted that the cornerstone of Morningstar equity analysis involves identifying wide moats that are synonymous with quality -- companies whose returns on invested capital are likely to exceed their weighted average cost of capital in the future. We also look for firms that appear to have at least one of the five sources of sustainable competitive advantage: intangible assets, cost advantage, switching costs, network effect or efficient scale, she said."}
{"original": "Wallace has identified nine small-cap companies with wide economic moats that will allow them to be profitable for at least 20 years."}
{"original": "And three of them appear to be particularly attractive, according to some investors and analysts: Dun & Bradstreet (DNB), John Wiley & Sons (JW.A) and Blackbaud (BLKB)."}
{"original": "Dun & Bradstreet, a leading global provider of business information and related decision-support services, has yet to participate in 2017's robust advance. Its stock is trading at $109 a share, down nearly 10 percent this year and well below its 52-week high of $141.57. However, the stock sharp's decline is attracting some opportunistic investors, who expect the company to post higher earnings in 2017. Some analysts see DNB beating earnings expectations when it reports its first-quarter results on Monday, May 1."}
{"original": "Catherine Seifert, equity analyst at CFRA Research, upgraded the stock in November to hold from sell, based on valuation. She noted that DNB's new products and services, such as a business-to-business online supplier database with information on importers and exporters of specific products worldwide, will likely help longer-term growth. However, she also noted that DNB faces competitive and currency headwinds."}
{"original": "John Wiley, which provides knowledge-related services in the areas of research, professional practice and education worldwide, also hasn't participated in the market's advance this year. It's trading at $53 a share, not far from its 52-year high of $58.86, and some big investors see it exceeding that mark this year. So far, according to CFRA's analysis of the stock's fair value, John Wiley is undervalued."}
{"original": "The company's research segment offers scientific, technical, medical and scholarly studies and journals that serve scientists, engineers and technologists in the academic, government and public sectors."}
{"original": "Blackbaud, which provides cloud software services to nonprofits, foundations, health care groups, various charities and other organizations, has been a strong winner since October 2016, when it was trading at around $55. It closed on Friday at $80.41, which exceeded its previous 52-week high of $79.28. It actually touched $81 during Friday trading, setting a new 52-week high at that level."}
{"original": "The company's strength is in helping private organizations increase their impact with software in digital marketing, grant management and improving corporate social responsibility."}
{"original": "Even though Blackbaud's earnings and revenues have been on the rise since 2012, the company has yet to attract wide attention on Wall Street."}
{"original": "NEW YORK - Investors saw some new hints that inflation is increasing on Wednesday, but they still sent banks, technology firms and consumer-focused companies climbing. That was a big change after the market's inflation-inspired plunge earlier this month."}
{"original": "After a shaky start, stocks rose for the fourth straight day, and banks made some of the largest gains as bond yields reached new four-year highs. The move in yields came after the government said consumer prices climbed in January a slightly faster pace than economists had expected. A different government report showed retail sales were unchanged in December and slipped last month."}
{"original": "The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 35.7 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,699. The Dow Jones industrial average added 253 points, or 1 percent, to 24,893. The Nasdaq composite climbed 130.1 points, or 1.9 percent, to 7,144. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 27.2 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,522."}
{"original": "After a 10 percent plunge in just nine days, the S&P 500 has risen 4.5 percent in the last four days."}
{"original": "I think the fears of the economy overheating have been a little bit balanced out with the combination of these [inflation and retail sales] numbers, said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management. The bond market is not suggesting that runaway inflation is a deep concern."}
{"original": "Stocks began plunging Feb. 1 after the Labor Department said wages grew at a rapid clip in January. Investors worried that that meant inflation was rising and that it would push the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates more quickly, making it more expensive for people and businesses to borrow money."}
{"original": "That would slow down economic growth as well growth in as corporate profits. Nixon said Wednesday's reports show inflation probably isn't rising that fast."}
{"original": "The Labor Department said prices paid by consumers rose 0.3 percent in January, excluding volatile items like food and energy. That's the most in a year, and it sent bond yields and gold prices higher."}
{"original": "The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.91 percent, its highest mark in four years, from 2.84 percent a day earlier. That helped banks, as the higher interest rates make lending more profitable."}
{"original": "But it hurt high-dividend companies like utility and phone companies. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of their big dividend payments and relatively steady prices, but investors find them less appealing when bond yields are rising."}
{"original": "Americans cut back on purchases of cars, furniture and a variety of other products in January. The Commerce Department also lowered its estimate for spending in December. That came after a three-month stretch that included the strongest holiday sales in a decade."}
{"original": "Retailers traded higher despite the tepid numbers in the report. Amazon (AMZN) rose $36.54, or 2.6 percent, to a record high of $1,451.05, and Tiffany (TIF) added $2.15, or 2.1 percent, to $103.11. Nike (NKE) picked up $2.09, or 3.2 percent, to $67.96."}
{"original": "Nixon, of Northern Trust, said she doesn't expect inflation to increase very much, but it can be unpredictable from month to month. She noted that it could go higher as people who received tax cuts or bonuses spend their extra pay."}
{"original": "Netflix (NFLX) climbed after the streaming video company said it signed another big-name TV writer and producer to a production deal. According to reports, Glee and American Horror Story producer Ryan Murphy received a $300 million deal that will span five years.

Chipotle has been hit hard by food safety scares over the last few years and has had trouble winning back customers. Niccol launched breakfast at Taco Bell and also introduced mobile ordering from its restaurants, and investors felt he might improve the company's fortunes. Founder Steve Ells resigned as CEO in November."}

{"original": "Update: Soon after the publication of this story, the union representing University of California graduate students said in a press release that at least 54 graduate students at University of California Santa Cruz who were striking received termination letters. This story has been updated to reflect that change."}
{"original": "At the University of California, San Diego, third-year Ph.D. student Eleanor Castracane said she works up to 50 hours a week teaching 24 undergraduate students, grading assignments, and conducting research. Second-year Ph.D. student Adam Cooper said he's done the same, on top of attending class, and has worked daily since January 6. Both make less than $31,000 a year after taxes and struggle to afford rent, they said — and now, they could lose their jobs as they fight to earn a living wage."}
{"original": "That's what happened at the University of Santa Cruz on Friday, according to the union representing University of California graduate students. According to the union and UC Santa Cruz's student newspaper, 54 striking students at UC Santa Cruz received letters firing them from their spring semester teaching assistant (TA) appointments."}
{"original": "According to the termination letter, students will officially be dismissed on March 26."}
{"original": "This action is based on abandonment of your job responsibilities by failing to submit student grades well past the fall quarter deadline... the termination letter reads. Your abandonment and sustained dereliction of your job responsibilities as a Teaching Fellow constitutes serious misconduct. Your conduct has harmed graduate students and disrupted University operations."}
{"original": "The students have been striking over what they say is inadequate compensation from the university. The average salary of UC-employed graduate students is $21,000 per year, according to UAW 2865, the graduate student union."}

{"original": "All 19,000 UC student employees who are part of UAW 2865, according to the union, are considered rent-burdened by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) guidelines. That means they spend more than 30% of their income on housing. These students typically spend up to 60% of their pre-tax income on housing costs, the union said."}

{"original": "The COLA 4 All movement started at UC Santa Cruz in November 2019, when approximately 200 graduate students withheld thousands of grades. Since February 10, UC Santa Cruz graduate students have been on strike with support from undergraduates and faculty members, according to Castracane. As an elected union officer, Castracane added that she cannot condone any action that violates our contract and that her support for the cost of living adjustment is done outside her capacity as a union officer."}
{"original": "The UC San Diego graduate student body has also been active in the movement since February 10, holding rallies, sit-ins, and marches in support. Every campus in the UC system is asking for a monthly stipend adjustment based on the specific needs of their respective students."}
{"original": "To determine the value of the adjustment, the union considered every UC campus' average monthly graduate student housing cost, assumed students would spend 29% of their income on rent, and included the mandatory fees graduates are required to pay the school."}
{"original": "This is how much money students at each school are seeking as a monthly stipend adjustment. Made by CBS News using Piktochart"}
{"original": "Some student activists are asking for even smaller adjustment amounts. UC Santa Cruz activists, according to their campaign website, are asking for $1,412 to fund nine months of rent in a housing unit with at least three bedrooms in Santa Cruz County."}
{"original": "Andrew Gordon, the Associate Director of Media Relations at the University of California, told CBS News in a statement that the university values graduate students and that teaching assistants, readers, and tutors are essential to UC's teaching mission. However, he said, that mission is in jeopardy when teaching assistants represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW) refuse to fulfill their teaching obligations by withholding grades and not teaching classes."}
{"original": "According to the school, the four-year contract with UAW expires in 2022 and includes fair pay and excellent benefits, such as a tuition waiver, annual wage increases of 3% over four years, a one-time payment of $100 for eligible employees, and an annual $300 campus fee remission."}
{"original": "The University is sympathetic to such challenges, particularly housing, and the related impacts on all our employees, Gordon wrote. Affordable housing has been an important priority for the University and we are making strides systemwide. All UC student housing is below market rate, and we're building more of it."}
{"original": "On Friday, before the firings were announced, the student union announced they filed an unfair labor practice charge against the university, saying it's clear UC wants to create an appearance that it is respecting graduate student employees while avoiding true bargaining where the law requires the parties to stand with equal footing and to act in good faith."}
{"original": "A GoFundMe page for UCSC strikers, which is raising money for strike supplies and those who may not be paid during the strike, says, The UCSC chancellor makes over $400,000 a year [1] AND receives a $6,500 housing stipend per month, meanwhile graduate students have to live in one of the most expensive cities in the country [2] on less than $25k a year."}
{"original": "The group has raised more than $122,100 as of February 28."}

{"original": "The high court's conservative justices seemed inclined during 80 minutes of oral argument to overrule a four-decade old precedent that allows public-sector unions to collect mandatory fees from non-members to cover collective bargaining costs."}
{"original": "A group of California public school teachers claims these fair share fees violate the First Amendment rights of workers who disagree with the union's positions."}
{"original": "Labor officials fear that union members will leave in droves if they realize they can get all the benefits of representation without paying for it."}
{"original": "But Justice Anthony Kennedy rejected arguments made by lawyers for the state of California and the California Teachers Association that the current fee system is needed to prevent non-members from becoming free riders - workers who get all the benefits of union bargaining and grievance procedures without paying for it."}
{"original": "The union basically is making these teachers 'compelled riders' for issues on which they strongly disagree, Kennedy said, noting the political nature of bargaining issues like teacher salaries, merit promotions and class size."}
{"original": "Arguing in support of the union, California Solicitor General Edward Dumont said the state needs a reliable bargaining partner that is funded by all the workers it represents. He said the fees for collective bargaining typically apply to non-political issues such as mileage reimbursement, working hours and other mundane issues."}
{"original": "Chief Justice John Roberts dismissed that reasoning, saying even routine matters can become politically charged if they involve how the state spends money."}
{"original": "That's always a public policy issue, Roberts said."}
{"original": "Even Justice Antonin Scalia, who in the past has expressed some sympathy for the free rider argument, said all the items negotiated in a collective bargaining agreement are necessarily political questions."}
{"original": "The California teachers want the high court to overturn a 1977 case that allows public unions to collect money from members and non-members alike, as long as the money doesn't pay for political action. The court in that case, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, said the arrangement was justified to prevent non-members from becoming free riders."}
{"original": "But the teachers argue that unions have become more political over time. They say even a push for higher salaries and pension benefits raises political questions about the best use of tax dollars for cash-strapped localities."}
{"original": "A federal district court ruled against the teachers, saying the outcome was clear under Abood. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling."}
{"original": "Half the states already have right-to-work laws banning mandatory fees, but most members of public-employee unions are concentrated in states that don't, including California, New York and Illinois."}
{"original": "Union advocates say the lawsuit is part of a conservative agenda to weaken powerful labor unions, known for reliably supporting Democratic candidates and policies. The teachers are backed by the conservative Center for Individual Rights."}
{"original": "Arguing for the teachers, Michael Carvin said mandatory fees serve to inflate the union's war chest by people who really have not made a voluntary decision to do so."}
{"original": "Justice Elena Kagan warned that the challengers come here with a heavy burden to overturn a nearly 40-year-old case on which thousands of contracts and millions of employees rely."}

That's largely due to the higher wages paid to workers, such as those caring for the elderly, that would contribute to an increase in federal spending, according to a report released Monday by the nonpartisan federal agency."}
{"original": "Democrats are pushing to include the higher minimum wage as part of their $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan. The current baseline wage of $7.25 has not budged in nearly 12 years, the longest span without a raise since the U.S. adopted a federal minimum wage in 1938.

{"original": "The decision on the minimum wage will be an early test for Mr. Biden as he seeks to build public support for his larger proposal and navigate differences within his own party about how far the COVID-19 legislation should go.

{"original": "The CBO cites several positive and negative effects from raising the minimum wage. In the plus column, the number of people living in poverty would fall by about 900,000 once the $15 wage is fully in place in 2025. On the other hand, the number of people working would decline by about 1.4 million."}
{"original": "The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute took issue with the CBO's projection of significant job loss, saying its own analysis has found the impact on employment to be negligible.

{"original": "Representative Bobby Scott, the Democratic chair of the House Education and Labor Committee, said the report strengthens the case for including the $15 minimum wage in the COVID-19 relief bill. He emphasized the report projects 17 million workers making below the minimum wage would see a pay increase once the requirement is in place. An additional 10 million workers making slightly more than the proposed minimum could also see a boost in pay, he said."}
{"original": "At a time when many of our essential workers are still not being paid enough to provide for themselves and their families, we must do everything in our power to give these workers a long-overdue raise, Scott said."}

{"original": "If we can land men on the moon, then we can get a monthly check out to folks, said Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the chair of the House Appropriations Committee."}
{"original": "Perhaps the biggest question in the COVID-19 relief bill is who will get another round of stimulus payments, as fewer may be qualified this go round. In December, lawmakers approved $600 checks for individuals making up to $75,000 a year and $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000, with payments phased out for higher incomes."}

{"original": "9 of the narrowest homes in the world"}
{"original": "Photo by Bartek Warzecha, courtesy of Jakub Szczesny The spectrum of reasons for building a narrow house is pretty wide. Some of the world's skinniest homes went up out of spite, like a 7-foot-wide house in Virginia built by a 17th century homeowner who wanted to keep his neighbors from using the alley near his property. Others, like London's Gap House, were built by curious architects who wanted to take on a challenging space. Then there's Keret House in Warsaw, Poland, which was constructed as a sober reminder of the tragedies that took place there during World War II and a symbol of how the area has moved forward. Regardless of why a thin home was constructed, its inhabitants are forced to invent creative strategies for accomplishing day-to-day tasks -- and avoiding claustrophobia. Here are nine homes that challenge how much space people really need to live."}
{"original": "Skinny House – Boston, Massachusetts Photo by Wikimedia user John Stephen Dwyer This four-story, 964-square-foot building at 44 Hull Street is the skinniest house in Boston. The property gets narrower from front to back, with a width that varies slightly between about 9 and 10 feet and floors separating the rooms rather than doors. A few different legends explain why the historic home was originally constructed -- and why in such a weird spot. One story says it was built by a Tory (someone who remained loyal to Britain) who wanted to obstruct his patriot neighbor's view. Another story says it was built by a Civil War soldier who came home, found out his brothers had built on the land he had inherited and wanted to block their views out of spite."}

Built in 1873, the red brick property is said to be the narrowest home in the city. It features a spiral staircase, a trapdoor leading to a finished basement and a surprisingly large backyard garden. The 3,400-square-foot home sold for a whopping $3.25 million in August 2013."}
{"original": "Kanonia 20-22 – Warsaw, Poland Photo by Wikimedia user Jolanta Dyr During World War II, the Nazis almost completely destroyed the Old Town area of Warsaw, Poland. Since then, its buildings have been carefully rebuilt, restoring a good deal of its architectural charm. This skinny, 17th-century home at 20-22 Kanonia Street, which was rebuilt in 1959 to match its original design, is just slightly wider than its front door. According to Elle Décor, its unusual construction was a strategy for avoiding property taxes. With a tax system based on the width of a home's front-facing façade and the number of windows it had, this property probably saved its original owners a lot of złoty."}
{"original": "Hollensbury Spite House – Alexandria, Virginia Photo by Flickr user Adam Fagen Homes all over the world have been built out of spite, but the little blue Hollensbury House in Alexandria, Virginia, is one of the most famous -- mostly because of the story behind it. Original owner John Hollensbury built the 7-foot-wide, two-story property in 1830 because he was tired of people and horse-drawn carriages using the alleyway next to his house. Apparently, there is still evidence of wagon wheels brushing up against the walls."}
{"original": "Singel 166 – Amsterdam, Netherlands Photo by Wikimedia user Rudolphous When the historic, red brick Singel 166 was built in Amsterdam, property taxes were based on the width of a home's street-facing side. With that in mind, the narrowest house in the city was built with a 6-foot-wide front entrance and designed to expand as the owner moved inward. Like many narrow homes, this townhouse overlooking the canal is sandwiched between two larger properties. It's a common tour stop for visitors but is still a privately owned residence."}

The house is named after Israeli author Etgar Keret, whose short stories inspired the project. While Polish law keeps the tiny home from being a permanent residence -- its narrowest spot is just 35 inches wide -- Keret and Szczesny made it a temporary homestay for traveling writers."}

Paul delayed a vote in the Senate by holding forth on the floor until his time expired."}

{"original": "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well you know I think we should draw attention to the fact that we're spending so much money. I ran for office in 2010 with what was called sort of the Tea Party tidal wave. At that point we were very, very critical of President Obama's deficits you know approaching a trillion dollars in a year. We talked endlessly about them we had 100,000 people rally on the Mall in Washington. And I'm still against deficit spending just because Republicans are doing it doesn't make it any better."}
{"original": "MAJOR GARRETT: And now we have deficits projected to be a trillion dollars again and yet they're growing non-recessionary economy or are you troubled by that?"}
{"original": "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yeah, I'm very worried and I think one of the questions the Republicans I think are not willing to ask themselves is can you be fiscally conservative and be for unlimited military spending. There's sort of this question, Is the military budget too small or maybe is our mission too large around the world? And because Republicans are unwilling to confront that they want more, more, more for military spending. And so to get that they have to give the Democrats what they want which is more and more and more for domestic spending and the compromise while some are happy with bipartisanship. Well if the bipartisanship is exploding the deficit I'm not so sure that's the kind of bipartisanship we need."}
{"original": "MAJOR GARRETT: From your point of view, Senator, on the defense side of the equation is the spending and the mission, are they reckless?"}
{"original": "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the mission is- is beyond what we need to be we're actively in war in about seven countries. And yet the Congress hasn't voted on declaring or authorizing the use of military force in over 15 years now. So I've been one that's been bugging the Senate and Congress to say how can we be at war without ever voting on it don't the American people through their representatives get a chance to say when we go to war. I think the Afghan war is long past its mission. I think we killed and captured and disrupted the people who attacked us on 9/11 long ago. And I think now it's a nation building exercise. We're spending 50 billion dollars a year. And if the president really is serious about infrastructure, a lot of that money could be spent at home. Instead of building bridges and schools and roads in Afghanistan or in Pakistan. I think we could do that at home and the interesting thing is I think the president's instincts lean that way but --"}
{"original": "MAJOR GARRETT: His policies, his policies, have not though."}
{"original": "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And that's sort of the problem and this is something that we've seen even going back to Reagan conservatives said, Oh, we love Reagan. Then the people appointed around him were often big government types. That's a little bit of the problem I see here is that I think Donald Trump is probably the least interventionist minded president we've had in a long time. I mean he criticized George Bush for the intervention in the Iraq war. I think he's not that excited about continuing the Afghan war forever. But the generals who surrounded him with don't want to admit that there isn't a military solution. And so the war goes on and on and on. And really I think after 15 years and a trillion dollars that the Afghan it's time for them to take over their country."}
{"original": "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Paul you and I have talked about this many times you know the instincts in Washington are to spend. You know that's what's going to happen and yet you voted for the tax cut which is contributing to these deficit and debt problems. How do you reconcile those two facts?"}
{"original": "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think if you're for tax cuts and for increasing spending that's hypocritical. But if you're for tax cuts and you're also for cutting spending a corresponding amount. See I would offset the tax cuts with spending cuts and there are a few of us that would actually do that. When we had the budget deal that lowered the taxes I also had an amendment to look at and try to control entitlement spending at the same time to pay for the tax cuts. But interestingly I could only interest three other Republicans. We had four votes total to try to control entitlement spending and that is where the money is."}
{"original": "MAJOR GARRETT: And that's sort of the way, Senator, because you know where the votes are. You know the votes are there for tax cuts. You know they're not there for spending cuts. So, isn't there any part of your voting pattern that is irresponsible?"}
{"original": "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think so because you know I can only control how I vote. So I voted for the tax cuts and I voted for spending cuts. The people who voted for tax cuts and spending increases. I think there is some hypocrisy there and it shows they're not serious about the debt. But all throughout my career I've always voted for spending cuts and I'm happy to offset cuts in taxes with cuts in spending. So no I think that I've had a consistent position in being very concerned about the debt and I want to shrink the size of government. So, the reason I'm for tax cuts is I to return more of the money to the people who own that who- who actually deserve to have their money returned to them. But it also shrinks the size of government by cutting taxes or should if you cut spending at the same time."}
{"original": "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Paul I don't need to tell you this was a rough week in terms of White House personnel. Do you think the president was well served this past week by his chief of staff John Kelly?"}
{"original": "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know I don't know the ins and outs of who hires and fires and who goes through personnel files, but you know all I can say is from looking from the outside in and not really knowing all the facts that obviously domestic violence should be roundly condemned particularly in an advanced world like ours that just something that we shouldn't countenance."}
{"original": "MAJOR GARRETT: Is that a message you think this White House has communicated clearly?"}
{"original": "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know I don't know. I just don't know the ins and outs and I was kind of distracted for about you know 24 hours of that news cycle you know talking for long periods of time about the deficit. And so-- and it's hard for me and I know the media gets consumed with this, you know. But it is sort of a personnel thing that those of us on the outside don't know the ins and outs and I nobody wants to speculate on it."}
{"original": "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But I think really that we should all roundly condemn domestic violence and--"}
{"original": "SENATOR RAND PAUL: -- complicated matters that really they have to deal with because they know all the facts and we don't."}
{"original": "MAJOR GARRETT: Sure. But setting aside the ins and outs. The president said on Twitter due process, lives are being ruined. The vice president said no tolerance. Can you reconcile those two. And if somebody in Kentucky asked you, Senator, what's their position on this? Could you explain it to them?"}
{"original": "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Right.You know it's difficult for me to get involved and there's other than to say that absolutely no place for domestic violence in our world. And then beyond that I will say that there is complicated things and somebody has to. I mean if you've ever been to family court with he said and she said and I'm not saying that I'm denying what these women are saying. I'm just saying that these things are very, very complicated. You go to family court and you're a family court judge you talk about a very, very difficult job. But that being said I don't want to think-- I don't want anybody to believe I'm making excuses. There is no excuse for domestic violence."}

{"original": "As Congress debates President Joe Biden's request for $1.9 trillion in coronavirus relief funding — including a third stimulus check pegged at $1,400 — some Democratic lawmakers are pushing for an even bigger response: $2,000 monthly payments until the pandemic is history."}
{"original": "Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and more than 50 other House members are urging the Biden administration to back such a policy, according to a signed letter sent to Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Signers of the January 28 letter also include other leading House progressives such as Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan."}
{"original": "One more check is not enough during this public health and economic crisis, they wrote. Many families cannot afford to wait for eight months between payments. To truly build back better, families need stability and certainty through ongoing relief — they cannot be at the mercy of congressional gridlock."}

{"original": "Supporters of the idea note that financial hardship remains widespread around the U.S. 10 months after COVID-19 effectively shuttered the economy. A new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank, found that one-third of adults are struggling to pay their bills. Many of those who are hurting are low-wage workers whose service jobs were impacted by the crisis, such as those in restaurant and retail jobs."}

{"original": "While the letter didn't specify an amount for a recurring stimulus payment, Rep. Omar tweeted on Thursday that she would like to see payments of $2,000 per month until the global health crisis has ended. So far, the federal government's response efforts have included two direct payments to most low- and middle-class families: a $1,200 check for eligible adults last spring and a $600 per person check earlier this month."}
{"original": "The recurring payments should be directed to those who need it most and will spend it the quickest, as well as include all immigrant workers, refugees, and their families, Omar wrote. Older dependents and people over the age of 16 who are claimed as dependents — and who were excluded from the first two stimulus checks — should also be included, she added."}
{"original": "The latest relief plan under debate in Congress would provide a third stimulus check of $1,400 to most U.S. households, with Wall Street analysts estimating that the payments could be approved by the end of March."}
{"original": "Given ongoing hardship and high unemployment rates, a bold stimulus plan is needed to both alleviate current suffering and plant the seeds for economic revival, said Gene Sperling, former director of the National Economic Council under President Clinton and President Obama, on a conference call with reporters on Thursday."}
{"original": "We know there is still an enormous amount of economic suffering going on in our country, Sperling said on the call hosted by Invest in America Action, an advocacy group for public investment. The top quartile might see unemployment around 5%, but for the bottom quartile, it's over 20%."}
{"original": "For people in the bottom fifth of income-earners, unemployment remains at Depression-level rates, he added."}
{"original": "Asked about Omar's request for recurring stimulus payments, Sperling noted that Biden's $1.9 trillion proposal includes several recurring aid programs, including $400 in extra weekly jobless benefits and an increase in tax credits to $3,600 per child under 6-years-old. There's some discussion that such a child tax credit could be paid on a monthly basis, he added."}
{"original": "Some economists have argued that direct stimulus checks aren't as effective in boosting economic growth as other forms of aid, such as unemployment benefits and food stamps, which are provided to people in need and are spent relatively quickly. The effectiveness of the second round of checks has been mixed, with lower-income households spending the money quickly, while wealthier households socked away the cash, a recent study found."}
{"original": "Ongoing payments would provide stability to families struggling in the crisis, Omar wrote. Recurring direct payments until the economy recovers will help ensure that people can meet their basic needs, provide racially equitable solutions and shorten the length of the recession, she said."}

{"original": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's home in Louisville, Kentucky, was vandalized early Saturday morning.

{"original": "One message reads weres (sic) my money, another, Mitch kills the poor, according to photos shared by CBS Louisville affiliate WLKY-TV. McConnell blocked a vote on increasing the checks for three days in a row last week, calling the proposal socialism for rich people."}
{"original": "McConnell and the GOP argue that the bill would benefit the wealthy. McConnell, however, previously supported the $1 trillion 2017 tax cut, which disproportionately benefited the wealthy. The GOP leader also takes issue with how much money the bill would cost the government. Bigger checks would amount to an estimated $530 billion, about $385 billion more than what $600 checks would cost, according to Heights Securities. The Senate, led by McConnell, on Friday approved a $740 billion defense policy bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA."}
{"original": "To approve the NDAA, the senate had to override a veto by President Trump, marking the first time Congress has voted to override Mr. Trump during his entire presidency."}
{"original": "After blocking the House bill that would have authorized $2,000 stimulus checks, McConnell then introduced a bill that linked the increased payments to two separate issues valued by Mr. Trump: Nixing Section 230, a legal shield for internet companies, and creating a commission to examine election integrity. The president also tied a repeal of Section 230 to the NDAA, but several members of Congress, including some Republicans, successfully argued that it was not relevant to national security."}
{"original": "Here is the deal, McConnell said in remarks on the Senate floor earlier this week. The Senate is not going to split apart the three issues that President Trump linked together just because Democrats are afraid to address two of them."}
{"original": "Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, called the vandalism to McConnell's home unacceptable in a tweet on Saturday. While the First Amendment protects our freedom of speech, vandalism is reprehensible and never acceptable for any reason, Beshear wrote."}
{"original": "McConnell said in his own statement that vandalism and the politics of fear have no place in our society."}

Democrats are in support of bigger checks, and Pelosi herself implored McConnell not to block a vote on the bill. Mitch McConnell, remove the obstacle that you have to the American people having the opportunity to have that direct payment, and do it now, she said."}

For the most part, the press staff have not been coming to work."}
{"original": "Some airlines who have taken delivery of new aircraft in the last month have been forced to park those new planes as they have to receive Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) certification to carry passengers, and the people who certify the aircraft are furloughed. That does not impact an airlines' operations, but it does cost them revenue to have planes sitting unused, CBS News' Kris Van Cleave reports."}

{"original": "The plan announced Wednesday would cut checks to about 5.7 million people who earn less than $30,000 per year, as well as some immigrants living in the country illegally who were excluded from federal COVID-19 relief payments made during the Trump administration."}
{"original": "The plan also provides a new round of small business grants and more housing assistance for farmworkers infected by the virus."}

{"original": "The Legislature plans to quickly take up the measure, with votes expected as early as Monday after budget committee hearings starting Thursday. Legislators are hoping that money for some of the largest segments of the plan can be distributed in April."}
{"original": "The plan calls for more money than Newsom proposed in his state budget last month, due in part to state revenues that came in more than $10 billion higher than expected."}
{"original": "About 5.7 million low-income residents would be eligible for one-time payments. Those getting $600 include households that received a California earned income tax credit in 2020. That carries the biggest price tag in the relief package, at $2.3 billion."}
{"original": "Immigrants and others who lack Social Security Numbers but have Individual Tax Identification Numbers, income below $75,000 and were ineligible for recent federal payments would get $600 — boosted to $1,200 if they also qualify for the California earned income tax credit."}
{"original": "The plan also widens Newsom's original plan by providing payments to some people who receive supplemental income under various state and federal programs, including immigrants and people who are 65 or older, blind or disabled."}
{"original": "The timing of those payments is being worked out with federal officials."}
{"original": "For small businesses affected by the pandemic, the package quadruples to more than $2 billion in money available for grants of up to $25,000. Newsom last month had recommended adding $500 million to the program but state lawmakers thought that figure was too small."}

{"original": "The governor's visit to the Coachella Valley was his latest stop in a tour around the state to highlight vaccination efforts as California's virus numbers continue to improve. The state's test positivity rate, hospitalizations and deaths are all down, and the rate of people spreading the virus to others is now at its lowest in months."}

{"original": "The $600 federal stimulus checks now landing in bank accounts and mailboxes across the U.S. will deliver an urgently needed financial shot in the arm to millions of Americans. A potentially nasty side effect: The attention of criminals eager to profit from the $166 billion government relief program."}
{"original": "Officials from states ranging from West Virginia to Florida are warning people to be wary of scammers seeking to defraud them of their stimulus payments. The checks began landing in bank accounts this week, with the IRS prioritizing people whose banking information is on record with the tax agency. Other people may receive mailed checks, but the IRS said it could take longer for them to get the money than those whose accounts accept direct deposits."}
{"original": "Because many Americans may not know when their checks are due to arrive and are anxious for the money, it could make them more susceptible to scammers, who are running so-called phishing schemes via phone calls, texts and emails to get valuable information from their victims."}
{"original": "In one such scam, the criminal pretends to be calling from a government agency and promises to quickly deliver the stimulus check payment — as soon as you pay a fee through a prepaid debit card. Other scammers say the money will be released after their victim provides them with personal information like their bank account data or their Social Security."}
{"original": "A lot of people are desperate for this money — I get it, said Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog at the consumer advocacy group U.S. PIRG. But it breaks my heart for people who stumble into an even bigger mess. That often means stolen bank information, credit cards or personal information such as Social Security numbers that scammers can use to fraudulently purchase goods and raid accounts."}
{"original": "Consumers should know that the IRS won't contact them through text, email or phone calls. Instead, the agency will only reach out through the mail. The first round of stimulus checks also attracted scams, with the IRS warning in November against clicking on texts that promised $1,200 checks."}

{"original": "Fraudsters may also falsely promise to expedite the arrival of a stimulus check. Likewise, the government won't ask consumers to pay a fee to collect their payment, while people should also be wary of unsolicited phone calls fishing for personal information."}
{"original": "It's important to remember that if you are vulnerable and desperate, you are capable of suspending your common sense for a minute, Murray said."}
{"original": "Criminals may have another way to target stimulus check recipients, said Haywood Talcove, CEO of LexisNexis Risk Solutions Government Division. The IRS website Get My Payment lets people check the status of their stimulus checks by entering basic personal information, such as their date of birth and Social Security number."}
{"original": "But because of data breaches like the 2017 Equifax hack, much of this information is already available in the shadier parts of the internet known as the dark web. For example, fraudsters can use the personal information they find to log into the IRS site to find out how much money a potential victim is receiving and where it's being sent."}
{"original": "What scammers can't do is redirect the funds toward their own bank accounts. That's because the IRS isn't allowing consumers to update their bank account information as part of this latest round of checks."}
{"original": "But as a result, people who moved or closed their bank accounts since the first round of checks this spring might be confused or worried if they don't immediately get their payments — making them more susceptible to scammers promising to track down the government funds if they only pay a fee or provide information."}
{"original": "This is Christmas for fraudsters, Talcove said."}
{"original": "Tax scams: 7 signs you could be a target"}
{"original": "​1. Your personal information is requested by email iStockphoto If the IRS sends an email asking you to divulge personal or financial information, you're probably not speaking with an actual IRS employee. There's an email phishing scam circulating where con artists pretend to be IRS representatives and send you a link to a site that looks exactly like the official IRS website. The email might say that you are to update your IRS e-file immediately and mention USA.gov and IRSgov (without the dot in between S and gov). If you get this email, do not respond. Instead, forward it to the IRS at phishing@irs.gov. The IRS doesn't initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages or social media channels to request personal or financial information. This includes requests for PIN numbers, passwords or similar access information for credit cards, banks or other financial accounts, the agency states on its website."}
{"original": "​2. Someone guarantees you OIC qualification iStockphoto When working with a tax debt company, be wary if you're told you qualify for an Offer in Compromise (OIC) before you even agree to be a client. If a tax consultant tells you that you're eligible without closely examining your case, that consultant is probably a scam artist."}
{"original": "​3. You're being pressured to inflate charitable deductions iStockphoto Tax deductions are great but only if you get them the honest way. Any tax preparer who encourages you to embellish the amount of money you contributed to charity the previous year is up to no good. Instead of paying a flat rate, these people might ask for a percentage of your refund. And, they want you to get as much money back from the IRS as possible. Steer clear of these unethical tax preparers, as they'll only get you into trouble with the IRS."}
{"original": "​4. Your tax preparer charges a fee based on a percentage of your refund iStockphoto To further elaborate, a tax preparer who bases their fee as a percentage of your refund is definitely shady. In fact, the National Association of Tax Professionals conducted a survey in 2010 that covered fee structures used by tax preparers. The results revealed that most professionals charge a set rate for each tax form, which can vary based on the complexity of each client's current tax situation."}
{"original": "5. Your tax preparer isn't getting any business iStockphoto The average tax preparer works notoriously long hours during tax season because they're flooded with business. According to Monster.com, spending 12 to 14 hours a day in the office is not uncommon at all. If you're instantly able to get an appointment with a tax preparer and arrive at an eerily quiet office, take this as a red flag that something might not be quite right."}
{"original": "6. You're promised a higher tax refund iStockphoto Who doesn't want to receive a large tax refund from the IRS? Scam artists are well aware of this, and they'll flash the promise of major dollars to draw you into their grips. The truth is it doesn't matter which skilled, reputable tax professional prepares your return -- your refund is going to be the same size. If someone promises a larger refund, they have some tricks up their sleeves, and you don't want to be involved with them."}
{"original": "LONDON -- British Prime Minister David Cameron admitted Saturday that he bungled his admission of his investment in an offshore fund revealed in the mammoth data breach of a Panama law firm."}
{"original": "Cameron drew laughs and applause from a sympathetic audience of Conservative Party activists as he opened his speech with a mea culpa."}
{"original": "Well, it not been a great week, he deadpanned. I could have handled this better. I know there are lessons to learn, and I will learn them. And don't blame No. 10 Downing Street or nameless advisers. Blame me."}
{"original": "It was Cameron's first public appearance since his admission Thursday night that he had owned shares in a Bahamas-based trust from 1997 to 2010. He had sidestepped persistent questions on the issue for four days with a string of obfuscating statements issued through aides."}
{"original": "Cameron faces mounting pressure from opposition lawmakers to reveal the full extent of his past investment in offshore investments, particularly those run by his late father, Ian, a millionaire stockbroker who placed much off his savings in trusts based in island tax havens. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and others say they will press Cameron on the issue when Parliament reconvenes Monday."}
{"original": "A few hundred left-wing protesters banged drums and whistled as they marched Saturday down to Whitehall, the government center, past Cameron's Downing Street residence. Many donned placards denouncing Cameron as a wealthy elitist and one held aloft a pinata of a pink pig with Cameron's face on it."}
{"original": "The British prime minister is one of scores of political leaders, celebrities and sports stars who have been linked to shell companies and investment trusts organized by the Panama City-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, which specializes in registering offshore companies. Cameron has made the closure of global tax loopholes a focal point of his government - and rejected charges of hypocrisy on the issue."}
{"original": "This government that I lead will go on very clearly, very doggedly, very determinedly making sure that we crack down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance, he said."}
{"original": "Last weekend's leak of 11.5 million documents from four decades of Mossack Fonseca files -- dubbed the Panama Papers -- identified Cameron's late father, Ian, as a client."}
{"original": "Cameron admitted in a Thursday television interview that he owned shares in his father's Bahama trust from 1997 to 2010, but sold that stake for a 19,000 pound ($30,500) profit along with all his other unspecified shareholdings shortly before becoming prime minister that year. His father died shortly after he gained office."}
{"original": "Michael Hudson is one of the reporters who has been studying the documents for months."}
{"original": "The paperwork said clear that they wanted it structured in a way that the profits from these investments would not be taxed in the UK, he told CBS News."}
{"original": "In Saturday's speech, Cameron reiterated plans to make public his recent tax returns to show that he paid all legally due taxes on that Bahamas-based investment. He has declined to answer questions on whether he made other offshore investments."}
{"original": "Labour lawmakers already have demanded that Cameron publish details of all his investment holdings since he became Conservative leader in 2005."}
{"original": "Corbyn said he would publish his own tax returns very soon, and there'll be no surprises there."}
{"original": "The IRS has a message for people still waiting on federal stimulus payments: The money is already out the door."}
{"original": "The tax agency said this week that it has sent more than 160 million checks — $1,200 for adults and $500 for children — directed by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which represented the first round of stimulus payments sent to most U.S. households. Starting in December, it also sent more than 147 million payments for the second round of checks, which offered $600 for each eligible adult and child."}
{"original": "To be sure, Congress is currently negotiating another round of stimulus aid, which could direct a third check to eligible households. If that $1.9 billion relief effort is passed by lawmakers, it could be signed into law by President Joe Biden by the end of March, Wall Street analysts say. In that case, the IRS would be authorized to distribute a third round of checks. So far, the tax agency has been authorized to send two rounds of checks — and it said that all those payments have been mailed or deposited into bank accounts."}
{"original": "Altogether, the IRS has disbursed more than $410 billion in so-called Economic Impact Payments, emergency relief to help tide people over during the pandemic, to U.S. households since April. Yet while those checks have been delivered to most eligible individuals, the IRS has struggled to reach some of the most financially vulnerable Americans, such as those who lack bank accounts or who don't earn enough money to file tax returns."}
{"original": "Those issues have complicated stimulus check distribution because the IRS is relying on a person's most recent tax return to determine whether they are eligible for the payments, as well to determine where to send the money."}
{"original": "That was a big problem — those people who do qualify but didn't file a return, and so aren't on the IRS' radar, said Jody D'Agostini, a certified financial planner with Equitable Advisors. Some of the people who missed out are those that are likely to need the stimulus money the most, she added."}
{"original": "While the IRS said all checks have been issued, it added that some checks could still be in the mail. And if you haven't received either or both stimulus payments — or didn't receive the correct amount — you'll have another chance to claim the money when you file your 2020 tax return, according to the agency."}
{"original": "If individuals didn't receive a payment — or if they didn't receive the full amounts — they may be eligible to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit and must file a 2020 tax return, the tax agency said in a statement."}
{"original": "That could happen if someone's income dropped in 2020, as experience by the millions of Americans who were furloughed or lost their jobs last year. Some people didn't qualify through their 2018 and 2019 tax returns but then had a horrendous 2020 and they didn't get the check, but they were really eligible, D'Agostini said. Those people can claim the payment by filing a 2020 tax return."}
{"original": "The IRS has come under fire from some critics over its distribution of the stimulus payments, with National Taxpayer Advocate Erin M. Collins calling out the agency for not ensuring that checks reached all eligible people. Households that failed to receive their checks are likely experiencing financial distress now, Collins wrote in a report to Congress last month."}
{"original": "In her view, taxpayers shouldn't have to wait to file their 2020 tax returns in early 2021 to get their payments. Unfortunately for those who missed out, the IRS isn't offering another option for now. It said that people who either missed a payment or didn't receive the correct amount will need to wait until they file their 2020 tax returns to claim the extra money."}
{"original": "How to claim your stimulus money"}
{"original": "The first step is to figure out how much in missing stimulus payments you'll need to claim on your 2020 tax returns."}
{"original": "The IRS, which began accepting tax returns on February 12, calls the checks recovery rebate credits on its tax forms. That's because, technically, the payments were actually tax rebates paid in advance of filing your taxes. Most taxpayers have until April 15 to file their taxes, although the IRS on February 22 said Texas residents will receive another two months to file, due to the winter storms that battered their state."}
{"original": "To help determine if you are owed more, the IRS published a Recovery Rebate Credit worksheet, which asks questions about eligibility (such as your income) and how much you received in the two stimulus checks so far. If you find that you are owed more, you can enter the amount on line 30 on IRS Form 1040."}
{"original": "If you don't recall how much you received in the first two rounds of stimulus payments, you can create or view your account at the IRS website. Extra stimulus money will be included with your tax refund. Most taxpayers will receive their refund within 21 days, according to the tax agency."}
{"original": "With Congress now working on a third relief package, millions of households could receive a third stimulus check within the next several weeks, which happens to fall in the middle of tax filing season."}
{"original": "People who lost income in 2020 or who had a baby last year may want to file their taxes as soon as possible to ensure they receive the correct amount in their next stimulus check. Otherwise, the IRS could rely on your 2019 tax returns to determine eligibility."}
{"original": "If that happens, people may have another wait ahead of them until they can update their information with the IRS and claim their extra stimulus money."}
{"original": "BOSTON -- In a federal court case deciding if Harvard University discriminates against Asian-American applicants, both parties say the evidence is firmly on their side. Harvard and the group Students for Fair Admissions filed dueling reports from outside economists Friday, each studying six years of Harvard admissions data and each reaching wildly different conclusions."}
{"original": "The reports were filed in Boston's federal court as both parties attempted to persuade a judge to end the suit before it reaches trial, which has been scheduled to start in October."}
{"original": "It marks a step forward in a lawsuit that has lasted nearly four years and raises implications for many other colleges that, like Harvard, say they consider race as one of many factors to gather a diverse mix of students."}
{"original": "Edward Blum, a legal strategist who founded Students for Fair Admissions, issued a statement saying his group's filing exposes the startling magnitude of Harvard's discrimination."}
{"original": "Harvard countered with a statement calling the group's analysis incomplete and misleading, saying it paints a dangerously inaccurate picture of the school's admissions process."}
{"original": "Both sides built their cases on records detailing Harvard's admissions decisions for individual students who applied from 2010 through 2015."}
{"original": "Students for Fair Admissions relied on an analysis from Peter Arcidiacono, a Duke University economist who says he found evidence of bias against Asian-Americans."}
{"original": "Arcidiacono's study concluded that if Harvard relied only on the academic scores it assigns to each applicant, more than half of admitted students would have been Asian-American in the six years in question. Instead, they made up just 22 percent."}
{"original": "To blame, he wrote, are subjective rating categories for which Asian-American applicants consistently received lower scores than their white peers."}
{"original": "Asian-Americans, for example, received lower scores than any other racial group in a category for personal qualities, and they fared worse than whites in an overall rating category that isn't based on any particular formula."}
{"original": "Yet Harvard alumni who interview applicants and provide their own ratings generally scored Asian-Americans higher than whites, a contrast that Arcidiacono says suggests bias."}
{"original": "The university attacked his analysis, saying it's flawed because it excludes applicants believed to have an advantage regardless of race, including relatives of alumni and athletes recruited by the school."}
{"original": "Instead, Harvard sought its own study from David Card, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who found no evidence of discrimination against Asian-Americans."}
{"original": "Looking at a wider pool of applicants and admissions factors, Card found that the effect of being Asian-American was statistically indistinguishable from zero."}
{"original": "Both sides also are sparring over a 2013 internal study at Harvard exploring the racial makeup of the admitted class. The inquiry, uncovered by Blum's group, was conducted amid earlier allegations of discrimination against Harvard."}
{"original": "The study found that even considering factors like legacy status and extracurricular activities, 26 percent of the admitted class would have been expected to be Asian-American. Instead, 19 percent were."}
{"original": "Blum's group says the report is proof of intentional discrimination and that Harvard killed the study and quietly buried the reports."}
{"original": "Harvard counters that the study was never intended to evaluate possible discrimination and that it was incomplete, preliminary and based on limited inputs."}
{"original": "University officials have painted the lawsuit as an attack on their ability to consider race in admissions, which they say is necessary to ensure diversity on campus."}
{"original": "In 2016, the Supreme Court examined the topic and upheld race-conscious admissions at the University of Texas, but the justices warned that other colleges still must be able to prove affirmative action is the only way to meet diversity goals."}
{"original": "Blum also was a driving force behind that case, helping Texas student Abigail Fisher sue the university. Fisher is also an executive in Students for Fair Admissions, according to the group's tax filings."}
{"original": "Friday's court filings followed a recent battle over a trove of Harvard data reviewed by lawyers during the discovery process."}
{"original": "Harvard argued that its records initially should be filed confidentially to protect students and the admissions process. Blum's group said the public should have access to the records, and the U.S. Education Department - which is also looking into Harvard's use of race in admissions - weighed in to agree."}
{"original": "The judge ultimately sided with Harvard, but Blum said Friday that he believes the rest of the records will be released in the next few weeks."}
{"original": "In November, CBS News learned the Department of Justice was investigating the role of race in the admission process at Harvard. CBS News correspondent Paula Reid tried to ask Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the Harvard investigation at a news conference, but his communications team repeatedly blocked the questions."}

{"original": "By now, most high school seniors have college offers on the table, leaving them only a few days to decide which one to choose. Will it be the glamour school with a big price tag? The reliable state school? A commuter or community college?"}
{"original": "Making a solid choice means weighing what will be the best fit and value for your family's budget, your student's personality and academic interests. But even though time is short, you can still work on getting better aid offers until colleges need a final decision, which is usually May 1."}
{"original": "Kalman Chany, a college financial counselor and author of Paying For College Without Going Broke, said from the time students and their families get the acceptance notices until May 1, the student and their family is in the strongest position -- as the ball is now in a different court with the school no longer being in control."}
{"original": "Why are families in a great position now that offers are in front of them? Chany noted this is prime time because once you lock into a school, you lose a great deal of leverage, so you still have time to improve a financial aid offer -- which shouldn't include loans but often do (I discourage anyone from going into deep debt for most degrees)."}
{"original": "Here are four strategies to keep in mind:"}
{"original": "If the aid offer falls short, appeal it. But this isn't the same process as trying to get a better price on a refrigerator. One should never use terms such as negotiate, bargain or 'goose up' when dealing with the aid office, Chany noted."}
{"original": "Better to say you wish to 'appeal' or 'request reconsideration.'"}
{"original": "Do your homework on the school's ability to dole out grants and scholarships. This means don't ask for nonloan aid from schools that are in financially struggling states or those with meager scholarship resources. Look at a school's endowment, the often enormous kitty that has been built up over years."}
{"original": "Colleges with billion-dollar-plus endowments certainly have the resources to meet your financial need. Others simply may have no-loan policies, which is desirable even if you don't completely meet their financial assistance thresholds."}
{"original": "What you're looking for in vetting a college's cash reserves is endowment per student, which should be on the university's website or findable through a simple online search. This is the amount the school is doling out from its endowment. The higher the number, the more generous it can afford to be."}
{"original": "Don't pay attention to retail price tags. The sticker price of tuition, fees and housing may not be what most families pay. It depends on a college's aid policy. If a school is committed to meeting all or most financial need, that means generous combinations of grants, scholarships and tuition discounts."}
{"original": "Also don't think because a private college's sticker price is much higher than a public school's that your net cost -- after all nonloan aid is awarded -- is going to be higher. You could get a much better deal at a private school because many have more money to offer and are in a position to dole it out. A good way to gauge a college's aid-giving record and net price is by searching College Abacus."}
{"original": "One will have a better chance with an appeal at a private college then at a public university, Chany has found. The key is having a thorough understanding of the aid formulas to know how the colleges and the government are determining your eligibility for aid."}
{"original": "Consider hiring an aid consultant. These professionals go to bat for your family to help you garner more aid. While they charge for their services (they're expensive and rates vary), they can make a difference if you're staring down a six-figure college bill."}
{"original": "If one is thinking about private colleges -- which usually require much more extensive documentation than just the federal FAFSA form -- the cost of a consultant may be just a penny on the dollar, given the sticker price for four years is now $250,000 to $300,000 at many of them."}
{"original": "How do you find an aid consultant? You can ask other parents and guidance counselors for referrals. Just be careful. Some consultants supplement their income by selling financial products you don't need. One neighbor told me a consultant insisted that her family needed an annuity, an often-expensive retirement product that has nothing to do with college financing."}
{"original": "A good place to start finding an adviser who does aid planning is through the Association of Certified College Planning Specialists. They train and certify a variety of financial professionals who can share prudent tax, financial, cash flow and lending advice that can help families lower the cost of college and pay the tuition bill."}
{"original": "If you have some time -- that is, if you're not making a decision about college offers in the next week, planning ahead is still the best strategy for maximizing your aid. Chany suggests that you start working with your child as early as 9th grade."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump's attorneys originally wanted him to submit an updated financial disclosure without certifying the information as true, according to correspondence with the Office of Government Ethics."}
{"original": "Attorney Sheri Dillon said she saw no need for Trump to sign his 2016 personal financial disclosure because he is filing voluntarily this year. But OGE director Walter Shaub said his office would only work with Dillon if she agreed to follow the typical process of having Trump make the certification. That is standard practice for the thousands of financial disclosure forms OGE processes each year."}
{"original": "The Associated Press obtained the letters under a Freedom of Information Act request."}
{"original": "As we discussed, OGE will provide this assistance on the condition that the President is committed to certifying that the contents of his report are true, complete and correct, Shaub wrote in a May 10 letter. When we met on April 27, 2017, you requested that he be excused from providing this certification."}
{"original": "In her letter to Shaub, Dillon says the president will sign and file documents regarding his 2016 financials by mid-June — an indication that she agreed to the OGE requirement that the president certify the information as true to the best of his knowledge."}
{"original": "Dillon also stressed in her letter, dated May 9, that Mr. Trump is under no obligation to file a financial disclosure this year and is doing so voluntarily. President Trump welcomes the opportunity to provide this optional disclosure to the public, and hopes to file it shortly, she wrote."}
{"original": "Personal financial disclosures include an accounting of a person's personal income, assets and liabilities. Mr. Trump's 2016 form will span his general election candidacy, election and transition to power — potentially shedding light on the immediate impact his Republican nomination and election had on his Trump Organization."}
{"original": "Last May, then-candidate Trump's disclosure form showed his business empire had grown in value while he was running for office. However, the information is no substitute for tax returns, which Trump has chosen not to release — breaking the long tradition of his predecessors. Tax documents would show his effective rate of income tax and detail the extent of his charitable giving."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump's decision to file a personal financial disclosure puts him in the company of past Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and others."}
{"original": "Shaub references that history in the first line of his letter to Dillon: Thank you for your letter dated May 9, 2017, regarding the President's decision to adhere to the longstanding tradition of voluntarily filing a public financial disclosure report in the first year after taking office."}
{"original": "Washington — The Plan B that some Senate Democrats had proposed for the minimum wage hike is now off the table, a senior Democratic aide told CBS News. The proposal involved a payroll tax penalty for large companies that pay their workers less than a certain amount."}
{"original": "The aide said they're going to be looking at all legislative avenues in the future to get the minimum wage hike approved, and insisted, we aren't going to just throw up our hands and walk away."}
{"original": "I expect that you'll be hearing a lot more about it this week, but it's not going to go away as an issue, certainly, the aide said."}
{"original": "The fate of the Democrats' proposed $15-an-hour minimum wage hike has been in question since the Senate parliamentarian ruled last week that it couldn't be included in the massive $1.9 trillion economic relief package if that package is passed through the budget reconciliation process. Budget reconciliation allows a bill pass with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes normally required to move legislation through the Senate."}
{"original": "President Biden had previously said in an interview with CBS News in early February that he didn't think a provision raising the minimum wage would be included in a COVID relief bill because of the rules of the United States Senate. The House early Saturday passed the relief bill, including the minimum wage hike."}
{"original": "After the Senate parliamentarian's ruling, Democrats immediately moved to a Plan B to get the minimum wage hike approved through a tax process. This measure, drafted by aides to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, would impose a 5% payroll tax penalty on very large companies that do not pay workers a certain amount. That amount is still unclear: Wyden favors $15 an hour, but is currently seeking feedback from fellow Democrats on that figure and on exactly which companies would face the penalties."}
{"original": "But a Democratic aide said on Sunday night that plan is dead. Extended unemployment insurance is set to run out on March 14 without the new economic relief package. The aide said they realized they would have to go back through the parliamentarian, something that wouldn't be feasible given that tight timeframe."}
{"original": "Because even though we think Plan B was much more likely to pass parliamentary muster than Plan A, you still need to go back through the parliamentarian on Plan B — and between the parliamentarian and finalizing the plan with the caucus, we just thought it would delay passage past the time where wouldn't be able to avoid going over a benefits cliff, the aide said."}
{"original": "The aide insisted the provision was not killed due to any opposition within the Democratic caucus from moderates such as West Virginia's Joe Manchin or Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema."}
{"original": "It was really just working out all the details, the aide said. I think realistically we would have had to have all this nailed down in the next 24 hours."}
{"original": "But the Biden administration's tepid reaction to the proposal may have contributed to the decision to shelf it."}
{"original": "The comments from [economic advisor] Dr. [Jared] Bernstein on Friday were pretty indicative of how they felt, the aide said. He just said that, you know, this is complicated, and obviously doing the tax penalty that we were thinking about is certainly more complicated than just a regulation to say you have to pay $15 an hour, and that he was concerned about being able to get it done in the amount of time we had, which is a very valid concern."}
{"original": "The aide said there might be an effort to pass a bill with a minimum wage hike with 60 votes. But, the aide said, since Democrats can't pass the minimum wage hike through a budget reconciliation process, the only other option would be a broader conversation about eliminating the filibuster."}

{"original": "If she is elected president, Elizabeth Warren has vowed to start wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans with the stroke of a pen on her first day in office, citing a 1965 federal law the Massachusetts senator says would let her proceed without congressional approval."}
{"original": "Don't stop making those student loan payments just yet. Warren's plan, released just before Tuesday night's Demorcratic primary debate, hinges on a purported legal loophole that some legal and college-lending experts say may not even exist. That could allow opponents of student-debt forgiveness to scuttle any efforts to offer relief on such a massive scale."}
{"original": "The U.S. government, just like any lender, has the authority to forgive a debt. But the power to do that almost always rests with Congress — not the president. Student loans appear to be an exception."}
{"original": "Back in 1965, in an effort to expand college access, Congress passed the Higher Education Act, which gives the Department of Education broad powers to run a college student loan program, including the ability to enforce, pay, compromise, waive, or release any right, claim, lien, or demand under the lending program."}
{"original": "And that's the loophole that Warren is banking on. She believes that part of the act would allow her administration to wipe much or all of federally backed student debt."}
{"original": "Three lawyers with Harvard's Project on Predatory Student Lending have written a letter concluding that Warren's unilateral debt relief proposal is lawful and permissible under current law — no congressional stamp of approval needed. One of the authors, Deanne Loonin, is a noted legal expert on student lending."}
{"original": "But here's where that loophole starts to shrink. Even Loonin and her co-authors agree that the U.S. president alone cannot directly forgive student debt. The Higher Education Act grants that power to the Secretary of Education. So, for Warren to waive student loans on her first day in office, her Education Secretary would have to be on the job also to execute the plan."}
{"original": "If the Senate is still controlled by Republicans, the issue of loan forgiveness could become a sticking point in any process to confirm an Education Department chief. That means Warren might still need congressional approval to enact student loan reform in order to get a Secretary confirmed, if not to pass a relief bill."}
{"original": "Eileen Connor, one of Loonin's co-authors, and director of litigation at the Predatory Student Lending Project, believes an acting Education Secretary would also legally be able to forgive debt. But that would certainly open the door to a legal challenge, most likely from companies like Navient and Nelnet that make millions servicing the nation's roughly $1.5 trillion in public student loans and that would see that lucrative business disappear along with the debt."}
{"original": "Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Savingforcollege.com, said Warren's debt plan would hit legal resistance whether it was enacted by an acting Education Secretary or a confirmed one. Kantrowitz said the Higher Education Act does give the Secretary of Education considerable flexibility, but only for the purposes of running the government's student lending program — not for shutting it down, as would happen under Warren's mass loan forgiveness plan."}
{"original": "Kantrowitz also points out that much smaller student debt relief programs require congressional approval, so it's not clear why Warren's plan, which would erase as much as $1 trillion in debt, wouldn't require such a process."}
{"original": "Congress didn't mean to abrogate its responsibility and allow the Secretary of Education to spend $1 trillion, Kantrowitz said. I don't think Warren's plan would even pass the legal counsel of the Department of Education, let alone a court challenge."}
{"original": "Still, Harvard's Connor said the most important part of Warren's proposal to begin forgiving debt on day one of her presidency is that it has pushed the conversation forward. Political pressure could stop the plan short of actually happening, Connor said. But the conversation that was happening was 'could it be done' instead of 'should it.'"}

{"original": "Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough – all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity, Holly Sullivan of Amazon Public Policy said in a statement. Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation."}
{"original": "Seattle-based Amazon said it received 238 proposals from cities and regions hoping to be the home of the company's second headquarters."}
{"original": "The announcement came the day after tech titan Apple (AAPL) said it will build a second corporate campus and hire 20,000 workers in a $350 billion, five-year commitment to the U.S. economy. The company has not announced a chosen city; Apple's main headquarters is in Cupertino, Calif."}
{"original": "Amazon kicked off its hunt for a second headquarters in September, promising to bring 50,000 new jobs and spend up to $5 billion. Proposals from cities, states and regions were due last week, and Amazon made clear that tax breaks and grants would be a big deciding factor on where it chooses to land."}
{"original": "The company has said the second headquarters, dubbed HQ2, will be a full equal to its Seattle home."}
{"original": "Leaders in Pennsylvania hailed the inclusion of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on the list of finalists. Gov. Tom Wolf said he wasn't surprised, given Pennsylvania's location in the heart of the East Coast along with its nationally ranked educational institutions and a workforce equipped to support future growth."}
{"original": "Both Pittsburgh and Philadelphia have a real shot, and we will continue to support these locations by making the case to Amazon that Pennsylvania is a unique and tremendous place to build a business, make a home, and pursue your happiness, Wolf said."}
{"original": "Officials in some metro areas that didn't make the cut expressed disappointment."}
{"original": "New Hampshire's groundbreaking proposal to recruit Amazon was the most comprehensive business marketing plan our state has ever produced, Gov. Chris Sununu said in a statement. While we always knew that our bid was considered a long shot, we are excited that it is already serving as a template for other businesses that now have New Hampshire on their radar."}
{"original": "New Hampshire's Amazon proposal was centered in Londonderry and emphasized the state's lack of a sales or income tax."}
{"original": "Memphis, Tennessee, Mayor Jim Strickland said the state gave it out best shot, while expressing confidence that the process will help it attract other businesses."}
{"original": "The city offered Amazon $60 million in cash incentives."}
{"original": "DALLAS - Coming off record earnings, American Airlines (AAL) says it will make profit-sharing payments to employees."}
{"original": "American said Wednesday that it will share 5 percent of its pretax earnings with all employees, except top management, starting in early 2017 based on 2016 results. Including its regional subsidiaries, American has about 118,000 employees."}
{"original": "Some American employees have complained that they don't get profit sharing like counterparts at other airlines. Delta (DAL) paid out $1.5 billion last year, and United (UAL) shared $698 million with employees."}
{"original": "American says its profit-sharing rate will be lower than other airlines, but added that it plans to offer higher hourly pay rates once it finishes renegotiating union contracts. Unions, which traded profit sharing for higher base pay in leaner years, would need to approve the profit sharing."}
{"original": "American CEO Doug Parker had resisted profit sharing and preferred compensation be set by pay rates. But he told employees Wednesday that there's a team-building benefit to profit sharing."}
{"original": "Last year American Airlines Group, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, earned $7.6 billion. Excluding one-time items like a big tax-accounting credit, the adjusted profit was a record $6.3 billion."}
{"original": "VATICAN CITY - The Vatican is denouncing offshore tax havens and financial instruments such as derivatives and credit default swaps as gravely immoral and unjust, calling them ticking time bombs that hurt the world's poor the most."}
{"original": "In a new document released Thursday, the Vatican's doctrine office teamed up with its social justice department to give a more solid moral foundation to the Holy See's oft-repeated call for a more ethical global financial system."}
{"original": "The document, approved by Pope Francis, calls for banks to create internal ethical committees to ensure decisions work for the common good and not just the myopic egoism of individual corporate bottom lines. It urged better regulation of financial products and for universities to educate the next generation of business leaders about ethics, not just profits."}
{"original": "The recent financial crisis could have been the occasion to develop a new economy, more attentive to ethical principles, and a new regulation of financial activities neutralizing the predatory and speculative dimensions, it said."}
{"original": "Instead, the global financial players have returned to the heights of myopic egoism that excludes any consideration of the common good or the need to spread wealth and heal economic inequality, it said."}
{"original": "Notably missing from the document was a call for a global political authority to regulate markets and tax financial transactions. The Vatican's social justice office, which co-authored the new document, had recommended such an authority in a 2011 document that was widely dismissed even within the Vatican."}
{"original": "Francis and popes before him have frequently denounced growing income inequality and profit-at-all-cost mentality that drives global capitalism, including in encyclicals and other authoritative teaching documents."}
{"original": "Officials told a news conference Thursday that they thought it was worth articulating considerations about specific aspects of the current economic-financial system for officials who work in the field."}
{"original": "The effort marks something of a shift in attention for the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which under the past two popes has focused on issues of doctrinal orthodoxy and sexual morality, not social justice and the poor."}
{"original": "History's first Latin American pope, however, has made those issues the priority of his pontificate, and the document's publication suggests the Vatican bureaucracy is getting the message."}
{"original": "The Seattle City Council passed a scaled-back version of a tax on large businesses to finance efforts to help the homeless, yet the compromise isn't sitting well with two of Seattle's biggest employers -- Amazon (AMZN) and Starbucks (SBUX)."}
{"original": "After weeks of heated debate and public hearings, the city council on Monday unanimously passed a tax of about $275 per worker annually -- less than the $500 each initially envisioned -- on businesses making at least $20 million a year. More than 500 Seattle businesses are expected to feel this new tax."}
{"original": "The levy, scheduled to take effect in 2019, is expected to raise about $47 million a year to construct affordable housing and to provide emergency services for the homeless."}
{"original": "Amazon employs more than 45,000 people in Seattle, and the retailer's growth is seen as a factor in skyrocketing housing costs in the area. Seattle last year had the nation's third-largest homeless population."}
{"original": "After halting two large expansion projects in its hometown to protest the tax proposal, Amazon voiced disappointment with the smaller tax plan, but it said it would resume planning for one new building."}
{"original": "We remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council's hostile approach and rhetoric towards larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here, Drew Herdener, an Amazon vice president, said in an emailed statement. The city does not have a revenue problem -- it has a spending efficiency problem."}
{"original": "Starbucks also blasted the new tax and questioned how the city handles its finances."}
{"original": "This City continues to spend without reforming and fails without accountability, while ignoring the plight of hundreds of children sleeping outside. If they cannot provide a warm meal and safe bed to a five-year-old child, no one believes they will be able to make housing affordable or address opiate addiction, John Kelly, senior vice president of global public affairs and social impact at Starbucks, said in an emailed statement. This City pays more attention to the desires of the owners of illegally parked RVs than families seeking emergency shelter."}
{"original": "If you've earned interest on a bank account or money market fund, or received dividends from stocks or mutual funds, the bank or brokerage firm that holds your money must send you a form 1099-INT (for interest income), 1099-DIV (for dividend income) or 1099-B (for proceeds from the sale of investments). If all goes as planned, you should receive your 1099 by early February because banks and other financial firms must mail them by Jan. 31 or make them available to you electronically (if that's your preference) by Feb. 1."}
{"original": "But those aren't the only kinds of 1099 forms. There's also the 1099-MISC. If you're among the millions of taxpayers who owns a business or is self-employed, and you've made payments for the services you need to run your business, you may be required to send out a 1099-MISC. If you're in that group, it's important to know the rules and requirements for sending 1099 forms."}
{"original": "The IRS makes this a requirement so that you remind those you've paid for services to include those payments on their tax returns. Additionally, you're required to file with the IRS a copy of any 1099-MISC forms that you send out."}
{"original": "Here's what you need to know:"}
{"original": "You must send a 1099 when you've made payments to a contractor of $600 or more during the tax year in the course of your trade or business. The contractor must be an individual or partnership. Payments to corporations currently don't require a 1099, except as noted below."}
{"original": "Payments you've made to an attorney, doctor or other professional should also be reported, if the payments are made in the course of your trade or business rather than for personal use."}
{"original": "Send a 1099 for payments to corporations only if the payments are for medical, health care, legal or fishing activities."}
{"original": "Payment of $600 or more in rent for office space, machines, equipment or land in the course of your trade or business will also require a 1099 if the payment was made to an individual or partnership. There's no requirement to send one for rent payments to a corporation."}
{"original": "You must also furnish a 1099 to recipients of payments you made that include commissions, fees, interest, rents, royalties, annuities and any other type of compensation or income."}
{"original": "Here are a few additional requirements to keep in mind:"}
{"original": "The information you must include on the 1099 includes the recipient's name, address, tax ID number (or SSN) and the amount of the payment. Because of this, most businesses require a completed W-9 form from any vendor or contractor they expect to pay more than $600 before the payment is made."}
{"original": "The IRS deadline for mailing 1099 forms for 2018 payments is Jan. 31. You don't want to overlook this requirement. If you fail to issue a required 1099, the IRS can assess penalties. For individuals, they can range from $30 to $100 per form. For businesses, it's a penalty of up to $250 per form, with a maximum total of $1.5 million."}
{"original": "Finally, you don't have to send 1099s for personal payments unrelated to your trade or business, such as to your landscaper, house painter, babysitter and so on."}

Currently, it takes 30 visits to earn gold status, and then another 12 visits to earn a free drink or treat. The new system will require customers to earn 300 stars to merely reach gold status, and then earn an additional 125 stars to receive a freebie."}

Others lamented that it will take them much longer -- and require more spending -- for them to reach the gold level. Many told Starbucks they planned to stop buying their coffee at its stores."}
{"original": "Starbucks didn't immediately return a request for comment."}
{"original": "The company said the changes were made in response to customer feedback, and claimed that earning rewards will be just as fast or faster for gold-level members. For others, though, it might mean taking a little longer to get that free treat, the company acknowledged on its website."}
{"original": "The changes may hurt small spenders the most, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. A customer spending $2 for regular coffee would earn a free item after spending $24 over 12 visits, but the new system will require them to visit more than 31 times -- spending about $62.50 -- to earn the freebie."}
{"original": "But even big spenders were annoyed by the change, with one customer writing on Facebook, A venti espresso drink is around $4.65ish pre-tax in my neck of the woods. I assume the taxes we pay does not get counted towards our stars. So now I need to buy about 13.4 drinks instead of 12 to get the freebie. Not a fan of this change to the rewards program."}

{"original": "When it comes to putting money aside for a child's future education, 529 saving plans hit the mark as about the most effective way to do so. Every state offers at least one 529 plan, and Americans have put more than $282 billion into 15 million-plus 529 accounts."}
{"original": "Among the benefits are tax-deferred growth (just like an IRA) and tax-free withdrawals for qualifying education expenses. Also, anyone can own and contribute to one."}
{"original": "And now with the new tax law in effect, you should know about a big change in the rules for taking tax-free withdrawals from a 529."}
{"original": "Starting this year, parents can take money out tax-free to pay for the tuition-related costs of K-12 education at a public, private or religious school. However, unlike unlimited withdrawals for post-secondary education costs, allowable K-12 expenses are limited to $10,000 per beneficiary per year. Also, it's not yet clear what public K-12 school costs, if any, will qualify as tuition until the IRS gives further guidance."}
{"original": "Previously, 529s provided tax-free funds only for post-secondary education, such as college tuition, fees, room and board, and required computer software or equipment. Tax-free withdrawals are also allowed for post-secondary tuition at a trade or vocational school, or for other qualifying career training programs."}
{"original": "The K-12 change makes 529 plans more versatile for parents and grandparents who are looking to get a head start on paying the future education costs of their children and grandchildren."}
{"original": "It also makes them a better option than the less widely used Coverdell Education Savings Account, or ESA. These accounts let parents save tax-free for expenses related to college, high school, middle and elementary school. But they limit savings at $2,000 per year per child until the beneficiary reaches age 18. 529s have no such contribution limits."}
{"original": "But the IRS does limit tax-free gifts to the beneficiary child at $15,000 per year. The rules also let you front-load a child's 529 plan account with five years of gifts by making a $75,000 deposit at once and no new contributions for the next five years. Since the various 529 plans are run by their states' sponsors, the states set overall contribution limits, which typically range from $400,000 to $500,000."}
{"original": "The new tax rules also allow 529 account owners to transfer assets to ABLE Accounts, as long as they follow the limits for annual deposits to an ABLE Account. These special tax-advantaged accounts allow families to accumulate savings for a disabled child without affecting the child's eligibility for government benefits such as Medicaid and Social Security disability income."}
{"original": "Finally, before you accumulate money in a 529 plan, you should know what happens to the money if your beneficiary receives financial aid, a scholarship or a grant that pays for most of the child's tuition. The financial aid may not cover other costs, so a 529 can pay for books, supplies and room and board."}
{"original": "And what happens to a 529 if your child doesn't go to college right out of high school? After all, 34 percent of high school graduates didn't enroll in college in 2017. Costs for college or a trade school at a later date are eligible. Since there is no time limit on when 529 assets must be used, you can just let the account grow until whenever your beneficiary decides to pursue higher education."}
{"original": "And if the child you've named as beneficiary of a 529 account doesn't need this money or doesn't ever go to college, you can change the beneficiary to someone else in your immediate family who might benefit. Eligible beneficiaries include siblings, a spouse or children of the beneficiary; cousins, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, grandparents or a parent."}
{"original": "Finally, 529 withdrawals for any reason other than qualified education expenses will trigger federal income tax -- and a 10 percent penalty on the untaxed earnings. Given the many allowable uses, this should be the last resort."}
{"original": "If you're self-employed, an independent contractor or the owner of a small business, you can really use some money-saving tax tips right now. After all, the total taxes on your net income as a sole proprietor can be as high as 55 percent. That's because the top marginal federal tax rate is 39.6 percent and the self-employment, or SE, tax rate is 15.3 percent on every dollar of net profit earned up to $118,500."}
{"original": "On top of that you may have to add state income tax. For example, in New York City that can be 10.5 percent or more."}
{"original": "Fortunately, you can do a lot to cut down your tax liability because so many deductions are available (but be sure you file your tax return correctly by heeding these pointers from the IRS)."}
{"original": "Here's a sampling of tax deductions for self-employed Americans:"}
{"original": "There's no place like home for a tax deduction -- if you use your residence for business purposes. Using Form 8829, you can either tally up your actual expenses for business use of your home, or you can use the Simplified Option for Home Office Deduction, which was allowed for the first time for 2013 tax returns. This allows people who meet the criteria to claim a deduction of $5 per square foot up to a maximum of 300 square feet, for a total deduction of up to $1,500."}
{"original": "In addition to being much easier to calculate, the benefits of the simplified method include being allowed to claim the full amount of home-related deductions (for taxes and mortgage interest) on Schedule A. And when you sell your home later, there's no recapture of depreciation for the years this option is used. Claim the expense for the business use of your home on Line 30 of the Schedule C, Profit of Loss from Business."}
{"original": "If you drive your vehicle for business purposes and you keep a record of the mileage and the purpose of each trip, those miles are eligible for this deduction. For 2016 tax returns, the standard deduction is 54 cents per mile. Claim the deduction on Line 9 of Schedule C."}
{"original": "The cost for services you've paid to other professionals, such as attorneys, inspectors, bookkeepers, etc. is another deduction the self-employed should claim. Even the cost for tax preparation attributed to your self-employment can be included on Line 17 of the Schedule C."}
{"original": "If you rent or lease space in connection with your business, make sure to claim this on Line 20 of the Schedule C. Any utilities paid separately should be included on line 25."}
{"original": "Additional expenses the self-employed may be entitled to include:"}
{"original": "Meals and entertainment (limited to 50 percent of costs)"}
{"original": "Cost of employee benefits and insurance plans"}

{"original": "The average price of regular-grade gasoline in the U.S. jumped 10 cents a gallon over the past two weeks to $3."}
{"original": "Industry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday that the price has spiked 41 cents over the past three months."}
{"original": "Lundberg says the increase is largely driven by higher crude oil costs and the phasing-in of summer-grade gasoline, which is used to prevent smog."}
{"original": "The highest average price in the contiguous 48 states was $3.79 in the San Francisco Bay Area. The lowest was $2.54 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana."}

Paying more at the pump could eat into household budgets and blunt the impact of the tax cuts signed into law late last year, wrote Gregory Daco, head of U.S. economics, and Oren Klachkin, lead economist, at Oxford Economics, in a research note published earlier this month."}
{"original": "If higher prices are sustained, it would sap some momentum from the U.S. economy, they noted. Higher energy prices typically translate into higher input and production costs for businesses, which in turn, constrain business activity and lift inflation."}

{"original": "SAN FRANCISCO - Tax-filing season is turning into a nightmare for thousands of employees whose companies have been duped by email fraudsters. A major phishing scheme has tricked several major companies -- among them, the messaging service Snapchat and disk-drive maker Seagate Technology (STX) -- into relinquishing tax documents that exposed their workers' incomes, addresses and Social Security numbers."}
{"original": "The scam, which involved fake emails purportedly sent by top company officials, convinced the companies involved to send out W-2 tax forms that are ideal for identity theft. For instance, W-2 data can easily be used to file bogus tax returns and claim fraudulent refunds."}
{"original": "The embarrassing breakdowns have prompted employers to apologize and offer free credit monitoring to employees. Such measures, however, won't necessarily shield unwitting victims from the headaches that typically follow identity theft."}
{"original": "This mistake was caused by human error and lack of vigilance, and could have been prevented, Seagate Chief Financial Officer Dave Morton wrote in a March 4 email to the company's employees about the breach."}
{"original": "The swindlers behind the tax scam are exploiting human gullibility rather than weaknesses in computer or Internet security. They have targeted company payroll and personnel departments, in many instances with emails claiming to be requests from the company CEO asking for copies of worker W-2s."}
{"original": "The schemes are so widespread that the IRS sent a March 1 notice alerting employers' payroll departments of the spoofing emails. The IRS said it has seen a 400 percent increase in phishing and computer malware incidents this tax-filing season."}
{"original": "The agency said the scheme has so far claimed several victims, but declined to disclose how many other employers had reported releasing W-2s to unauthorized parties."}
{"original": "It's premature to provide numbers at this point, but even one company being fooled by these criminals is too many, the IRS said in a statement."}
{"original": "The federal alert didn't come soon enough for Snapchat, which on Feb. 28 revealed that its payroll department had been duped by an email impersonating its CEO, Evan Spiegel. The Los Angeles company didn't specify how many employee W-2s it released. Snapchat didn't respond to requests for comment Tuesday."}
{"original": "When something like this happens, all you can do is own up to your mistake, take care of the people affected, and learn from what went wrong, Snapchat wrote in a post on its corporate blog ."}
{"original": "Seagate acknowledged surrendering the W-2s for all of its current and former employees who worked at the company last year. The Cupertino, California, company said several thousand people were affected, but declined to be more precise. As of July last year, Seagate employed about 52,000 workers, however, all but 10,500 of them were based in Asia."}
{"original": "Both Snapchat and Seagate notified federal authorities about the phishing attacks and are offering affected workers two years of free credit monitoring."}
{"original": "It's unclear how many other employers have been sucked into the tax scam. Hundreds of companies appear to have been targeted, according to Stu Sjouwerman, CEO of KnowBe4, a Florida company that trains employers to detect and avoid such scams."}
{"original": "Phishing attacks commonly occur during holidays and other annual events, such as tax season, to prey upon people's routines, said Fatih Orhan, director of technology at security firm Comodo. The attacks are becoming increasingly effective because they rely on powers of persuasion instead of an attachment or link that might raise suspicion, said Ed Jennings, chief operating officer at email security company Mimecast."}
{"original": "It's just like someone who convinces you to hand over $20 on the street, Jennings said."}
{"original": "Sjouwerman said the W-2-seeking attacks are most likely are being sent by Eastern European hacker groups planning to sell the information or claim fraudulent tax refunds."}
{"original": "The most effective phishing attacks use emails decked in company logos and colors to reduce the chances of detection, Orhan said. It's relatively easy for con artists to pose as a CEO online, since they can quickly fetch convincing details from a Google search or a perusal of professional networking service LinkedIn."}
{"original": "That doesn't excuse payroll or personnel departments who reflexively acquiesce to requests in apparently legitimate email, experts say. For instance, Sjouwerman said his firm's controller received a phishing email that, at first glance, appeared to be sent by him. But the email asked the controller to kindly prepare employees' W-2s, a phrase that he never uses. Company employees were alert enough not to send out the W-2s."}
{"original": "Even without a red flag like that, payroll and personnel specialists should be trained well enough to question why a CEO needs to see individual worker W-2s in the first place."}
{"original": "It's a case of: 'Oh, the boss wants it', Sjouwerman said. They stop thinking, 'Why would this be?'"}

The site informs people about the date of their payment and whether they will receive it via direct deposit or the mailed payment date."}
{"original": "Still, there are some glitches that are delaying the payments of the stimulus money and creating confusion and questions for consumers. Chief among them: Some people who had their 2020 tax returns filed through tax preparers like H&R Block may have had their stimulus check sent directly to the tax firm, rather than their bank account."}
{"original": "This echoes a glitch that impacted payment of the first stimulus check for some people who used tax prep services and for whom the IRS didn't have direct-deposit information. With the second round of stimulus checks, a similar issue may impact some people, with H&R Block warning its customers who used a service called a refund transfer that they might see an account number you don't recognize on the Get My Payment website. Refund transfers are offered to allow people to tap their refund to pay their tax prep fees, according to H&R Block."}

{"original": "Intuit's TurboTax on Tuesday also tweeted that some customers were having problems receiving their stimulus checks. The IRS announced yesterday that due to the speed at which they issued this second round of payments, they sent some payments to an account that may be closed or no longer active, the tax-prep service said."}
{"original": "The IRS said checks sent to closed or inactive accounts can't by law be held by the financial institutions and redirected to consumers. Instead the funds will be returned to the IRS, and people who didn't receive a check must wait until they file their 2020 tax returns to get the stimulus money in a refund. Because of that, it's likely that those customers will face a delay."}
{"original": "Some customers responded on social media that they had panicked after failing to receive their funds as expected, with some expressing concern they had been a victim of fraud."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, the IRS said on Monday that the direct deposits could take several days to post to individual accounts after the official payment day of January 4. It added that some people may see their stimulus checks listed as pending or as provisional payments in their accounts."}
{"original": "Here's what to know about tracking your payment."}
{"original": "How can I get my stimulus check?"}
{"original": "The IRS says people will automatically get their payments in the second round of stimulus checks. One way to track the status of your payment is to visit the Get My Payment site."}
{"original": "As with the first round, you will need to enter a few pieces of personally identifiable information, such as your Social Security number, date of birth and address. The site will then provide you with the status of both your first and second stimulus payments."}
{"original": "What will Get My Payment tell me?"}
{"original": "The Get My Payment site will inform you about the date of the payment and the method, which the IRS says will either be the mailed payment date or the date of direct deposit to your bank account. Checks sent in the mail will need more processing and mailing time, although the IRS didn't specify the length of time that will be needed."}
{"original": "The IRS says it is prioritizing direct deposit payments to people with valid routing and account information."}
{"original": "Can I change my bank account information?"}
{"original": "The IRS says that option isn't available this time around because the tax agency is issuing the checks based on information it already has on file from the first round of checks. In the first round of checks directed by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (or CARES Act), people could enter or correct their bank account information at the Get My Payment site."}
{"original": "However, that's not an option in the second round. You will not be able to add new routing or account information and cannot request to receive your payment by EIP Card, the IRS said on December 30."}
{"original": "What if the IRS sent the check to a closed account?"}
{"original": "Because people can't update their bank account information on the Get My Payment site, there's concern that some checks might be sent to accounts that were recently closed. If that's the case, the IRS says you'll have to wait until you file your 2020 tax returns."}
{"original": "The stimulus checks are actually a tax rebate that can be applied to your annual tax returns — but that means people may be waiting weeks or even months for their stimulus money to show up through their tax refund."}
{"original": "Why is it saying Payment not available?"}
{"original": "This was a message that frustrated many consumers in the first round of checks, and resulted from a number of issues, such as if the IRS was still verifying whether a person qualified for a check."}
{"original": "Some people are receiving this message with the second round of stimulus checks, which the IRS says either means the person doesn't qualify for a check — such as if their income exceeds the eligibility threshold — or the IRS says it was unable to issue you an EIP 2 payment, which is the IRS' term for the second stimulus check."}
{"original": "The IRS said that it might not be able to issue a second stimulus payment if it is still processing your most recent tax return."}
{"original": "What if I receive Social Security through the Direct Express debit card?"}
{"original": "The IRS says that people who receive government benefits such as Social Security, Railroad Retirement benefits, Supplemental Security Income or Veteran's Benefits through Direct Express — a debit card that automatically receives payments — will get their second stimulus checks deposited onto that card."}

{"original": "The government shutdown -- the longest in U.S. history -- is estimated in 31 days to have cost the American economy almost as much as the $5.7 billion President Trump has demanded for his proposed southern border wall."}
{"original": "Average weekly direct and indirect costs of the partial shutdown, which began Dec. 22, currently add up to $1.2 billion, according to Beth Ann Bovino, S&P Global's U.S. chief economist. Monday marked the start of the shutdown's fifth week, and the closure will have caused roughly $6 billion in damage to the economy if the government does not reopen by the end of the week, Bovino estimated in a recent research note."}
{"original": "And the average weekly cost of the shutdown is expected to grow as the damage to industries and consumers both widens and deepens. The longer this shutdown drags on, the more collateral damage the economy will suffer, Bovino wrote."}
{"original": "Direct effects of the marathon shutdown include lost productivity from the hundreds of thousands of furloughed workers who haven't been paid since the Dec. 22 closure. While the precise impact has not been calculated, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that federal employees' lost hours during a 16-day shutdown back in October 2013 reduced fourth-quarter GDP by 0.3 percentage points."}
{"original": "As in previous shutdowns, the productivity lost from furloughed government workers will never be regained. In real terms, GDP will be lower since no 'product' was created, the S&P Global note said."}
{"original": "Federal workers will be compensated when the government reopens, but workers in the roughly 4 million private-sector jobs that depend on the federal government won't receive back pay, according to Capital Economics."}
{"original": "The longer the shutdown extends, the more grave its impact could be if it starts to affect unpaid workers' consumption, for example."}
{"original": "The partial closure of the Securities and Exchange Commission will delay companies' plans to file initial public offerings, at least until it reopens, and the Treasury's shutdown threatens to delay income tax refunds, which could have a dampening effect on sectors that tend to benefit from tax-refund spending, including auto retailers, according to Raymond James."}
{"original": "Private businesses that depend on visitors to national sites are also feeling the pinch as Americans cancel their vacations to national parks, museums and monuments that are closed."}
{"original": "An extended shutdown could reach even further into American households by causing these businesses to reduce their staffs -- taking wages away from private citizens."}
{"original": "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's largest business association, last week urged Mr. Trump and Congress to end the shutdown. Consequences from the shutdown are wide and growing, Neil L. Bradley, the group's chief policy officer, wrote in a letter Tuesday. He listed a wide range of affected programs, data and functions."}

Companies ranging from manufacturers to brewers are unable to receive the approvals required by law to sell their products, he wrote. Travelers are delayed."}

{"original": "President Biden is directing the federal government to increase its purchases of U.S.-made goods, seeking to remove loopholes from an existing Buy American policy and follow up on his promise to help the nation's beleaguered manufacturing industry."}
{"original": "The U.S. has lost about 540,000 factory jobs since last February, as the pandemic pummeled the nation's economy into recession. The idea behind Mr. Biden's executive order would in part be to use the roughly $600 billion that the federal government spends annually on procurement to lift domestic manufacturing and employment."}
{"original": "I don't buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past, Mr. Biden said Monday in delivering remarks on his latest initiative. The prior administration allowed loopholes in the Buy American policy, the president stated. This is different, Biden said, vowing his will tighten the existing policies and broaden them."}
{"original": "Mr. Biden's order seeks to change the rules of the existing Buy American program, raising the bar for contractors to qualify for a waiver and selling foreign-made goods to federal agencies. It also stipulates that more of a product's components originate from U.S. factories, and hikes the government's threshold of how much more can be paid to buy U.S. goods versus foreign products."}
{"original": "The move calls for the creation of a public website of companies given exemptions to sell foreign goods to the U.S. government, giving American suppliers and manufacturers more information so they can better compete. It also creates a position at the White House Office of Management and Budget to oversee the initiative and track whether progress is being made."}
{"original": "The president's move drew cautious praise from some quarters, with Public Citizen calling it a good first step, so long as the White House follows through on really ditching exemptions that allow many foreign companies to be treated as American for U.S. government purchasing needs, resulting in U.S. tax dollars getting diverted overseas."}
{"original": "If the Biden administration's planned stimulus funds are to be reinvested in the U.S. to rebuild our resilience and create jobs, then the massive trade-pact loophole to Buy American needs to be closed immediately, Lori Wallach, a trade expert at Public Citizen, said in a statement. Otherwise billions will leak out in off-shored government procurement contracts."}
{"original": "The Alliance for American Manufacturing also applauded Mr. Biden's efforts, and urged specific steps. It's essential to close loopholes, reduce waivers, broaden coverage to more federal spending and more manufactured products, and strengthen origin standards, Scott Paul, president of the group, said in a statement. Stronger domestic content preference policies and a sizable new investment in infrastructure and clean energy will spur factory job creation and new investment in America."}

It's lower than the $500-per-worker tax initially proposed. The tax would begin in 2019 and raise about $48 million a year to pay for affordable housing and homeless services."}
{"original": "The debate over who should pay to solve a housing crisis exacerbated by Seattle's rapid economic growth comes amid skyrocketing rents and rising homelessness. The Seattle region had the third-highest number of homeless people in the U.S. and saw 169 homeless deaths in 2017."}

{"original": "Super Bowl money is a big topic of conversation in San Francisco -- as in, how much should the host city get?"}

{"original": "We have credentialed over 40,000 people to work on the Super Bowl itself, Peter O'Reilly, the NFL's senior vice president of special events, told CBS News. He admits the scale of the game has become a bit ridiculous."}
{"original": "It has, O'Reilly said. But it really is just a testament to our fans and their passion for the game."}
{"original": "Along with that passion, the fans have brought traffic tie-ups and grumbling about how much it's costing San Francisco's taxpayers."}
{"original": "Our taxpayers shouldn't be left with a $5 million tab, Jane Kim, a member of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors, told CBS News."}

{"original": "The best financial advice tends to apply to pretty much everyone. You don't need a spreadsheet of pros and cons and complex scenarios. What you need is a rule of thumb."}
{"original": "There's no shame in using one-size-fits-all advice. A study of West Point cadets, for example, found teaching rules of thumb was at least as effective as standard personal finance training in increasing students' knowledge and confidence as well as their willingness to take financial risks. Researchers found money rules of thumb were more effective than teaching accounting principles to small-business owners in the Dominican Republic."}
{"original": "Here are a dozen shamelessly simple money rules of thumb I've collected over the years to help people address how they borrow and save."}
{"original": "You need to be able to get your hands on cash or credit equal to three months' worth of expenses. The classic emergency fund advice — that you need three to six months of expenses saved — is great, but it can take years to save that much and you have other more important priorities (see retirement, below). While you build up your cash stash, make sure you have a Plan B for a true emergency. That could be money in a Roth IRA (you can pull out your contributions at any time without paying taxes or penalties), space on your credit cards or an unused home equity line of credit."}
{"original": "2. Save 15 percent for retirement…"}
{"original": "If you got a late start or want to retire early, you may need to save more. Run the numbers on your retirement plan. For most people, 15 percent including any company match is a good place to start. Even if you can't save as much as you should, start somewhere and kick up your savings rate regularly. Retirement should be your top financial priority. You can't get back lost company matches, lost tax breaks and the lost years when your money isn't earning tax-deferred returns."}
{"original": "3. …and don't touch that money"}
{"original": "Leave retirement money for retirement. When your retirement fund is small, you may feel like spending it doesn't really matter. It does. Taxes and penalties will cost you at least 25 percent and likely more of what you withdraw. Plus, every $1 you take out costs you $10 to $20 in lost future retirement income. Once your retirement fund is larger, it may be easy to convince yourself there are good reasons to borrow or withdraw the money. There really aren't. Leave the money alone so it's there when you need it."}
{"original": "Get in the habit of putting at least $25 a month aside for college soon as your child is born. Even small contributions to a 529 college savings plan can add up over time — perhaps the difference between choosing the best school and choosing a school based on its financial aid package. (But if you have to choose, retirement saving is more important. Your kids can always get student loans, but as you've probably heard, no one will lend you money for retirement.)"}
{"original": "5. Plan and manage your student loans"}
{"original": "Your total borrowing shouldn't exceed what you expect to make your first year out of school. At today's interest rates, this will ensure that you can pay off what you owe within 10 years while keeping payments below 10 percent of your income, which is considered an affordable repayment rate. What if you didn't limit your borrowing and are now struggling? You have options. Look into consolidating your loans or income-based repayment plans."}
{"original": "6. Cars: Buy used and drive it for 10 years"}
{"original": "New cars are lovely, but they're expensive and lose an astonishing amount of value in their first two years. Let someone else pay for that depreciation and take advantage of the fact that today's better-built cars can run well for at least a decade if properly maintained. You can save hundreds of thousands of dollars over your driving lifetime this way."}
{"original": "7. Car loans: Use the 20/4/10 rule"}
{"original": "Ideally, you wouldn't borrow money to buy an asset that loses value, but you may not always be able to pay cash for a car. If you can't, protect yourself from overspending by putting 20 percent down, limiting the loan to four years and capping your monthly payment at no more than 10 percent of your gross income. A big down payment keeps you from being underwater, or owing more on the car than it's worth, as soon as you drive off the lot. Limiting the length of the loan helps you build equity faster and reduces the overall interest you pay. Finally, capping the size of the payments prevents your car from eating your budget."}
{"original": "8. Make credit cards work for you"}
{"original": "If you carry a balance, look for a low-rate card so you can pay off your debt faster and don't mess with rewards cards right now. If you pay in full each month (as you should), find a rewards card that returns at least 1.5 percent of what you spend. You should regularly review your rewards programs to make sure you're getting enough value from them. The programs can change, as can your spending and the way you use rewards. (Check out this article for a lazy optimizer approach to maximizing your credit-card rewards.)"}
{"original": "Cover yourself for catastrophic expenses, not the stuff you can pay out of pocket. Insurance should protect you against the big things — unexpected expenses that could wipe you out financially, such as your home burning down or a car accident that triggers a lawsuit. You want high limits on your policies — and high deductibles, too. Small claims don't make financial sense in the long run. You may gain some small insurance payments, but you risk a rate increase that could more than cancel out your gains."}
{"original": "10. Choose a reasonable mortgage amount"}
{"original": "If you can't afford the payment on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, you can't afford the house. You may be able to save money by using another kind of mortgage, such as a hybrid loan that offers a lower initial rate. But if you're using an alternative loan because that's the only way you can buy the home you want, you may have set your sights too high. A budget-busting mortgage puts you at risk of spiraling into ever-deeper debt, especially when you add in all the other costs of homeownership."}
{"original": "11. Choose the right mortgage rate"}
{"original": "Fix the rate for at least as long as you plan to be in the home. Plans can change, obviously, but you don't want a big payment jump to force you out of a home you hoped to live in for years to come. If you're pretty sure you'll be moving in five years, a five-year hybrid could be a good option. If you think you may stay for 10 years or more, though, consider opting for the certainty of a 30-year fixed rate."}
{"original": "You have better things to do with your money than prepay a low-rate, potentially tax-deductible mortgage. Shaving years off your mortgage and saving money on interest sounds great. But before you consider making extra payments to reduce your mortgage principal, make sure more important priorities are covered. You should be saving enough for retirement. You should have paid off all other debt, since most other loans have higher rates and the interest isn't deductible. It would be smart to have that emergency fund built up as well and to be adequately insured. If you've covered all of those bases and still want to pay down your mortgage, have at it."}

{"original": "3 money mistakes you might make after a breakup"}
{"original": "​1. Forgetting to update beneficiaries iStockphoto Before you and your love breakup up permanently, don't forget to update your beneficiaries. Check to make sure that your spouse is no longer listed as the beneficiary on your individual bank accounts, life insurance policies, and retirement accounts. Attorney and mediator Daniel R. Burns advises taking a very close look at all of your benefits. After I conclude a divorce settlement with my mediation clients, I recommend that they look carefully at everything they own, including benefits they have with their employer, which are often not obvious. Unless their agreement requires otherwise, I further recommend they change the beneficiary designations for any retirement accounts, pensions, and insurance policies. Even if your agreement requires you to maintain your former spouse as the beneficiary on any of these accounts, it is still a good idea to complete a new beneficiary designation so there is no doubt about what you intended. Your beneficiaries will thank you for saving them a lot of trouble down the road! said Burns."}
{"original": "​2. Forgetting about joint debts iStockphoto Don't forget about joint liabilities such as outstanding tax bills, mortgage debt, and joint credit card accounts. Your tax bill must be paid, your mortgage will likely need to be refinanced, and your joint credit cards will need to be canceled. Don't wait until you receive a past-due notice to start handling your finances. Otherwise, old debts may come back to haunt you. Just as a divorcing couple must divide what they own, so they must divide what they owe, said attorney Michael J. Davis. The piper must be paid...Credit card companies are not bound by a divorcing couple's property agreement. In all jurisdictions, joint credit card debt is jointly owned because each spouse has joint and several liability for the obligation. Even when one spouse agrees to take on a debt, if it has the other spouse's name on it -- or in some cases, even if it does not -- the creditor has the right to come after both spouses for payment."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania in 2016 by less than 1%. To win in the upcoming election, he or the 2020 Democrat will need support from a crucial group of voters in the swing state: suburban women."}
{"original": "Eight women across the political spectrum from suburbs outside of Philadelphia told CBS This Morning co-host Anthony Mason what they thought about Mr. Trump, the Democratic candidates and issues like the economy and foreign policy. Here's what they had to say:"}
{"original": "Four of the women said they could not vote for Mr. Trump. One of them, Melinda Wolff, said she doesn't like to be labeled as either a Democrat or a Republican, but describing a candidate she would vote for, said, I want somebody I can look up to, somebody that has dignity, somebody that's not bullying."}
{"original": "MaryEllen Digregorio, who flipped from voting Democrat to voting for Mr. Trump in 2016, said she doesn't see Trump as bullying."}
{"original": "I see him challenging because the ridiculous that goes on sometimes, she said. I thought it was refreshing to find a businessman who made himself a millionaire want to work for me."}
{"original": "I do have to ask, don't you think he's very thin-skinned? Cynthia Sabatini, an Independent who is registered as a Republican, asked Digregorio about Mr. Trump."}
{"original": "Listen, my husband's thin-skinned and a whackadoodle, and I'm still with him 26 years, she said."}
{"original": "Sabatini said she thinks a politician needs to be thicker skinned and not excoriate those who disagree with him."}
{"original": "Julia Bohnenberger, a registered Republican who said she voted for Mr. Trump because he was the most qualified candidate, said part of Mr. Trump's appeal is that he punches back at people."}
{"original": "Past Republicans, she said, have failed because they've taken the high road and they've been buried by it."}
{"original": "I'm not saying that this necessarily appeals to me, but I think Trump appeals to a lot of people because he punches back, she said."}
{"original": "Mary Lou Doyle, who plans to vote for Mr. Trump in the 2020 election, said the president isn't everyone's cup of tea, without a doubt."}
{"original": "I don't like everything he says, she said. I don't need him to be like me. I need to be safe, and I need to be able to know that my economy for my friends, my family is solid."}
{"original": "Charrele Robinson-Brown, a Democrat with some conservative ideals, was the only Democrat in the group who had chosen who she will vote for. She said she has picked former Vice President Joe Biden."}
{"original": "Asked why, she said, Honestly, the lesser of the evils."}
{"original": "He's got past experience, Digregorio pointed out."}
{"original": "Wolff said she will vote for who can best beat Trump."}
{"original": "Debbie Morse, a Democrat, agreed with Wolff. And I do think Biden's probably at the top of the list, but I'm still looking at the other candidates also."}
{"original": "Nelly Jimenez, an Independent who said she will not vote for Mr. Trump, said she is concerned she'll have to vote for the less evil of the Democratic party or whoever else shows up."}
{"original": "I am disappointed. I don't have choices. I don't feel that I have someone who's going to move me, she said."}
{"original": "Sabatini argued Jimenez could write in a candidate instead. I did a write-in in 2016, she said. My family took issue with me that I was complicit in Trump's election … But it was a matter of conscience."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump's international policy has been bold and effective in ways that we never anticipated. Getting rid of ISIS, getting rid of Soleimani, getting rid of al-Baghdadi, Bohnenberger said."}
{"original": "I will tell you personally, I'm a Zionist, she added. For a president to so boldly stand for Israel is very important to me, and I'm a Christian, by the way."}
{"original": "Bohnenberger also said strong borders were important to her."}
{"original": "Jimenez said she was concerned about the way people and children have been treated at the U.S.-Mexico border."}
{"original": "There is a lot of issues for me there about racial profiling, she said. The issue of the border is one that I can't forget or forgive."}
{"original": "Robinson-Brown agreed. I think that Donald Trump is allowing people to make the decision to mistreat people at the border, to have racially charged marches, she said."}
{"original": "Robinson-Brown said she likes that Mr. Trump takes hard stances on some things, but, she said, he's not taking the hard stance on the racial issues, which are very close to me because I'm a black female."}
{"original": "We need for him to take a hard line … and say, 'Hey listen, we don't act like that here,' she added."}
{"original": "I like the fact that my portfolio looks pretty nice right now. I can make my taxes next year 'cause as time goes by cost of living does not match the cost of really living, Digregorio said."}
{"original": "Sabatini questioned the tax cuts under Mr. Trump."}
{"original": "Economic fairness is very important to me, she said. I'm not a Bernie Sanders supporter, I'm not an Elizabeth Warren supporter, but I believe that the Tax Act of 2017 was skewed in favor of the half of the 1%."}
{"original": "And the corporations as well, added Doyle."}
{"original": "Washington - Delta Air Lines can't get eight new aircraft in the air. Roughly a million government employees and contractors aren't being paid. Some Americans who are trying to start small businesses face delays in obtaining the required tax identification number from the IRS."}
{"original": "As the partial government shutdown moves through its fourth week with no end in sight, the economic blow is hitting not only federal workers but also businesspeople, households and travelers across the country. And while the damage to the overall economy so far remains slight, economist foresee real damage if the shutdown drags into February or beyond."}
{"original": "Even if the shutdown is over by the end of the month, the hit to growth will be material, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a research note."}
{"original": "Shepherdson projects that after growing for nearly 10 years, the economy might even contract in this year's first quarter if the shutdown lasts through March. Other forecasts are less dire. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, thinks if the shutdown extends that long, the economy would slow by 0.5 percentage point but would remain on solid footing."}
{"original": "S&P Global estimated the U.S. economy had lost $3.6 billion as of Jan. 11. If the shutdown continues. the loss could soon exceed the $5.7 billion Mr. Trump is asking for the proposed border wall, S&P Global estimated."}
{"original": "That may seem like pennies for the world's biggest economy, but it means a lot to those workers trying to cover their household costs without their paychecks, Beth Ann Bovino, the S&P Global chief economist, wrote in a report."}
{"original": "For now, though, the shutdown is rippling through the economy in ways that are not always visible, making it hard to fully assess its consequences. Complicating the task is that much of the economic data the government normally provides — from retail sales to home construction to the nation's GDP — has been suspended because the agencies that compile it remain closed."}
{"original": "With national parks shut down and some travelers suffering through long security lines and in some cases partial airport closures, for example, many Americans are having to decide whether to cancel travel and vacation plans."}
{"original": "It is now plainly evident that the shutdown is affecting air travel, and when that happens, damage to the overall U.S. economy will shortly follow, said Jonathan Grella, a spokesman for the U.S. Travel Association, a trade group."}
{"original": "Some companies are pointing to specific problems: Delta said Tuesday the shutdown is costing it $25 million a month in government travel. Delta CEO Edward Bastian said with the Federal Aviation Administration partially closed, Delta will also likely delay the start date of eight new aircraft."}
{"original": "The Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees public stock offerings, is mostly closed because of the shutdown. As a result, some companies that had been planning initial public offerings in coming months, including Uber and Lyft, are likely facing delays. Marianne Lake, chief financial officer for JPMorgan Chase, said the bank could lose out on fees from IPOs and merger and acquisition deals that would be delayed if other shuttered agencies can't approve them."}
{"original": "For small companies, too, the effects are increasingly making a mark. Edward Farrer, an executive at Principal Manufacturing, a manufacturer in Broadview, Illinois, said when the shutdown took effect, his company had nearly won approval for a request to the Commerce Department to import specialty steel from Europe free of U.S. tariffs. Commerce is among the now-closed government departments."}
{"original": "We think we'd got it to the goal line and were waiting for an approval, but everything is at an impasse because of the shutdown, Farrer said."}
{"original": "Principal Manufacturing uses mainly American-made steel in the parts it sells to automakers and other industrial companies. But it imports some steel from Europe that it uses to make a component for auto underbodies. Last spring, it asked the Trump administration to exclude that steel from the 25 percent tariffs the White House imposed on steel imports. Commerce was considering the request as part of a process the administration had established for companies that say they can't obtain the steel they import from elsewhere."}
{"original": "For now, Farrer said Principal is paying the tariffs, which typically cost it tens of thousands of dollars a month. It wants to keep doing the work, so the company is eating the cost, Farrer said. But we can't do it forever."}
{"original": "Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber has heard from members that have been unable to obtain an employer ID number from the IRS. That number is needed to open bank accounts and file tax returns."}
{"original": "Eric Smith, an IRS spokesman, said most U.S.-based businesses can obtain the numbers online, but paper applications aren't being processed."}
{"original": "The most hard-hit by the shutdown, of course, are government workers themselves, who missed their first paychecks Friday, and contractors that work closely with the government. Many have had to cut back on purchases, lowering overall consumer spending."}
{"original": "Among them is Pearl Fraley of Greenville, North Carolina, a consumer safety inspector for the food safety inspection service. Fraley, 53, helps ensure the safety of the nation's food supply by monitoring slaughter processing plants -- a job she has held for over 15 years."}
{"original": "Fraley's position is deemed essential, so she has to go to work even though she isn't being paid. She and her co-workers were told in an email that if they work 40 hours, they aren't eligible for unemployment benefits under North Carolina rules -- even though they're receiving no pay."}
{"original": "Fraley said she feels like an indentured servant and said her stress level is over the top."}
{"original": "I can't pay my rent, she said. I can't pay my car payment or insurance. I have money for gas to go to work and for food."}
{"original": "For now, her 25-year-old daughter is contributing some of the money she earns from working at McDonald's. McDonald's doesn't typically pay enough for someone to actually live on, Fraley noted."}
{"original": "Moody's Zandi said the shutdown could inflict longer-term damage on the government — and ultimately on the economy — in ways that might not be obvious. He noted, for example, that some demoralized federal employees, particularly those with vital skills in such areas as cybersecurity, might quit for jobs in the private sector. Federal agencies may also have a harder time recruiting young workers."}
{"original": "Government workers have options, Zandi said, particularly with unemployment low and many employers desperate to fill jobs. This could be quite debilitating to the government."}

{"original": "Companies that lay off more than 50 workers in New Jersey may soon have to pay them severance, with the Garden State poised to adopt what's dubbed the Toys R Us bill that advocates say would be the first of its kind in the nation."}
{"original": "Approved by the New Jersey Senate in December, the state Assembly on Monday voted 55-22 in approving the legislation, which would require that companies give workers a week's pay for every year worked, and extend the employee notice period for mass firings to 90 days from 60 days."}
{"original": "The bill could be signed into law as soon as Tuesday by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, a Democrat who campaigned as a pro-labor advocate and last year signed legislation raising the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024."}
{"original": "Given the state's present political makeup, New Jersey is now among a handful of states viewed as fertile ground for enacting additional pro-labor legislation, according to Rebecca Kolins Givan, an associate professor in the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations."}
{"original": "The current governor forged his identity on being helpful to working families, Givan told CBS MoneyWatch. You can say the current legislature and the governor make a potentially successful venue for enhancing workers' rights at the state level, and it's become a particular focus because federal protections are so minimal, and there's little hope of that changing anytime soon."}
{"original": "The New Jersey legislation was drafted in response to a spate of business closings and bankruptcies, with Toys R Us in particular drawing fire for laying off tens of thousands of workers with little or no compensation after declaring bankruptcy in September 2018. The retailer's demise had it closing 740 stores in the U.S., including its New Jersey headquarters and distribution center."}
{"original": "The Toys R Us closure led to protests and a public relations campaign that succeeded in getting two of the private-equity firms that took over the retailer in a leveraged buyout in 20015 to create a $20 million financial assistance fund for workers in November."}
{"original": "As things stand, there is no law in the country mandating that companies guarantee severance pay to employees affected by bankruptcy, according to United for Respect, which helped organize former Toys R Us workers and advocated for the measure."}
{"original": "Companies have exploited bankruptcy laws to protect their profits while workers lose their jobs and severance pay, according to state Senator Joseph Cryan, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. Employees shouldn't be left in the dark as companies are pillaged for their resources after equity firms load them down with debt and the top officials walk away with bonuses. The law needs to be upgraded to better protect the rights of the workers."}
{"original": "The bill could help me in the future, said former Payless ShoeSource employee Beth Hink, who traveled from Neptune, New Jersey, to Trenton, the state capital, to lobby lawmakers to pass the bill."}
{"original": "It's really important for New Jersey to lead the way and show other states that it is possible, that standing with working families is always your best bet in supporting a healthy economy, said Hink, who received three days pay as severance when she lost her job as a store manager in May after working for the bankrupt retailer for almost 20 years."}
{"original": "Conversely, business groups decried the proposal as offering further impetus to companies to steer clear of New Jersey."}
{"original": "If enacted, this proposal would make our business climate even less competitive, New Jersey Business & Industry Association. said in a statement. It would come after the enactment of a series of tax increases and other expensive mandates imposed on employers during the past year, including a higher corporate business tax, higher state income tax, new paid sick leave requirements and the signing of a $15 minimum wage."}

{"original": "We could reverse that for 2018 and 2019 so that people could refile their taxes, Pelosi told the Times. They'd have more disposable income, which is the lifeblood of our economy, a consumer economy that we are."}
{"original": "However, repealing the cap on SALT deductions would primarily benefit high-income earners, and liberal economists are largely opposed to the idea. The Times reported a repeal would affect an estimated 13 million American households — nearly all of which earn at least $100,000 a year. A spokesman for Pelosi told the paper that a repeal could be tailored to focus on middle-class earners and include limitations on the higher end."}
{"original": "Any legislation crafted by House Democrats would also run into resistance in the Republican-controlled Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday that any phase four legislation passed in the House would not get far in the upper chamber."}
{"original": "I'm not going to allow this to be an opportunity for the Democrats to achieve unrelated policy items they wouldn't otherwise be able to pass, McConnell said."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump also indicated in a tweet Tuesday morning that he would not support Pelosi's suggestions, reacting to her appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Pelosi said she hoped the next bill would address the concerns of our state and local governments."}
{"original": "I watched a portion of low rated (very) Morning Psycho (Joe) this Morning in order to see what Nancy Pelosi had to say, & what moves she was planning to further hurt our Country. Actually, other than her usual complaining that I'm a terrible person, she wasn't bad. Still praying! Mr. Trump wrote."}
{"original": "However, in a second tweet, Mr. Trump suggested that he would support infrastructure legislation."}
{"original": "With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO, this is the time to do our decades long awaited Infrastructure Bill. It should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4, Mr. Trump wrote."}
{"original": "Melissa Quinn contributed to this report."}
{"original": "The IRS said it is mailing 8 million prepaid Visa debit cards loaded with a federal stimulus payment, advising people to keep an eye open for the envelopes if the funds aren't directly deposited in their bank accounts."}
{"original": "The tax agency also said it has changed the envelopes to make it more evident that they include the $600 payment, which Congress approved in late December as a way to offer millions of Americans additional financial relief as the economy struggles to recover from the coronavirus pandemic."}
{"original": "Last spring, some people discarded their prepaid debit cards loaded with the first round of stimulus money because the envelopes weren't clearly marked as coming from the IRS or Treasury Department. The IRS said the latest batch of debit cards will be mailed in a white envelope with a label that prominently displays the Treasury seal."}
{"original": "IRS and Treasury urge eligible people who don't receive a direct deposit to watch their mail carefully during this period, the IRS said in a statement."}
{"original": "The agency started delivering the second round of stimulus checks into millions of bank accounts this week, providing $600 for each eligible adult and child. Because the IRS doesn't have bank account information for all those who are eligible for payments, it is also sending paper checks as well as prepaid debit cards to millions of households."}
{"original": "#IRS starting to mail out #stimulus checks by debit cards. Some of those who received first round of stimulus by check or deposit may this time get it by prepaid debit card. More info in links below:https://t.co/8NlRqOpFOJhttps://t.co/CgNXQMuHn9 — UnemploymentPUA (@UnemploymentPUA) January 7, 2021"}
{"original": "The IRS said people should not assume they will receive their mailed stimulus payment via the same method they did in the spring, when the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided $1,200 for each eligible adult and $500 per child."}
{"original": "Taxpayers should note that the form of payment for the second mailed [stimulus payment] may be different than the first mailed [payment], the IRS said in a statement. Some people who received a paper check last time might receive a prepaid debit card this time, and some people who received a prepaid debit card last time may receive a paper check."}
{"original": "The IRS has rushed to send the latest checks after the stimulus payments were signed into law on December 27 by President Donald Trump. In the initial round of payments authorized last year under CARES, it required weeks and sometimes months to distribute the payments to more than 160 million households."}
{"original": "The money has gone out faster this time around, with the checks deposited directly into millions of bank accounts on January 4 — a little over a week following Mr. Trump's signature. But that's come with some errors, with an estimated 13 million checks reportedly sent to closed or inactive bank accounts."}
{"original": "People whose checks were sent to closed or inactive accounts may have to wait weeks or months to receive their second stimulus checks. Financial institutions by law must return the checks sent to closed or inactive accounts, and the IRS said that recipients affected by this error may need to wait to file their 2020 taxes, when they can claim the stimulus payment as a tax rebate."}
{"original": "The IRS typically begins accepting tax returns for the prior calendar year at the end of January and starts processing them in February, which means a wait of at least several weeks until those people receive their stimulus checks via their tax refund."}
{"original": "Global oil prices surged Friday as global investors were gripped with uncertainty over the potential repercussions after the U.S. killed Iran's top general. The international benchmark for crude oil jumped more than 4% in London trading."}
{"original": "News that Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran's elite Quds Force, was killed in an air attack at the Baghdad international airport prompted expectations of Iranian retaliation against U.S. and Israeli targets. Crude oil jumped $2.70 to $68.95 a barrel."}
{"original": "In previous flare-ups in tensions with the U.S., Iran has threatened the supply of oil that travels from the Persian Gulf to the rest of the world. About 20% of oil traded worldwide goes through the Strait of Hormuz, where the shipping lane is only 3 kilometers (2 miles) wide and tankers have come under attack this year."}
{"original": "Revenge will come, maybe not overnight but it will come and until then we need to increase the geopolitical risk premium, said Olivier Jakob, head of consultancy Petromatrix, in a note to investors."}
{"original": "Substantially higher oil prices represent a tax on oil consumers and could spark concerns about economic growth, noted Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a research note. Every $5 increase in prices represents a spending increase of $183 billion per year, or about 0.1% of global GDP, he estimated."}
{"original": "If events in the Middle East drive oil prices up substantially, markets probably will become nervous about growth and will push the Fed to respond with lower interest rates, he noted."}
{"original": "Jakob noted that Iran's response may not be limited to the Strait of Hormuz."}
{"original": "In September, Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels launched drone attacks on the world's largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia. The strike briefly took out about half of the supplies from the world's largest oil exporter. The U.S. directly blamed Iran, which denied any involvement."}
{"original": "Launching attacks that can't be easily linked back to Iran limits the chances of direct retaliation."}
{"original": "But Iran has also directly targeted tankers. This year it seized a British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero, for several weeks. And it has shot down a U.S. military drone."}
{"original": "About 80% of the crude oil that goes through the Strait of Hormuz goes to countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea."}
{"original": "But the rise in the global price of oil will affect other countries more widely, particularly oil-importing countries with big manufacturing sectors like Germany and Italy. Those countries fared worst in the stock market on Friday, with their main indexes falling 1.4% and 1.1% respectively."}
{"original": "President Trump delivered his second State of the Union address Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2019, from the House chamber. The White House released the president's remarks as prepared for delivery."}
{"original": "Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:"}
{"original": "We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans."}
{"original": "Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation."}
{"original": "The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people."}
{"original": "Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first."}
{"original": "There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country."}
{"original": "This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission, and the power of American pride."}
{"original": "In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade — the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you."}
{"original": "President Trump recognized World War II veterans in the audience at the State of the Union address, Feb. 5, 2019. CBS News"}
{"original": "In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets."}
{"original": "In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach."}
{"original": "We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before."}
{"original": "But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good."}
{"original": "Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make."}
{"original": "We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction."}
{"original": "Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness."}
{"original": "Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades."}
{"original": "In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started."}
{"original": "Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history –- 157 million."}
{"original": "We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit."}
{"original": "We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms."}
{"original": "We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty — and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try."}
{"original": "My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations."}
{"original": "We have unleashed a revolution in American energy — the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy."}
{"original": "After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before."}
{"original": "On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone — almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations."}
{"original": "If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way!"}
{"original": "We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad."}
{"original": "This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate – some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country."}
{"original": "Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible."}
{"original": "In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans."}
{"original": "And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population — and far beyond."}
{"original": "Alice Johnson wipes away a tear as President Trump talks about commuting her sentence for a nonviolent drug offense during his State of the Union address, Feb. 5, 2019. CBS News"}
{"original": "Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing — and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life."}
{"original": "In June, I commuted Alice's sentence — and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny."}
{"original": "When I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing."}
{"original": "Inspired by stories like Alice's, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption."}
{"original": "We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home."}
{"original": "As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis."}
{"original": "The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border."}
{"original": "Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business."}
{"original": "As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught."}
{"original": "This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally."}
{"original": "Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country."}
{"original": "No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net."}
{"original": "Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country."}
{"original": "Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery."}
{"original": "Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl."}
{"original": "The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in."}
{"original": "Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens."}
{"original": "I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured."}
{"original": "Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison."}
{"original": "To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again."}
{"original": "Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border."}
{"original": "In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings."}
{"original": "We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job. Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year."}
{"original": "Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement — and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE."}
{"original": "My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border."}
{"original": "It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall — but the proper wall never got built. I'll get it built."}
{"original": "This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down."}
{"original": "San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings."}
{"original": "The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities."}
{"original": "Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe."}
{"original": "As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace."}
{"original": "No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before."}
{"original": "As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries."}
{"original": "To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount — reversing decades of calamitous trade policies."}
{"original": "We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end."}
{"original": "Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods — and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us — I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs."}
{"original": "Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA."}
{"original": "I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried — until now."}
{"original": "Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — or USMCA — will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA."}
{"original": "Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us."}
{"original": "Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure."}
{"original": "I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill — and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity."}
{"original": "The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs — and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions."}
{"original": "Already, as a result of my Administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years."}
{"original": "But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it."}
{"original": "I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down."}
{"original": "No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America."}
{"original": "Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer."}
{"original": "Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: Last Day of Chemo. Grace — you are an inspiration to us all."}
{"original": "Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research."}
{"original": "To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave — so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child."}
{"original": "There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth."}
{"original": "To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb."}
{"original": "Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God."}
{"original": "The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security."}
{"original": "Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military — with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO — but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies."}
{"original": "As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System."}
{"original": "Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests."}
{"original": "For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty."}
{"original": "Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't –- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far."}
{"original": "As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam."}
{"original": "Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido."}
{"original": "We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair."}
{"original": "Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country."}
{"original": "One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East."}
{"original": "Our approach is based on principled realism — not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel — and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem."}
{"original": "Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East."}
{"original": "As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars."}
{"original": "When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers."}
{"original": "Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home."}
{"original": "I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor — and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict."}
{"original": "In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement — but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace."}

Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil."}

But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall — more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: It's the Americans."}

{"original": "I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight — seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation."}

{"original": "Last year, Americans spent more than $80 billion playing state lotteries, that's around $250 for each citizen, more than what was spent on concerts, sporting events and movie tickets combined. Over 25 states took in more from their lottery proceeds than from corporate income tax. Because of these stakes, it's essential that, in both perception and reality, lotteries are truly games of chance, everyone entering with an equal opportunity to win. Which is why investigators took note when a retired couple from Michigan, Jerry and Marge Selbee, made $26 million winning various state lottery games dozens of times. This is not a story, though, of a con, or a scam, or an inside job. No, this is a ballad of a couple from small-town America who did something that most people only dream of. They didn't so much as beat the lottery odds as they figured them out."}
{"original": "For years, high school sweethearts Jerry and Marge Selbee lived a quiet life in Evart, Michigan, population 1900. A single-stoplight factory-town that collapses in the folds of a map."}
{"original": "Together they raised six kids and ran a local convenience store on Main Street. Jerry handled the liquor and cigarettes and Marge kept the books and made the sandwiches."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: How long did you have the store?"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: Why'd you decide to sell it?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: I was 62. Marge was 63. And I thought it was a nice time to sell and see what we could do after that."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: You're in your early 60s, you decide to retire."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: You're gonna put your feet up. What was the plan?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: Yeah (chuckle) that was basically it."}
{"original": "Marge Selbee: I don't think we had one per se."}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: That was basically it. We were gonna enjoy life a little bit."}
{"original": "But one morning in 2003, Jerry happened to walk back into the corner store and spotted a brochure for a brand new lottery game called Winfall. Jerry always possessed what he calls, a head for math. He has a bachelor's degree in the subject from nearby Western Michigan University. And in only a matter of minutes, he realized that this was a unique game."}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: I read it and by the time I was out here I knew what the potential might be."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: It did not take you weeks to suss this out?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: No, no, not at all. Three minutes."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: Three minutes and you found the loophole in the state lottery?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: Three minutes. I found-- I found a special feature. (laughs)"}
{"original": "That feature was called a Rolldown, and the lottery announced when it was coming. Unlike the Mega Millions games you've probably heard of where the jackpot keeps building until someone hits all six numbers and wins the big prize, in Winfall, if the jackpot reached $5 million, and no one matched all six numbers, all the money 'rolled down' to the lower-tier prize winners, dramatically boosting the payouts of those who matched five, four or three numbers."}
{"original": "Sound complicated? Well, it wasn't to Jerry. See if you can stick with him here."}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: Here's what I said. I said if I played $1,100 mathematically I'd have one 4-number winner, that's 1,000 bucks. I divided 1,100 by six instead of 57 because I did a mental quick dirty and I come up with 18. So I knew I'd have either 18 or 19 3-number winners and that's 50 bucks each. At 18 I got $1,000 for a 4-number winner, and I got 18 3-number winners worth $50 each, so that's 900 bucks. So I got $1,100 invested and I've got a $1,900 return."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: Sounds like good math"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: That's-- yeah (laugh) a little over 80 percent isn't it?"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: You're talking about this as if it's the most obvious set of figures in the world"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: This is not taxing the outer limits of your math skills."}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: No, it is actually it's just basic arithmetic."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: Are you thinking, I bet there are a million people that have also caught onto this?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: Exactly, is what I thought."}
{"original": "When a rolldown was announced, Jerry sprang into action. He bought $3,600 in Winfall tickets and won $6,300. Then he bet $8,000 and nearly doubled it."}
{"original": "The Selbees with correspondent Jon Wertheim"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: At that point, I told Marge what I was doing. (Laugh)"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: I was gonna say, you're putting thousands of dollars in action on the state lottery game, at what point do you share this with your wife?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: Right at that point"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: Jerry says, I think I've cracked the Michigan State Lottery. What do you say to that?"}
{"original": "Marge Selbee: He just, you know (chuckle) it didn't surprise me."}
{"original": "Marge Selbee: No, I wasn't surprised. Because as long as nobody wins and you win money, you could see the numbers."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: So when you realized there aren't a million people that have discovered this, it's pretty much just you, what's that feeling like?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: I just couldn't, I just couldn't fathom it."}
{"original": "Soon Jerry and Marge Selbee started playing for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Jerry set up a corporation, G.S. Investment Strategies. He showed us stacks of record books that detailed their winnings."}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: Here's one that was pretty successful. We played $515,000 and we got back $853,000"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: It's about a 60 percent return?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: That was a good return. (Laugh)"}
{"original": "They invited family and friends to share in their, well, windfall, selling shares in the corporation for $500 apiece. You might say this was a different kind of hedge fund. We met some of the local investors at the evart hangout spot, Sugar Rae's Café."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: All four of you guys are members of an exclusive club."}
{"original": "James White is a local attorney, Dave Huff operated a machine and tool shop and brothers Loren and Ray Gerber are retired farmers."}
{"original": "James White: And when you looked at the mathematics of it, it made sense."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: You guys followed the math when he broke it down?"}
{"original": "Loren Gerber: Yeah, yeah, but he's really good at math"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: So he explained this?"}
{"original": "Loren Gerber: You ask him questions…"}
{"original": "James White: Yeah, he's a math whiz"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: Do you guys remember how much you gave him to invest?"}
{"original": "Loren Gerber: I had about $8,000 and then I put another six in for the grandkids."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: But overall you guys came out way ahead on this?"}
{"original": "Loren Gerber: It was a good game."}
{"original": "Dave Huff: It helped me put three kids through school and one through law school. So it was quite beneficial to me."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: Used it for education?"}
{"original": "James White: There's a lot of people around town that knew what it was about and talk about it and that it occurred."}
{"original": "Dave Huff: But a lot of people were really leery."}
{"original": "Dave Huff: They were thinking, You guys are nuts."}
{"original": "By the spring of 2005, Jerry's club stood at 25 members. Those willing to press their luck included three state troopers, a factory plant manager, and a bank vice president. They had played Winfall 12 times, winning millions. When Michigan suddenly shut down the game, citing, ironically, lack of sales."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: Michigan game gets closed down. How long before you realize there was a game in Massachusetts that also presented some favorable odds?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: One of our players emailed me and he said Massachusetts has a game called Cash Winfall. Do you think we could play that?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: And so I got on the computer. I looked at the game and once I researched it, I got back with him and I said, we can play that game."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: We got another winner. How long did it take you this time to figure out that you could get a positive return here?"}
{"original": "That's when Jerry and Marge Selbee developed a routine they continued for the next six years, driving 900 miles to Massachusetts every time there was a rolldown and buying hundreds of thousands of tickets at two local convenience stores. Then they holed up, not in some fancy suite at the high rollers hotel, but in a room at the Red Roof Inn, sorting the tickets by hand for 10 hours a day, 10 days straight, not so much playing the lottery, as working it."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: So once there was a rolldown, on average, how much were you putting in play?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: Over $600,000 per play. Seven plays a year."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: $4.2 million once this rolldown was coming?"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: Did you ever get nervous?"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: What'd you do with all the losing tickets?"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: You saved all the losing tickets?"}
{"original": "Marge Selbee: Saved them in big totes."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: There must have been millions."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: $18 million worth of losing tickets. And you have those?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: Uh-huh just in case we had a physical federal audit."}
{"original": "Marge Selbee: We had the upstairs of the barn. I stored them in one end and in the other end. And then I thought, Oh no, this floor is gonna fall through. So then we stored them down in the pole barn. And we had probably 60, 65 tubs of tickets."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: Did you guys ever say, We're supposed to be retired here. We're making 14-hour drives to Massachusetts."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: It's fun for you guys?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: It's fun doing it."}
{"original": "Marge Selbee: You get a high on it"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: And it gave you the satisfaction of being successful at something that was worthwhile to not only us personally but to our friends and our family."}
{"original": "Scott Allen of the Boston Globe"}
{"original": "But in 2011, the Boston Globe got a tip and discovered that in certain Massachussetts locations, Cash Winfall tickets were being sold at an extraordinary volume."}
{"original": "Scott Allen: Smart people had figured out if I buy enough of these tickets, I'll always be a winner. I'll get back more than I spent."}
{"original": "Scott allen oversees the Globe's investigative reporters, known as the Spotlight team. The paper's reporting revealed that two groups were dominating Cash Winfall: the Selbee gang from Evart, Michigan, and their competition, a syndicate led by math majors from MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These were kids young enough to be the Selbees' grandchildren."}
{"original": "Scott Allen: The guy who started it, he was doing an independent study project as an undergraduate at MIT and he figured out that he could win this game. So he got a bunch of his friends to pool in their money so they became, as time went on, professional Cash Winfall players, recruiting their friends and raising money from backers until they too were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars."}
{"original": "Incredibly, the MIT group bet between $17 and $18 million on Cash Winfall over a seven-year period, earning at least $3.5 million in profits. Almost the exact same rate of return as the Selbees."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: You've got a syndicate from Northwest Michigan, you've got a group of MIT students. Did your story meter start beeping?"}
{"original": "Scott Allen: It was-- oh it's a great story."}
{"original": "The Boston Globe articles caused a sensation, raising suspicion that the game was rigged."}
{"original": "The Massachusetts state treasurer shut down the Cash Winfall game and called for an investigation. It was led by then-state inspector general, Greg Sullivan."}
{"original": "Greg Sullivan: When we got involved, the public perception was there must be some kind of organized crime or public corruption to explain how millions of dollars are being bet by syndicates on state lottery tickets. We really looked at this, looking for corruption. We used subpoenas, we looked at documents, we interviewed dozens of people to look at this in detail with a hypothesis that something illegal had happened."}
{"original": "Greg Sullivan, the Massachusetts state inspector general who investigated the Cash Winfall game"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: You went into this looking for organized crime. As the story unfolded, were you surprised by what you found?"}
{"original": "Greg Sullivan: I wasn't surprised. I was dumbfoundely amazed that these math-nerd geniuses had found a way legally to win a state lottery and make millions from it"}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: And the state's getting rich in the process."}
{"original": "Greg Sullivan: And the state got very rich. The state made $120 million."}
{"original": "The investigation found no one's odds of winning was affected by high-volume betting. When the jackpot hit the rolldown threshold, Cash Winfall became a good bet for everyone, not just the big time bettors like the Selbees. By then though, Massachusetts State Lottery had moved on to a different game without a statistical twist."}
{"original": "And with that, Jerry and Marge Selbee's excellent adventure drew to an end."}
{"original": "In total, their unlikely homegrown company grossed more than $26 million from nine years of playing the lottery."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: Your corporation, $26 million. You smile when you recounted that figure."}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: Uh-huh. That was satisfactory."}
{"original": "They made nearly $8 million in profit before taxes. Back in Evart, not exactly the land of extravagance, the Selbees put their winnings to practical use, renovating their home and helping their six kids, 14 grandkids and 10 great-grandchildren pay for their education. They still get together with members of their lottery group. But millions of dollars in Winfall tickets have been replaced by nickel and dime poker night, and Marge makes everyone chicken pot pie."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: I'm struck by how measured you are, telling this story. Do you find anything remarkable about this?"}
{"original": "Jerry Selbee: The only thing I found really remarkable is nobody else really seemed to grasp it."}
{"original": "Jon Wertheim: What I'm hearing you say is that this part of the country is really good at keeping a secret"}

{"original": "He came across as a man of the cloth, said Tom Sarkes, a parishioner, to WFSB. You could picture him in the holy land coming out."}
{"original": "Police said they began looking into Kombo last April after they received a complaint from people at St. Augustine Church in Connecticut."}
{"original": "On May 6, 2013, police said Kombo received a large sum of money in the form of a check made payable to the St. Augustine Church. Police said Kombo opened an account at a local bank and deposited the proceeds from this monetary annuity into this account."}
{"original": "Kombo was removed back in November for allegedly embezzling $20,000, officials with the Hartford Diocese said. The money was left to the church by a parishioner who passed away, WFSB reported."}
{"original": "After initially denying the allegations, police said Kombo admitted that he took about $27,000 and used it for projects in his home country of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, specifically a plan to provide loans to the African county."}
{"original": "Father Kombo stated he felt huge pressure as the 'Microfinance company had to maintain a certain financial threshold in order to get outside funding.' Father Kombo stated that this lead him to 'get into this unauthorized borrowing of money' from the church, court documents said."}

{"original": "On Oct. 18, 2013, police said Kombo had opened a line of credit account at a local bank in the name of St. Augustine's Church utilizing the church's tax identification information. Police said that Kombo deposited majority of these funds into his personal bank account."}

{"original": "Consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in January, compared with the expectation from economists for a 0.3 percent increase, according to Bloomberg News. That was the biggest climb in a year and is likely to fan inflation fears in financial markets. Over the past year, consumer prices rose 2.1 percent, higher than a forecast for a 1.9 percent increase."}
{"original": "The specter of high inflation has spooked many investors, who worry it would force up interest rates, making it costlier for consumers and businesses to borrow and weighing down corporate profits and ultimately the economy. Historically, fear of high inflation has led the Federal Reserve to step up its short-term interest rate increases."}
{"original": "It's a big reason investors have dumped stocks and bonds in the past two weeks."}
{"original": "With unemployment so low, growth going to get big boost from tax cuts and the newly announced spending increases, the stars are aligned for inflation to pick up more from here, said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, in an email. So this could set off another round of selling as some investors fret about what it means for US interest rates."}

{"original": "Separately, retail data released today pointed to weaker-than-expected sales, with U.S. retail and food sales slipping 0.3 percent in January. A decline in auto and building materials sales was particularly sharp last month, which could be related to unusually cold weather, TD Securities said."}
{"original": "The one-two punch of a bigger-than-expected rise in the January total and core CPI of 0.5 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively, along with the weaker than expected January retail sales report knocked the stock market down from a big rise in pre-opening prices to an even decline as of now, wrote Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC."}

{"original": "If the world's largest economy accumulates its most significant debt ever, does it matter? Economists are divided. Many say because of the dollar's role in the global finance system, the U.S. can essentially borrow as much as it wants at very low rates. But others say today's debt could threaten the economy during future downturns -- and the current expansion is the perfect time to get it under control."}
{"original": "Here are the many ways that the national debt could become problematic, according to that view."}
{"original": "The U.S. pays interest on its debt, and those payments increase as the debt grows -- even if interest rates themselves stay steady. In the next few years, interest rate payments are projected to rise rapidly, reaching levels they haven't seen since the early 1990s."}

{"original": "Consider a married couple that earns two six-figure salaries and routinely carries a credit card balance of $90,000. Households like this routinely face the ire of financial planners because they have no cushion for bad economic times. If one lost a job, for instance, the couple would be forced to borrow money at higher rates, sell their valuables or curtail their spending in entirely unpleasant ways, assuming they don't have wealthy family members to ask for money."}
{"original": "Like this profligate household, the U.S. is limiting its own options for the next economic downturn, in the eyes of many economists. With a large portion of the federal budget earmarked for interest payments, that leaves less room for other spending."}
{"original": "Interest payments may not be debilitating, economists say -- but the U.S. won't get anything for that money."}
{"original": "Whereas spending on infrastructure, for example, puts money into circulation that moves among businesses and fuels hiring and trade (or just puts money into some contractor's pocket), spending on interest does no such thing. It's simply covering the costs of decisions that were made a long time ago."}
{"original": "The rise in the debt will impose burdens on future generations, said Gale. The millennials are catching on to that, and objecting."}
{"original": "Not everyone agrees with that analysis. The only reason interest payments appear high is because U.S. social spending is stingy compared to that of many developed countries, said Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. You can't make it big just by comparing it to things that are small, he said."}
{"original": "The more money the government borrows, the more pressure it puts on private borrowing, economic theory goes. Borrowing more increases the demand for loans, so the government is competing against business and students and everyone in the market for loans, said Gale. If the government wants to borrow more, that jacks up interest rates on everyone else and crowds out what other people might do."}
{"original": "We can't grow our way out of it"}
{"original": "Since debt is most commonly measured relative to GDP, some pundits point out another way to make the debt smaller: get the economy to grow faster. That was the theory behind the 2017 tax cuts, which boosted economic growth but fell far short of paying for themselves. And as those cuts show, such an outcome is harder to plan for -- because the U.S. economy depends just as much on global growth as on domestic policy."}
{"original": "The good news is, if we can grow our way out of the debt, we would be able to do that even while reducing it in other ways, said Gale."}
{"original": "We don't need to kill the government or starve it, We don't need to get rid of Social Security, he added. There's a range of options on the tax or spending side that are conventional."}
{"original": "Recreational marijuana use became legal in just one more state, Illinois, with the start of the New Year on Wednesday. More states could follow suit in 2020, with several states set to put recreational marijuana on the ballot. Cannabis is still considered an illegal substance at the federal level."}
{"original": "According to an end of the year CBS News Poll, support for legal pot hit a new high in 2019, with 65% of U.S. adults saying marijuana should be legal. And, for the first time in CBS News polling, a majority of Republicans (56%) favored legal marijuana. While people ages 65 and over continued to be the least likely age group to support marijuana legalization, slightly more of them favored it (49%) than opposed it (45%) in the 2019 poll."}
{"original": "The trend has been reflected in state legislatures, albeit piecemeal. Thirty three states have legalized pot in some form, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2012 — when Colorado and Washington became the first two states to legalize recreational use — 11 states in total have legalized recreational marijuana."}
{"original": "Marijuana is currently legal for recreational use in: Alaska, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia. On January, 1, 2020, Illinois became the 11th state to legalize recreational marijuana."}
{"original": "Democratic Governor JB Pritzker granted more than 11,000 pardons for low-level marijuana convictions on Tuesday, ahead of the state's official legalization — which the Legislature passed in June — effective on Wednesday. State officials estimate that 116,000 convictions involving 30 grams or less of marijuana, including for possession of the drug, are eligible for pardons under the new law."}
{"original": "Illinois is now the second state in the Midwest, following Michigan in 2018, to legalize recreational marijuana sales and use."}
{"original": "Several states are expected to vote on recreational marijuana use measures in 2020, while others are preparing similar legislation."}
{"original": "Make It Legal Florida, a political committee, is behind a proposal to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. Chairman Nick Hansen told CBS Miami in early December that, according to their polling, over 65 percent of Florida voters want to have expanded access to cannabis for 21 and over."}
{"original": "However, that milestone appears to have hit a snag. The Miami Herald reports that Make it Legal filed a lawsuit against the state on Tuesday, alleging that a new election law placed restrictions on the ballot initiative process that hampered their ability to collect signatures."}
{"original": "As of Tuesday, the state had verified 219,290 signed petitions from Make It Legal — just 28% of the total signatures needed by the February 1 deadline."}
{"original": "Democrats in the state are preparing marijuana legislation, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. House Majority leader Ryan Winkler (D) has been touring the state on the issue in an effort to ready a bill for the state's session in February."}
{"original": "The Republican-controlled Senate, however, poses steep odds, as key conservative leaders remain opposed to legalization."}
{"original": "Last year proved lackluster for recreational marijuana legislation efforts in the Empire State."}
{"original": "A measure to legalize cannabis for adults went up in smoke, despite support from Governor Andrew Cuomo. Legislators did downgrade possession from a misdemeanor to a fine, but people with more than two ounces of the drug on them can still be arrested, according to the New York Police Department."}
{"original": "Cuomo has continued to push the issue, hiring Norman Birenbaum, a major force in pro-legalization efforts, to lead the state's cannabis program."}
{"original": "The state will vote on legalization of recreational marijuana in November, 2020, The Associated Press reports. If the measure passes, New Jersey residents 21 and older will be allowed to use pot recreationally. All sales of cannabis products would be subject to a 6.625% sales tax."}
{"original": "Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring has called for the immediate decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana, and hosted a Cannabis Summit in December to educate state leaders on what steps need to be taken to accomplish that goal."}
{"original": "The system is broken. It's unjust. It's not working and the way to fix it, first of all, is to move and decriminalize possession of small amounts and address those past convictions. But for me, I think we should move to legalize and regulate adult use, Herring said, CBS affiliate WTVR reports."}
{"original": "He may have the support he needs, as the Commonwealth of Virginia's House and Senate are now controlled by Democrats, who tend to favor marijuana reform."}
{"original": "One piece of marijuana legislation that has been filed for the state's 2020 session, SB 2, would decriminalize marijuana possession, and would raise the amount needed to be charged with distribution to one ounce versus half-an-ounce, WTVR reports. The bill would also allow people to petition to expunge their convictions."}
{"original": "California is still fine-tuning its cannabis regulation"}
{"original": "On January 1, 2020, two new laws went into effect in California that clarify tax laws related to the state's legal cannabis industry — which competes with it's long-established illegal cannabis industry."}
{"original": "Senate Bill 34 allows licensed cannabis retailers to donate cannabis to low-income patients, and exempts those products from state taxes, CBS affiliate KFMB reports. Assembly Bill 37, allows cannabis businesses to claim deductions and credits available to other legal businesses in the state."}
{"original": "Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signed those bills into law, but begrudgingly vetoed another cannabis bill that would have required some health care facilities to allow terminally ill patients to use medical cannabis. In a message explaining his decision, Newsom wrote that the requirement would put patients on Medicaid and Medicare at risk of losing coverage."}
{"original": "Is federal legalization likely in 2020?"}
{"original": "Since cannabis is still considered an illegal substance at the federal level, most banks are prevented from doing business with marijuana companies. To face this hurdle, lawmakers introduced the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act, which would protect banks who partner with cannabis businesses, CBS Miami reports."}
{"original": "The Act passed the Democratic-led House, but is expected to fail in the Senate, after Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) expressed his strong opposition in December."}
{"original": "Significant concerns remain that the SAFE Banking Act does not address the high level potency of marijuana, marketing tactics to children, lack of research on marijuana's effects, and the need to prevent bad actors and cartels from using the banks to disguise ill-gotten cash to launder money into the financial system, Crapo said in a press release outlining his concerns."}
{"original": "The same fate is likely for federal cannabis legalization."}
{"original": "In November, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2019, or MORE Act, now heads to the full House, where its chances are better in the Democratic-controlled chamber than in the Republican-held Senate, where the bill's future is uncertain."}
{"original": "In this episode of Facing Forward, Margaret Brennan talks with David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world that makes one of the few FDA-approved antibody drugs for COVID-19. In their conversation, Ricks talks about what the drug giant is doing to keep up with the evolving pandemic."}
{"original": "On competition in the antibody treatment marketplace: We all want the same thing, we want to erase COVID and given the constraint on supply for monoclonal antibodies, I'm glad they're working on this. And it shows the benefit of companies taking different approaches. So we could use Regeneron against that strain in ours against other strains...I think this all just highlights that, that the virus is moving. It's a changing picture. Its pace of change will be exactly consistent with how many people are infected. So the first priority is vaccination to reduce the number of people infected because the more people infected, the more changes that will occur naturally. And then we need science to keep track of carefully these emerging strains that require surveillance and doing genomic testing, which is not well done right now in the US."}
{"original": "On the US' preparedness for new strains of COVID-19: I think we're not fully prepared. We were lucky that the UK strain occurred in the UK first and they have a much better surveillance system than we do. They made a decision early to sample 7% of all cases, and that's well set up. There's, you know, the U.K. response isn't perfect to this virus. They've had a lot of death and outbreak too. But that piece they had right and that strain appeared there. And so in some sense, we got lucky, and we're- we have medicines on the shelf that we tested early, like our monoclonal antibodies. We know the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer already work against that strain. What we have to do is get these tools in the hands of doctors and get them in patients arms. That- that's fortunate because if something like the Manaus, Brazil strain was that one, we probably wouldn't have detected it and we wouldn't- we know we don't have the proper tools yet. So I think we need to not count on luck."}

{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'M MARGARET BRENNAN AND WELCOME TO FACING FORWARD. THIS WEEK, PRESSURE IS RAMPING UP TO VACCINATE AMERICA AS THE CDC DIRECTOR WARNS… MORE CONTAGIOUS COVID-19 STRAINS ARE FOUND IN THE U-S."}
{"original": "CDC DIRECTOR RACHEL WALENSKY: The variants that have been identified recently seem to spread more easily, they're more transmissible."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: NEW CONCERNS ARE MOUNTING OVER WHETHER THESE VARIANTS COULD EVADE ANTIBODY TREATMENTS, ONCE SEEN AS A BRIGHT SPOT IN FIGHTING THE DISEASE."}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: A little bit more concerning with -- the mutant that is now prevalent in South Africa, particularly its negative impact on some of the monoclonal antibodies that have been given for treatment"}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: THESE TREATMENTS WERE USED TO HELP FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE WHEN THEY WERE DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19. THESE LAB-MADE ANTIBODIES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN PATIENTS WHO RECOVERED FROM COVID-19, AND GIVE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM A BOOST TO FIGHT OFF THE VIRUS."}
{"original": "ELI LILLY - ONE OF THE LARGEST PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES IN THE WORLD MAKES ONE OF THE FEW F-D-A APPROVED ANTIBODY DRUGS. AHEAD - WE'LL SPEAK WITH THE COMPANY'S C-E-O, DAVID RICKS -- ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO KEEP UP WITH THE EVOLVING VIRUS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks joins us now. Welcome to the program."}
{"original": "CHAIRMAN & CEO OF ELI LILLY DAVID RICKS: Great to be with you today."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's so good to have you on the podcast. We spoke on FACE THE NATION a few weeks ago, and I know a lot has been happening. Your treatment helped to reduce the chance of hospitalization from COVID-19 by 70%, but you have to give it within the early stages of the disease. As I understand it, if you are already hospitalized it's basically too late for the monoclonal antibodies to work. Is that right?"}
{"original": "RICKS: That- basically right, MARGARET. Yeah, we have now two settings where we have data and- and the emergency use authorization that's approved already is for the first 10 days after a positive test. Now it's- some of the patients in that study might have been hospitalized within the first 10 days. So it's not exactly right that hospitalized patients couldn't get it. But first 10 days after the test and we- we've worked with the FDA to define a high risk group. Those that are over 65 or have other preexisting conditions are really the target patients for- for the medicine."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've heard a lot of concern in recent days about these mutant strains for lack of a better term of COVID, specifically the B1351 strain out of South Africa. It may evade vaccines and even these monoclonal therapies. I want to play a sound bite for you of what Dr. Fauci told reporters on Wednesday."}
{"original": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Now I want to make one mention about the monoclonal antibodies because they are more seriously inhibited in the sense of impacting on their efficacy by this South African strain. That's the reason why there will be attempts to develop even other antibodies that might be able to avert this particular problem."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So can you translate that? Does your treatment work against B1351 from South Africa?"}
{"original": "RICKS: Yes, well we don't know the answer definitively. But what Dr. Fauci's saying there is consistent with data I've seen from independent labs, and our own laboratories where we do experiments in test tubes basically to assess the question is- is the response diminished with the mutations in the South African variant. Just to step back, there's three emerging variants we're all talking about, the- the Kent, U.K. one, South Africa, and now this one out of Brazil. To be clear, though, the Kent, U.K. one both our monotherapy and the new data on combination therapy we suspect fully neutralize this no differently from the other types. And that's actually the wave we- we worry about right now, hitting the US because it's been so successful in Europe. That strain it's coming here."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to clarify, Kent U.K., that's B117, right?"}
{"original": "RICKS: Yeah. B117, which is now the predominant strain in the U.K. and across Europe and is present in at least 25 states in the US, growing rapidly because it's about 50% more contagious. But that strain we- we have strong data to suggest we will be equally effective against. The Southern Hemisphere ones you're speaking about, Brazil and South Africa, have more changes in them. And based on our early experiments, I would agree with what Dr. Fauci says. These monoclonal antibodies are likely going to have reduced activity against those two strains. But it is also possible, as he said, to create new medicines, new monoclonal antibodies that will neutralize it. And in fact, there's one on the shelf already from a comp- another company called Vir, where we announced this week we're starting an experiment with them so that a combination of family bamlanivimab- our monotherapy, plus the Vir antibody will be tested and that could be effective against South Africa and the Brazil variant."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So if you collaborate with those companies to- to get those treatments combined, how long will it be before we know the results of the study that's underway?"}
{"original": "RICKS: This study we're doing now will be a few months. The benefit of using an off the shelf one that's already been through other phases of testing, is we- we probably could supply it and ramp it up more quickly. In addition, MARGARET, we've said this week we also have our own novel, a new model monoclonal antibody that we think on paper should neutralize both South Africa and Brazil. And so that will take more like six to nine months."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So your competitor Regeneron said this week that it's cocktail of antibodies does work, they think, against the B1351. What's the difference between what they're creating and what you are talking about?"}
{"original": "RICKS: Right, I know they said that. I wouldn't call them a competitor, we all want the same thing, we want to erase COVID and given the constraint on supply for monoclonal antibodies, I'm glad they're working on this. And it shows the benefit of companies taking different approaches. What I have seen from the published experiments and there was an experiment published this week, it is true they maintain more potency, but there was some reduction in potency with their combination against the South African strain, the B135 that you mentioned. I think this all just highlights that, that the virus is moving. It's a changing picture. So the first priority is vaccination to reduce the number of people infected because the more people infected, the more changes that will occur naturally. And then we need science to keep track of carefully these emerging strains that require surveillance and doing genomic testing, which is not well done right now in the US. And- and then we'll need help from some regulatory authorities like the FDA to allow us to do basically what we do with the flu shot every year. Where companies can change parts of that shot to keep up with the change in the virus without doing long term large scale studies, because we're pretty confident that the science translates and with the safety, the approach. I think we're getting close to that with monoclonal antibodies and we'll need regulators to help us with a pathway there."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we spoke on FACING FORWARD last week with the CEO of Illumina, which is one of those companies that does the surveillance and the- the sequencing that you're talking about. And- and he was pretty stark. I mean, he said what- we're- we're only sequencing 0.3%. We need to be at 5% of cases to actually kind of even know what's happening within US borders with- with this virus. So, I mean, from where you sit is enough attention being paid right now to this, is enough funding being thrown at this? Because the CDC says it's aware, but those numbers aren't really moving up that quickly."}
{"original": "RICKS: I agree with- with his comments. But just to step back, first of all, this cannot just be a US thing. We've seen this virus moves and jumps continents much faster than we can control borders. So the idea that we can shut down all the borders and contain it, unless we want to live in a society where we really have a lot less freedom, it's just not a reality with this- this virus and probably other respiratory viruses. So we really need a network across the developed economies where people are mostly traveling to and from to- to catch this. The second thing I'd say is- --is the public health infrastructure in our country is in a- in a poor state. And I think that was fully exhibited during the early stage of the pandemic and the poor testing capacity. It wasn't until the private sector and other labs spun up. We need more base infrastructure in public health in the country. And that would include this kind of surveillance that you're talking about."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to- just to sort of bottom line this for people listening, at this point, is America prepared for these mutant strains, because it kind of sounds like you're saying we're not, but we're trying to catch up."}
{"original": "RICKS: I think you have it right. I think we're not fully prepared. We were lucky that the UK strain occurred in the UK first and they have a much better surveillance system than we do. They made a decision early to sample 7% of all cases, and that's well set up. There's, you know, the U.K. response isn't perfect to this virus. They've had a lot of death and outbreak too. But that piece they had right and that strain appeared there. And so in some sense, we got lucky, and we're- we have medicines on the shelf that we tested early, like our monoclonal antibodies. We know the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer already work against that strain. What we have to do is get these tools in the hands of doctors and get them in patients' arms. That- that's fortunate because if something like the Manaus, Brazil strain was that one, we probably wouldn't have detected it and we wouldn't- we know we don't have the proper tools yet. So I think we need to not count on luck."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Don't go anywhere. The conversation continues with Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks. And ahead, we'll discuss the challenges with administering the antibody treatment."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So your company announced this week it has evidence that the monoclonal antibodies can be administered to those in nursing homes who've been exposed to the virus but haven't yet tested positive. So does that mean it can be used as a prophylactic to prevent COVID-19?"}
{"original": "RICKS: We believe the study we announced this week in nursing homes does prove it can be used as a prophylactic very effectively to prevent outbreaks in nursing homes. We built mobile pharmacies that drove around looking for outbreaks, and then we set up in these homes and administered prophylactically our drug or placebo and then measured whether the disease spread in nursing homes. We need to protect our seniors, and we could give monoclonal antibodies. In this case, when one patient was infected, we would then give it to every other resident in the- in the nursing home. And we not only proved we reduce their risk of getting covered by 80%, the- the disease was less severe and actually there was an imbalance in death so that four patients who received placebo actually died in the study versus zero who got the drug. So we're saving lives as well. Those numbers are small, but you know it's indicative of the benefit in this setting."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when we spoke last time on FACE THE NATION, you described that your drug needs to be administered by infusion through an IV. Is- is that still a bottleneck to getting wide use of the therapies? Should people who are infected or exposed to COVID have an alternative site to go if they want to receive your treatment?"}
{"original": "RICKS: It remains a challenge. When we spoke, I think we were seeing that of the shipments we made to hospitals of the therapy, about 20% of it was being used in the week it was sent. That number has doubled since we spoke. So that's a pretty good improvement. But 40% isn't 100%, so there's still a long way to go. The good news is we have many areas of the country that are demonstrating great practices. And interestingly, MARGARET, these aren't the places where, you know, of, you know, famous hospitals and leading world experts. They're communities that- community hospitals that just organized to do it. In Northern Alabama, the hospital system there has set aside space in every single hospital. They staffed with nurses and they're one of the busiest hospitals in the country in terms of using the monoclonal antibodies to prevent infection. El Paso converted their convention center to an infusion center and- and the city funded it. It's making a big difference there."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what would your advice be to the federal government, right? We have a new administration. We have the Biden administration and they say they're trying to help iron out some of these kinks in the system. What- what's the lesson learned from what's worked in some of these localities?"}
{"original": "RICKS: I think three things. The first is- is to make the bet on the therapy. Right. It's- this wasn't easy, but of course, there's a sense of desperation. We had Phase 2 data and submitted it for emergency use. And experts, including at the NIH as well as in infectious disease societies, said, oh, it's interesting data, but we're not yet ready to fully endorse. We hope the data we released this week, which was the nursing home study, plus a very large Phase 3 study for treatment that showed a ten to zero death benefit, along with 70% reduction in probability of hospitalization, will move them. And I think we need, you know, doctors pay attention to those endorsements. That's important. The second thing is, as we were just talking about, you need people to rearrange resources. And I think we've learned through this pandemic in the US, we have a lot of capacity and expertise in our healthcare system. We're not good at moving it around. We- we're not flexible. And the final thing is the federal government is talking about coming on top of the local vaccination effort with some impressive national efforts. For instance, setting up vaccine centers at NFL stadiums and tents with National Guardsmen who can vaccinate people. We need a similar kind of thing for therapy as well, in particular in the states that are experiencing really tough outbreaks."}
{"original": "Maybe we don't need it all the time, but when there's- the hospital system's overflowing, we need federal help to come in with extra resources."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, we're going to take a quick break, so stay with us. You're listening to FACING FORWARD."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Eli Lilly reports earnings Friday, which is the day that this podcast airs. Just to note for our listeners that we're speaking before that financial release. Just big picture here, President Biden campaigned on this pledge to raise the corporate tax rate. It's currently at 21%. You've got offices all around the world. How would your company be impacted if the tax rate is raised again?"}
{"original": "RICKS: Yeah, it's a good question. We hope it's not. You know, I think we lobbied and we're very supportive of the reduction because previously the US was at 35%. This has a direct effect on where we place investments. What had happened in the pharmaceutical industry is almost all of the manufacturing sites that were built in the last 20 years when the tax rate was high were overseas. And there's been a lot of reporting on other parts of the medical supply chain that broke down in the pandemic. The same is true. So raising the corporate tax rate in- in our industry would be the exact opposite of the policy goal of repatriating manufacturing as well. Since that tax rate changed, I'll share with you, we have announced and broken ground on a very large new facility in North Carolina. We've expanded Indianapolis and New Jersey, and I think we'd have to reevaluate that if the tax rate went up. Now, it could go up a few points. Does that really change things? Not so much. But to think about going above Europe or above major developed nations would be, I think, a grave mistake."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the US is the only industrialized country without a national paid leave mandate. The Treasury secretary recently said that plus the lack of childcare support is hurting the economy right now in the middle of this pandemic, particularly when it comes to unemployment among women. Do you think there should be a mandate?"}
{"original": "RICKS: Well, maybe our actions speak better than- than anything. Lilly has expanded our maternity and paternity benefits, so the paternity benefit is four weeks. Maternity benefit now goes a full six months paid. Not only do we think that's good for retention of top talent, but as a healthcare company, good for the baby. And I'll share- just, MARGARET, a personal story. You know, my wife's a pediatrician and we had one of our children while on an overseas post in a country that had one year paid maternity leave. And we saw the difference from our first child where we- my wife is at home three weeks and then had to go back to work versus a full year. Huge difference. So I think it's also just a compassionate thing to do. So whether we need a mandate, I just hope companies do it. And of course, small employers struggle more. And maybe that's where the federal intervention would help. But we're certainly for expanding maternity leave."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: And when you take a step back and you look at the Operation Warp Speed project that the Trump administration put in place, you know, they trumpeted reducing some of the regulatory barriers, subsidizing private companies to help create vaccines. Is there architecture that they put in place that you would encourage the Biden team to keep?"}
{"original": "RICKS: Yes. You know, plenty of things went wrong in many countries and including in this one in the early pandemic response, but one thing that went well, from my perspective, is the Operation Warp Speed effort. Which really was kind of an above agency effort to rebalance the normal balance of risk and benefit for the interaction between agencies and- and companies and really make sure that we could get therapies and then vaccines to the public as quickly as possible, given the situation. And it was successful, I think much more successful than any other country I can think of. But- but the streamlining and debottlenecking of the regulatory process, which can be slow and cumbersome. But, what- as it relates to medicines and vaccines we're seeing now is sporadic and not so good execution of getting these medicines to people. And that part needs improvement. And I would really encourage the Biden administration to focus there."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks for your time today. I appreciate you sharing your insights."}
{"original": "RICKS: Of course, great to be with you."}

{"original": "2010: Mr. Obama called on Congress to pass an energy bill in which the government would cap how much carbon dioxide companies could emit. The effort died in the Senate after Republicans successfully cast the proposal as a cap-and-tax that would cost jobs."}
{"original": "2011: Mr. Obama called on Congress to get rid of tax loopholes benefiting individual companies and industries so that the additional revenue generated could be used to offset a lower corporate tax rate without adding to the deficit. But one company's loophole is another's necessity. The result so far is no reduction in the corporate tax rate."}

{"original": "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The conservative protege of a powerful former president and a leftist former guerrilla who has galvanized voters with an anti-establishment message are headed for what promises to be a polarizing presidential runoff after gaining the most votes in Sunday's election. With almost all quick-count results in, former senator Ivan Duque was leading with 39 percent of the ballots cast, short of the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a June runoff."}
{"original": "One-time rebel and ex-Bogota mayor Gustavo Petro trailed in second place with 25 percent, edging out former Medellin Mayor Sergio Fajardo, who garnered nearly 24 percent."}
{"original": "Duque and Petro represent opposite ends of Colombia's political spectrum and have presented dramatically different visions for the future of the Andean nation as it moves forward with a historic peace process with leftist rebels."}
{"original": "Duque is the handpicked candidate of Alvaro Uribe, the ex-president and chief critic of the nation's 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. He is promising to amend important aspects of the accord like ensuring that drug trafficking is not an amnestied crime and blocking guerrilla leaders from political office."}
{"original": "Colombian presidential candidate Gustavo Petro speaks to supporters and the news media after polls closed in the first round of the presidential election in Bogota, Colombia May 27, 2018. Henry Romero / REUTERS"}
{"original": "Petro supports the accord and has galvanized youth voters angered by deeply entrenched corruption and income inequality. He is vowing to end Colombia's dependence on oil exports and raise taxes on vast swaths of unproductive land in hopes of boosting agricultural production. Critics have warned his rise could push Colombia dangerously toward the left and rattle markets."}
{"original": "The result was a sharp blow to traditional politics, said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue. With a Duque/Petro runoff, Colombians will face a starker choice than in many years."}
{"original": "The election has sparked fears on both the left and right, with Duque's critics cautioning that his presidency would be tantamount to a constitutionally barred third term for Uribe. Though hugely popular among Colombians for improving security and weakening illegal armed groups, Uribe also presided over grave human rights violations by the military."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Petro and his populist Humane Colombia platform have drawn comparisons from critics to the late Venezuelan socialist leader Hugo Chavez, who Petro once admired. He brought Chavez to Colombia in 1994 shortly after the Venezuelan paratrooper was released from jail, where he was sent for staging a military coup."}
{"original": "I'm worried ... Populism is strengthening, Nicolas Goyeneche, 28-year-old student, told Reuters news agency.But in the second round, we'll beat populism."}
{"original": "Petro describes himself as a strong adversary of the neighboring country's current president, Nicolas Maduro, but his early ties to Chavez have dogged him throughout the campaign. His campaign likened the comparisons to fear-mongering tactics by a traditional political class no longer able to court votes based on their hardline stance against leftist rebels."}
{"original": "In a speech before hundreds of supporters Sunday night, Petro said fears that he would turn Colombia into an authoritarian state where wealth is redistributed are unfounded. He said his proposals instead amount to a democratization of opportunities so that more Colombians can benefit from education and join the middle class."}
{"original": "The nearly 5 million votes we received today are the votes of the youth, of excluded sectors far and wide across Colombia who have decided to burst in and say, 'We are present,' he said."}
{"original": "Supporters waved flags emblazoned with the Soviet Union's hammer and sickle and the logo of the disbanded M-19 rebel group that Petro belonged to in his youth."}
{"original": "Edilia Pinzon, 55, was among those cheering on Petro."}
{"original": "We are making history, said Pinzon, a street merchant. The others who have reached power haven't fulfilled their promises, especially to those of us with few means."}
{"original": "More than 19 million voters cast ballots in the election, the highest turnout in two decades."}
{"original": "The results were especially harsh for Fajardo, who fell less than 2 points behind Petro and failed to advance to the next round. During weeks of negotiations he tried unsuccessfully to form an alliance with like-minded centrist Humberto de la Calle, whose 2 percent vote haul would've been enough to push Fajardo past Petro."}
{"original": "Fajardo conceded defeat but showed no sign of who he'll support in a runoff where his 4.5 million supporters are likely to be decisive."}
{"original": "Petro and Duque differ on almost every critical issue facing Colombia: Duque favors forcibly eradicating coca crops that have skyrocketed to record levels, whereas Petro favors substitution. Historically tight relations between the U.S. and Colombia would likely remain unchanged under a Duque presidency, whereas Petro has called U.S. assistance to Colombia help that has served for nothing."}
{"original": "In regards to the peace deal, Duque has said he'll introduce a constitutional reform mandating that drug trafficking cannot be an amnestied crime. Under the accord, guerrillas involved in drug trafficking and violent crimes during the conflict who fully confess can avoid jail time. Many Colombians consider those terms far too generous."}
{"original": "The FARC long funded itself by leveling a war tax on cocaine moving through territory it dominated, and 50 members of its leadership structure were indicted in 2006 in the U.S. on charges of running the world's largest drug cartel."}
{"original": "In April, Colombian authorities arrested a former top rebel peace negotiator on a U.S. drug warrant on charges that he conspired with three others to smuggle several tons of cocaine into the U.S. with a wholesale value of $15 million."}
{"original": "In a victory speech to supporters little changed from his regular campaign stump, Duque stressed law and order issues that are red meat to his conservative base. He said he didn't want to tear up Colombia's peace agreement but rather make modifications that would ensure victims of the conflict achieve peace with justice."}
{"original": "I want to be the president who unites our country and not govern with a rearview mirror, he said."}
{"original": "Analysts said that mostly urban voters turned off by Colombia's polarizing politics will play kingmaker in the second round."}
{"original": "Political analyst Ivan Valencia, himself a former rebel, said Duque will face a steeper challenge winning over supporters of Fajardo and other centrist candidates because he's more hostile to the peace process, while Petro from the campaign's outset has tried to portray himself — so far with mixes success — as a moderate."}
{"original": "Whichever candidate is able to move more to the center is the one who will win the election, said Valencia."}
{"original": "De la Calle, the government's chief negotiator with the FARC, without specifically endorsing Petro, made an impassioned plea not to backtrack on implementation of the peace accord when a future free of armed conflict is within reach."}

{"original": "The pay people take home after accounting for inflation fell 1.3 percent last year, a new analysis shows. The findings come a year after President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with his administration promising it would deliver immediate wage growth to workers."}
{"original": "Yet many workers' wages aren't keeping pace with the cost of living, compensation-data company PayScale found. That's concerning because it indicates more Americans are falling behind -- despite seeing the lowest U.S. unemployment rate in nearly 50 years -- and could struggle to maintain their standard of living when the next recession inevitably rolls around."}
{"original": "PayScale examined the difference between nominal wages -- what you're paid on paper -- and a paycheck's actual purchasing power after accounting for inflation, or what economists call real wages. If pay growth is lower than the rise in the cost of living, a worker will have less purchasing power."}
{"original": "That may explain why Americans reported an anxiety spike about personal finances last year, with nearly three-fourths of women and three-fourths of young adults ages 18 to 34 saying they were somewhat or extremely anxious about paying their bills."}
{"original": "The dip in real wages also is notable as it came during a year when corporations got generous breaks thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Instead of providing higher wages, however, many companies used the money to repurchase shares, which reached a record $1 trillion last year."}
{"original": "Although there are positive macroeconomic indicators, it's not a guarantee, and not everyone is experiencing the benefits, said Katie Bardaro, chief economist at PayScale. Wages aren't moving at the rate they should be unless you are in in-demand jobs."}
{"original": "Notably, wages in manufacturing -- a sector that Mr. Trump promised to revitalize -- suffered one of the largest declines in real wages, which slipped 2.4 percent last year. Transportation witnessed the biggest dip, with real wages losing 3.9 percent compared with a year earlier. At the same time, the tech sector roared ahead, with wages rising 2.7 percent."}
{"original": "The manufacturing and transportation sectors may be feeling the impact of the Trump administration's trade war with China. Fewer imports would mean less demand for transportation to haul those goods across the country, for instance."}
{"original": "We cannot underscore the impact that these trade policies have had, Bardaro said."}
{"original": "PayScale's study examines wages for full-time, private industry employees and education professionals."}
{"original": "Americans are also experiencing different wage growth by region, PayScale found. The strongest wage growth is being enjoyed in metropolitan areas on the coasts, such as San Francisco. But cities in the midwest and south are struggling."}
{"original": "Wages in Nashville slipped 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter while those in Detroit declined 0.6 percent, representing the lowest of the more than 30 cities tracked by PayScale."}
{"original": "There is this dichotomy between the coastline and the non-coastline regions in the current political climate, Bardaro said. That could have real lasting effects on our country."}
{"original": "Getting a tax refund this year? The IRS reports that it's returning nearly $3,000 to the average American this tax season. And though your March Madness buddies may be unanimous in believing you should use yours for a high-definition big-screen TV, your empty bank account -- and big credit card bills -- say otherwise."}
{"original": "The more vexing question is this: Would you be better off paying off debt or using that refund to start a savings account? The surprising answer is that if your income is low, saving for retirement might provide twice the aftertax return than you would realize from paying off debt."}
{"original": "The reason is a little-known break called the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit, or the savers credit for short."}
{"original": "This credit was put into the tax code to give low-income filers -- those least able to afford socking away money for retirement -- an incentive to save. The less you earn, the bigger the incentive. Single filers earning less than $18,500 and married couples earning less than $37,000, for instance, get a tax credit worth 50 cents for every $1 they put into a retirement account."}
{"original": "However, the credit amount drops for those earning more, falling to 20 percent of retirement contributions for singles earning $20,000 and to 10 percent once single income exceeds that amount. Once you earn more than $31,000 when single or more than $62,000 when married, the credit evaporates completely."}
{"original": "It's worth mentioning that tax credits are considerably more valuable than tax deductions. The latter simply reduce the amount of income that's subject to tax, while tax credits provide a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the tax that you owe. A taxpayer who pays 30 percent of his income in federal and state taxes, for instance, would save $300 with a $1,000 tax deduction, but save $1,000 from a tax credit of that amount."}
{"original": "That said, those who qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit can double-up on tax breaks, claiming both this credit and a tax deduction for saving in a tax-favored account."}
{"original": "Who gets this credit, and how can you claim it?"}
{"original": "The credit is available to people who are over the age of 18 and can't be claimed by another taxpayer as a dependent. You're also barred from claiming it if you're a full-time student. Otherwise, the only restriction is based on earnings."}
{"original": "To claim it, you must do two things: Contribute up to $2,000 (single) or up to $4,000 (married) to a qualified retirement account, such as a 401(k) or an IRA, and fill out the IRS Form 8880. And since IRA contributions can be made until the tax deadline of the following year, those who qualify for the credit can still claim it for the 2016 tax year, as long as they put money in an IRA before April 18."}
{"original": "Consider, for example, my son Michael, who started full-time work last year, earning $17,558. He lived frugally enough to sock away $1,000. If he saved that money in a simple bank account, he wouldn't qualify for any tax breaks. After accounting for standard deductions and personal exemptions, he would pay tax on $7,208 in income and owe $723 in federal income tax."}
{"original": "On the other hand, if he socked the $1,000 into a tax-deductible IRA, his taxable income would drop by $1,000, and his tax obligation would fall to $623."}
{"original": "But he's not done. By filling out form 8880, he realizes that he also gets a credit of $500 -- 50 percent of his $1,000 deduction. That cuts his tax bill to just $123. Net tax savings: $600. That's the equivalent of getting a 60 percent return on your money -- before the money is even invested."}
{"original": "Incidentally, if Michael owed money on a credit card -- even at 30 percent interest -- the net benefit of paying off a $1,000 debt would be $300 – less than half of the tax break you get for saving this money. Indeed, the truly smart answer in this case would be to save in the IRA to get the credit and deductions, and then use your $600 tax savings to pay off your credit card debt."}
{"original": "Is Big Blue back? IBM (IBM) caught investors' attention last week when it reported what some saw as positive and indicative of better things to come. Although the skeptics on Wall Street weren't convinced that IBM's long-awaited turnaround is finally on its way, the bulls viewed the December quarter's results as definitely promising."}
{"original": "IBM's 2018 guide is incrementally better and encapsulates IBM's ability to stabilize revenues and gross margins, argued Amit Daryanani, equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets. That, he added, should enable the company to sustain $13.80 earnings per-share despite anticipated headwinds, including a tax rate that IBM sees coming in at 16 percent vs. 12 percent in 2017."}
{"original": "Furthermore, the company expects free cash flow conversion to remain 100 percent in 2018, with likely focus toward shareholder return, noted Daryanani. And IBM expects gross margins to stabilize in 2018, thanks to improvements in mix and volume (constant currency growth expected), better leverage in its strategic imperatives and productivity improvements in services, he asserted."}
{"original": "Daryanani acknowledged that the December quarterly report would broadly underwhelm investors (for now) given steady revenue headwinds (beyond systems/mainframe) and gross-margin declines across the board."}
{"original": "One such underwhelmed analyst is Moshe Katri of securities firm Wedbush, who describes the quarterly result as a low-quality earnings beat because the company's large legacy exposure continues to cannibalize revenue growth while compressing margins."}
{"original": "Bottom line, IBM margins remains in a 'work-in-progress' mode, he said, as it continues to convert its revenue base away from an asset/labor-intensive legacy model into asset/labor-light 'digital' solutions.' Katri has a neutral rating on IBM, with a price target of $185. The stock closed on Tuesday at $166.25, up 2.3 percent, or $3.66."}
{"original": "Even the bulls don't expect a quick uptick in investor attitudes toward IBM's stock in spite of the positive outlook they discern from the fourth-quarter results. One reason is it will take time to analyze IBM's revenue growth profile, said David M. Grossman, equity analyst at investment firm Stifel, who rates IBM as a buy, with a price target of $182 a share."}
{"original": "And with IBM's nearly 4 percent dividend yield, we believe the market is discounting IBM will remain in secular decline independent of its growth initiatives, and that the current level of free-cash-flow generation, which covers capital returns and acquisitions, is unsustainable."}
{"original": "Even so, Grossman believes IBM's risk-reward profile remains attractive given very negative market sentiment and several potential catalysts over the next 12 months, which could drive both estimates and the (price-earnings) multiple higher. These catalysts, said Grossman, include extended mainframe/server product cycles, reaccelerating services growth and a weaker U.S. dollar (50 percent-55 percent of IBM's revenue is denominated in foreign currency)."}
{"original": "One huge factor that has negatively affected IBM shares was Warren Buffett's move in November to trim Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) stake in it to roughly 37 million shares (about $4.5 billion worth) from 54 million shares ($8.3 billion)."}
{"original": "But while CFRA equity analyst David Holt said Buffett's move has put downward pressure on the stock over the short term, we don't believe that this negates the fundamental stabilization of key segments (Systems and Global Business Solutions) that have been a drag in the past at IBM."}
{"original": "He added, Coupled with nascent success in scaling up cloud [computing], which rose 30 percent in the third quarter, we think this helps power solid trends in Strategic Imperatives and lends more incremental margin lift."}
{"original": "Holt recommends IBM shares as a buy, with a 12-week price target of $175 a share, helped by share repurchases. He sees IBM earning $13.98 a share in 2018."}

If you can redefine what it means to support abortion rights, you can redefine how you feel about Democratic candidates. And I think going to our other conversation, you know, the Trump base is demonstrably different than-- than the Democratic Party's base, which is why there is asymmetrical and there's two different standards for how you talk about racial issues or gender issues or-- or, you know, sort of anything in the spectrum that we have been talking about this morning."}

Federal student loans offer significant benefits that aren't standard with mortgages, such as death and disability discharges, economic hardship deferments, forbearances, income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness options, said Kantrowitz. The tax treatment may be less favorable. The traditional wisdom over the years has been to favor mortgage debt over other kinds of credit because home-related debt is tax deductible. However, Kantrowitz pointed out: There's a deduction for mortgage interest, but you must itemize (most taxpayers don't). The student loan interest deduction, on the other hand, lets you deduct up to $2,500 in interest on federal and private student loans. It's an 'above-the-line' exclusion from income, so you can claim it even if you don't itemize. It also reduces the [adjusted gross income], which may have other benefits."}

And if you look at the way these fights are shaping up, if you look at the way the Democrats this last week walked into Donald Trump's thing at the State of the Union about how we're never going to be a socialist country by unveiling in not great fashion the green new deal, it does seem like the Democrats are in danger of spiraling off to exactly the place where the White House wants them to be."}

They are unlikely to qualify for a lower rate on a mortgage. You lose federal loan breaks if you can't pay. The federal loan program has a surprising number of generous provisions if you're sick, disabled or can't pay back your loan.  Federal student loans offer significant benefits that aren't standard with mortgages, such as death and disability discharges, economic hardship deferments, forbearances, income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness options, said Kantrowitz."}

There are three reasons for that gap --some fail to pay any taxes, others underreport income, and yet others underpay their taxes, according to the IRS. Mulvaney said the president's proposed tax plan doesn't include an expectation that the gap will close, but pointed out how shrinking it would help the proposed $4 trillion budget. The tax gap in 2016 was $486 billion -- out of the expected revenue from income and corporate taxes of roughly $1.9 trillion."}

{"original": "However, Mulvaney's hopes of closing or even significantly shrinking the tax gap may be a stretch. The tax gap has remained relatively stable during the last decade, with the majority of the gap stemming from individual, rather than corporate, tax, shortages. The total tax gap was $450 billion in 2006, and the total tax compliance rate was 83 percent, according to the Government Accountability Office. The Obama administration made attempts to close the gap by stepping up enforcement, but probably only reduced it by $50 billion to $100 billion over a decade, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget."}
