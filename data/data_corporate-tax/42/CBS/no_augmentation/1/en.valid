LOS ANGELES -- Johnny Depp sued his former business managers on Friday alleging they mismanaged his earnings throughout a lucrative period of his career, although the company says the actor's spending is to blame.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Did the crown prince know of the murder? You're saying he didn't direct it.
ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Something like that.
WARREN BUFFETT: Well -- they almost all represent something important. I mean over here -- is my -- certificate from the Dale Carnegie course I took when I was 21. (CHUCKLES) I was terrified of public speaking. I -- oh, I couldn't do it. I couldn't get in front of a crowd and give 'ya my name. (CHUCKLES)
The issue has always been: How do we pay for it? Beutner said. That issue does not go away now that we have a contract. We can't solve 40 years of underinvestment in public education in just one week or just one contract.
REPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: I don't really know how that happens. I mean, maybe the impeachment proceeding does that. I know the lieutenant governor has called for an FBI investigation.
It's fairly customary for U.S. attorneys to leave their positions after a new president is in office, but the departures are not automatic and don't necessarily happen all at once.
How do you save someone like yourself at that time? Duncan asked.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You have them, you say, in custody though.
Millions do not qualify for unemployment insurance after seeing their hours reduced, switching to lower-paying jobs, or temporarily leaving the workforce to care for family members during the pandemic, they wrote in the letter. Direct payments are crucial for supporting struggling families who aren't reached by unemployment insurance.
As she put it: As the crisis spreads it's going to become more evident that this is necessary, that businesses of all sizes will need this, at some point.
And you know, I've said before the greatest honor I have as president is being commander-in-chief and I meet extraordinary women in uniform who can do everything that a man can and more.
You should try to file as soon as possible, said Greene-Lewis, who noted that TurboTax users can file up to 11:59 p.m. on the night of the tax deadline. People who rush at the last minute may leave something out or forget about tax deductions and credits, even though we do remind you. It's best to do everything earlier.
California legalized cannabis in 2017. Cooper said in the BET documentary that growing up in California, his children often saw marijuana dispensaries.
Aimee Picchi and the Associated Press contributed reporting.
Person to Person take you to where Buffett's mega deals are done. His private office in Omaha, Neb., is as unconventional as the man himself.
In Kushner buildings across the city, records show frequent complaints about construction going on early in the morning or late at night against the rules, improper or illegal construction, and work without a permit.
But that's exactly what the company then run by Jared Kushner did, and with remarkable speed. Two years later, it sold all three buildings for $60 million, nearly 50 percent more than it paid.
It's bare-faced greed, said Aaron Carr, founder of Housing Rights Initiative, a tenants' rights watchdog that compiled the work permit application documents and shared them with The Associated Press. The fact that the company was falsifying all these applications with the government shows a sordid attempt to avert accountability and get a rapid return on its investment.
Manafort's attorneys submitted a poorly redacted filing in January revealing Manafort shared polling data with Kilimnik during the campaign. In their response to Mueller claiming Manafort breached his plea deal, Manafort's attorneys inadvertently revealed the special counsel alleges Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.
Pharmaceutical and medical supply companies should be required to demonstrate to the Food and Drug Administration that they're working towards building more resilience into the supply chain, he said. Resilience in practical terms means ensuring companies have at least two suppliers, sourcing for instance 50% of their products from New Jersey and 50% from China, he said.
The residency requirement is structured so that a single child can't be claimed by more than one taxpayer for a given year. But its complexity can lead to confusion, especially in multi-generational households, said Nina Olson, founder of the Taxpayer Rights Center and the National Taxpayer Advocate from 2001 to 2019.
Michael J. Kump, an attorney for The Management Group, calls Depp's lawsuit a fabrication and wrote in a statement that Depp never alleged any wrongdoing. The company did everything possible to protect Depp from his irresponsible and profligate spending, Kump wrote.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The governor's a peer of yours. Do you think that the-- the time, the place, the context of any of this should be considered in placing judgment on him?
House Democrats believe that the minimum wage hike is necessary. Therefore, this provision will remain in the American Rescue Plan on the Floor tomorrow, Pelosi said. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 has not been increased since 2009.
LARA LOGAN: This is the baseball you were talking about.
The paid sick leave provision — the center of negotiations last week between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — is complicated, according to the analysts. It mandates that employers with less than 500 employees fund paid leave at varying rates for varying amounts of time, with wide variations for different circumstances, they wrote. Government tax credits would offset some of those costs.
Trump says he doesn't need to be tested for coronavirus
He hired a lawyer who found out he was protected from the 60-percent rent hike by law, something Romano did not know at the time. And he said his rent, which was set to increase to $3,750, was restored to $2,350.
She added: People are already starting to take this leave, with or without emergency benefits.
According to experts, the lasting effects of Mr. Trump's tweets on the economy and big business are yet to be seen.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Watson said investigators had not been able to trace all of the stolen money but said the operation was among the largest tax refund fraud schemes the IRS has ever uncovered. Watson said Decoste was arrested in 2015 on similar charges in the Atlanta area and appeared to brag in recorded jail phone calls there about his abilities to steal.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And along those lines, the issue of abortion, very divisive, also reignited. That's where the scrutiny of Northam came from in the first place because of this radio interview he did, Margaret. And Republicans are arguing that Democrats are out of step with public opinion on abortion. Gallup poll conducted in May 2018 showed sixty percent of Americans think abortion should be legal in the first trimester, thirteen percent when asked about terminations in the third trimester. And that's where Northam's comments were directed, that later part.
The report also claims $450 billion in consumer benefits over the next 10 years based on broader availability of less costly insurance options, reduced taxpayer spending on subsidies, and the cancelled fines. But it acknowledges that premiums will go up for some middle- and upper-income consumers.
He said both Greece and its creditors -- other European countries and the International Monetary Fund -- agreed that some progress has been made.
And you know, one of my military aides is about five feet tall. Probably weighs about a hundred pounds. You put a 50 pound pack on her and she can do things that you or me would keel over doing. And so, you know the truth is is that women are serving. They are taking great risks. What we should not do is-- is somehow prevent them from advancing in an institution that we all revere.
Walmart, the planet's largest retailer, last April began offering reusable bags at the checkout counters in U.S. stores. Kroger, the nation's biggest grocery chain, in May said it would eliminate plastic bags by 2025.
I think it was a fraud factory, Dimitrouleas said at a hearing Thursday. He's the boss.
Many of those new workers came from out of state, contributing to North Carolina's net annual influx of about 46,000 college degree holders. That migration of educated workers is the norm among the southern states.
These costs have largely been borne by local businesses, who often see those safety measures as necessary to get customers back in the door.
Congressional Democrats opted to use the procedural maneuver known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, allowing it to be approved by only a simple majority in the Senate. Most legislation requires 60 votes in the Senate to advance, so the budget reconciliation process allows Democrats — who hold a 50-seat majority — to pass the bill without any Republican votes.
Because of the dynamics of the American family, children move back and forth between separated parents; they may be living with grandparents; they may be living with unmarried parents, Olson told CBS News.
Other supermarket chains are also moving away from plastic bags as more cities and states ban them. Plastic bags are considered especially bad for the environment as they are made with petroleum and don't decompose.
The market for Polaris' machines, popular for farm work, hunting and sport riding, was growing in the south. Open land was available, and Alabama had programs to help recruit and train a workforce expected to rise to 1,500.
It's been a long couple of years for Cooper and his family. He reflected on how his time behind bars impacted his daughter and his family.
The agency has previously pushed back the tax filing deadline, including two years ago when the website to make payments suffered multiple outages hours before the deadline. The legislators noted in their letter Tuesday that the IRS already has authority to extend filing deadlines by up to six months, as well as to waive penalties.
MARGARET BRENNAN: No. Gayle, we love that you are here--
The answer is, quite a lot. That $486 billion represents more than 10 percent of the White House's proposed fiscal year 2018 budget. For instance, it would easily cover the proposed 2018 Medicaid budget of $408 billion, a good chunk of the proposed $600 billion defense budget, or much of the proposed $582 billion Medicare budget.
New York City's Department of Buildings did not comment in general about the false filings by the Kushner Cos., but said it disciplined a contractor who filed false documents while working on two of the Queens buildings, which are currently under investigation by a tenant-harassment task force. It added that the department is also ramping up its monitoring of construction, hiring 72 new inspectors under city laws recently passed to crack down on tenant harassment.
Government spokeswoman Olga Gerovassili voiced optimism that an agreement can be found in time. It is in the interest of all the parties involved, she said.
Gangi, also in Sicily, started selling vacant homes for €1 in 2015, and Ollolai, in Sardinia, followed suit. At the heart of those efforts are attempts to revive their economies and preserve their cultures as young residents flocked to big cities and older inhabitants passed away, leaving a stock of abandoned homes in their wake.
GAYLE KING: Margaret, can I ask you a question? Am I still on mic? No.
The Associated Press has reported that the subpoena seeking documents from Hunter Biden in December asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma.
Overall ventilator capacity and what we need in Europe or the orders that will keep coming in from Italy and France, orders from within the U.S. ... they will all aggregate up to quite a high number, which may be more than the current capacity of existing manufacturers, Yadav said. So we might have to think about bringing on board new manufacturers who might not be certified or approved to sell medical equipment in the United States, but we might have to think about how we bring them on board.
However, it's unclear that the provision raising the minimum wage would have been included in the final bill even if MacDonough had ruled that it was possible to include a wage hike in the bill. At least two Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, had expressed concerns about raising the minimum wage. Without support from all 50 Democrats in the Senate, the bill's prospects would be doomed.
This tax credit can reduce your liability up to $2,000 per child. It can also give you back up to $1,400 even if you had no tax liability, making it one of the most valuable tax credits.
REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. I-- I-- I heard that and-- and Senator Shelby is a, you know, a very seasoned negotiator and-- and-- and certainly when you look at-- at his conversations, you can draw some optimism from it. But I can tell you based on my conversations with conferees and a number of rank and file, there are distinct differences. And-- and here's-- here's what I'm concerned about. Border patrol came in to brief the conference. They gave their top three priorities and the conferees have said zero money for those top three priorities. How can you be serious about securing our border if the very people that are experts on securing it say these are our top three priorities, we need money. And yet they're saying zero dollars for that. I-- I don't understand that.
Under the tentative agreement, the district, the union and the mayor's office will work jointly to advocate for increased county and state funding for Los Angeles schools, according to the UTLA summary.
Decoste also created a purported rap label called GroundUp111 as a cover for the fraud business, Watson said. Other defendants were listed as officers of the so-called company, which did not produce any music.

The only case in which a borrower might consider using a mortgage or home equity loan or line of credit to pay off student loans is if the student loan borrower has high-interest private student loans.
NEW YORK -- When the Kushner Cos. bought three apartment buildings in a gentrifying neighborhood of Queens in 2015, most of the tenants were protected by special rules that prevent developers from pushing them out, raising rents and turning a tidy profit.
However, Fiorenza said major casinos have contingency plans, and he expects them to find ways to continue operating if a strike does happen, such as using managers in front-line jobs and bringing in workers from outside the area.
One thing it doesn't seem to have created, though, is many full-time freelancers.
These accounts have sky-rocketed in the last six years, with 85 percent of the accounts opened since 2011, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, or EBRI.
Supporters of the idea point out that financial hardship remains widespread around the U.S. almost a full year after COVID-19 effectively shuttered the economy. Despite the ongoing recovery, a third of adults are struggling to pay their bills, while employers have slashed roughly 10 million jobs from their payrolls during the crisis, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
CHARLIE ROSE: Modesty -- modesty becomes you. (LAUGHS)
Buffett appeared on CNBC Monday after meeting with roughly 40,000 Berkshire shareholders on Saturday.
Submitting false documents to the city's Department of Buildings for construction permits is a misdemeanor, which can carry fines of up to $25,000. But real estate experts say it is often flouted with little to no consequences. Landlords who do so get off with no more than a demand from the city, sometimes a year or more later, to file an amended form with the correct numbers.
If you think you're going to spend most of the funds, it doesn't make sense to invest it, said Evan Powers, a certified financial planner with Cypress Financial Planning in Charlottesville, Virginia, and an adviser for myfinancialanswers.com.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: It is gonna be a great game. I got some some wings waiting for me upstairs.
Made a killing on GameStop shares? That won't come up until 2021 taxes, which aren't due until next year. But it would be wise start making plans or anticipated payments on those taxes now.
The government study, however, has some key differences from industry research. It only asked about a person's primary job, so it doesn't capture freelancers who moonlight on top of a day job. And it is time-limited, so it only captures the freelance workers at a single point in time.
The incoming official said the number is not dependent on an additional vaccine becoming available, like the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine that is awaiting the Food and Drug Administration's authorization. Under the plan, the vaccine will be free and available to everyone, regardless of immigration status.
WARREN BUFFETT: Here are my children here. Here's Peter and Susie probably giving me little advice at the annual meeting. And that's my son, Howard, over there.
My figure was 17 percent. So clearly-- something is out of whack. And, you know, nobody's gonna pay more than is required. Mitt Romney doesn't, I don't, you know. ...And, incidentally, I don't fault M -- Governor Romney at all. He paid what -- the Congress told him to. ...we were promised that a rising tide would lift all boats. A rising tide has lifted all yachts.

Higher-education institutions, including public colleges, HBCUs and other Minority Serving Institutions, could receive $35 billion in assistance. Biden's plan details that millions of students could receive an additional $1,700 in financial assistance with this money.
Higher-income households may also face a net investment income tax on capital gains and other investment income.
CHARLIE ROSE: There's also a picture among the board of directors of Bill Gates. And you have become...obviously, well known because of -- of the commitment to philanthropy and -- and giving -- $30 billion or more to Bill to -- as part of his foundation. That grew out of what?
If you can really fill out your tax reform -- tax returns on a single piece of paper, you're much more likely to actually do it, Mulvaney added.
But if the Trump administration managed to do what previous administrations have been unable to do and closed the tax gap with a one-approach solution, what would that more than $400 billion cover?
Plants in Kentucky and Indiana gave Toyota a U.S. foothold in the 1980s and 1990s, but in this century the Japanese carmaker turned to Alabama, Texas and Mississippi for expansion. Located on former cotton fields, the company's Huntsville, Alabama, plant now employs more than 1,400 people and churns out about 3,000 engines a day.
GAYLE KING: And now your attorney general is also-- also has some explaining to do about--
ADEL AL-JUBEIR: I personally have not. No. But we have communications with them through intelligence channels.
A divorce decree will usually spell out who can claim the child, but individual families can make decisions differently, Jaeger notes. Sometimes parents will alternate years, with one claiming the child tax credit in odd years, and the other claiming them in even years. Or, if two children are involved, one parent can claim each child.
You definitely need to be comfortable in Italian if you are going to undertake any kind of labor project, said Kat Kalashian, editor of Live and Invest Overseas. You will need to speak Italian to get referrals and find labor, and you will need to speak Italian to work with them.
So if you really want to do something productive with your refund, the first step is to move it out of your bank and put it into another account that's harder to reach. If you don't already have one, consider opening brokerage account, mutual fund or retirement account.
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, my dad. That's his campaign picture in 1942. He was 39 years of age then. And he ran for Congress. ...And that picture comes from his campaign card. ...he went on to -- have a few more terms.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I don't know if it will put-- push the country in a recession. But here's what we know. The reason that the economy shrank a little bit, despite the fact that housing's recovering, manufacturing is gone strong, car sales are up. You know truth is that overall there were a lot of positive signs in the economy. The big problem was defense spending was cut 22 percent. It was the biggest drop in-- in 40 years. And it was very abrupt and it had to do with you know folks being worried about the possible impacts of the fiscal cliff and what goes on here in Washington and what I've said repeatedly is-- you know Washington cannot continually operate under a cloud of crisis. That freezes up consumers. It gets businesses worried. We can't afford these self-inflicted wounds.
GAYLE KING: Mm-Hm. And he is aware of all of that. And I think I said, Listen, in Virginia you have one, two, three people that are involved in a very messy scandal all at the same time. What do you make of that? He knows that the optics aren't good. He said, But I am concentrating on my battle and my fight. And I want to figure out a way how can I turn this around.
You get a tax break for your contributions, and if you earn interest or investment growth on your account, that is also tax-free as long as you use the money for qualified expenses.
Independent contractors don't have the right to a minimum wage, overtime or breaks, said Maya Pinto, senior researcher and policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project. They can be subject to discrimination based on age, race, gender or disability; they don't have the right to organize or the right to a safe and healthy workplace, or workers' compensation or unemployment benefits, and they bear the full cost of Social Security and Medicare.
Amendments only require a simple majority to be added to legislation, so an amendment on the minimum wage is possible as long as all 50 Democrats approve.
In 2020, Corvain Cooper was featured in the BET documentary titled Smoke: Marijuana + Black America. In a telephone interview from a maximum-security prison in Louisiana, the 41-year-old Cooper detailed his sentence.
The IRS is still digging out from a backlog of tax returns filed last year, when the agency shifted its workers to remote work and stored paper tax returns in trailers until it could get to them. The backlog of unprocessed returns from last year still numbers in the millions.
Now, the greatest supply chain concern for the U.S. lies in the future: will the U.S. be able to deliver all the pharmaceutical drugs and medical equipment the U.S. will need? Whatever production capacity there is now in the U.S. and in Europe, Yadav said he has less confidence in whether that capacity will remain available over the next few months, as workers at manufacturers may not be able to go to work.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Because I think a lot of people ask, where is the benchmark for you believing the accuser versus believing the lieutenant governor? And they apply that to various different cases whether it was Justice Kavanaugh or their own personal experience. For you, what is the benchmark?
His life sentence was just one of 143 cases that received commutation during Mr. Trump's last weeks in the White House. Of the people who had their sentences commuted, at least 12 were serving lengthy time for non-violent drug-related crimes. Cooper detailed to Duncan what his final day of prison was like.n
The president-elect also wants to implement emergency paid sick, family, and medical leave, stabilize childcare centers with $25 billion in emergency funding, and forestall COVID-related evictions.
REPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Because I don't believe he can effectively lead co-- the commonwealth at this time. I mean, I understand that he wants-- that he is feeling contrition, that he is feeling regret. But we need somebody who-- who cannot only address the wrongs of the past but take Virginia into the future. And I think he's lost the confidence of the people in order to be able to do that.
IRS may already be behind on refunds
MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to North Carolina Republican Congressman Mark Meadows. He is the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and one of President Trump's top allies on Capitol Hill. Good to have you here.
In the meantime, workers can make their own calculations to see if they'll owe money. Unemployment benefits are subject only to federal income tax paid at income-tax rates (not Social Security or Medicare taxes that are taken out of employer paychecks.) People living in states without an income tax or in select states that don't tax such benefits — including Alabama, California, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia — don't need to worry, said Robbin Caruso, a partner in the tax practice at Prager Metis.
His proposed legislation also would also initiate his push for a $15 national minimum wage and for ending the tipped minimum wage.
Kushner would never deny any tenant their due-process rights, it said, adding that the company has renovated thousands of apartments and developments with minimal complaints over the past 30 years.
SCOTT PELLEY: Next week the board of the Boy Scouts of America is going to vote on whether to end their national ban on gays in scouting. Should scouting be open to gays?
GAYLE KING: Well, the interview was at seven o'clock, and he was there ready to-- we were in his house, of course, he was there ready to go. And he was on time. And he clearly is very anguished by this whole situation. I know that this is an attempt at damage control. Who's calling us, Margaret?
The IRS lists seven criteria for a child to be eligible for the credit:
Cooper is now a dad determined to set an example by growing a message of hope.
The president appeared to take the critique from one of his strongest voting blocs personally, mocking the magazine, which was founded by Billy Graham, and retweeting supporters of his who also blasted the publication. Mark Galli, the editor in chief whose name was attached to the editorial, is retiring.
The aide said that the phase two bill is expected to be passed in the Senate on Wednesday, and phase three by the end of the week.

REPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Well, I mean that's-- everybody's entitled to their opinion and that's-- that's persuasive. But remember he-- he won a vast majority of the black vote in his election. And we're not talking about approval numbers. We're talking about people who feel that the governor should step down immediately. So, it's a very different situation. The fact is, he's really lost the confidence of a lot of the people he's supposed to be leading.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sunday, February 10th. I'm Margaret Brennan. And this is FACE THE NATION.
MARGARET BRENNAN: For some more perspective we turn to Virginia Congressman Don Bayer-- Beyer who also served as the commonwealth's lieutenant governor. You jinxed me there congressman.
Some deficit watchdogs, however, argue that past tax cuts haven't yielded the economic growth that proponents have promised. They believe dynamic scoring encourages fiscally irresponsible proposals that will blow up the deficit.
Internal Revenue Service investigators say the group used a rented house in the quiet suburb of Miramar as the hub for 10 laptop computers used in an attempt to steal about $108 million between July 2011 and May 2013. The IRS estimated the men were able to fraudulently obtain at least $28.2 million in actual refunds using 29,000 separate stolen identities.
The risk is that you may not withhold enough tax -- and then find that you owe tax when it's time to file your return. Nobody wants that. Which is why we overpay our taxes and are happy to get a refund.
In a statement on Thursday, Pelosi said MacDonough's decision was disappointing.
And for those of us who we'd like to see a big hit, and enjoy, you know, the rock-em sock-em you know, elements of the game, you know, we're probably going to be occasionally frustrated. I know defensive players in the NFL get frustrated now, because some of the changes in the rules. But I do think that we want to make sure that after people have played the game that they're going to be okay. And I'm glad to see that the NFL is starting to take this seriously. I understand that Commissioner Goodell has authorized 30 million dollars to the NIH to help study issues of how we can prevent concussions. But these are serious issues and especially for younger kids, as well as college players who don't make a big-- a big salary playing the sport. We want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep them safe.
The child needs to be your child, foster child, sister or brother, or a descendant of one of them (such as a niece, nephew or grandchild)
Essential medicines refers to the over 400 medicines the World Health Organization has identified as essential for any nation to have.

This includes medicines, supplies such as face masks and gloves, and medical equipment like ventilators.
Although you can often get a better rate on a home-equity loan than on most credit cards and installment loans, federal college financing is mostly pretty cheap. Federal student loan rates range from 3.76 percent (undergraduate) to 5.31 percent (graduate). They reset on July 1.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Where is Jamal Khashoggi's body?
The House's latest proposed changes to its measure stipulate that:
The child cannot provide more than half her own living expenses
We know how important America has been to the fight. Are you worried about what might happen after American forces leave?
We need to build resilience into the supply chain, undoubtedly, Yadav said.
I've said in different times, we'll fix the deficit, he said. This is not the time to worry about it.
H&R Block, meanwhile, appears to have kept its online and software prices steady. Like TurboTax, it also offers a free filing option for simple tax returns. Still, many of those free filing options disappear later in the tax season, according to research from Oppenheimer & Co. cited by Bloomberg News. H&R Block didn't immediately return a request for comment.
Mr. Biden proactively addressed critics who not share his optimism of striking a bipartisan deal, saying unity is not some pie-in-the-sky dream, it's a practical step to getting the things we have to get done as a country, get done together.
Chesterfield County, Virginia Sheriff Karl Leonard said the legislation was a necessary step to reduce the risk for law enforcement officers and other employees in his county, including those who might have to contain a virus outbreak in a prison or jail.
Not even close to the max. Among the propositions of the new health care bill is raising the maximum contribution allowed to HSAs, which this year was capped at $3,400 for an individual and $6,750 for a family.

Buyers can avoid paying property tax on the homes if Sambuca becomes their principal residence. Otherwise, a tax rate of up to 0.76 percent applies. A secondary tax, that varies across municipalities, also applies, in the range of zero to 3.3 percent. You could have zero point zero taxes depending on the municipality, Kalashian said.
The president also touted his work in weakening the Johnson Amendment, which has long restricted tax-exempt churches from endorsing or denouncing political candidates.
JAMES BROWN: And welcome back to the Super Bowl today presented by Pizza Hut, as we continue from inside the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. You know, over the years Super Sunday has become far more than a championship football game. It is now an unofficial American holiday. And with that in mind, it's only fitting that we check in with the nation's first fan.
CHARLIE D'AGATA: Local commander Khaled Baran told us there had been a pause to let civilians leave before the final offensive, yet moments later, airstrikes in all probability from a U.S. warplane struck an ISIS position in the no man's land between the front line and the village. And then one much closer to us followed by a whizzing noise, what sounded like an incoming mortar that sent everyone scrambling. It's not clear how many ISIS militants remain holed up, but the past few days have seen an exodus of families along with some suspected ISIS fighters among them. They arrive hungry and cold to a desolate holding camp in the desert. The men separated from the women and interrogated.
We just finished discussions at the president's request with the Republicans. I know there's been some rumors of the number. It is a big number, Mnuchin said afterward. This is a very unique situation in this economy. We've put a proposal on the table that would inject a trillion dollars into the economy.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We've got to leave it there. Thanks to all of you. We'll be back in a moment.
The vessel sizes are getting bigger. The market is getting bigger. The cargo is here, Adams said.
Some conservatives have long argued that the cost of tax cuts should be evaluated using dynamic scoring, rather than traditional scoring. They don't believe tax cuts must be fully paid-for in legislative text, clalming that the economic growth they create will counterbalance any additional money the tax cuts add to the national debt.
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Great to be with you.
So one financial app, called Trigger, has even created an alert to notify users if Trump tweets about a company they have invested in, reports CBS News correspondent Alex Wagner.

Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who joined Sanders in calling for $2,000 direct checks late last year, also introduced a bill that would require companies with revenues of $1 billion or more to pay their employees $15 per hour.
The issue arose after Florida voters n 2018 overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure, known as Amendment 4, that amended the state's constitution to give voting rights to former felons — restoring nearly 1.4 million people's right to vote.

LARA LOGAN: There's no computer that we can see on your desk. Is there, does that really mean you have no computer in your office at all?
REPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: I don't know that I can say that there is a particular benchmark, I judge every case and every-- every complainant and every situation on its merits. You know, I was also a prosecutor and this is not an issue where we need to prove something to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Elected leaders need to be held to a higher standard and where there are credible allegations-- corroborated allegations of serious sexual assault. We're talking about rape and forcible sodomy. This is something that impacts his ability to lead in future.
GAYLE KING: Yeah. But the-- the two of them have not spoken.

So, yes, I have thought about resigning but-- but I've also thought about what Virginia needs right now. And I-- I really think that I'm in a position where-- where I can take Virginia to the next level and it-- it will be very positive and, you know, we have a number of inequities in this country right now and in Virginia and-- and we're in a position to really stop talking so much and now to take action with policy to address a lot of these inequities.

Eligibility for the full stimulus payment last year included an income of $75,000 or less for a single person and $150,000 or less for a married couple; people who earned above those amounts may have qualified for a reduced payment. If you fell within the income brackets but didn't get a payment, you'll want to claim it on your tax return. If you earned too much to qualify based on 2019 but your 2020 income was lower, filing your tax return will allow you to get a payment based on your 2020 income. And if you had a child last year, you'll qualify for a back payment of $500 or $600 (or potentially both) if you haven't already received the dependent payment.
GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Well, again we-- we have worked very hard. We've had a good first year. And-- and I'm a leader. I've been in some very difficult situations, life and death situations taking care of sick children. And right now--

While lower interest rates allowed acquirers to borrow money to finance their deals, Buffett dismissed the notion he would join the trend. At Berkshire, in contrast, we evaluate acquisitions on an all-equity basis, knowing that our taste for overall debt is very low.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The intelligence community, though, had a very different conclusion here and after the CIA director briefed Congress on the details of what the CIA had found, the Senate then passed a bill saying undoubtedly the crown prince knew about what happened.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. And that intelligence relationship is one of the strongest assets of the work between our two countries. So, I know you would think highly of the CIA and its assessment. When it comes to your own internal investigations, in October is when this murder happened.

This goal was also communicated to the congressional aides on Tuesday.
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.

ADEL AL-JUBEIR: I don't know what the CIA briefed them but I don't-- I believe that the same briefing that the President and the secretary of state and the secretary of defense at the time received did not point in that direction. So, I think there's a-- there's-- there may be emotions here, there may be exaggerations here.

You know, when we look at-- at some thirty to forty percent of those who come here illegally, they come through one corridor that-- that many times is-- is left open. We need to secure it. That requires some type of physical barrier. And-- and certainly we would support that. If that number is less than 5.7 billion, certainly everyone should be willing to compromise. I know I am and we'll find that.

REPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: We'll see any way that particularly happens. You know, this whole notion of how do you adjudicate guilt here is very difficult. I believe both women. I see no reason why they would come forward. They have nothing to gain. There is no lawsuit. There's no money involved. These were all documented some years back. It wasn't created overnight and I believe the women and I think if you believe the women, we have no-- no call but to call for his resignation. No choice.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well as I said before, I'd have to think about it. You know, it's hard to say no to a kid when they've got a passion for something. And I've got daughters. They don't have a passion for football. It is a great sport. I am a huge fan. But there is no doubt that some of the concerns that we've learned about when it comes to concussions have to give parents pause. And you know, as I said before, I feel differently about the NFL. These are grown men. They-- they're well compensated. They know the risks that are involved. But as we start thinking about, you know, the pipeline. Pop Warner. High school. College.

After initially running for a North Carolina congressional seat as a Democrat in 1992, Jones was first elected to Congress in 1994 during the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich. Although he was a reliable Republican vote for most of his nearly 24-year tenure, Jones gained notoriety for sometimes breaking with his party.

But that's also kind of a fantasy, Goldwein added. That's kind of the equivalent of saying, what if we eliminate all government waste, fraud and abuse?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what about Elizabeth Warren? Because you saw this week, another issue here of identity and of race. She, it was revealed according to Texas State Bar Application, self-identified as Native American on that and-- and critics seized on this saying, this wasn't an issue of true identity.

ADEL AL-JUBEIR (Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs/@AdelAljubeir): The-- the death of Jamal Khashoggi was a mass-- massive tragedy. It was a mistake. It was committed by officials of the Saudi government acting outside their scope of authority. The king ordered investigation. The investigation led to the arrest of a number of individuals. Those-- eleven of those individuals have been charged by the public prosecutor, and the trials have begun. We have said we will investigate. We will hold those accountable-- those responsible accountable and we will punish them. The crown prince had nothing to do with this. There was no order given to murder Jamal Khashoggi and-- and the whole country is shocked by this. The trial is taking place. What I tell people is wait until the legal process plays out and then judge us. But don't judge us before the process is complete.

The answer to the Governor's question largely turns on whether 'all terms of sentence' encompasses all obligations or only durational periods, the court wrote in its opinion. We conclude that the phrase, when read and understood in context, plainly refers to obligations and includes 'all' — not some — LFOs imposed in conjunction with an adjudication of guilt.
Yadav said the U.S. should also consider giving companies that produce ventilators a guarantee that if they overproduce ventilators months from now, the federal government will purchase them, or purchase them and allocate them to developing countries hit by the pandemic later in the year.
And can we close some loopholes and deductions that, folks who are well-connected and have a lot of accountants and lawyers can take advantage of, so they end up paying lower rates than a bus driver or a cop. Can we close some of those loopholes? If you combine those things together, then we can not only reduce our deficit but we can continue to invest in things like education and research and development that are going to help us grow.
JONAH GOLDBERG: --where everybody is trying to prove that they're zero-tolerance people, that they're-- they-- they check all the boxes on social justice stuff. And this is, you know, a radioactive mess if everybody is trying to be, you know, sort of (INDISTINCT) than now and purer than now in the Democratic 2020 primary.
ED O'KEEFE: --whoever it was. Well, you know, then you ask-- you hear them saying, give us a little time to seek forgiveness and understanding or for due process. And it's like, how-- you know, are they potentially putting themselves in an even bigger box if they don't say, you know what, I'm not from Virginia, why don't we let this sort itself out there and see what happens?
MARGARET BRENNAN: You're blaming the Turkish government?
Now the White House report undercuts the notion that the tax penalties at issue in the case are central to the health law. Officials at the Council of Economic Advisers said they're not policymakers or lawyers, but economists.
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, they-- they-- think that what is important is next quarter's earnings. And they think they have to trade around, and they have to read news events and change their opinion ...And if people would...adopt the philosophy that they're buying something to hold for the rest of their life. ...they can't go wrong doing that.
Italy's birth rate has been trending downward for years. The Italians a few years ago set records for having the lowest birth rate recorded in history, at 1.1 children, said Steven Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute.
The president's speech comes as the commander-in-chief is ensuring his grip on the evangelical vote, after a widely circulated Christianity Today editorial denounced him in December. The day after that editorial ran, the Trump campaign announced the launch of the Evangelicals for Trump coalition in Miami.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Gayle, we'll be watching the rest of this interview on CBS THIS MORNING.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Gayle, thank you for bringing us this interview. What did you make of the governor's explanation?
WARREN BUFFETT: I think that's the way to do it. And I think saying the two is the best way to do it, because you wouldn't want him to feel bad if you're writing this, right? (LAUGHS). Thanks to both of you.
Buffett turns to leave and walks back towards his office.
CHARLIE D'AGATA: We started this together with Americans on the ground and their air support, Commander Adnan Afreen told us. Just before the end the American decision to withdraw, it's not a good decision, not the right time.
For taxpayers who file immediately, the refunds should land in bank accounts by the first week of March if there are no other issues, Corbin said.
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I've been making deals from this building for -- for 50 years. ...and I love this building and wonderful landlord. And -- they keep the rent down for me. (LAUGHS) Well, I'm a happy guy here.
It's shocking that it happened so close to home, so all you can do is worry and think about your family, and that's all I've been doing, Xavier Lee, who lives two door down, told CBS affiliate WIAT-TV.
In a response to the findings, the IRS pointed to the delay in the tax filing deadline as one reason for the increase in interest payments. The agency must issue refunds within a 45-day window after the April 15 filing date, or else it owes interest on the refund. But the delay in the tax deadline meant the IRS had to pay interest going back to that April 15 filing date even though it had given taxpayers more time to file.
On Thursday, Mnuchin acknowledged that eliminating loopholes and deductions will finance only a portion of Mr. Trump's ambitious plan to overhaul the nation's tax code.
Here are a few other ideas for making good use of a tax refund:
Some Senate Democrats are urging President Joe Biden to overhaul the nation's approach to handing out stimulus payments, the direct financial relief deployed by Congress to help millions of Americans affected by the economic collapse that followed the coronavirus pandemic.
This legislation is likely to face intense lobbying from congressional members and special interests, which could affect the final price tag.
Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
It's tax time — here's when to expect your refund The IRS started processing tax returns this week. Here's when to look for your refund.
So I thought if I went to this opening -- I wore his -- the tie he gave me. And then, when I saw him, I started looking at his tie. And I said, You know, Jay, that is one good looking tie. And he said, Warren, he said, forget it, you only get one. (LAUGHS) ...but he is a very smart guy. And he's financially smart.
The deal will pay for itself, Mnuchin declared during a question-and-answer session at the Institute of International Finance's Washington Policy Summit. The secretary added, however, that the administration fundamentally believe[s] in dynamic scoring and will judge the proposal's impact on the deficit accordingly.
The executive action consists of a three-pronged strategy that includes the Buy American piece, streamlining regulations to allow for a quicker approval process for domestic products, and incentivizing new technologies. The goal of the order is to have a robust domestic production of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment on U.S. soil, Navarro said.
MARGARET TALEV: Yeah, this is part of, sort of, a larger effort by-- you know, by some Republican strategists to-- to try to paint the Democrats to the extremes because the battle is fought in the middle on these sorts of issues. It's much tougher for Donald Trump and his-- and-- and that segment of kind of the Republican ideological arm, whereas if you're talking not about a woman's right to choose but if you're talking about something that most Americans find extremely reprehensible. If you can redefine what it means to support abortion rights, you can redefine how you feel about Democratic candidates. And I think going to our other conversation, you know, the Trump base is demonstrably different than-- than the Democratic Party's base, which is why there is asymmetrical and there's two different standards for how you talk about racial issues or gender issues or-- or, you know, sort of anything in the spectrum that we have been talking about this morning.
These reforms do not 'sabotage' the ACA but rather provide a more efficient focus of tax-funded care to those in need, the report says. The council is a White House agency that advises the president.
Buffett says he likes owning roughly 15 percent of American Express' stock even though competitors are trying to develop a better way to process payments. Berkshire owns about a 9 percent stake in Coca-Cola Co.
No tax on your stimulus check — or that PPP loan
They might be able to save money through refinancing. Though, generally, if they have a high interest rate, they might be able to get a lower interest rate if their credit score has improved a lot since they borrowed the money. If they don't qualify for a lower rate on a private consolidation loan, they're unlikely to qualify for a home loan with a lower rate.
WARREN BUFFETT: (CHUCKLES) Charlie, America's not in decline. I mean I was born in 1930, just imagine that you had foreseen 25 percent unemployment, 4,000 banks closing, the Dow going, from the day I was born, from 250 down to 42? I mean all kinds of things, a world war coming on. But this country, it moves ahead.
Buffett also said his company does have a plan for when he's no longer at the helm, despite the 87-year-old's stance that he has never felt better.
WARREN BUFFETT: We have all kinds of things here... Let's start with some of the sports material. Here's Ted Williams in his first game as a Red Sox player against Holy Cross.
So, what is the tax gap?
SCOTT PELLEY: It was right here in this room, two weeks ago today, that you took the oath of office for the second time to begin your second term so let me ask you about the next four years. You have just raise tax rates on families that make more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year and above. Are you through raising tax rates?
MARGARET BRENNAN: The New York Times has new reporting out, and I'm sure you've seen the story, detailing how U.S. intelligence intercepted communications of the crown prince telling a top aide in 2017 that he would, quote, use a bullet on Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi if he did not return to the kingdom and end his criticism of the Saudi government. What was he talking about?
IRS may already be behind on refunds
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what is it that you need to see in order to get your vote and that of your caucus?
Pay down high interest rate debt. If you carry a balance on a credit card account, listen up. Interest rates are on the rise, and that means that your credit card debt will cost you more. The average rate on newly issued cards in 2018 has risen to 15.59 percent. When you pay down this debt, you'll also save money on interest and fees.
The first thing I wanna tell them is they get to see the results. They get to see what actually happened to me. I got a life sentence, Cooper said. And I wanna show them the stuff that they're chasing is all fools' gold.
They don't call me the Money King for no reason, Decoste said on one recorded call in which he told another person details of using stolen identities on tax forms.
Teachers can deduct $250 spent on teaching supplies from their income, provided their employer didn't reimburse those costs. That includes personal protective equipment.
The report comes as House Democrats under Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are moving to shore up the ACA, including trying to undo some of Trump's insurance changes. Although such a rollback seems unlikely to succeed under divided government, there has been bipartisan support for measures that would help reduce premiums and guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions. Restoring the ad budget for HealthCare.gov slashed by Mr. Trump is also a possibility.
He said he's witnessed a number of initiatives aimed at encouraging procreation, none of which have been effective.
Across its chain, Wegmans found that reusable bags account for only a fifth of all bags used. But a test Wegmans conducted in two stores in New York state found that customers opted to bring reusable bags when the company imposed a small fee for paper bags.
Jeremy Littlejohn moved his cloud computing start-up RISC Networks from Chicago to Asheville, NC, in 2012 for the less hectic pace, but has found the location a selling point as he grew from 6 to 33 employees.
REPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: I think that our reaction to the-- to these stories shows how seriously we take these allegations and-- and-- and conduct of our elected officials. You know, the good news is Democratic elected leadership-- Democratic leadership doesn't begin and end with the three men serving in elected office in Virginia right now in statewide office. We have a vast numbers (sic) of really talented, diverse, hardworking, capable leaders who are able to step up and fill the void that-- that will be left.
Manafort and Rick Gates, his former business associate, were indicted by a federal grand jury in late 2017. He was found guilty on five counts of tax fraud, one count of failing to disclose his foreign bank accounts and two counts of bank fraud, in August.
REPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: He is the subject of two extremely credible corroborated accusations of serious sexual assault. That's the situation we're looking at right now. It seems highly unlikely that these women would come forward and subject themselves to this kind of abuse if these allegations were not factual.
Had the Kushner Cos. disclosed those rent-regulated tenants, it could have triggered stricter oversight of construction crews by the city, including possibly unscheduled sweeps on site by inspectors to keep the company from harassing tenants and getting them to leave.
These figures suggest that for some workers -- particularly those with specialized and in-demand skill sets, who also tend to be older -- independent work really is one path to a more satisfying life. That's the line that many independent work platforms have been pushing for some time.
There's not some magic way to get an entire half a trillion dollars a year, Goldwein said.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) added Friday in a release, Not paying for tax reform is extremely misguided, would explode the federal deficit and end up harming long-term economic growth prospects.
The homes -- which cost less than a slice of pizza -- are enticing, but do come with strings attached.
Mr. Biden said he will detail specific vaccination procedure changes on Friday.
Contrary to Flexible Spending Accounts, in which you put aside pre-tax dollars and have to spend it all in a year or lose it, there is no yearly expiration for HSAs. The account is yours for good.
Shoppers at Wegmans Food Markets across New York are no longer carting their groceries home in plastic bags. Starting Monday, the grocery chain is ditching single-use plastic bags, with a statewide ban set to take effect March 1 in the Empire State.
But when you get to the heart of the matter, a refund is the result of overpaying income taxes during the year. Worse, you must file a tax return to ask the IRS to return your overpayment. When else do Americans gladly overpay for something and wait till the next year to get a refund?
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats will support the House bill. He had proposed his own phase-three deal worth $750 billion on Monday, but said Tuesday the final figure may have to be higher than $1 trillion.
SCOTT PELLEY: Thank you again sir. J.B. back to you in New Orleans.
Washington — As early as Tuesday, the Biden administration will begin asking dozens of U.S. attorneys across the country to resign, a senior Justice Department official tells CBS News' Clare Hymes. They will include most of the ones who were appointed by former President Trump, as the Biden administration moves to transition to its own nominees, The Associated Press says.
There were earlier versions that would have covered more people, but after extensive lobbying from big business and what conservatives wanted, this is where we ended up, Glynn said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The Democratic Party has really tried to stake out a moral high ground on issues of race, on issues of gender and sexual assault. Do you think these stories--three Democrats here--do you think that this has damaged the party?
This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the Special Counsel's Office is investigating, prosecutor Andrew Weissman said, according to the transcript, about Manafort continuing to work with Kilimnik on Ukrainian issues.
CHARLIE ROSE: Why Omaha for you?
Removing the tax penalty and opening up more affordable options was able to save taxpayer dollars, give families more choice, without destabilizing the exchanges, he said.
The new pause in the talks, which were originally scheduled for completion last October, will allow officials participating in the negotiations to attend an IMF meeting in Washington this week.
Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin with the chaos in Virginia's government and the scandals that have rocked the top three Democrats in the commonwealth, Governor Ralph Northam, Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax and Attorney General Mark Herring. CBS THIS MORNING co-host Gayle King has just returned from Richmond, Virginia, where she spoke to the governor in his only television interview.
JAMELLE BOUIE (The New York Times/@jbouie): I think there are a variety of issues, I mean, with Northam and Herring in particular, there is sort of the-- this larger national reckoning with racism that's ongoing. In some-- to some extent prompted by the President and the President's sort of use of-- of racialized rhetoric and-- and racist rhetoric over his term. And I think Democrats and Virginia Democrats nationally are seeking to kind of basic (INDISTINCT) of zero tolerance for anything like that to create a contrast by saying, in our party, if you have any sort of like whiff of racism in your past or present, that kind of renders you radioactive for-- for the rest of the party. And so, I think that is kind of what is driving this. I think also there is just the element of-- it's-- it feels so old-fashioned, and I think just talking to people who are not Virginians, even talking to Virginians, sort shocked that in 2019 an entire state is facing controversies over blackface, a thing that I think many observers would have thought is in-- in our past or at least recognized as being unacceptable. And so, I think that the shock and surprise of just the circumstances of the controversy, plus the-- the way it resonates in our current national politics has come to driving a lot of-- a lot of the attention.
MARGARET TALEV: --next election cycle also.
We have seen over the last few weeks the way that the city has rallied around public education, and quite frankly it's been breathtaking; it's been inspiring to see, Garcetti said agt the news conference, CBS L.A. notes.
Fundraising for the Trump campaign remained strong through the impeachment process. The campaign raised $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The executive action is expected soon — Navarro says it will be done in Trump time, meaning as soon as possible.
ED O'KEEFE: --and trying to tackle issues like that over next three years. People need to remember outside of Virginia, they only get elected to one term as governor, so he's a lame duck immediately. So, if he stay, he stays and there's no political retribution for him, but there clearly could be for his party. And I think it's-- it's still an open question as to whether Democrats are really going to tolerate him being in office for the next three years. There are legislative elections later this year. Mark Warner, the senior Senator is up for reelection next year while it's also a presidential year and the thirteen electoral votes in Virginia are ones both parties desperately want. And if these guys are still around, all three of them, even just one or two of them, it could be radioactive for Democrats.
The American Rescue Plan is broadly popular among Americans, earning support from Republican voters as well as Democrats and independents. A poll by Morning Consult/Politico released on Thursday shows that 76% of Americans support the package, including 60% of Republicans.
The deal was broadly described by officials at the news conference as including a 6 percent pay hike and a commitment to reduce class sizes over four years.
Globalization hit both the north and the south hard. Between 2000 and 2010 each lost about a third of their manufacturing jobs. But employment rebounded faster and more broadly in the south. Between 2000 and 2015, combined private sector employment in nine southern and gulf coast states still grew 13.5 percent.
REPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: I'm withholding judgment.
GAYLE KING: --his use of blackface. He said it was because it was Halloween and he was dressed up as his favorite-- one of his favorite rappers, Kurtis Blow.
In the south, business executives and development officials interviewed by Reuters were less likely to call for new tariffs and trade deals than to worry about how any new regime may disrupt a system they have learned to work with.
WARREN BUFFETT: This is Tiger Woods over -- I caddied for him some years ago down at Isleworth. He was a terrific -- he's a terrific student. I mean he -- (CHUCKLES) picked up all kinds of things from the tips I gave him as I caddied. And...
GAYLE KING: And why you think you still deserve this job when so many people are calling for you to step down?
Buyers must make a €5,000 (or $5,682) security deposit and commit to spending upwards of €15,000 (about $17,000) to revamp them within three years. The security deposit will be returned once the renovations are complete, CNN reported.
I really do believe we have God on our side. I believe that, I believe that, the president said from the stage.
JONAH GOLDBERG: No. I mean, I-- like I--
All of a sudden, there was drilling, drilling. ... You heard the drilling in the middle of night, said one of the rent-regulated tenants, Mary Ann Siwek, 67, who lives on Social Security payments and odd jobs. There were rats coming in from the abandoned building next door. The hallways were always filled with lumber and sawdust and plaster.
MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think, though, about-- what this has sparked in terms of a national conversation? I mean, this is a state that has a long-troubled history with race. It was the capital of the Confederacy.
The data are puzzling to some, since many other measures indicate that freelance and on-demand work has exploded since 2005. Some studies by gig-economy platforms put the portion of so-called independent workers at a third or more of the workforce.
REPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: I do. And-- and I think that just the-- the great confusion last weekend where he wasn't sure whether he was in the Klan robe or the blackface, has just sacrificed so much of his credibility and his ability to lead. You know, I know he's determined to go on this reconciliation tour but I think he should do that as a private citizen, rather than as the governor.
It's true, workers want flexibility, she added. But they also want basic security and the right to health care and retirement, and they shouldn't be forced to choose.
Whether the rust belt's expectations are met will be central to 2018 U.S. mid-term elections and likely frame the presidential race in 2020. The southern states are reliably Republican, but the party's ability to repeat its success in Midwestern swing states, such as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, may hinge on whether the Trump administration delivers on its economic promises.
This is not just for teachers. It's also for counselors, nurses, psychologists and social workers, said O'Brien, who teaches 10th grade English.
LARA LOGAN: Can you take us into your office, Warren?
And there is a way for us to solve these budget problems in a responsible way. Through a balanced approach that the vast majority of people agree with. If we do that, there's no reason why we can't have really strong growth in 2013. But you know, we can't have Washington dysfunction getting in the way.
The bill also would expand the Child Tax Credit and transform it from an annual break claimed on tax returns — and which typically shows up in people's annual refunds — into a monthly payment. Under the plan, the tax credit would rise from $2,000 to $3,600 for children up to 6 years old and to $3,000 for children up to age 17. The IRS would pay the tax credit in monthly installments. That means that a family with two children under 6 could receive monthly checks of $600 from the IRS, for example.
The lawsuit came on the same day Depp finalized his divorce from actress Amber Heard. Their divorce judgment calls for the actor to pay his ex-wife $7 million in installments -- which she has earmarked for two charities -- while allowing him to keep numerous properties and vehicles.
These are considered the two most valuable tax credits for low- and moderate-income working families. A family of four earning up to $53,000 can claim the EITC, while the CTC is applicable to families making as much as $400,000.
JAMELLE BOUIE: Just also on that point, I think there is something in terms of public perception in the fact that we were referencing a woke primary. I think the term, Woke, gets to it, which is that there is a sense-- a broad sense that talking about race and racism, talking about identity, it's somehow opportunistic, is somehow not quite sincere in that. On the other end, President Trump sort of like open use of racist language, regardless of what people think about it, reads as somehow more authentic. And I think that there is-- there is a-- there is a-- I'm not saying that it is authentic, but that there is like this Archie Bunker quality to it that I think people are willing to look--
CHARLIE ROSE: There's hope for you yet. ...The phone seems to be the principle instrument there.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: There is no doubt we need additional revenue, coupled with smart spending reductions in order to bring down our deficit. And we can do it in a gradual way so that it doesn't have a huge impact. And as I said, when you look at some of these deductions that certain folks are able to take advantage of, the average person can't take advantage of-- the average person doesn't have access to Cayman Island accounts. The average person doesn't have access to carried interest income where they end up paying a much lower rate on billions of dollars that they've earned.
This bill benefits our essential workers and our community as a whole, he said.
GAYLE KING: In this state, yeah. Did you ever think about resigning when the drumbeat became so loud and, by the way, there was still beating for you to step down?
MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry I mu-- muddled your name there. You heard the conversation we just had with Congresswoman Wexton and with Gayle King. Do you agree? Do you think that the governor still needs to step down?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well because I think that, you know, my attitude is that gays and lesbians should have access and-- and opportunity the same way everybody else does in every institution and walk of life. And, you know the Scouts are a great institution that are promoting young people and exposing them to, you know, opportunities and-- and leadership that you know will serve people for the rest of their lives. And I think that nobody should be barred for that.
On Facebook, West posted lots of selfies and commenters often mentioned her attractiveness. But there were also photos of her wedding to longtime husband William Jeffrey West and images of West and her daughter playing in the snow last month.
Los Angeles -- Teachers overwhelmingly approved a new contract Tuesday and planned to return to the classroom after a six-day strike over funding and staffing in the nation's second-largest school district.
For that reason, Medows tell clients claiming the credit to file as early as possible.
Variable annuities are often the investment that brokers recommend for people's retirement accounts, especially when they're retiring or leaving a company and roll over their employer-based 401(k) account into an individual retirement account, or IRAs.
CHARLIE ROSE: You know, there's a lot of talk about America, and whether America's in decline. We've had -- the president mentioned it in his State of the Union address. You feel good and optimistic about America and its future?
Mnuchin echoed that point on Tuesday, saying concerns over the price tag for a stimulus bill are secondary.
CHARLIE ROSE: So no desire to have lots of, a lot of mansions around the world, a big boat -- all those things that your wealth would allow you to do?
Seasonal changes could also be a factor: The previous survey was conducted in February, while the one released Thursday was conducted in May 2017.
Judith Adams, vice president at the Alabama State Port Authority, speeds visitors through warehouses of wood fiber products, steel ingots and other goods ready to ship abroad. The port is spending $47 million to boost its capacity to 500,000 containers a year from 300,000. The longer-term the goal is to triple that to 1.5 million.
The measure is a huge, huge first step, said Kathleen Romig, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Millions of people are going to get some paid time off that they would not have otherwise, and employers are getting a big government subsidy.
The rules in the Senate have been really put there to preserve the power of the minority, Jayapal said. Now we have to show that it's going to make a difference that we're not going to get caught up in the tyranny of the minority that exists in the Senate.
Tax records show those rent-regulated units that numbered as many as 94 when Kushner took over fell to 25 by 2016.
The deal came as teachers in Denver voted to go on strike as soon as next Monday. More than 5,000 educators would be affected. The main sticking point is increasing base pay and lessening teachers' reliance on one-time bonuses for having students with high test scores or working in a high-poverty school.
Since a rule change in 2015, the Congressional Budget Office has gauged the cost of various proposals using two distinct methods: traditional scoring and dynamic scoring. The traditional scoring method looks only at the text of legislation to determine its impact on the deficit -- specifically, the money a bill proposes to spend, and the methods the bill proposes to pay for it. The dynamic scoring method, by contrast, adds to that calculation an estimate of the bill's impact on the broader economy.
Joining us now is Scott Pelley, the anchor and managing editor of the CBS Evening News who is live with President Barack Obama at the White House. Scott?
MARGARET BRENNAN: This has really resonated around the country.
Mr. Trump's ability to influence a company's stock prices with a single tweet is no secret -- just ask companies like Boeing, Ford, Toyota or Macy's. All it takes are 140 characters for him to move markets in a big way.
The posts continued until the morning before her death, when West tweeted a link to sell a women's wool jacket. A few days earlier, she had posted a lingerie photo showing her bare buttocks that linked to her adult site.
Four GOP members of Congress — Senator Ted Cruz and Congressmen Matt Gaetz, Paul Gosar and Doug Collins — are quarantining themselves after learning they had contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, or coronavirus, at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington last month.
Contribute to a health savings account. If you have a health insurance plan with a high deductible, you can open an HSA. These accounts allow pretax contributions, which grow tax deferred. And withdrawals used to pay qualifying medical expenses are tax-free. The 2018 HSA contribution limit is $3,450 for individuals and $6.900 for families (those 55 and older can contribute an additional $1,000).
There is no evidence that broad-based tax cuts can pay for themselves completely, and economic studies from across the spectrum have found that deficit-financed tax cuts only pay for a fraction of their cost, the CFRB said in a blog post. Even if tax cuts could generate more growth than estimated, no plausible amount of economic growth would be able to pay for the tax plan, let alone reduce deficits.
But the strike is a lingering worry for those still planning summer vacations.
We won't tolerate landlords who use construction to harass tenants - no matter who they are, spokesman Joseph Soldevere said.
GAYLE KING: I know he needs to make it, but what do you think? Do you think he--
The federal loan program has a surprising number of generous provisions if you're sick, disabled or can't pay back your loan. Federal student loans offer significant benefits that aren't standard with mortgages, such as death and disability discharges, economic hardship deferments, forbearances, income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness options, said Kantrowitz. The tax treatment may be less favorable. The traditional wisdom over the years has been to favor mortgage debt over other kinds of credit because home-related debt is tax deductible. However, Kantrowitz pointed out: There's a deduction for mortgage interest, but you must itemize (most taxpayers don't). The student loan interest deduction, on the other hand, lets you deduct up to $2,500 in interest on federal and private student loans. It's an 'above-the-line' exclusion from income, so you can claim it even if you don't itemize. It also reduces the [adjusted gross income], which may have other benefits.
But issues such as higher preparation costs and even more delays may come hand-in-hand with putting off tax preparation until the last minute. Because the workload intensifies leading up to the filing deadline -- which is April 18 this year -- some certified public accountants will ask their procrastinating clients to file a tax extension. Consumers relying on tax software programs or online filing will face higher costs than if they had filed earlier in the season.
Mr. Biden in his American Rescue plan, calls for an additional $1,400 in stimulus checks for Americans, on top of the $600 that's already been approved, bringing the total stimulus to $2,000. Other financial aid includes expanding unemployment insurance by $100, bringing the weekly total to $400, and increasing the child tax credit to $3,000 per child.
The president addressed the recent attack on Jews in New York, condemning anti-Semitism and insisting his administration will continue to stand up for Israel.
For almost two decades, presidents have often sat for interviews airing the Sunday of the Super Bowl. For CBS News, Scott Pelley sat down with then-President Barack Obama before the Super Bowl on Feb. 3, 2013.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Jamelle Bouie is a CBS News political analyst and is now a columnist with The New York Times. Jonah Goldberg is the senior editor for the National Review. Margaret Talev is a senior White House Correspondent for Bloomberg News. And we have our own political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Ed, it's good to have you here. I know you've been in Richmond for like ten days now--
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, a friend gave it to me. And - and -- and it's got -- you know, it's got a bunch of my boyhood heroes, and they're still my heroes -- on there.
President-elect Donald Trump has no intention of giving up his Twitter account when he takes office, and the so-called Tweeter-in-chief said the followers should expect more posts.
A day after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin suggested economic growth could pay for a majority of President Trump's tax reform proposal, debt hawks are sounding the alarm, warning that any tax overhaul must not add to the federal deficit.
It will be considered by the Senate next week, although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cautioned that Republican senators will have to thoroughly read the 110-page bill before bringing it to a vote.
With many unemployed workers potentially facing a smaller credit this year or even owing taxes, Congress adjusted the eligibility criteria for the EITC and CTC as part of a December pandemic relief package, allowing taxpayers to use their 2019 income to qualify for these credits.
Rep. Walter Jones, R-North Carolina, poses for a portrait in his office on Capitol Hill, on Wed., Oct. 25, 2017, in Washington. AP
JAMELLE BOUIE: So I-- I don't think it's tactics because I-- I do think there's-- there's substance here, right? The-- the Northam yearbook photo is genuinely shocking. It is genuinely shocking to see someone dressed up as a Sambo next to someone dressed up as a Klansman, two things that evoke very painful history and a painful like you see in this country that affects people living today, people alive, people I've spoken to and living, you know, quite recently have experienced these things. And so, I think-- I think the substance is important. I don't think-- I think trying to-- I think Democrats in Virginia and Democrats natural-- nationally are trying to reconcile the-- the fact that there is a substance here with these emerging political standards, with sort of like, yes, the tactical stuff. But I don't think this is a pure, like immoral power politics. I think I'll also add that-- and I think, Margaret, you made a really good point tying this to 2020 that there already has been-- there already are signs the Democrats are looking for my diverse candidates or looking for candidates who are sort of-- aren't tied to legacies of the politics or the '90s and the '80s. And I do think this very much kind of makes that even more solid and in-- in a weird way, even though, you know, I'm reasonably sure Joe Biden has nothing like this in the past. It may-- it may cripple Joe Biden's attempt to run.
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it grew out of the fact that, when I was in my 20s, my wife and I decided, after we took care of ourselves and our family reasonably well, that we would probably have a lot of money left over. And the original idea was that I would pile it up, and then some day, she'd unpile it -- (LAUGHS) for philanthropy.
WARREN BUFFETT: It encompasses the idea that people who are extremely rich, who have benefited enormously from this society, should have a tax rate...that's at least as high as the people that work for them. And the people of this office averaged 36 percent.
The new contract also eliminates a longstanding clause that gave the district authority over class sizes, officials said. Grades 4 through 12 would be reduced by one student during each of the next two school years and two pupils in 2021-22.
If it's just pure tax cuts and no revenue-raising provisions, we don't predict that any tax cut will pay for itself. There's just no federal tax that's bad enough to raise sufficient revenue by eliminating it, explained Alan Cole, an economist with the conservative Tax Foundation. It means you're punting on the question of how the revenue will eventually be raised to pay for this.
Many people jumped into the stock market for the first time in 2020 — that might entail new tax obligations.
White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland told reporters Monday that the price tag of any such measure was no issue for the president.
They also accused Barkat of surprising them with the order and violating longstanding understandings with the churches. Barkat's office claimed the churches have debts of roughly $185 million.
GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Well, again, I want the truth to come out. I-- I certainly support an investigation. And again, these accusation-- accusations are very serious. And we need to get to the bottom of them.
A spokesperson for Spanberger also said the congresswoman is actively working to include the provisions of the bill in the upcoming COVID relief package proposed by the White House that is working its way through the House and Senate.
Economists and industrial site consultants say the reasons behind the trend have moved beyond lower wages and lower levels of unionization. Per capita income in the south has now almost caught up with that in the Midwest, and its skilled workforce continues to grow as college graduates move in.
She should be no older than 16 at the end of the tax year
The report looks at three big changes under Mr. Trump that affect former President Barack Obama's health care law. They are congressional repeal of the law's unpopular fines on people who go uninsured, association health plans for small businesses that can be marketed across state lines, and low-cost short-term health insurance that doesn't have to cover pre-existing conditions or basic benefits like prescription drugs.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The final push to eliminate ISIS forces from Syria has begun. CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata filed this report from the front lines.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a press conference on Capitol Hill that senators will first vote on an earlier aid package that passed the House over the weekend before moving on to a much larger phase three deal outlined by administration officials just hours before.
Labor? Perceived advantages. Taxes? Some of these are fairly low (tax) states. Real estate? For big projects that are going to employ three, four, five thousand people, you can find free land - zero cost land, said Darin Buelow, an industrial site specialist with Deloitte Consulting.
It was like memories lost. Like, I would see my friends have their dad there and they would pick them up and I didn't have that memory with my dad, his daughter, Scotlyn, said.
WARREN BUFFETT: And - and -- and your viewers are gonna get very confused about which one of us you're interviewing unless you make it perfectly clear. (LAUGHS)
GAYLE KING: Of slavery in this country?
If your dependent is 17 or older
Since 2010, the IRS has faced every tax season with fewer and fewer staff. This year, just over 70,000 permanent agency employees are on hand for a projected 155 million tax returns.
More than 20 million Americans currently have these accounts, which allow people with high-deductible health plans - above $1,300 for an individual or $2,600 for a family - to put aside money for out-of-pocket medical expenses and save leftover funds for future expenses.
Those who don't bring or buy their own reusable sacks can pay five cents apiece for paper bags, with any profits donated to local food pantries, according to the 101-store Wegmans chain, which also operates in neighboring Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Massachusetts as well as Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina.
That would be huge, if somehow we could get that, we would have barely any budget deficit this year, Goldwein said.
Population in the rust belt grew 13 percent, to 63 million, over the same period. When the Minnesota-based Polaris Industries Inc. began planning a new facility for its line of outdoor vehicles, there was no Minnesota play, said Eric Blackwell, director of operations at the company's new factory outside Huntsville.
The idea of issuing recurring stimulus payments as a way to speed up the economic recovery has been championed by progressives and some Democrats. In January, more than 50 House members urged the Biden administration to back a proposal for $2,000 monthly payments until the pandemic ends.
The Florida Supreme Court's decision is disappointing and cuts the 1.4 million people who voters expressly intended to re-enfranchise almost in half, said Nancy Abudu, the Southern Poverty Law Center's deputy legal director. By holding Floridians' right to vote hostage, the Florida Supreme Court is permitting the unconstitutional modern-day poll tax in SB 7066, and redefining an amendment nearly 65 percent of Florida voters approved of in 2018.
The president has instructed his team to look very expansively at what we need to do and not be impeded by the potential price tag of what's necessary here, Ueland said.
This is a good agreement. It is a historic agreement, Garcetti said.
The rust belt by contrast saw a net outflow of more than 400,000 residents with college degrees between 2007 and 2014. The customers are heading south too. From 1990 to 2015, population in the nine southern and gulf states grew 43 percent, to more than 76 million, and passed that of the rust belt states in the late 1990s.
A knock on the door came a few weeks later, and an offer of at least $10,000 if she agreed to leave the building.
There is a lack of tools to go after landlords who harass tenants, and there is a lack of enforcement, said Seth Miller, a real estate lawyer who used to work at a state housing agency overseeing rent regulations. Until officials inspect every construction site, you're going to have this incentive for landlords to make life uncomfortable for tenants.
WARREN BUFFETT: OK, let's take a look.
But global interest in the newly listed Sambucan homes suggests the tactic is already working.
Buffett's yearly missive included an explanation of Berkshire's 2017 results, which included the conglomerate tallying a more than $29 billion gain for 2017 due to the tax overhaul passed by Congress late last year. The gain, which was mildly offset by $1.4 billion in taxes paid on repatriated foreign earnings, made up almost two-thirds of Berkshire's $44.9 billion in net earnings for the year.
Unfortunately, unless you have a business, you can't, said Alicia Jegede, a CPA in Brooklyn, New York, and founder of New Gen Financial Planning.
The Witch Hunt is sputtering badly, but still going on (Ukraine Hoax!), the president tweeted Thursday morning. If this...had happened to a Presidential candidate, or President, who was a Democrat, everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason (and more), and it would be considered the CRIME OF THE CENTURY, far bigger and more sinister than Watergate!
ISIS is cornered now. Territory once bigger than Indiana now reduced to a strip of land no larger than Central Park, and unlike every other battle here, this time there is no escape. There is nowhere left to run.
The Justice Department has been investigating the finances of Hunter Biden, including scrutinizing some of his Chinese business dealings and other transactions. The tax investigation was launched in 2018, the year before the elder Biden announced his candidacy for president, two sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News. Hunter Biden confirmed the existence of the investigation in December after a round of subpoenas was issued in the case.
Now a clue has emerged as to how President Trump's son-in-law's firm was able to move so fast: The Kushner Cos. routinely filed false paperwork with the city declaring it had zero rent-regulated tenants in dozens of buildings it owned across the city when, in fact, it had hundreds.
This is a little bit like a hurricane, and we need to cover these [costs] outside the normal expenses, he said.
Prashant Yadav, a visiting fellow at the Center for Global Development whose expertise is in global health supply chains, said such a possible executive order comes down to how it's implemented. The pharmaceutical industry should be encouraged to increase their resilience, meaning they should be encouraged to have more bandwidth to manufacture drugs on U.S. soil.
He was planning a very major attack, and we got him, the president told a supportive audience.
Separately, U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was appointed in October by then-Attorney General William Barr as a special counsel to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe, will remain in that capacity, the senior Justice Department official told Hymes, but Durham is expected to resign from his other position as the U.S. attorney in Connecticut.
The report also highlighted another factor: a pileup in paper returns that IRS personnel struggled to process after the pandemic shut down its offices and workers shifted to remote work.
JERUSALEM -- The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem reopened early on Wednesday after Israeli officials suspended a plan to impose taxes on church properties in the holy city. The iconic church, revered by Christians as the site of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, had been closed for three days to protest the Israeli tax plan.
It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons -- among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals -- to measure their investment 'risk' by their portfolio's ratio of bonds to stocks, Buffett wrote. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk.
A quick reminder of the difference between tax credits and tax deductions: Credit reduces the amount you owe in taxes dollar-for-dollar, making them generally more valuable than deductions. A deduction reduces the amount of your income on which you have to pay taxes, so its value to you will depend on what tax bracket you fall into.
That brings me to another point, which is, in such a scarce capacity scenario, we also worry about the limited supply is going to be sucked up by what we need in the U.S. and what we need in Europe, and in such a scenario, what happens to a country in Africa which is also ... trying to buy ventilators, Yadav said.
Procrastinators live among us, given that about 20 percent of taxpayers wait until the last two weeks of the tax season to file their returns. The majority of Americans tend to file early because of the anticipation of receiving their tax refund, said Lisa Greene-Lewis, CPA and tax expert at TurboTax. Others, however, may have complicated tax issues or late-arriving tax forms that delay their ability to file, while some might simply put it off because they are worried or confused about the process.
Those who are saving and investing are doing better - they have an average balance of $14,971, seven times larger than those who do not invest.
It's like to have my dad home; it's like a relief. Like it's like, I was when he was in jail, it was like I was missing a part of him. It's like a piece of me is back, his daughter, Cleer, said.
The transition process, which happens routinely between administrations, is expected to take weeks and would apply to a few dozen U.S. attorneys who were appointed by Mr. Trump and confirmed by the Senate. Many of the federal prosecutors who were nominated by Mr. Trump have already left their positions, some in recent weeks.
Clashes over pay, class sizes and support-staff levels in the district with 640,000 students led to its first strike in 30 years and prompted the staffing of classrooms with substitute teachers and administrators.
Even so, some elements of the American Rescue Plan could provide a similar form of ongoing relief to some households. First, it would direct an extra $400 per week to unemployed Americans, up from $300, which would be helpful to jobless workers and their families but wouldn't help those who are struggling with cut hours or other income losses.
Make extra mortgage payments. Finally, think about adding extra principal to your monthly mortgage payments. By making the equivalent of just one additional monthly payment on a 30-year mortgage each year, you can pay off that loan in about 18 years instead -- and save thousands of dollars in interest over that time.
That's the sad thing about it, another neighbor told WIAT-TV. You've got a little girl that's not gonna have her mother anymore.
REPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: --governor for the people of the commonwealth. I don't-- I don't think the governor is that selfish at the end of the day.
GAYLE KING: Calls for him to resign, as well.
Initially, West just tweeted links to a site where she sold clothing items, including dresses, coats, shoes and kid's clothing. The feed took a sharp turn Aug. 11, when she tweeted: Happy Frisky Friday - Let's get this party started, with a link to the pay-per-view site. The description included a link to a wish list page where viewers could purchase lingerie for her.
Goldman Sachs estimates people could end up owing as much as $50 billion in taxes on unemployment insurance benefits they got last year — as layoffs soared during the coronavirus pandemic — come the April 15 tax filing deadline. That could wipe out many taxpayers' refunds and even dent the economy.
SCOTT PELLEY: Thanks J.B. We're in the Blue Room of the White House. Mr. President, very kind of you to take the time. Thank you very much.
There's just no way, Greff said. It is all based on speculation, conjecture and possibilities.
The one exception to the low-rate student rate offerings are PLUS loans, which parents usually take out, pegged at 6.31 percent for this academic year. Note to parents: Avoid these loans at all cost.
Employees of companies with fewer than 500 employees and government staffers may take up to 12 weeks of protected family and medical leave, including two weeks at full pay, with any additional weeks taken with no less than two-thirds of the employee's usual pay, to either quarantine or seek preventative care. Small and mid-sized businesses would receive tax credits to pay for medical and family leave of up to 100% of the wages they pay out. Employers with fewer than 500 employees are required to provide two weeks of sick leave at full pay for employees who are seeking treatment for the virus. Self-employed individuals would also receive tax credits to receive paid leave. Workers would be eligible for paid sick leave if they have a child whose school or childcare facility is closed due to the coronavirus. These employees are required to receive not less than two-thirds of their regular pay. Unemployment insurance: States will receive additional funding to provide unemployment insurance should there be an increase in uninsured people.
Buffett in the past has repeatedly called on Congress to raise taxes on the wealthy, saying people like him should be paying more. He refrained from revisiting that call in his yearly update.
GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: --right now, Virginia needs someone that can heal. There's no better person to do that than a doctor. Virginia also needs someone who is strong, who has empathy, who has courage and who has a moral compass. And that's why I'm not going anywhere. I have learned from this. I have a lot more to learn. But we're in a unique opportunity now. Again the four hundred year anniversary of-- of the history whether it be good or bad in Virginia to really make some impactful changes--
MARGARET BRENNAN: Two of your Democratic colleagues, Senator Warner and Congressman Scott have-- have sort of hedged their criticisms saying if true. Is there a possibility that Justin Fairfax is unfairly accused here?
Instead of providing discrete rounds of stimulus checks that are negotiated each time and arrive months apart, the federal government should provide recurring checks to help families get by until COVID-19 is over, the 10 lawmakers said in a letter released on Tuesday.
The specific amendment's wording, all terms of sentence, quickly became a flashpoint in the state. In June 2019, DeSantis signed S.B. 7066, requiring all financial obligations be paid off before a convicted felon can vote.
ED O'KEEFE: I-- you know, clearly, he's bound and determined to stay. And there is some evidence this morning that Virginians, at least half of them, may be okay with that. What I thought was interesting though is that he still clearly hasn't come up with some specific plan on how to move forward other than he mentioned, and I don't believe we aired this part, but he talks later about concerns of infant mortality in the state--
I still haven't gotten rid of them.
CHARLIE ROSE: Thank you very much. Warren. Great to see you ...
But labor advocates note that work satisfaction isn't incompatible with traditional employment. Full-time freelancers who eschew nine-to-five employment are often giving up much more than a portion of their pay.
For America to thrive in the 21st century, we must renew faith and family as the center of American life, the president told the crowd.
This president wants to bring our jobs home. This is especially important when our national defense and public health are at risk, Navarro said.
When we first visited the front lines a few weeks ago right beside local soldiers launching a barrage of mortars, we found some of the two thousand American troops who had been at the forefront of this fight. Their Kurdish allies have suffered grave losses, more than eight thousand fighters. They now worry the end of ISIS as a territorial force will hasten the withdrawal of U.S. troops they desperately rely on for advice, artillery, and especially air power.
That's according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office, which assessed the IRS' performance last year during the coronavirus pandemic and outlined some risks to the 2021 tax season. The reason for the surge in interest payments due to late refunds is tied to the coronavirus outbreak, which caused a backlog of paper tax returns and prompted the IRS to delay the tax filing season by three months.
It was noisy, there were complaints, I got mice, said mailman Rudolph Romano, adding that he also bristled at a 60 percent rent increase, a hike the Kushner Cos. contends was initiated by the previous landord. They cleaned the place out. I watched the whole building leave.
Health-care providers and emergency responders — along with workers who had been in quarantine or caring for a family member with the virus — would not be eligible for the additional 10 weeks of paid leave.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.-- A man described by a Florida federal judge as the boss of a $100 million-plus fraud factory that used thousands of stolen identities to illegally obtain income tax refunds was sentenced Thursday to nearly 20 years in prison.
David Fiorenza, who teaches urban economics at Villanova University, said local and state governments will start to notice a hit to their sales tax revenue if the strike lingers. And if hotel stays decrease, less revenue will come in from the local hotel tax.
Mr. Biden's proposal to eliminate $10,000 of student loan debt is not included in this plan, but an incoming senior Biden official said during a press briefing that he still supports this idea and reiterated the Biden administration's plan to continue the pause on student loan payments.
Indeed, the IRS — which was still processing 6.7 million returns at the end of January — has advice for taxpayers in the current tax season: Use e-file.
Finally, to assist struggling businesses, Mr. Biden is asking for $15 billion dollars to go directly to 1 million small businesses. He also wants to increase loans to businesses in need. Community transportation, tribal communities, and technology investments are also included in the bill.
Klaassen said some companies may profit.
The next question is: What to do with your tax refund?
District Superintendent Austin Beutner said he was delighted the deal was reached. But he stressed that financial challenges remained.
Some 300 miles north in Huntsville, new businesses sprout in farm fields drawn by readily available land, low taxes, flexible labor rules and improving infrastructure. As President Trump faces pressure to deliver on his promise to revive manufacturing in the northern rust belt states that put him in the White House, his biggest challenge may not be Mexico or China, but the southern U.S. states that form the other pillar of his political base.
If you're gonna talk about shared sacrifice -- we have not had an ounce of shared sacrifice from the very rich.
This child doesn't have their mother anymore. Don't know why, don't know what happened, that led up to the incident, but to wake up to that news, it makes you think, Lee said.
REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I've-- I've heard that reported honestly when you look at zero to 5.7, somewhere in the mi-- middle would be, you know, a two-billion to three-billion-dollar range. But it's not as much just the dollar amount. It's the flexibility and how to spend it. I think what Democrats are trying to do is say you can spend it here, you can't spend it there. And really the experts should be the ones deciding how we spend it.
We're looking at sending checks to Americans immediately, Mnuchin said. We have to do this now.
The Internal Revenue Service expects taxpayers to pay their taxes on time — and it also holds itself accountable for sending out late tax refunds. Last year, the agency sent out $3 billion in interest to taxpayers whose refunds were delayed, up 50% from the prior year.
And we have someone on set to do just that. Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton, who represents Northern Virginia in Congress. Congresswoman, I-- I know you know Governor Northam.
I believe we have a moral obligation, Mr. Biden said in a speech on Thursday night from Wilmington, Delaware. In this pandemic in America, we cannot let people go hungry, we cannot let people get evicted, we cannot watch nurses, educators and others lose their jobs, we so badly need them. We must act now, and we must act decisively.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're withholding judgment?
The hearing focused on whether Manafort breached his plea agreement by lying to investigators, including about his meetings with Konstantin Kilimnik, who is suspected of having ties to Russian intelligence. Prosecutors allege Manafort was talking about a redacted issue related to Ukraine as late as 2018.
Moved for work? You may owe in multiple states
Over the past decade, the much-vaunted freelance economy has spawned dozens of platforms designed to help people launch their unrealized dreams of independent work: from TaskRabbit to Fiverr to Upwork to Handy to the much-maligned Uber, to name just a handful.
Although previous coronavirus relief bills have passed with bipartisan support, the bill had been expected to pass in the House along party lines, as Republicans have criticized the high price tag and the inclusion of provisions they see as unrelated to the crisis.
GAYLE KING (CBS THIS MORNING/CBS THIS MORNING Co-Host/@GayleKing): I know this has been a very difficult week for you in the state of Virginia. So where would you like to begin?
REPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Yes it should. And I think that's one of the differences between Governor Northam and Attorney General Herring. They both made dumb mistakes as young men. Governor Herring though, or Lieutenant Attorney General rather, has been incredibly remorseful, very simple, took it very responsibly. The way our-- my-- Governor Northam handled the first couple of days was confusing, even bizarre. And he's also in a different role. The attorney general is-- runs the state's largest law firm, whereas the governor really has to be the role model for more than eight million people.
State and local governments around the country are also facing major budget shortfalls because of the declining tax revenues and the costs they have incurred to fight the pandemic. But they've been largely left out of COVID relief efforts — including the $900 billion package passed in December — because of Republican opposition.
The best way to ensure adequate investment is to provide a stable, strong, long-term demand domestically for these products, Navarro said.
The IRS last year extended the tax deadline for all U.S. taxpayers due to the coronavirus pandemic, although this year it plans to keep its regular April 15 deadline for 2020 tax returns. With about 29 million residents, Texans represent almost 9% of the U.S. population, which means about 1 in 10 taxpayers will get an extension on their taxes this year.
WASHINGTON—Borrowing a word from Democrats, a new White House report says changes made to the Affordable Care Act under President Trump didn't amount to sabotage.
Jones, whose health had deteriorated after he fell and broke his hip, had been in hospice care since late January.
CHARLIE ROSE: My goodness, look at this.
OMAHA, Neb. - Investor Warren Buffett says he would be willing to sell Berkshire Hathaway's big investments in American Express, Coca-Cola and other companies if he found a significantly better option, but he still believes in those companies.
Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said the meetings in Athens would resume April 18, with an aim to reaching an agreement by April 22, when he is due to meet with his peers from the 19-country eurozone.
Most people like getting that financial boost, and when considering the opposite, who would disagree?
Collins shook hands with Mr. Trump last week and visited the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta with him.
Raising the minimum wage is widely popular, with a 2019 poll by the Pew Research Center showing that 67% of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15. It even has support in some red states, as demonstrated by a ballot initiative in Florida to increase the minimum wage increase to $15 by 2026 which passed with support from more than 60% of voters in the last election.
The country has depended on rescue loans since 2010 and signed up to a third bailout last summer after the government ditched its anti-bailout policies to prevent a disastrous Greek exit from the eurozone.
But research shows not many participants are actually saving money beyond the initial tax break.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, have the-- we're talking about this as if these politics of race should have a cost to them.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:
MARGARET BRENNAN: The Wall Street Journal editorial board put it this way. It says Democrats believe they must sacrifice Mister Northam to preserve the sword they have made of racial politics for routine use against Republicans. Racism has become the default charge for any GOP policy they dislike on crime, immigration, education, the environment, you name it. The argument is this is tactics. Not true.
For the three Queens buildings in the borough's Astoria neighborhood, the Kushner Cos. checked a box on construction permit applications in 2015 that indicated the buildings had zero rent-regulated tenants. Tax records filed a few months later showed the company inherited as many as 94 rent-regulated units from the previous owner.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Attorney General Herring who you just brought up also admitted to having worn blackface at one point. If he resigns, the next in line is a Republican.
REPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Well, his situation is different and I judge each situation on its merits. The attorney general came forward proactively, is very regretful and contrite. He reached out to all the African-American leaders and-- and other leaders, very heartfelt anguish about what he had done. But he's got a lot of work to do to regain the trust of the people of Virginia.
Mulvaney said there are two reasons for the tax gap -- people either don't want to pay, which is always a problem, or filing out the form is just too hard. It's not easy to make headway into that first problem, Mulvaney conceded, but that second reason has a solution.
LARA LOGAN: Were you any good as a caddy?
Earlier in the afternoon, Mr. Trump addressed reporters, insisting, We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war.
In the original version of the bill, all workers who received paid sick time would be eligible for another 10 weeks of paid leave at two-thirds pay.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I want to make sure we also talk about the Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax because I know you have strong feelings about him as well. He has made clear he's not going to resign. Do you expect there to be an attempt to impeach him?
The closure of the church raised tensions with the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, as well as smaller denominations, weeks ahead of the busy Easter season.
WARREN BUFFETT: That -- that is true. And Jay-Z had been out here about a year ago. And what I did was I admired his tie about six times. I said, Boy, that is a good (LAUGHS) looking tie, Jay. And (CLEARS THROAT) finally he said, OK, you win, Warren. And he took it off and he gave it to me. (CHUCKLES)
MARGARET BRENNAN: You-- you realize though that there's a lot of skepticism, that there would be this level of dissent to have that large number of people defy the monarch and the crown prince and carry out such a rogue operation?
CBS L.A. says the LAUSD covers 710 square miles and has 1,322 schools, although 216 are independent charter schools, most of which were being staffed with non-union teachers and were unaffected by the strike.
CHARLIE ROSE: There is one thing that's come up. It's fairness. And you have been making the point...that it wasn't exactly fair for you to be paying at a lower tax rate than your secretary. ...There is also the -- now the Buffett Rule. Explain to us what the Buffett Rule is.
CHARLIE ROSE: -- the way we're pitching this.
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, you know, I was born here. I've always been happy here. II've lived various other places -- Washington D.C., New York. ...It's home. And I live five minutes from here. I've lived in the same house for 53 years. I've been in this building for 50 years. My car just automatically drives back and forth (LAUGHS). If I try to take it anyplace else, it won't go.
The IRS is also coming off a 35-day shutdown that saw just a fraction of its workforce show up. The agency has said it will be doing everything it can to have a smooth tax season and minimize the impact on taxpayers, but it has also canceled three days' worth of Tax Court sessions over larger tax cases, and left open the possibility of canceling more.
CHARLIE ROSE: What do you admire about Ted Williams?
Max Dilendorf, a New York-based attorney who last year responded to a similar initiative, ultimately decided the offer didn't make sense after weighing the cost of a gut renovation against renting.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman thank you for joining us. Gayle King, thank you--
ADEL AL-JUBEIR: I'm not going to comment on reports based on anonymous sources. We have seen many such reports in over the past two or three months that turned out to be incorrect, or that turned out to-- that turned out to be incorrect frankly. And so, I don't know this-- this-- the background. The crown prince, we know, did not order this. This was not a government sanctioned operation. We have an investigation and we have a trial. And many things have been put out that turned out to be incorrect.
States like Alabama have built a presence in the global supply chain in direct competition with the country's Midwestern industrial heartland, and even if Trump coaxes jobs back to the United States they may well head south rather than north.
Union officials say workers want to increase wages, protect job security against the increasing use of technology at hotel-casinos and strengthen language against sexual harassment.
Her cosponsor, freshmen representative Young Kim, who is a former small business owner, said it was an immediate and urgent priority to distribute rapid tests and personal protective equipment, both of which could be purchased with the grant program created by the bill.

The analysis compared gross domestic product, population and other factors among northern and Midwestern states that played a key role in Trump's victory or are typically considered part of the industrial heartland, with those in the south and along the Gulf Coast that have become an emerging destination for auto and other investment.
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it -- it goes on and on. But it -- (LAUGHS) it -- it says some-- it says some nice things-- Charlie.
Increase contributions to your employer's 401(k) plan. Using your refund to save for retirement is a great move, especially when you get paid to do it. That's because many employers match their employees' contributions, for instance, 50 percent of the first 6 percent you contribute. That would put 9 percent of your pay into your 401(k).
If you moved permanently or temporarily last year — especially if you spent more than 180 days in a new state — it may be advisable to consult an accountant to figure out what tax applies to you. Double taxation could cost a lot.
WARREN BUFFETT: Thanks for joining me.
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Charlie, I'd been reading IBM's annual report, literally, every year for 50 years. And then this year...I saw something that sort a clicked in terms of adding to my-- feeling of confidence. And -- so we spent $10-plus billion. (CLEARS THROAT)
Kushner Cos. responded in a statement that it outsources the preparation of such documents to third parties that are reviewed by independent counsel, and if mistakes or violations are identified, corrective action is taken immediately.
While the GAO highlighted the challenges of the pandemic as a culprit in the surge in interest payments, it pointed out that the IRS has been paying out more in interest payments on late refunds for several years prior to the pandemic. That's likely to increase for the current tax season until IRS addresses its backlog of unprocessed and suspended returns, the GAO added.
That means you can exchange student loans for mortgage debt. That will indeed erase your student loans on paper, but what you owe isn't magically eliminated. It's added on to your mortgage obligation. And it could boomerang on you if you can't pay your mortgage: You could lose your home.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And that means explicit wording that says what?
The portion of independent contractors in the workforce last year was slightly smaller than it was in 2005, according to figures released Thursday by the Labor Department. Just 6.9 percent of workers toiled primarily as independent contractors in 2017, down from 7.4 percent in 2005. There were slightly fewer on-call workers. The portion of temp workers and contract workers -- employees of a company who work for a client of their employer -- was flat.
The missing component is consumer education, said Ascensus' Christenson.
Debate on the bill went until nearly 1 a.m. on Saturday.

Washington — Congress and the White House moved quickly to craft the parameters of a massive stimulus bill to prop up the economy in response to the coronavirus crisis on Tuesday. Senate Republicans took the lead on a package that could cost upwards of $1 trillion.
The White House has also floated a number of possible measures to mitigate the economic fallout of the coronavirus, including a temporary payroll tax cut.
MARGARET BRENNAN: They can't tell you where the body is?
The IRS' November projections show it processing 1.2 million electronic refunds by Jan. 24 — a number that now appears highly unlikely, since electronic filing did not officially open until Jan. 28.
As far as using an accountant, what I've seen, having worked for a CPA firm, they may (have) a deadline about when they want to see your tax documents because they get backed up, said Greene-Lewis. They may have a cut off where they put you on an extension.
The direct payments are planned for those who fall beneath an income threshold. It's not yet clear how the payments will be funded. For the time present, the payroll tax holiday favored by the president is not under consideration in the package.
REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: --it's more detention beds when-- when we look at-- at ICE versus detention-- detention beds and what they're talking about is those who come across the border illegally, cutting down on the number of beds which would actually force them being released into the United States and so it's-- it's more of an open border policy that some Democrats have supported in the past. And-- and I don't think that-- that's-- in fact I know that's not going to be supported by this administration.
Younger residents of Sambuca have moved to urban environments, while its elderly inhabitants generally are not equipped to maintain a modern economy.
Evangelicals, particularly white evangelicals, were a critical voting bloc in propelling the thrice-married president who says he's never asked God for forgiveness to the White House in 2016. And the president said he thinks he can improve upon that performance among evangelicals in 2020.
GAYLE KING: Let's talk about Justin Fairfax.
At the end of the day, if you are only going to end up being there once or twice a year, I think you are better off just getting an Airbnb, he said. But if someone is willing to relocate and live there, maybe it does make sense.

The novel program permits mortgage originators that sell loans to the mortgage giant to offer a new refinance option for the purpose of paying off a student loan. Proceeds from the refinancing will go directly to the student loan servicer to fully pay off at least one loan.
Some lawmakers have cited research that shows higher-income families are rebounding well from the pandemic's economic impact, as a rationale for lowering those income thresholds. Given that debate, many lawmakers are unlikely to support recurring stimulus payments.

It's important to reopen the doors of the Church, to let the people who sometimes come once in their life to visit this holy place, he said. Because a holy place without people is nothing ... only the stones.
ED O'KEEFE: Don't we get credit for that? Yeah. But when you can't verify that you have every document and which she's done this, and we don't know whether she and her family spent decades identifying this way, potentially to their advantage, then it invites the scrutiny that they're getting and will continue to get.
But the U.S. attorney overseeing the federal tax probe involving President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, will remain in place, the official told Hymes. The acting attorney general, Monty Wilkinson, called U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who runs the federal prosecutor's office in Delaware, and asked him to remain on the job, the official said.

Home-rental company Airbnb is also offering to pay four foreigners to spend three months in Grottole, located in the southern province of Matera, through its Italian Sabbatical program. Participants will help the local community revitalize the village.
The most important thing to understand is that you only pay taxes on investments when you realize their gains. So if you bought a stock in 2020 and its value went up, you won't pay taxes on those gains until you sell. And if it sank in value, the same rules of realizing apply. Investment losses hurt, but you can use them to offset your gains, up to a limit.
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I would say that based on the size of the tip, no. (LAUGHS)
Mr. Trump has been largely holed up at his Mar-a-Lago resort since the Friday before Christmas, making frequent golf outings.

REPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Thank you, Margaret.
Sambuca, a hilltop town in Sicily with sweeping views of the Mediterranean, is selling dozens of bargain basement-priced homes after other Italian towns and villages have made similar offers.

At the coalition launch, Mr. Trump recognized a number of the evangelical leaders who were at the event supporting him, including Franklin Graham, the son of Billy Graham. The president said that Franklin Graham had a special family and thanked him for having fought very hard for us over the two weeks since the editorial was published.
Exactly how much money the Kushner Cos. earned from the buildings mentioned in the documents is unclear. Of those 34 buildings, only the three in Queens and a fourth in Brooklyn appear to have been sold. The company also likely made money by reducing the number of rent-regulated tenants and bringing in those who would pay more.
Federal health providers such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers, are required to provide free testing. Expanded funding for food security programs: The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children, the Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Senior Nutrition Program will receive supplemental funding to assist Americans affected by the virus. The package also provides funding for state waivers to pay for meals for children who normally receive them at school.
The Child Tax Credit is the best-known of these, since it doubled in size recently with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. But parents can also take advantage of tax perks for some child-care expenses — including for adult kids.
GAYLE KING: Thank you, Margaret. Thank you.

Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has held major stakes in American Express and Coca-Cola for decades, so the company would face a significant tax bill on the gains if he did ever sell those investments.
You may not net a lower rate on your rolled in debt. As noted above, student loans relative to private mortgage rates, can often be a better deal. Federal Stafford Loans for undergraduate students have a low fixed rate, currently 3.76 percent, noted Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Cappex, a college decision site. They are unlikely to qualify for a lower rate on a mortgage.
Shrinking savings. Most HSAs are churn accounts, and saving might actually be going down instead of up. Devenir's latest report found participants holding over less in 2016, just $5.7 billion, compared with $5.9 billion in 2015 and $6.2 billion in 2014.
The phase three proposal follows an initial $8.3 billion measure passed earlier this month to boost emergency funding, and the House legislation approved early Saturday providing paid sick leave and family leave to some workers forced to remain at home over the outbreak.

Normally, a taxpayer's income in the prior year will determine if they can claim the EITC. But the credit typically applies only to money earned from work. Unemployment benefits, though they are subject to federal income tax, don't count as earned benefits for the purposes of the EITC or CTC.
While death and taxes may be two inevitabilities of life, some people like to push the envelope when it comes to the latter.
Companies would not be compensated for sick days they already provide workers, although they could be reimbursed for health care premiums for employees on emergency sick leave.
With tax season officially starting on Friday, millions of Americans could be in for a shock: owing taxes on unemployment benefits they received in 2020. The federal government and most states consider jobless aid taxable income. But unlike a paycheck, taxes typically aren't automatically deducted from such benefits, with the IRS expecting its cut.
Congress could still ride to the rescue. Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill to exempt unemployment benefits from taxes, with worker advocates noting that taxing unemployment assistance undercuts the purpose of the payments.
ADEL AL-JUBEIR: Absolutely not. This sounds to me like a soap opera. I've been watching it on television and reading about it in the paper. This is something between the two parties. We have nothing to do with it.
Getting a big refund -- more than a thousand dollars -- while carrying expensive debt can be a financial mistake. It's better to reduce your tax withholding, which increases your take-home pay, and use the larger cash flow to pay off your debt. Of course, your tax refund the following year will be smaller, but your debt will be smaller, too.
Specifics provided later by the district and the union included the addition of more than 600 nursing positions over the next three school years. Additional counselors and librarians were also part of the increase in support staff.

I'm watching rapists get out and my brother is in prison facing life without the possibility of parole, Cooper's sister, Shqunda, said. Things have changed. You know what I mean? And he's not there all because of marijuana? And then it's legal here. So it makes it even worse.

Kump wrote that Depp owes The Management Group $4.2 million from a $5 million loan they provided the actor. His tactics and lawsuit will fail, and he will be forced to pay back the loan as promised, Kump wrote.
JONAH GOLDBERG (National Review/@JonahNRO): Because he is like the Norse god Loki. He likes to create drama. He is a master at trolling and creating division. And-- and he was watching-- I think he was watching CNN, Jake Tapper tweeted that. This tweet came right after a conversation along these lines. There-- there are African-American politicians in Virginia, as I understand it, who think the calls for Fairfax to resign are unfair given the fact that, you know, for all the usual understandable partisan politics reasons. And Donald Trump is very good at sort of making-- of-- of sewing division and-- and-- and trolling this kind of stuff. And he gets, from-- from his perspective, pretty good results when he does.
GAYLE KING: --how this all came about. There are-- I'll just say, Margaret, we have a lot of interesting information that we'll have tomorrow on CBS THIS MORNING. I know you're ready for me to go.

REPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON: Well, one of the members of the House of Delegates has said that he intends to file articles of impeachment next week. That's a decision that my-- my former colleagues in the General Assembly are going to have to make about-- about how that plays out. But I expect that the lieutenant governor will do the right thing for Virginia and resign.
ADEL AL-JUBEIR: We are still investigating. There-- we have now-- a number of-- of possibilities and we're asking them what they did with the body, and I think this investigation is ongoing, and I would expect that eventually we will find the truth.

What happens during the summer in Las Vegas is you get a lot of people who are traveling. They say 'We're going to visit family in California, and then we'll go on a trip to Las Vegas,' said Michael McCall, a Michigan State University professor of hospitality business. This would deter them. That's going to shut down everything.
In addition, MetLife failed to tell customers that the recommended new contract would reduce or eliminate important features of the current contract, such as guaranteed income benefits and accrued death benefits.
REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I think that that's accurate. Obviously, no one wants it, the President doesn't want it. Mick doesn't want it. I don't want it. At-- at the same time what we're seeing with these negotiations going on-- I-- I don't know that they're real serious about reaching a compromise. I mean, they've met twice in-- in almost two weeks now.
The bill also includes a provision raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, even though the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the bill could not include an increase of the federal minimum wage if Congress uses the budget reconciliation process.
The decades of research on stimulus checks back up the argument that much of this is spent, which helps stimulate the economy, and sources like the Census show there is immense need for more funding despite the fitful recovery, said Claudia Sahm, an economist who has worked at the Federal Reserve and the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.
Housing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos. filed dozens of amended forms for the buildings mentioned in the documents, most of them a year to two later.

SCOTT PELLEY: American women have fought in many of our wars. Some of them have been killed and wounded in our wars. But the Pentagon just announced a major policy change, opening hundreds of frontline combat jobs to women. Do you have any hesitation as commander-in-chief ordering women into combat?
On average today, 20% of the bags used across all Wegmans stores are reusable. However, at our pilot stores in Corning and Ithaca, we've flipped that statistic so that only 20% of the bags used are single-use bags, according to Jason Wadsworth, Wegmans packaging and sustainability manager.

As it stands, the bill provides tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses finance the new benefit. For an employer, those credits would materialize when they pay their taxes, which companies typically do quarterly. For self-employed workers, that relief would also come when they pay their annual taxes.

GAYLE KING: I-- I know that is clearly an attempt at damage control, but I didn't feel that he was spinning a story. I think he's anguished, I think he's very sincere. And I think that he's hoping that once voters and viewers hear his story, that they will reconsider the calls for his resignation. That said, he's not planning to go anywhere. He thinks that he-- he-- he feels he is in a very unique position to lead Virginia to another way, and that this is actually, as painful as it is, a very good conversation for us all to have.

REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I-- I do expect the President and take some kind of executive action--a national emergency is certainly part of that. There are a few other things in his toolbox that he could use. But I do expect him to do that if we don't reach a compromise. And-- and, listen we have about twenty-four hours to do that. At this point they're going to need to look at some type of funding measure to make sure that we don't have a lapse, whether that's a clean CR for a short-term basis or a-- a longer period going through the end of September. They need to make sure that they have something on the table and ready to be voted on in the Senate where we could pass it in the House without a lapse in funding.
Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the House Progressive Caucus, told reporters on Friday that the Senate should consider eliminating the legislative filibuster, which would allow any legislation to pass in the Senate with a simple majority. Using budget reconciliation is a work-around that allows lawmakers to approve bills with a simple majority without torpedoing the filibuster.
If Mr. Biden cannot reach a deal with Senate Republicans, this package could still pass under reconciliation, a process sometimes used for spending measures. Under this approach, the bill would require only a simple majority to pass and would not be subject to being blocked by a filibuster. Most Senate bills require 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. This option would be used pass the Biden team's framework with only Democratic votes. Once the Georgia Senate election results are certified, there will be a 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would break any ties. With Harris as the 51st vote, Democrats will control the Senate.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with more FACE THE NATION in just a moment.
ED O'KEEFE: It's-- it's already sticking. It's clearly sticking. And they know this. And I think to the point about this being a woke primary, that's the element of this that her team didn't anticipate. They thought they get credit for being as transparent as possible, releasing tax return to allowing a thorough review by the Boston Global for employment history and then releasing a DNA test because it would provide such a sharp contrast of the President who doesn't release any information despite the fact that he won and is still in office. But what they didn't anticipate was that by identifying that way when you clearly aren't or only a minuscule part of you is, it suggests that you were trying the take advantage of somebody else's heritage. And that is an-- is an-- is a radioactive element of this that they just are not prepared for. And I think she is going to suffer throughout this campaign, whether they like it or not. And there has been this attitude from her team of, well, we put it all out there.

For now, the bill's status remains fluid. House lawmakers passed a series of corrections to their bill Monday night. In the Senate, Kentucky Republican Rand Paul is reportedly threatening to delay a vote unless lawmakers include additional means of funding the benefits expansion.
The Getting Americans Safely Back to Work Act, introduced Monday by Virginia Democrat Abigail Spanberger and California Republican Young Kim, would create a $1 billion block grant program for such purchases to be administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health departments. A quarter of the funds, $250 million, would be set aside to help small business like restaurants fully reopen. The bill was first reported by CBS News.

JAMELLE BOUIE: --of anyone talking about it.
GAO, which analyzed the tax gap problem in 2012, pointed out that simplifying the tax code is only one way to help close the gap. GAO said the IRS also needs to improve customer service lines for taxpayers, devote additional resources to enforcement, expand compliance checks before issuing refunds and modernize information systems, among other things, to address the gap.
These places are small and very skewed toward older generations. Life is very quiet and simple and basic. There wouldn't be much to do beyond renovating your property and gardening, said Kathleen Peddicord, publisher and founder of Live and Invest Overseas.
GAYLE KING: I think he is hoping he can ride it out. He is not going to step down. He is not going-- I even asked, Under what circumstances would you step down? And he couldn't even give-- he did not want to give an answer to that question because that is not how he is thinking, that is not what he wants, and that's not what he believes that he should step down.
But West, a Florida native with blonde hair and a resemblance to Marilyn Monroe, seemed like a different person on other online accounts.
Teachers hoped to build on the Red4Ed movement that began last year in West Virginia and moved to Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado and Washington state. It spread from conservative states with right to work laws that limit the ability to strike to the more liberal West Coast with strong unions.
REPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Yeah, but I don't think that's actually true. There are-- there are cynics who say this is about the next election. But I think it's much more about values. We would move from a progressive, very strong attorney general to someone, who is not just a Republican, but someone who is on the arch conservative end of it. So, the way our laws would be administered Virginia would be completely different. This isn't about party politics as much it is about the kind of Virginia that we want.
Federal court records show West and her husband filed for bankruptcy in 2007 while living in Cartersville, Georgia, but the case appeared to be handled routinely and closed within months. Tax records indicate they moved into the home in Calera in 2015. It was valued at $169,000 last year.
GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: That's going to be a decision that he needs to make.
Mr. Biden on Thursday also laid the foundation on how his administration will change the vaccine distribution process. The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure so far, Mr. Biden said.

For small business experiencing steep declines in demand now, my fear for some is that is going to mean having to close their doors, Glynn said.
The operation broke wide open after police responded to a May 2013 home invasion robbery at the house and found the computers, stacks of cash, closets filled with expensive shoes and jewelry, watches, bags of marijuana and other drugs, and dozens of prepaid debit cards and credit cards.
Following the recent disaster declaration issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the IRS is providing this relief to the entire state of Texas, the IRS said in a statement.
The main sticking points are creditors' demands for cuts in pensions under a sweeping reform package designed to keep the tottering system alive, plus tax reform and the degree of protection accorded to individuals and companies struggling to repay their bank loans.
This gets money quickly into the pockets of millions of Americans who will spend it immediately on food and rent and other basic needs, as economists tell us that helps the whole economy grow, Mr. Biden said in the speech.
In all, Housing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos. filed at least 80 false applications for construction permits in 34 buildings across New York City from 2013 to 2016, all of them indicating there were no rent-regulated tenants. Instead, tax documents show there were more than 300 rent-regulated units. Nearly all the permit applications were signed by a Kushner employee, including sometimes the chief operating officer.
I've had situations in my practice where I've had parents come in and complain to me that, even though they're legally entitled to claim a child on their tax return, their former partner has claimed the child and gotten extra tax refunds, said Jonathan Medows, a CPA based in Manhattan. It created a fight with the IRS to get their refunds.
REPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: Well, I know that's what he wants to do. And I-- I respect him. I know he wants to rehabilitate his reputation and-- and even his sense of what he called his moral compass. But he sacrificed so much of his ability to govern effectively. Figured the Legislative Black Caucus in Richmond, the Congressional Black Caucus on the Hill, virtually every African-American leader I know, has said that he needs to resign and the-- the Post poll that we've talked about before--
The president seemed to take pride in undermining the ACA, but now his administration is resisting the argument that they have undermined the health law, said Levitt, who reviewed the report for AP. They can point to benefits of deregulation, but will also have to live with the costs, which include higher premiums for middle-class people with pre-existing conditions.
The administration has been saying they were going to use economic growth to deal with our fiscal challenges and reduce the debt. Now they want to use growth effects to pay for tax cuts, she explained. You shouldn't assume growth effects before they occur, and you sure shouldn't count them twice.

They were promised a utopia of an Islamic State, but now these ISIS families have been reduced to eating American-made rations and living out of a hole in the ground.
Now that tax day (plus one) has come and gone, millions of Americans are looking forward to refunds. After all, nearly 80 percent of individual filers get a check from the IRS. According to the agency's most recent data, it has processed more than 101 million returns and issued more than 79 million refunds totaling $226.6 billion so far. The average refund is $2,864.
Many workers who've spent the last year with their office in their living room may be wondering if they can deduct the costs of setting up a home workspace.

Mr. Biden is proposing $400 billion dollars to boost vaccine infrastructure, with a specific focus on increasing the number of community vaccine distribution locations. An incoming senior Biden administration official reiterated confidence that the goal of providing 100 million vaccine shots in the first 100 days would be met.
Two lawmakers from opposite coasts and different parties want to ease the burden on local governments and small businesses of operating during the pandemic by helping them purchase personal protective equipment and rapid testing equipment.
GAYLE KING: In the beginning, he did not call for your resignation. He said, you know, Let the Governor decide. I know the Governor will make the right decision. But now his story has also changed.
So far this year, tax return filings have run mostly on schedule. The IRS had received 59 million tax returns as of the end of February, the same number as it had this time last year. That's just over a third of all the returns the agency expects to process this filing season.
JONAH GOLDBERG: Well, I-- I just think all of this is baked in with President Trump. The President Trump you see allegedly mocking the Trail of Tears is the same President who mocked parents of gold star families. Everyone has made up their mind about the guy, and that's-- there's a reason why he's never made it out of the forties in approval rating and his real-- his support is about thirty-five percent of the electorate, which gets us to the fact that this-- there's-- if you just look at the math of the electoral college and his approval rating, there is almost literally no way Donald Trump can affirmatively win in 2020. But the Democrats can certainly lose. And if you look at the way these fights are shaping up, if you look at the way the Democrats this last week walked into Donald Trump's thing at the State of the Union about how we're never going to be a socialist country by unveiling in not great fashion the green new deal, it does seem like the Democrats are in danger of spiraling off to exactly the place where the White House wants them to be.
GAYLE KING: Well, when you said that he's lost the confidence, he realizes that. But he also wants a chance to regain the confidence. Do you think he deserves that? He knows that he's lost everyone's confidence.
In addition to the Child Tax Credit, working parents can deduct some of the cost of child care. If you paid someone to care for your kids so that you could work or look for work, you likely qualify. The deduction limit is $3,000 for a single child, or $6,000 for two or more children.
SCOTT PELLEY: So I'm not hearing you say, read my lips, no new taxes. You think there is going to have to be additional revenue over the next four years?
The most prominent takeaway is that there is not actually that much saving beyond the tax break in Health Savings Accounts. Money goes in and comes right back out, with only a fraction held over.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, I don't. And the reason has become because women, as a practical matter, are now in combat. They may not get treated as if they're in combat. But when they're in theater in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, they are vulnerable. They are wounded. And they've been killed. And they have carried out their jobs with extraordinary patriotism and distinction.
Sales of variable annuities, which are tax-deferred and often used to save for retirement, have ballooned in recent years. They're contracts with investors in which the company selling them agrees to make periodic payments to the investor. The periodic payouts change depending on the performance of the mutual funds, bonds or other investments linked to the annuities.
GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: I don't live in a vacuum.
Analysts declined Wednesday to weigh in on the financial impact that a strike could have on casino operators. But the casinos and hotels aren't the only ones that would feel the squeeze. Local and state governments stand to lose millions from the impact on tourism.
IRS' overall 2020 performance was significantly impacted by its reliance on manual processes such as for paper returns, and its limited ability to process returns remotely while processing centers were closed, the GAO report said. As a result, as of December 2020, IRS had a significant backlog of unprocessed returns and taxpayer correspondence.

There are progressive Democrats that have that muscle in the House, Ocasio-Cortez said. If we as a party decide to stand down on our promise of elevating the minimum wage, I think that's extraordinarily spurious and it's something that as a party we could have a further conversation about how to fight for it.

Still, such arguments are unlikely to gain traction among congressional Republicans and even some moderate Democrats given that many have already voiced opposition to the $1,400 checks that are part of Mr. Biden's American Rescue Plan. Some lawmakers have also called for the the third round of stimulus checks to be distributed to fewer households by focusing on lower-income Americans.
Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation said less regulation isn't automatically an act of sabotage, but Mr. Trump has made clear his hostility to Obamacare.
An agency spokesman said the IRS had started processing some returns in January, but did not have data on how many had been filed or processed to date.
While plenty of factors argue against doing a mortgage debt swap with your student loans, there's one exception, Kantrowitz pointed out:
The last time casino-hotel workers went on strike across Las Vegas was in 1984. That job action lasted 67 days and cost workers and the city more than $1 million a day each in lost wages and revenues, not counting gambling losses. The price could be much higher this time if the two sides can't reach agreements: The city has 90,000 more hotel rooms and gets an additional 29 million visitors a year than it did in 1984. More than 42.2 million people visited Vegas last year.
While the IRS is able to accept and process tax returns before the official opening of tax season (Jan. 28 this year), it's not able to accept large numbers of electronic returns before then, which is the filing format preferred by nearly 90 percent of taxpayers.
We're expecting more people to have business losses. Before, you could deduct up to $250,000 [in losses] for single people. Now you can deduct an unlimited amount, Jegede said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration missed a congressional deadline to officially weigh in on whether Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. We spoke Friday, the day of that deadline with the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir and asked him about his meeting with the secretary of state earlier in the week.

On Friday, the president repeated his line that he has been a better president for people of faith than anyone else. He also issued his usual warning that anyone on the radical left who takes the White House will eliminate any policy gains for religious people.
There are villages and towns where they are offering bonuses for every child born there because the birth rate is so low, he said. But there seems to be no combination -- around the world -- of economic incentives, at least in developed countries, to bring the birth rate up to be replacement, which would be 2.1 children, he said. I don't know if there is anything Italy can do.

SCOTT PELLEY: There has been concern about the safety of football at all levels, high school, college, and in the NFL. If you had a son, would you let him play?
The bottom line with student debt management is to be careful. Look at all of the scenarios carefully and see how much you can save -- if you can reap any savings at all.
You lose flexibility from the federal student loan program. Homeowners who tap home equity to pay off student debt give up their rights to income-driven repayment options on their federal student loans, which cap federal student loan payments at roughly 10 percent of their income, said Rohit Chopra, senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America. Income-driven repayment is a critical safeguard during periods of unemployment or other income shocks that help avoid the consequences of default. Also, keep in mind that the federal college loan program has multiple repayment options.
The child needs to be a U.S. citizen or legal resident
ADEL AL-JUBEIR: Of course not. Of course not. Nobody in Saudi Arabia knew about the murder except the people who did it. That's why when the team came back we said, as far as we know he left the consulate through the backdoor. It turned out to be false. And that's when the king asked for an investigation to be launched. The prosecution launched the investigation. The public prosecutor determined that something went wrong, brought in the people who were in the mission and basically detained them and questioned them and established that yes, they did in fact murder him.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and you continued your conversation with him. Let's play that clip.
Single people could receive as much as $1,400 each, while married couples filing jointly could receive $2,800. Only individuals earning up to $75,000 would get the full payments, as would married couples with incomes up to $150,000. For incomes above those thresholds, payment amounts would decline, phasing out completely for single individuals earning above $100,000 and married couples with a combined income of more than $200,000.
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children, the Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Senior Nutrition Program will receive supplemental funding to assist Americans affected by the virus. The package also provides funding for state waivers to pay for meals for children who normally receive them at school. Emergency family and sick leave: Employees of companies with fewer than 500 employees and government staffers may take up to 12 weeks of protected family and medical leave, including two weeks at full pay, with any additional weeks taken with no less than two-thirds of the employee's usual pay, to either quarantine or seek preventative care. Small and mid-sized businesses would receive tax credits to pay for medical and family leave of up to 100% of the wages they pay out. Employers with fewer than 500 employees are required to provide two weeks of sick leave at full pay for employees who are seeking treatment for the virus. Self-employed individuals would also receive tax credits to receive paid leave. Workers would be eligible for paid sick leave if they have a child whose school or childcare facility is closed due to the coronavirus. These employees are required to receive not less than two-thirds of their regular pay.
Still, unless changes are made to the bill, more than 60 million Americans would be ineligible for the two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of family and medical leave it offers for those impacted by the global pandemic. That's because larger companies, those with 500 or more employers, are exempt from the proposal's provisions.
The IRS says nearly 90 percent of refunds are directly deposited into a bank account. But that can be a temptation to spend.
In conversations with Central Virginia small businesses, restaurants, and local governments, a major concern remains the continued cost of PPE and COVID-19 testing supplies, Spanberger said. While these costs are high, employers recognize the importance of making these investments for both the safety of their employees and the health of our communities.
The senators who signed the letter, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon, argue that aid such as enhanced unemployment benefits hasn't reached every family hurt by the economic crunch.

However, if you have home equity, a new route to paying down student loans is now open. Fannie Mae, the federal mortgage financing company, recently announced a new program that allows student debt holders to swap student debt for mortgage debt.
Jared Kushner, who stepped down as CEO of the Kushner Cos. last year before taking on his advisory role at the White House, sold off part of his real estate holdings as required under government ethics rules. But he retained stakes in many properties, including Westminster Management, the Kushner Cos. subsidiary that oversees its residential properties. A financial disclosure last year showed he still owns a stake in Westminster and earned $1.6 million from the holding.
The House passed President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package early Saturday morning almost entirely along partisan lines. The bill now goes the Senate, although it included a minimum wage hike that the Senate parliamentarian ruled on Thursday cannot be included if Congress uses the budget reconciliation process.
The extension also includes any taxes that would have been owed by April 15, as well as any business returns that otherwise would have been due on March 15, the IRS said. Texans also will have until June 15 to make 2020 IRA contributions, the agency said.
As for taxpayers who rely on accountants, there's the danger that your CPA may not have time to handle your returns the closer you wait until April 18. It's not all that unusual to file for an extension, since about 8 percent of all returns the IRS receives are filed with the additional 6 months that the extension provides.
Soleimani has been killed and his bloody rampage is now forever gone, the president said during his speech at the church, adding Soleimani had been plotting attacks but they've been stopped for good.
The report didn't address constitutional arguments in a Texas court case against the ACA brought by red-state officials. But its economic analysis could have a bearing on that case.
Supplier networks followed, creating even stiffer competition in an industry already changing due to passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the growth of automaking in Mexico. New industries, such as aerospace, followed.
However, the spreading coronavirus could disrupt tax season, as many Americans rely on IRS field offices and volunteer centers for help with their filings.
Any minimal employer contribution - even just $500 - and you've essentially given them the jump start, said Steve Christenson, executive vice president at Ascensus, a retirement and savings plan provider. When you say 'here are dollars to start with and here's some additional information on how to keep funding it' - those two simple things go a long way.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Tuesday the decision was its largest fine related to variable annuities, popular yet complex investments that have grabbed the attention of regulators in recent years. FINRA has taken hundreds of disciplinary actions against brokers and investment firms for abuses in sales of variable annuities.
But angry religious leaders say their non-church properties provide valuable services for pilgrims and their local flocks, and fund important services like schools and health clinics.

U.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas imposed the sentence on Harlan Money King Decoste, 27, who previously pleaded guilty to fraud, identity theft and other charges. Decoste had faced even more prison time, but Dimitrouleas gave him a slight break by using a somewhat lower tax-fraud loss estimate than the government.

About 9 in 10 individual returns are filed electronically, but the GAO found that more than 20% of businesses filed paper returns even though they could have e-filed, which is a faster option because processing is automated.
These direct payments may be structured in a way similar to the tax rebate in 2008 in the midst of the financial crisis. In that case, individuals received a designated amount, married couples received a certain amount, and additional funds were given based on the numbers of dependent children.
As noted above, student loans relative to private mortgage rates, can often be a better deal. Federal Stafford Loans for undergraduate students have a low fixed rate, currently 3.76 percent, noted Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Cappex, a college decision site. They are unlikely to qualify for a lower rate on a mortgage. You lose federal loan breaks if you can't pay. The federal loan program has a surprising number of generous provisions if you're sick, disabled or can't pay back your loan.  Federal student loans offer significant benefits that aren't standard with mortgages, such as death and disability discharges, economic hardship deferments, forbearances, income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness options, said Kantrowitz.
GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: And so again, I regret that our attorney general is in this position. But this is a decision that he's going to need to make.
As now structured, the measure covers workers in businesses with less than 500 employees, which is roughly half of private-sector workers, or 67 million, Glynn said. If you add public sector workers into the mix, a total of 87 million are covered.
Even though they earn less, however, independent contractors overwhelmingly love their jobs, with more than 4 in 5 saying they preferred it to a different arrangement. Most temps, on the other hand, would rather have a traditional job.
Taxpayers used to claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which is worth between $538 and $6,660 depending on income and number of children, can continue to do so — with a twist. Taxpayers who had big income changes in 2020 can use their income from 2019 to qualify for the credit. The same is true for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), which is worth up to $2,000 per child.
Depp hired the Mandels in 1999 and their compensation was not subject to a written contract, his lawsuit states. It states they received 5 percent of his income on hit films such as the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and other major releases, including Alice in Wonderland and the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
He's said it before and he's saying it again. In his widely read annual letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's chief executive, emphasized that bonds are risky and that investors should stick with equities—even though they can pose greater risk in the near term.

Last year, 18 million tax returns were filed by the first week of filing season, which ended Feb. 2. A spokesman for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc., the country's No. 2 tax-prep company, said the number of January filers was much lower than typical this year, a drop he attributed to the effect of the government shutdown.

CNN was first to report that the department was seeking the resignations.
Workers who turned to the gig economy to make ends meet in 2020 could find themselves owing a lot more in taxes. For one, their payroll tax would be double what a regular employee owes — 15.3% on any income up to $137,000. This is separate from federal income tax.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, can you say though that the Saudi government and any of its employees or its, you know, contractors that it works with, definitively that they had no contact--
Police have classified West's death as a homicide, but they haven't said how she died. What appears to be the remainder of a blood stain darkens the asphalt across the street from the two-story brick home she shared with her husband and middle school-age daughter.
The tax gap, simply put, is the amount in taxes individuals and companies owe the government, but that the government never receives. There are three reasons for that gap --some fail to pay any taxes, others underreport income, and yet others underpay their taxes, according to the IRS. Mulvaney said the president's proposed tax plan doesn't include an expectation that the gap will close, but pointed out how shrinking it would help the proposed $4 trillion budget. The tax gap in 2016 was $486 billion -- out of the expected revenue from income and corporate taxes of roughly $1.9 trillion.
I know it's pretty horrible, but we can help you get out, Siwek recalls the man saying. We can offer you money.
It's also important to understand that gains are taxed differently depending on how long you held on to the investment. If you sell a stock you held for less than a year, it is taxed at the higher short-term capital gains rate, versus the lower long-term capital gains rate for investments held for more than a year.
CHARLIE ROSE: You said to me once, Warren, that he was your hero.
Once the Senate considers its version of the bill, progressives in the House could threaten to withhold their support for the final package unless some kind of minimum wage hike is included. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested on Thursday that progressive members of the House should pressure their own party in ways similar to conservative Democrats in the Senate.
However, Mulvaney's hopes of closing or even significantly shrinking the tax gap may be a stretch. The tax gap has remained relatively stable during the last decade, with the majority of the gap stemming from individual, rather than corporate, tax, shortages. The total tax gap was $450 billion in 2006, and the total tax compliance rate was 83 percent, according to the Government Accountability Office. The Obama administration made attempts to close the gap by stepping up enforcement, but probably only reduced it by $50 billion to $100 billion over a decade, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The House passed a coronavirus relief bill shortly after midnight on Saturday following lengthy negotiations between Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. The bill passed on a bipartisan basis with President Trump's endorsement.
Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit
MARGARET BRENNAN: Jonah, the President weighs in on a lot of things, and he weighed in on this a few times this week. And then this morning said, African-Americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in Virginia. It's not clear what he was referring to, it might have been this Washington Post poll that said the majority of black residents were okay with Northam remaining in office. Why weigh into this?
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is leading negotiations for the administration, traveled to the Hill to discuss the measure with senators over lunch on Tuesday.
It's a tax credit, basically, and it's a refundable credit, Caruso said. That means a person whose income is low enough could potentially owe no taxes and still qualify for a stimulus check.
Navarro, in a recent interview with CBS News, said the impending executive action he has been working on would tighten domestic procurement by requiring federal agencies looking to purchase pharmaceuticals and medical equipment to Buy American. The medical supply chain has been a concern — face masks and other necessary medical equipment are made in China, where this strain of coronavirus is believed to have originated. Navarro is also pushing for a payroll tax cut to address the country's worsening economic outlook, an initiative that Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for, despite pushback from bipartisan lawmakers.
Senator Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Budget Committee and an outspoken advocate for raising the minimum wage, said Thursday that he would introduce an amendment to the package to take tax deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don't pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide small businesses with the incentives they need to raise wages.
As it ramps up production, local officials say 20 suppliers have already arrived in Airbus' wake, with firms like Ireland's Maas Aviation looking to put 150 people to work painting planes.
One single tweet we've seen can eradicate market cap losses in the billions of dollars. One single tweet can adjust the strategy of a large Fortune 500 company, Mayer said.
You need to claim the child as a dependent on your tax return
There's one exception to this rule: Independent contractors and small business owners can deduct home office costs from their business income. To qualify for the tax break, the workspace must be exclusively and regularly used as a place of business, Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert at TurboTax, told the Associated Press. That means working from the dining room table doesn't qualify.
A lawsuit filed by voter rights advocacy groups against DeSantis and the Florida Secretary of State over SB 7066 is not affected by the court's opinion, the Tampa Bay Times reported. It remains unclear how the court's opinion will affect felons waiting to register to vote.
The President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms, Grisham said. She added that Mr. Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him.
CHARLIE ROSE: There are some references to the University of Nebraska there, the Big Red. Does that football team mean something?
Casey Mulligan, chief economist for the White House council, said it turns out that the penalty for people going uninsured wasn't really essential for the Obama health law to function. The subsidies were more important.
Someone subject to this should basically think of a doubling of their state income tax liability, or potentially more, Walczak said.
In accounts not associated with a workplace, the average contribution was $1,713, according to Devenir, an HSA research consultant.
WARREN BUFFETT: It's a nice office. It's perfect. I've been -- I'll be happy here the rest of my life. It -- you know, it -- it is home to me. (LAUGHS)
And fluency in Italian is a must, according to travel and retirement experts.
SCOTT PELLEY: Without raising rates again?
At the same time, I want to incentivize the smallest of small businesses-those with middle-class owners-to raise their workers' wages. My plan would provide an income tax credit equal to 25 percent of wages, up to $10,000 per year per employer, to small businesses that pay their workers higher wages, Wyden said.
Not only will their taxes go down this year, but also for five prior years, he said.
TurboTax, for instance, ended its early season pricing on its online filing products on March 17, which means that consumers will now pay as much as 25 percent more for the same products. The company still offers its federal free edition, which is geared for consumers filing either the relatively simple 1040EZ or 1040A forms, although TurboTax said that is subject to change. TurboTax's Deluxe edition now costs $54.99 for federal returns, for instance, instead of the $34.99 before March 17.
Mr. Trump signed an $8.3 billion emergency response package last week. Congress is expected to continue considering legislation to respond to the crisis in the coming weeks.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well I don't think the issue right now is raising rates. The question is, if we're going to be serious about reducing our deficit, can we combine some smart spending cuts? Because there's still some waste in government. Can we reform our health care programs in particular, because we spend a lot more on health care than every other country does. And we don't get better outcomes. So there's a lot of waste in the system and there are things that we can do to reduce health care costs.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet The Washington Post had a poll out that published overnight and it said Virginians are split. But an interesting portion of that said the majority of black residents say he should remain in office. Is that black-- public opinion persuasive to you at all?
Gig workers for a delivery company should make sure to claim all the mileage they are eligible for, as well as costs for car maintenance, vehicle supplies or washing, which are eligible expenses.
Either way, that presents problems, given that many employers are already taking an income hit from the virus, Glynn said. For one, the bill would not take effect for two weeks after being signed into law. For small businesses, that means they'd have to start covering workers as soon as early April — but they wouldn't see any relief until July, when filing quarterly taxes.
Losing to inflation. Most of the $37 billion in HSA accounts is sitting in cash, with only $5.5 billion invested in any way, according to Devinir. EBRI's study found that investments made up only about 3 percent of the total deposits. In today's low interest-rate environment, that means these accounts are not keeping up with inflation, and actually losing value over time.
The Obama administration recently acted to require that brokers who recommend investments for retirement savers meet a stricter standard that now applies to registered advisers. The idea is to prevent brokers from steering customers into riskier investments because they pay the broker a high commission.
A senior Democratic aide confirmed to CBS News that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is looking to add a new provision to penalize large corporations that don't pay their workers at least a $15 minimum wage, an idea which appears to be gaining traction.
Independent contractors earned slightly less than traditional workers, while temp workers and on-call workers made significantly less money. Demographics play a role here, since temp and on-call workers are more likely to be African-American and Latino. Temp workers are also younger than the workforce overall.
That amendment must be included in this reconciliation bill, Sanders said.
Still, the lure of rolling federal loans into a mortgage debt sounds tempting. But here are five major drawbacks you should be aware of:
Mnuchin also said that the government should pick up the costs for small and medium businesses whose workers have to self-quarantin or care for quarantined family members.
Children who are 17 or older won't qualify you for the full Child Tax Credit, but you can get up to $500 per person through a dependent care credit. You can claim an adult child or an aging parent, for instance — as long as that person meets the IRS' definition of a dependent.
This is not necessarily a bad thing, as you still get a tax deduction for the contribution, said Paul Fronstin, director of Health Research and Education for EBRI.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.

The small village of Grottole, with only 300 inhabitants and more than 600 empty homes, is at risk of disappearing and is asking for your help! the program's description reads.
Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the president's council of economic advisers, and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, will be going to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to meet with Republican lawmakers about economic measures the government could take to provide relief to those impacted by coronavirus. They're expected to discuss a payroll tax cut, aid for hourly wage earners to help them avoid lost wages, small business loans, and aid for the airline, cruise and hotel industries, which are suffering losses over fear about the spread of coronavirus.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I don't know that you are. Sorry, what is your question, Gayle?
Before Tuesday, the union last voted for a strike in 2002, but it reached a deal before employees walked out.
Some 22 million households, or about 1 in 7 taxpayers, claimed the Child Tax Credit in 2017, the most recent year for which IRS data are available. The figure last was likely much higher, since the late-2017 tax law changes more than doubled the maximum income someone could earn and still qualify for the credit.
Marianne O'Brien said the need for additional support staff was one of the main reasons she walked picket lines.
And you've got not only Bill and Melinda Gates of the Gates Foundation, but you've got my three children, and I've left them-- or I'm giving them significant amounts for their foundations. ...And I feel very good about it.

The billionaire investor offered the recommendations not long after the stock market's biggest single-day drop in more than six years. He also urged investors not to use leverage to invest in stocks, saying it can lead to irrational behavior when times are volatile.
Mr. Biden's coronavirus package proposes $170 billion for updates to K-12 schools to ready them for in-class instruction again. Funds could be used to reduce class size, modify space, improve ventilation or provide additional funding for summer school to make up for lost time.
I am pleased that @FLCourts confirms that Amendment 4 requires fines, fees & restitution be paid to victims before their voting rights may be restored. Voting is a privilege that should not be taken lightly, and I am obligated to faithfully implement Amendment 4 as it is defined. — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) January 16, 2020
President-elect Joe Biden unveiled his $1.9 trillion dollar coronavirus economic relief plan on Thursday evening. The expensive legislation contains three major targets: $400 billion for arresting the spread of COVID-19 and increasing vaccine capabilities; over $1 trillion to assist families needing direct financial support; and $440 billion in emergency funds for cash-poor small businesses and communities.
If you're looking for a quick, low-cost way to pay off your student loans, you can find a few options. But while you may be able to consolidate or refinance (even private loans), you won't find many ways to significantly pay off those loans without forking over more money every month.
The IRS is giving all Texas residents and businesses an additional two months to file their federal income taxes, citing the deadly winter storm that left millions without power and water. Texans will now have until June 15 to file their 2020 returns, instead of the regular deadline of April 15, the tax agency said on Monday.
CHARLIE ROSE: Warren, thank you very much. This been a remarkable visit.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, the Lieutenant Governor, Justin Fairfax, now two of the accusers have said that they would publicly testify should there be impeachment proceedings. There was no formal investigation here. Does one need to happen?
GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: Yes. He is and I support that. And-- and if these accusations are determined to be true, I don't think he is going to have any other option but to resign.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks during a press briefing with the coronavirus task force at the White House on Tuesday, March 17, 2020. AP
This executive order would target essential medicines and medical countermeasures— not just pharmaceuticals, but supplies and equipment needed to deal with emerging infectious diseases, as well as medical products and the supply chains that feed into those two categories, according to Navarro.
LARA LOGAN: Where'd you get that?
IRS may already be behind on refunds
ADEL AL-JUBEIR: It's-- Oliver North was involved in Iran-Contra. And he thought that Ronald Reagan wanted this. And Ronald Reagan did not want this at all. Abu Ghraib, you had people abusing prisoners and the President and the vice president and the secretary of state were not even aware of it. Unfortunately people make mistakes. Unfortunately people exceed their authorities. Unfortunately people do things wrong. We have done the right thing. We acknowledged that this happened. We acknowledged that these were officials of the Saudi government. We acknowledged that this-- they had no authority to do this, and we jailed them. And now we're putting them on trial.
There is no doubt this is the year to file electronically, Ken Corbin, the new chief taxpayer experience officer at the IRS, said last month. Taxpayers who file paper returns need to prepare for a lengthy potential wait.
About 10 million people continue to get private insurance through the ACA's subsidized markets, or exchanges, and another 12 million are covered by its Medicaid expansion. The GOP's drive to repeal the ACA in 2017 fell flat, and Democrats effectively blocked another try by gaining control of the House.
As the coronavirus promises to strain the nation's supply chains, top White House trade adviser Peter Navarro says he's delivering an executive action to President Trump intended to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and bring that manufacturing to the U.S.
For now, the Internal Revenue Service is not considering extending the April 15 deadline or waiving penalties for Americans who find they underpaid taxes throughout the year, Ken Corbin, chief taxpayer experience officer at the IRS, said on a call Thursday.
Warren Buffett is one of the richest men in the world. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns or has a stake in over 70 businesses such as Coca Cola, IBM, and American Express. But this is no ordinary billionaire. He's giving 99 percent of his wealth to charity and he thinks rich people should pay higher taxes.
What we know from current behavior is that just 15 percent contribute the maximum, according to Devenir. More than 30 percent do not contribute any money at all in a given year.
Just like that...I made my first call and I called my mom. And she said—I'm crying uncontrollably. But she says, 'What are you crying for? Ivanka Trump called me at 12:30 and said that you that you're coming home, Cooper recalled.
As a result, gig workers and freelancers should make sure they're deducting all their business costs. Any money spent on work cuts into business profits — that includes equipment, office supplies, advertising or marketing-startup costs, or costs for a dedicated home office.
Trump says he doesn't need to be tested for coronavirus
That said, the grocery chain has no immediate intention to remove plastic bags from its stores outside New York, with a spokesperson emailing CBS MoneyWatch: We don't have specific plans to remove them from stores in other states. However, we will continue to focus on helping our customers shift to reusable bags.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you been briefed on what the CIA determined?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns the Washington Post, is accusing AMI, which publishes The National Enquirer, for essentially trying to extort him with these incriminating photos. He personally said though that the Post's essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder, specifically of Khashoggi, was undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles. Did the Saudi government have anything to do with these leaks to AMI?
As full-time employees, we tend to build our personal lives around holes and gaps that are left by our professional lives, said Kasriel. For freelancers, it's the opposite.

JAMES BROWN: All right Scott, and our thanks to President Obama and to Scott Pelley for joining us this afternoon.
REPRESENTATIVE DON BEYER: --one of things we missed is that forty percent of black Virginians think he shouldn't remain. That's-- that's a damning number for a Democratic governor.
CBS also interviewed President George W. Bush in 2004 and President Obama before the Super Bowl in 2010 and 2016.
You may not be able to have your federal student loan forgiven. This would apply to those in public service professions who may qualify for loan forgiveness after a decade.
Manafort reached a plea agreement with Mueller's office on Sept. 14 to avoid a second trial on additional charges in D.C. District Court. Under the deal, Manafort pledged to cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly with Mueller's probe and any other investigation.
A number of states also have what are called tax convenience laws, under which the state collects taxes from workers based on the location of their employer, regardless of whether someone commutes to the office. Typically, a worker's state of residence will provide a credit for taxes paid to another state so that an individual doesn't get taxed twice on the same income.
In making their argument, the senators noted that the $1,400 isn't likely to tide many families over for very long.
The Health and Human Services, Defense and Veterans Affairs Departments would be most affected by the possible change. Navarro argues the coronavirus crisis highlights that the U.S. is dangerously dependent on numerous nations for medicines, supplies and equipment, roughly 15 to 20 countries, not just China. The top trade adviser said the previous administration wasted numerous opportunities to address this in the face of crises that underscored this dependence, such as during the H1N1, SARS and MERS crises.
Cooper started a website selling clothing and also advocating for companies that legally sell marijuana. He called the BET documentary pivotal to raising awareness about his story and so many others. BET is a division of Viacom CBS.
GAYLE KING: --sexual inappropriateness. And they have both said that if there is an impeachment hearing that they will testify against him. Where do you sit on how you feel about Justin Fairfax today? Are you too calling for him to step down?
If you're just caring for a child and it's your cousin, that's not necessarily going to qualify you for the tax credit, she explained. That's where you really get into people claiming something that maybe makes sense, but doesn't qualify under the law.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Jonah, the President again weighing in on this in a tweet not only mockingly calling her Pocahontas, but then using the term TRAIL, all caps, which many read as a nod to the Trail of Tears, the-- the forceable relocation of thousands of Native Americans leading to mass death, is he going to be paid-- paying a price for that?
GAYLE KING: At this time, do you think he should resign?
A senior Republican official told CBS News, based on Tuesday's lunch discussions with Senate Republicans and conversations with senators throughout the afternoon, that the package will likely include roughly $50 billion in assistance for airlines, $250 to $300 billion in small business loans, and $250 billion in direct payments for Americans to be paid in April.
He had two previous non-violent convictions; which were both later vacated. But because of those two convictions, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for his third conviction.
MARGARET BRENNAN: He campaigned for you. The contrition you heard there, is that enough for you to say he does not need to resign?
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the caveat seems to be in the case of the President, you're saying, no, it's actually a tactic that can be to his benefit.
CHARLIE D'AGATA (CBS News Foreign Correspondent/@charliecbs): At full sprint we raced through a desert wasteland of former ISIS territory in eastern Syria toward the last sliver of land still under the group's control. Years of battle etched on the face of our chain-smoking escort behind the wheel. Up the stairs in a bombed-out home, the rooftop provides a glimpse of the final ISIS village of Baghuz Fawqani. Women in black burqas, trucks, motorcycles, daily life of all that's left in the dying days of this so-called caliphate.

MetLife's variable annuities replacement business garnered it around $152 million in commissions over the period, FINRA said.
The request comes as the Senate takes up Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package this week, which would include a third round of stimulus checks that would direct $1,400 to millions of eligible Americans. Congress distributed $1,200 checks a year ago under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and sent an additional $600 payment in December as part of a broader stimulus bill. The senators didn't specify an amount they are seeking for monthly direct aid.
In Calera, neighbors don't know what to think about West's slaying.
Taxpayers aren't exactly getting rich from the IRS interest payments on late refunds, given that the agency's interest rate is 3%. The average amount of interest paid to taxpayers for late refunds was $18, according to the Washington Post.
If you had a large business loss but no other income last year, you could potentially wind up owing no taxes. A taxpayer could even use a large loss from 2020 to offset income for prior years, potentially getting tax refunds for, say, 2019 or 2018, said Robert Caplan, a partner at Caplan & Wong CPAs in San Mateo, California.
Those expecting to claim either credit should be prepared to wait a little longer to get their refund, as the law requires the IRS to hold these refunds as it verifies claimants' qualifications to prevent fraud.
The Treasury chief's remarks came a day after some Democrats in Congress urged the IRS to consider a filing delay given the possibility of disruption from the outbreak.
Operators that have casino-hotels in other states likely have begun sending notices to some workers at those properties to draw them to Las Vegas temporarily, McCall said. It would be hard to hire short-term replacement workers locally because unemployment is low in Las Vegas.
Instead, current and former tenants of the Queens buildings told the AP that they were subjected to extensive construction, with banging, drilling, dust and leaking water that they believe were part of targeted harassment to get them to leave and clear the way for higher-paying renters.

Joaquin Flores, a special education teacher, said he believed he would support the deal unless it weakened health care or didn't go far enough to reduce class size.
People may be working one week and not the next week, so if you look at one week's worth of data you dramatically undercount the workforce, Stephane Kasriel, CEO of the freelancing platform Upwork, told CBS MoneyWatch. A substantial part of the workforce is moonlighting.
Gerovassili insisted that Greece would honor its bailout commitments, but she accused the IMF of dragging its feet during the negotiations.
Older populations don't innovate and invest for the future, they just draw down resources they have already accumulated, Mosher said. Some countries have years of inventory of homes that may never be occupied again because there simply aren't people to occupy them. It's a drag on the economy.
Wow. Just like that, Duncan said,
Ventilators in particular are a concern, since orders for them at health care facilities will increase as the Coronavirus continues to spread. The Trump administration has been unable to say how many ventilators it thinks the country will need in the weeks and months ahead.
Decoste attorney Barry Greff insisted the IRS fraud estimates were vastly overblown. He said even the loot and cash recovered at the house was meager compared to the government's loss figures in the tens of millions of dollars.
For a decade now, nine southern states - North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas - together have accounted for a larger share of the U.S. economy than nine northern states that defined America as the 20th century's industrial superpower, according to a Reuters analysis of federal data.
Almost enough to close the deficit that year, Mulvaney said. And we don't assume an additional penny of that being closed as part of our tax reform.
There is a risk that the Senate could look to make alterations to the House bill, though we expect that the pressure to act rapidly, and the bipartisan nature of the current text, will reduce the likelihood of changes, Height Securities analysts Clayton Allen and Hunter Hammond said in a report.
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act barred workers from deducting unreimbursed work expenses — anything from news subscriptions to business travel to union dues — from their income. Jegede suggests that anyone who spent money on their work-from-home set up ask if their employer can reimburse the cost. The business can deduct it, but the employee can't, she noted.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Gayle's interview comes as the scandals involving the top three state-elected officials in Virginia near meltdown proportions. Now Virginia Democrats are calling for Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax to quit following accusations of sexual misconduct and now rape. As the governor, attorney general, and Republican leader in the State Senate struggle to deal with racially insensitive photos from their past, we'll talk with two Democrats from the Virginia congressional delegation, Jennifer Wexton and Don Beyer. Then, as the deadline nears for a deal to keep the government from shutting down again, what's the status of negotiations? We'll ask a key conservative in the House, North Carolina's Mark Meadows.
West, 42, was found dead outside her home near Birmingham, and authorities are now faced with a question: Did West's online activities play a role in her death?
The contracts of 50,000 members of the Culinary Union who work at 34 different casino-resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and downtown Las Vegas are set to expire at midnight May 31. Half of those workers cast ballots Tuesday, a majority of whom authorized a strike at any time starting June 1. Individual casino operating companies and the union have failed to reach agreements through negotiations that began in February.
It's not that easy to get rid of it, Goldwein said. In fact I should say, it's impossible to get rid of it. It's not that easy to reduce it.
If you have one situation that can cause problems, it's children of divorced parents, said Mark Jaeger, director of tax development at TaxAct. Sometimes they may not understand who should be claiming what child, and it causes some complexities.
Mulvaney thinks a simpler tax code will help close the gap-- he reasons that one of the biggest reasons people don't pay taxes is that they don't want to or are unsure how. Much of the White House's pitch for tax cuts hinges not necessarily on cuts, but on how the plan -- still in a preliminary stage -- would make filing taxes simpler for the average American.
A week into tax season, the U.S.' tax collector appears woefully behind its own projections on processing tax returns and refunds.
GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM: --that we haven't seen certainly in my lifetime.
In the nine northern states total private sector jobs as of 2015 remained 1.3 percent below their 2000 level, according to federal data. The transition dates back to the 1980s, when German and Japanese automakers began investing in what has become a sprawling, regional industry.
CHARLIE ROSE: When you look at the future, your own future -- are there things that you want to accomplish? Are there goals that still are there for you?

Reynolds has been representing himself. In a Wednesday filing, he argued that one year of probation would be an appropriate sentence. Prosecutors argued earlier that he deserves at least two years behind bars because he had flouted the law for so long. The maximum sentence is four years in prison.
MARGARET TALEV (Bloomberg News/@margarettalev): But-- well, you know, some-- to some extent, what's going on in Virginia is really about these three politicians and they're kind of youth or semi-youth catching up to them. But if you're following 2020, it's so hard to miss the preview of what's to come, you've got this potentially huge Democratic field with cross sections that involve a lot of women, a handful of African-American candidates, and a lot of older white men who have had decades of yearbooks and past statements and-- and sort of generational political shifts where things like three strikes you're out or, you know, whatever, the way you talk about crime, the way you talk about welfare have changed over the years. And so, to some extent, I think it does give us a-- a preview and gives the Democratic Party a preview of the pitfalls of zero tolerance, and also the kind of traps of saying we're going to hold ourselves to a higher standard than-- than President Trump or-- or his party.
Voting rights advocates have denounced the court's opinion.
REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: You know I have been. And-- and here's one of the things that I would reach out to my Democrat colleagues. If once and for all you're wanting to work in a bipartisan manner, to return the power back to Congress, I'm willing-- I'm-- I'm willing to do that even now with this President, with our President's party in-- in the White House, I'm willing to do that. But until we do that, why should we allow a Democrat president in the White House to use executive orders and-- and not do the same with a Republican president. I've put forth measures that would actually eliminate some of the executive branch power.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --with David Pecker or AMI?
With many businesses last year losing money and even closing, Congress has increased the amount of losses a business owner can use to offset their income.
