Erin Schaff/The New York Times More than a week before President Trump called Georgia's secretary of state, pressuring him to find votes to help overturn his electoral loss, the president made another call, this one to a top Georgia elections investigator, in which he asked the investigator to find the fraud in the state. The earlier phone call, which came to light on Saturday, along with the revelation that White House officials pushed Atlanta's top federal prosecutor to resign, underlined a broader push by Mr. Trump to overturn election results in the state. Mr. Trump's phone call, made in late December, was first reported by The Washington Post. The content of the Post report was verified by a state elections official who requested anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak about the matter. In the call, Mr. Trump said the investigator would be a national hero for finding evidence of fraud. At the time, Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger's office was conducting an audit of more than 15,000 ballots in Cobb County, a populous suburb of Atlanta that was formerly a Republican stronghold but voted against Mr. Trump in both 2016 and 2020.", "augmented": []}

The single largest donation that Chainalysis found, which was worth around $250,000 at the time, went to a Bitcoin wallet owned by Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist who was at the Capital building on Jan. 6 and who called for violence before the event. Mr. Fuentes has previously mocked journalists on Twitter who asked him about his involvement in the event.

There is no precedent for the Senate holding an impeachment trial after a president has left office, but it has done so for other government officials. Democrats who control the House can choose when to send their article of impeachment to the Senate, at which point that chamber would have to immediately move to begin the trial. But even if the House transmitted the charge to the other side of the Capitol right away, an agreement between Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate would be needed to take it up before Jan. 19, a day before Mr. Biden is inaugurated. Since Mr. McConnell said on Wednesday that he would not agree, the trial cannot start until after Mr. Biden is president. That could clog the Senate floor in the early days of Mr. Biden's administration, at a time when he will be eager to have the chamber confirm members of his cabinet. Would impeaching Trump disqualify him from holding office again? Conviction in an impeachment trial would not automatically disqualify Mr. Trump from future public office. But if the Senate were to convict him, the Constitution allows a subsequent vote to bar an official from holding any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.

Credit... Nic Antaya/Getty Images Ford Motor Company said on Wednesday that it sold about two million cars and light trucks last year, a decline of 15 percent from 2019, roughly in line with the broader auto industry. The coronavirus pandemic sharply slowed sales for automakers as people stayed away from dealerships and companies were forced to shut down factories for nearly two months last spring. Ford's sales were also affected by company's decision to phase out most sedans, including the Fusion and Fiesta, from its U.S. lineup. Ford said sales in the fourth quarter fell 10 percent. Cars made up just 7 percent of total sales; the rest were trucks and sport-utility vehicles. The company said its shift to focus on larger vehicles is paying off. Sales of sport utility vehicles, which generate much more profit for automakers than sedans, rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, Ford began selling a redesigned version of its F-150 pickup truck, which has long been the top selling vehicle in the United States.

Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation).

This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld.

In an unsigned article titled Donald Trump's Final Days, the Journal's editorial page — a bellwether for the conservative establishment — excoriated the president for an assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election and said this week has probably finished him as a serious political figure. If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign, the Journal wrote, concluding, It is best for everyone, himself included, if he goes away quietly. The Journal's editorial page, led by the editor Paul Gigot, has criticized Mr. Trump in the past, sometimes harshly.

With such a system in place, health officials could warn the public in affected areas and institute new measures to contend with the variant — such as using better masks, contact tracing, closing schools or temporary lockdowns — and do so early, rather than waiting until a new surge flooded hospitals with the sick. The incoming Biden administration may be open to the idea. The president-elect supports a national testing program that can help stop the spread of Covid-19 and find variants, said T.J.

Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called Gov. Brian Kemp, urging him to convene a special session of the Georgia legislature in hopes that lawmakers would overturn the election results. Mr. Kemp and Mr. Raffensperger have rejected all of Mr. Trump's efforts to get them to help him overturn the election results, even though both are conservative Republicans.

The monthly deficit in December — $140 billion — was more than 10 times the size of the deficit the government ran in the same month a year earlier, and it broke a record set in the 2009 recession. The first three months of the fiscal year 2021, which began in October, have seen the nation run a deficit of nearly $600 billion in total — also a record, Treasury officials said. The fiscal year 2020 deficit was a record-smashing $3.1 trillion. Lawmakers responded to the pandemic-induced recession with trillions of dollars in government spending, including direct aid to individuals and businesses, tax cuts for corporations and increased spending on health efforts to combat the spread of the virus.

The vast majority of those sales were delivered from Target stores, which analysts say helped the company avoid some of the shipping delays caused by an overload of e-commerce orders. Fulfilling online orders from stores is also more profitable than paying to have items shipped through carriers like FedEx and UPS. Target's holiday results are further evidence of the growing gap between large retailers that are emerging from the pandemic stronger and more dominant and others that are failing and not likely to survive.", "augmented": []}

Karim Sahib/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images An outbreak of at least four new coronavirus infections occurred on a September flight from Dubai to Auckland, New Zealand, despite numerous containment measures, researchers reported on Wednesday, suggesting that airlines may need to tighten their precautions still further to prevent in-flight transmission. The new infections were detected after the plane landed in New Zealand, which requires incoming travelers to quarantine for 14 days before entering the community. The analysis, led by researchers at the New Zealand Ministry of Health, found that seven of the passengers tested positive during their quarantine, and at least four appeared to have been newly infected on the flight. The passengers came from five countries, and five had tested negative at different points before boarding. They were seated within four rows of each other for the 18-hour duration of the flight, and the viruses they carried were virtually identical genetically — a strong indication that one person initiated the outbreak. The findings are not definitive, cautioned the authors, led by Tara Swadi of the health ministry. But, they wrote, they underscore the value of considering all international passengers arriving in New Zealand as being potentially infected, even if pre-departure testing was undertaken, social distancing and spacing were followed, and personal protective equipment was used in-flight.", "augmented": []}

We condemn it, the president and this administration, in the strongest possible terms. It is unacceptable. And those that broke the law should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. What we saw yesterday was a group of violent rioters undermining the legitimate First Amendment rights of the many thousands who came to peacefully have their voices heard in our nation's capital. Those who violently besieged our Capitol are the opposite of everything this administration stands for. The core value of our administration is the idea that all citizens have the right to live in safety, peace and freedom.

James Tensuan for The New York Times The Labor Department on Wednesday released the final version of a rule that could classify millions of workers in industries like construction, cleaning and the gig economy as contractors rather than employees, another step under the Trump administration toward endorsing the business practices of companies like Uber and Lyft. Companies don't have to pay contractors a minimum wage or overtime and don't have to pay a share of contractors' Social Security taxes or contribute to unemployment insurance on their behalf. By contrast, companies that hire employees must provide them with those benefits and protections, which can raise labor costs 20 to 30 percent, according to estimates from industry officials. This rule brings long-needed clarity for American workers and employers, the labor secretary, Eugene Scalia, said in a statement, adding that the rule makes it easier to identify legitimate employees while recognizing and respecting the entrepreneurial spirit of workers who choose to pursue the freedom associated with being an independent contractor. The rule is scheduled to take effect on March 8, which will allow the incoming Biden administration to postpone it and perhaps set it aside.", "augmented": []}

Ariana Drehsler for The New York Times With no robust system to identify genetic variations of the coronavirus, experts warn that the United States is woefully ill-equipped to track a dangerous new mutant, leaving health officials blind as they try to combat the grave threat. The variant, which is now surging in Britain and burdening its hospitals with new cases, is rare for now in the United States. But it has the potential to explode in the next few weeks, putting new pressures on American hospitals, some of which are already near the breaking point. The United States has no large-scale, nationwide system for checking coronavirus genomes for new mutations, including the ones carried by the new variant. About 1.4 million people test positive for the virus each week, but researchers are only doing genome sequencing — a method that can definitively spot the new variant — on fewer than 3,000 of those weekly samples. And that work is done by a patchwork of academic, state and commercial laboratories. Scientists say that a national surveillance program would be able to determine just how widespread the new variant is and help contain emerging hot spots, extending the crucial window of time in which vulnerable people across the country could get vaccinated.", "augmented": []}

In its privacy policies, Flo had repeatedly promised users that it would protect private details about their menstruation cycles and fertility, and that the data would be used only to provide services to them, according to a complaint filed by The Federal Trade Commission. Instead, federal regulators said, Flo shared sensitive health details on millions of users for years with numerous third parties — including Facebook's and Google's analytics units, as well as with two mobile analytics services, AppsFlyer and Flurry. The private data included information related to users' periods, pregnancies and childbirths, the complaint said. Moreover, Flo did not put limits on how Facebook, Google and other companies could use the women's health information, federal regulators said, giving the third parties the ability to use the data for advertising and other purposes. The proposed federal settlement prohibits the app's developer, Flo Health, from misleading users about its data-handling practices.

The next big push is to bring those online and make sure the governors have those available really to hopefully expand out to much larger swathes of individuals, said Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services. Some states have already begun using their pharmacies to give out vaccines, mainly to health care workers and older people. The program being activated this week, which was announced in November without a time table for its launch, is a partnership with 19 pharmacy chains and associations, including Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and Costco. States will be able to allocate doses of vaccines directly to these pharmacies, which can then give out the vaccines to high-risk groups designated by each state. Across the country, 40,000 pharmacy locations have enrolled to participate in the program, although in the first days of the program, only a few thousand pharmacies are expected to begin giving out vaccines.", "augmented": []}

Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation).

This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits.

If the Legislature approves the idea, the state payments will roughly equal the federal ones established in the stimulus package Congress approved last month. It provides individual adults with an adjusted gross income of up to $75,000 for 2019 with a $600 payment. There is also a $600 federal payment for each child under 17 in families who meet those requirements.

The W.H.O. has discussed sending an investigative team to Wuhan since last January, but the Chinese government has delayed those plans while promoting flimsy theories that the outbreak started outside of China. Last summer, two W.H.O. experts were allowed into China to negotiate the terms of the investigation, but they did not go to Wuhan. The Chinese government has yet to release crucial information about its own internal investigations into the virus's origins, including data from animal samples taken in and around Wuhan. Most scientists say the virus probably jumped to humans from an animal, probably a bat. They say that solving the mystery of its origin is critical to preventing future pandemics and helping to develop vaccines and treatments. In the absence of more solid information, numerous conspiracy theories about the virus have flourished. China has largely, but not entirely, subdued the virus within its borders.

Many payments have been sent to inactive or temporary accounts that taxpayers don't have access to. It's not clear how many people are affected, but the tax preparation company Jackson Hewitt said the Internal Revenue Service had sent payments to more than 13 million bank accounts that were no longer open or valid.

Companies like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt sometimes set up temporary accounts for clients when they prepare returns. For example, clients who opts to have preparation fees deducted from their refund may be issued one of these accounts, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest.

The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction?

Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:34 - 0:00 transcript Biden Outlines $1.9 Trillion Economic Rescue Package President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a spending package to combat the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. The plan includes $1,400 direct payments to individuals and more generous unemployment benefits. During this pandemic, millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. Millions of Americans never thought they'd be out of work — many of them never even envisioned the idea — are facing eviction, waiting for hours in their cars to feed their families as they drive up to a food bank. A growing chorus of top economists agree that the moment of crisis — in this moment of crisis, with interest rates at historic lows, we cannot afford inaction. Our rescue plan also includes immediate relief to Americans hardest hit and most in need. We will finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in cash relief to people who need it the most. The $600 already appropriated is simply not enough. One in seven households in America, more than one in five Black and Latino households in America, report they don't have enough food to eat.

In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction?

How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more.

Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions.

For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021.

Officer Brian D. Sicknick died at about 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, the Capitol Police said in a statement. He had been with the agency since 2008.
