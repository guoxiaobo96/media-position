With the Taliban controlling some of the road network around Ghazni, citizens have long felt vulnerable. But during a recent visit, I kept hearing an even greater sense of defenselessness. Many here fear a full-on effort by the Taliban to seize the city could come at any time.

James Estrin/The New York Times Laura Engle, 78, lives alone in an apartment in Midtown Manhattan. She uses a walker and has a chronic lung disease. She is exactly the kind of person who most needs a coronavirus vaccine. Yet she has found it impossible to make an appointment and has become lost in the confusing system set up by the city and the state. Computer-literate, she navigated New York City's vaccine finder page on Monday, found the closest provider and sent an email with her name and phone number to set up an appointment. When no one called, she reached out to the urgent care's corporate office, which told her to wait. She wanted to register at the new Javits Center megasite, which she had heard about on the news, but couldn't figure out how. I'm willing to wait my turn, she said, frustrated, but I would like to have some feeling that I have a turn. Millions of older New Yorkers started the week with optimism that they would finally gain access to a vaccine after months of fearing they would fall victim to the coronavirus. But the reality of actually getting the shots has proved maddening.
What this means is that we've established a basically vicious system under which children can't get the help they need unless their parents find jobs that don't exist. And a growing body of evidence says that this system is destructive as well as cruel.
Virus drains $2.5 billion from N.Y.C. property tax revenue. A Courtyard Marriott is boarded up after closing in Manhattan. Credit... Gabby Jones for The New York Times As New York City officials fight to control the coronavirus by this summer, it is becoming clear that the economic fallout will last far longer: The city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, the largest such drop in at least three decades. The anticipated shortfall, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, is largely driven by a projected drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties, which have all but emptied out since the pandemic began. Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate, and the economic projections suggest the city's budget will remain in a precarious position for the foreseeable future. For now, the city will partially offset the loss with increased revenues from income taxes: The rich got richer, according to a slide from the mayor's presentation. But the city will still likely have to substantially cut spending elsewhere. This is just a total economic dislocation for certain industries, the mayor said. We've never seen anything like what's happened to the hotel industry. We've never seen Midtown in the situation it is now. Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who have battled with the Trump administration for more federal aid, have expressed optimism that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., together with a Democratic-led Congress, will bring substantial assistance.
The owners, who are moving to Italy, opted for a contemporary aesthetic in the renovations, led by Vivian Calissi, a local interior designer. They used a mostly muted palette in the finishes and textured wall coverings, with bursts of color in the artwork and accessories, outfitting the spacious rooms with modern Italian furnishings.
It is the country's 40th largest television market, best known as a destination for tourists and gamblers, and has a population heavy on retirees and service industry workers, who are unlikely candidates to spend thousands of dollars on season tickets. The city had little hockey tradition; it has hosted minor league teams but has few ice rinks or youth leagues.
At the same time, few on Wall Street seem to think Democrats will prioritize tax increases, which had previously been seen as a potential risk of a Democratic sweep. Now you have the potential for more stimulus, even possibly an infrastructure spend, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at the investment management firm Invesco on Thursday. So, I think the stock market is enthused right now. And that enthusiasm is pretty strong. Gains continued in other financial markets too. Oil prices continued to rally, with West Texas Intermediate rising more than 3 percent to $52.52 a barrel. A surge earlier in the week, which came after Saudi Arabia said it would cut production, means oil prices rose more than 8 percent this week. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note also continued to rise, reaching 1.11 percent on Thursday. The rise in yields most likely reflects expectations that the Treasury will be issuing large amounts of debt to finance renewed government spending. Kevin Granville and

Nevertheless, it is evident that the loss was the result of a combination of factors, all of which are evidence of a consistent problem that T.I. has had in the consumer electronics business. In digital watches and calculators, T.I. helped drive prices so low that it ruined the business, even for itself.
The margin of victory in Uttar Pradesh was the largest seen by any party in more than 30 years. It gives Mr. Modi a significant advantage in the national elections in 2019, which in turn would bring him closer to his long-term goal of becoming a leader of historic significance, steering India away from its more socialist, secular past.
But for their part, Ms. Pelosi and her new majority are concerned about presenting a united front against Mr. Trump's challenges to constitutional authority. With the president's wall having become a flash point, the political costs to Democrats for cutting a deal seen as advantageous to Mr. Trump would be steep.
The Constitution is a remarkable document, of which some parts remain opaque and in need of constant interpretation, but the question of fair use of tax dollars is profoundly clear.
American arts institutions ought not to give up their independence for crumbs. For now, especially as the pandemic subsides, the more urgent task is to encourage a richer cultural offering at the local level. A nimbler and more practicable solution to do that is with a White House Office for Culture, akin to the National Economic Council or the Domestic Policy Council, that could research and coordinate arts policy across the federal government.
To compensate, the package contains deep cuts in entitlement programs that would hit hardest many of the economically strained voters who propelled the president into office. Over the next decade, it calls for slashing more than $800 billion from Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor, while slicing $192 billion from nutritional assistance and $272 billion over all from welfare programs. And domestic programs outside of military and homeland security whose budgets are determined annually by Congress would also take a hit, their funding falling by $57 billion, or 10.6 percent.
The result was a decline in assistance for the poor children who needed it most.

Britain has banned travelers from Portugal and Latin America, citing concern about a new variant of the coronavirus. Credit... Niklas Halle'N/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Britain said on Thursday that it would ban arrivals from Latin American countries and Portugal over fears of a coronavirus variant discovered in Brazil. In recent weeks, British authorities have already struggled to contain the spread of a different coronavirus variant discovered in Britain that is more contagious than its predecessors. At least two coronavirus variants are currently circulating in Brazil, and at least one has slipped its borders, traveling to Japan. Japanese authorities found one of those variants in four people traveling from Brazil earlier this week. The variant contains a mutation that has been linked with higher contagiousness, similar to the variant found in Britain and another in South Africa. Like the variant found in South Africa, the one exported from Brazil to Japan also carries a mutation that may weaken the efficacy of vaccines. This same mutation has also been identified in the other coronavirus variant recently discovered in Brazil. Experts have cautioned, however, that it would be very difficult for new variants of the coronavirus to evade vaccines entirely. The British ban is set to come into effect on Friday at 4 a.m., the transportation secretary Grant Shapps said on Twitter.
This year, the governor's arguably two most popular proposals — the legalization of pot and mobile sports betting — will require resolving disagreements with legislative leaders over how best to implement them.
No sooner was Jair Bolsonaro sworn in as president of Brazil on New Year's Day than he let loose a fountain of far-right decrees, undermining protections for the environment, indigenous land rights and the L.G.B.T. community, putting nongovernmental organizations under government monitoring and purging government contractors who do not share his ideology. This thrilled Donald Trump, who tweeted enthusiastically, Congratulations to President @JairBolsonaro who just made a great inauguration speech — the U.S.A. is with you!

On the same day, he abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, effectively declaring an end to the era of multinational trade agreements. He said the decision would protect American workers, but some worry that such moves will allow China to fill the economic vacuum.
There are also smaller-bore projects, some of which the governor has already debuted: On Sunday, Mr. Cuomo said he wanted the High Line — a pedestrian walkway in Manhattan on a former elevated train track — extended to connect to the newly opened Moynihan Train Hall, a project that he hoped would spur development in the surrounding neighborhoods, already some of the city's richest.
But the customs police now say that he evaded $51,732 in taxes owed on the sale. The director general of the customs police, Moinul Khan, said on Thursday that the police were seeking authorization to charge Mr. Priesner with tax evasion and, because he received the proceeds through a foreign bank account, with money laundering.
Second, and perhaps more important, administration officials appear to be counting on the agreement to revive business investment in the United States, which has fallen in recent quarters after surging in the first half of 2018. The uncertainty that Mr. Trump and the Chinese sowed as they imposed escalating tariffs on each other's imports was largely to blame for that sluggishness, many companies and economists have said.
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two injections, separated by three or four weeks, and they aren't believed to fully kick in until about a week or two after a person receives the second shot. Capitol Hill has long struggled to control the spread of the pandemic within its marble walls, a haphazard effort exacerbated last week as hundreds of maskless Trump supporters stormed the building and forced lawmakers to shelter in confined secure locations across the Capitol complex. Lawmakers, aides and reporters who took shelter in two separate rooms on both sides of the Capitol have been warned about possible exposure to the coronavirus. Though cases have continued to emerge since the 117th Congress was sworn in nearly two weeks ago, House Democrats have blamed a group of their Republican colleagues who refused to wear masks during the attack while waiting in a secure location for law enforcement to regain control of the building. Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat of New Jersey, Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, and Brad Schneider, Democrat of Illinois, have all tested positive in the aftermath of the attack and cited the Republican refusal to wear masks during the siege. Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, is in isolation after her husband, who was with her in the room, tested positive, and in a statement said the diagnoses were a consequence of my callous Republican colleagues who refused to wear masks.
At the heart of the case is an official named Stefan Priesner, an Austrian who headed the United Nations Development Program in Bangladesh from 2008 to 2012. When he left at the end of his tenure, Mr. Priesner sold his imported sport utility vehicle to a colleague.

Even well-intentioned urban, coastal, college-educated scribes commit obliviously condescending word choices (flyover country), illogical assumptions (everyone in red states voted for Trump) and variations on poverty porn, in which subjects are conveyed as helpless and joyless (observe this sorry case in Appalachia). To those who know something about, say, rural poverty firsthand, earnest nonfiction narratives understandably may read as voyeuristic studies predicated on the dangerous idea that we are a nation of two essentially different kinds of people.
This perception undermined support for spending on children. And it went along with a widespread belief that aid to poor families was creating a culture of dependency, which in turn was the culprit behind social collapse in America's inner cities. Partly in response, aid to families, such as it was, increasingly came with work requirements, or took the form of things like the earned-income tax credit, which is linked to earnings.
The minimum wage in New Jersey is currently $8.85, and raising it to $15 would boost the incomes of more than 1 million people in the state, according to New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal-leaning research group. The bill proposes increasing the minimum wage to $10 an hour on July 1. On Jan. 1, it would increase to $11 an hour, and then would increase by $1 an hour every year until it reaches $15 in 2024.
Not content to merely control access to the city, the insurgents have begun attacking police posts within it. The Taliban methodically extort money — they say it is taxation — from businesses in the city center, including those near the government headquarters, and an increasing number of insurgents live openly in the city. Their fighters regularly kill officials, security personnel and even traffic police officers.
And Mr. Trump's signature economic policy so far — the $1.5 trillion tax cut — is likely to widen the trade deficit in coming years by encouraging more investment in the United States, many economists say.

Of course, we shouldn't exaggerate the novelty of this. Newspapers and TV stations have long been able to decide which politicians to cover and which politicians' op-eds to publish.
On the whole, the numbers are expected to be solid. Analysts estimate that, when all the results are in for S&P 500 companies, fourth-quarter profits will have risen 15 percent over a year earlier. That would be the fifth-straight period of double-digit profit growth, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
In the two months since her election, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has had the uncanny ability for a first-term member of Congress to push the debate inside the Democratic Party sharply to the left, forcing party leaders and 2020 presidential candidates to grapple with issues that some might otherwise prefer to avoid.
New York's public schools averaged $386,000 in federal aid. But Poly Prep Country Day School, a private school in Brooklyn with more than $114 million in the bank, got a $5.83 million P.P.P. loan. Public schools in Washington, D.C., averaged $189,000 in federal funding. But a P.P.P. loan for $5.22 million went to the Sidwell Friends School, the Washington alma mater of Sasha and Malia Obama.
Pierre-Alain Conil, a partner with Morel d'Arleux, a Paris notary firm, said he worked with many fewer foreign buyers in 2020 than in previous years, and close to none for pieds-à-terre.

If that were not enough, perceived success has often boiled down to one yardstick — the tally of murders and other violent crimes — whose roots, many experts say, lie to a large extent in a stew of deeper problems beyond the reach of a police chief.

This week, as the federal government releases a second round of P.P.P. loans, watchdog groups are following the money. From its start, the $659 billion program, intended to help struggling mom-and-pop businesses and nonprofits cover their payrolls with loans backed by the Small Business Administration, has been troubled by complaints that the rich and connected had crowded out intended recipients.

Legalizing recreational marijuana, for example, is expected to generate billions of dollars in economic activity and about $300 million in tax revenue in its first year, but legalization efforts have previously fallen apart following disputes over who should get licenses and how to spend the tax money. And marijuana tax dollars would not immediately solve the state's budget crisis; much of the money wouldn't materialize until years down the road.

Americans are dying in greater numbers this year, and not just because of the virus. A casket sat in an empty room at a funeral home in Los Angeles on Sunday. Credit... Alex Welsh for The New York Times Deaths from all causes rose sharply during the second quarter of 2020 as the pandemic took hold in the United States, reaching levels last seen 75 years ago, according to provisional figures released on Thursday by the National Center for Health Statistics. Over all, the unadjusted death rate for all Americans rose to 1,033.7 per 100,000 in the second quarter of 2020, up from 850.8 per 100,000 Americans during the second quarter of 2019. The last time the death rate exceeded that figure was in 1945, the year World War II ended, when there were 1,058 deaths for every 100,000 Americans. Rates had steadily declined since then, said Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch of the center. The overall death rate attributed specifically to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was 136.2 deaths per 100,000 Americans during the three months of April, May and June of 2020. But deaths from several other leading causes, including diabetes, stroke, heart disease and hypertension, also increased. Since March, at least 400,000 more Americans have died than would have in a normal year. Deaths related to cancer, which have been declining for some time, continued to drop. The new figures also highlight the unique threat that Covid-19 poses to men.
The F.A.A.'s announcement came after unions representing aviation safety inspectors and air traffic controllers raised concerns that the lengthy shutdown was eroding the safety of the United States' air travel system.
The confusion is hardly limited to California. In New York City, a million residents who are over 65 became eligible to be vaccinated this week, but the reality of actually getting a shot has proved maddening, with buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems and a lack outreach. California, with its decentralized public health system, is a microcosm of the many problems plaguing the national vaccination effort. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti defended the decision to limit vaccinations for now to health workers, despite the state's new directive. This is really about expectations, he said Thursday. Politically, it'd be easy to say, open it up to 65-plus. But he said that would mean that a senior citizen on the city's wealthier west side, living in a large house, could easily take a spot from an essential worker who's younger and living in a crowded home, with no room to isolate. And so when health care workers in Los Angeles arrive at a vaccination site, like the one the city is set to open at Dodger Stadium on Friday, they'll have to present either an employee badge with a photo or another form of documentation of their work. California relies on county health departments like the one in Los Angeles to administer vaccines, and Dr. David Lubarsky, the chief executive of UC Davis Health, said the counties were up against the same problem they faced when trying to ramp up coronavirus testing: too little manpower.
Mr. Brown, who was elected to his third term in 2018, said the committee's first order of business would be to use congressional action to keep landlords from evicting people who could not pay their rent because of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on their finances. He said Democrats wanted to provide additional pandemic relief and work quickly to confirm President-elect Joseph R. Biden's nominees — all while an impeachment trial of President Trump could be playing out.
The number of permits plummeted in the first half of 2016, but recovered some in the second half, leading some low-income housing advocates to suggest scrapping 421-a, because it is too costly and does not focus enough on the poor tenants who need it most.

The National Health Commission reported that nine of the 144 cases recorded on Thursday involved people returning to China, but most of the new ones have spread domestically. In Shijiazhuang, a city of 11 million people where residents have been ordered to stay home since last week, the authorities have scrambled to build a large quarantine center in a rural district. The facility, which covers 82 acres, will ultimately have 3,000 trailer-like units, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Claire Fu contributed research.
Andrew Hunter, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, backed that assessment on Tuesday. The gap that opened up last year between investment and corporate profits suggests that tariff uncertainty has caused firms to delay investment plans, he wrote in a research note. He added, With the U.S.M.C.A. deal signed and the threat of further tariffs on Chinese goods seemingly off the table, that drag should now be fading.
Big banks have long resisted the idea of a public alternative to their services and have explored ways to pre-empt the creation of such a system. Early last year, for example, JPMorgan Chase officials discussed placing the company's banking services like A.T.M.s in some post offices, although the plan was abandoned when the pandemic hit. Bank lobbyists have argued that the responsibilities of financial services would overwhelm public institutions like the Postal Service and that banks can carry out the duties more efficiently themselves.

Strict safeguards should protect schools from the virus variant, experts say. Students boarding a school bus after school let out at Eneida M. Hartner Elementary School in Miami, Fla., on Monday, Nov. 30, 2020. Credit... Scott McIntyre for The New York Times When a more contagious coronavirus variant first surfaced in early December, some researchers initially suggested that unlike with previous versions of the virus, children might be just as susceptible to the new variant as adults. Recent research from Public Health England may put those fears to rest. Based on detailed contact-tracing of about 20,000 people infected with the new variant — including nearly 3,000 children under 10 — the report showed that young children were about half as likely as adults to transmit the variant to others. That was true of the previous iteration of the virus, as well. There was a lot of speculation at the beginning suggesting that children spread this variant more, said Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government. That's really not the case. But the variant does spread more easily among children, just as it does among adults. The report estimated that the new variant is about 30 percent to 50 percent more contagious than its predecessors — less than the 70 percent researchers had initially estimated, but high enough that the variant is expected to pummel the United States and other countries, as it did Britain.

For farmworkers, the base minimum wage would increase to $12.50 an hour by Jan. 1, 2024. Then, a special committee would review whether to raise those workers' minimum wage to $15 an hour.

One reason that the start to the U.S. vaccination campaign has been so sluggish is that health care workers — among the first to be eligible — have proved more reluctant to get the inoculation than expected.

Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, criticized China's handling of the pandemic at a Heritage Foundation forum on Thursday. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times The U.S. secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, excoriated China on Thursday for its bullying of international experts and scientists and acknowledged for the first time that a top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was correct when she warned in February that the novel coronavirus might cause a severe disruption to American lives. The official, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, was muzzled for nine months after issuing the Feb. 25 warning, which threw the stock market into a nosedive and infuriated President Trump, who was on his way back from India at the time. But she was merely repeating what she had learned from a White House Task Force meeting days earlier, Mr. Azar recalled. She got a little ahead of the briefing of the president and the official announcement, Mr. Azar said. But she and we were correct. Mr. Azar made his comments to the Heritage Foundation, during an online seminar that was billed as a talk about lessons learned from the pandemic. He spent much of it describing how China rebuffed offers of help from the United States — and thwarted American efforts to learn more about the virus that has now claimed more than 380,000 American lives.

The same trade policy that Trump attacks ferociously and promised to speedily replace is still in place, said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.

In response to those accusations and concerns about the spread of the virus on Capitol Hill, the House earlier this week approved a fine system for members who refuse to adhere to a mask mandate on the floor. It was unclear whether Mr. Espaillat took shelter in the secure room. But on Wednesday, he was among the lawmakers who spoke on the House floor — while wearing a mask — before voting to impeach President Trump for the second time. Mr. Espaillat noted that the colleagues who had tested positive in recent days collectively occupy a range of gender, ages, races and ethnicities. Covid-19 does not discriminate, he said. It is incumbent on each of us to prioritize social distancing from one another — even if that poses a temporary inconvenience — and wear a face mask.

Multiple studies have found that safety-net programs for children have big long-term consequences. Children who receive adequate nutrition and health care grow up to become healthier, more productive adults. And in addition to the humanitarian side of these benefits, there's a monetary payoff: Healthier adults are less likely to need public aid and are likely to pay more in taxes.

1. A failure to grasp how divided government works. The president somehow came to believe that he'd have more leverage once the Democrats took control of the House. Maybe someone convinced him that, after the transfer of power, he could shift blame for the impasse onto Speaker Nancy Pelosi — a favorite villain of Republicans. Or maybe he assumed that Pelosi & Company would fold in the face of the dysfunction and public outcry a shutdown would bring. Whatever the logic, Team Trump assumed Democrats would b ecome more pliable , and a deal would emerge.
Asked in an interview with CNBC if cuts to entitlements would ever be on his plate, Mr. Trump answered yes.
Our concern is the additional costs that are starting to pop up in the process, the mayor said on Tuesday while unveiling the city's $84.7 billion budget proposal. We put forward a proposal around 421-a, with very simple standards: Reduce exposure for taxpayers, and that means city taxpayers, because we have to pay the bill; more affordable housing; and, don't fund luxury housing. It was really simple.
At the same time, Mr. Biden is keen on addressing the racial disparities in health that have been exposed by the pandemic, which has disproportionately claimed the lives of people of color. He pledged to increase funding for community health centers, and also intends to fund efforts to mitigate the pandemic in prisons and jails, where African-Americans and Latinos are overrepresented.

The Moderna vaccine was ultimately given an emergency green light from the Food and Drug Administration as a two-dose vaccine of 100 micrograms of mRNA each. Trial volunteers who got lower doses might especially benefit from a third shot, said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. In its statement, Moderna said that boosters might also be studied in people who took part in its later, Phase 3 study of 30,000 participants, if accumulating antibody persistence data indicate that this is warranted. Company officials said at a conference this week that they thought protection should last at least a year, according to a report by CNBC. But Moderna's chief executive, Stephane Bancel, also noted in an interview with CNBC that the vaccine might have to be adjusted in the future to immunize people against new coronavirus variants or strains, much like flu vaccines are regularly revamped. Denise Grady and
Unfortunately, Mr. Trump has been spoiled by two years of Congress being led by weak-kneed members of his party who, even when troubled by his excesses, largely let him run amok, lest he call down upon them the wrath of the Republican base.
We now know that it is essential to harden the boundaries that future presidents must abide by and provide specific legal remedies when they fail to do so. We must require the release of tax returns before running for president and that the president's assets be placed in a blind trust during his or her presidency.
Unemployment rate By Ella Koeze · Seasonally adjusted · Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics Hiring has slowed every month since June, and the economy lost more than nine million jobs in 2020 as a whole, the first calendar-year decline since 2010 and the worst on a percentage basis since the aftermath of World War II. Congress last month passed a $900 billion relief package that will provide temporary support to households and businesses and could give a boost to the broader economy. And in the longer run, the arrival of coronavirus vaccines should allow the return of activity that has been suppressed by the pandemic. But the vaccine and the aid came too late to prevent a sharp slowdown in growth. We did have a pullback in the economy, said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. If stimulus was passed earlier, maybe that could have been avoided.
This four-story house, which dates to the 19th century, is on 0.40 acre on the Rua da Junqueira, close to the riverside neighborhood of Belém in Lisbon, Portugal's capital. The house has 12 bedrooms and bathrooms, 10-foot ceilings, elaborate moldings and stonework, and an elevator. It is about five miles from the center of Lisbon, and eight miles from Lisbon's international airport.
Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the Phase 1 agreement was good news for the U.S. and the world economy. But, she said, there remains considerable uncertainly for businesses using China as a platform for products destined for the U.S. market, and we will continue to see the impact of this in slower investment and higher business costs.

To help remove that burden, Mr. Brown called for a 36 percent cap on interest rates for payday loans. At the moment, rate caps vary by state.
None of that seemed to matter to voters laboring under an economic collapse, a crime wave and a corruption scandal that undermined any faith in the political establishment. Mr. Bolsonaro's promise of change, any change, was enough to sweep him into office with 55 percent of the vote in October. The language of his inaugural address — I come before the nation today, a day in which the people have rid themselves of socialism, the inversion of values, statism and political correctness — was music to the ears of his reactionary base, investors and Mr. Trump, who shares his values and his bluster. The stock market soared to record highs and the Brazilian real strengthened against the dollar.
Mr. Hogan recently said, for example, that by leaving the European Union, the British people were trading in a Rolls-Royce for a used sedan. The statement was seen as particularly cheeky coming from an Irishman who will also be responsible for negotiating a trade deal with Britain as part of its withdrawal from the European Union, a herculean task.

His actions were a sad but not unexpected performance by Brazil's new leader, a onetime military officer whose 27 years in the Brazilian Congress were notable only for crude insults to women, sexual minorities and blacks. A good criminal is a dead criminal, he declared; he promised to send red outlaws to prison or exile; he dedicated his vote to impeach former president Dilma Rousseff to the military officer responsible for her torture under the former military dictatorship.
Mr. Bolsonaro returned the love, tweeting back, Together, under God's protection, we shall bring prosperity and progress to our people!
I still say exactly what many people have said for the past few months — that schools should be the last thing to close, said Helen Jenkins, an infectious disease expert at Boston University. Keeping schools open carries some risk, but I think it can be reduced substantially with all the mitigations in place, she said.
Mike Lowry, a former five-term Democratic member of Congress whose one term as governor of Washington State was tarnished by sexual harassment allegations, died on Monday. He was 78.
Now, there is an activist in the White House and many of those same executives have been making pilgrimages to Trump Tower and the White House, hoping their business plans don't get swept away by the changes made by the new president.
Buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems that act in parallel but do not link together and a lack of outreach is causing exasperation and exhaustion among older New Yorkers and others trying to set up vaccination appointments. It is also stymying New York's efforts to get the vaccine to many of the city's most vulnerable, creating a situation that risks exacerbating the inequalities that Covid-19 has already laid painfully bare. The race to vaccinate millions of New Yorkers has reached a critical point, as officials on Wednesday announced that two cases of a more contagious variant of the virus first detected in Britain had been found in New York City, one in Manhattan and one in Queens. The state has used 35 percent of its available vaccine, in line with the national average in a rollout that has gone far slower than expected nationwide. New York City has distributed 38 percent of its shots, with 491,000 available doses as of Thursday. But in the race to get shots in arms, some say the bigger picture about exactly whose arms should be prioritized has been lost. Here we are, facing a global pandemic, with thousands of New Yorkers who have lost their lives, and who is again the forgotten group of people? The very people who need help the most, said Mark Treyger, a city councilman from Brooklyn who said his office had been inundated with calls from family members trying to get appointments for their parents.
The mayor this week selected Michael Harrison as the city's fifth police chief in four years, and asked him to try to solve a list of persistent problems that chased most of the others from the job. Among the tasks: Reducing one of the nation's highest murder rates; building trust among residents who widely view the department as racist, corrupt and indifferent; and earning the support of rank-and-file officers.
In fact, we are a nation of essentially similar people shaped by vastly different circumstances of place, wealth, education and culture. Those best able to document our socioeconomic divide with humility and accuracy typically have occupied more than one class, remain connected to the one they left and attribute any upward mobility to good fortune rather than to personal exceptionalism.
Punishing tariffs on European steel and aluminum remain in place. The administration continues to dangle the threat of duties on European cars, which would be economically devastating for the Continent. Europeans are deeply alarmed by what they regard as the president's recklessness in the Middle East.
Despite Mr. Trump's frequent promises to reduce the trade deficit, many economists believe that his trade policies will be largely powerless to reverse the trend. That's because the overall trade deficit is governed by macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. So while changes in trade policy can shift imports and exports from one country to another, for example, reducing the American trade deficit with China while increasing its trade deficit with Thailand, they are unlikely to reduce the American trade deficit overall.
WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Administration is bringing thousands of furloughed inspectors and other employees back to work as the partial government shutdown drags on, the agency said Tuesday.
I started in my late 20s, when I had a little bit of money (and no children). I didn't know enough to pick individual stocks, so I figured mutual funds were the way to go. In researching what to buy, I was stunned to learn that most actively managed mutual funds never beat the benchmark that they were being judged against, a reality that remains true today.
An arts center inside the executive office of the president — led, why not, by a Dr. Fauci of culture — could be sharper and swifter than a full department. This team could help Treasury create cultural tax policy, advise the Education Department on music instruction, liaise with Congress on arts stimulus. Importantly, it could ensure that stimulus funds for states and municipalities, whose budgets have been pitted by shutdown-induced tax shortfalls, shore up and eventually strengthen local arts organizations. (Almost no one has been hurt more by Covid than our artists, said Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York this week, when he announced a public-private partnership supporting the state's arts organizations.)
Mr. Kraft said the market has performed much better than expected given the circumstances. Paris is still a seller's market, he said, provided prices are realistic. High-end properties in good condition, especially those with outdoor space, are in demand, while homes in need of renovation or in less desirable areas won't sell. In the end, our 2020 results will be equal to those of 2019 (a record year), and this despite 3 months of enforced inactivity during the lockdowns! he wrote in an email.
His troubles are a ground-level indicator of what economists say is the biggest financial threat to Iraq since Saddam Hussein's time. Iraq is running out of money to pay its bills. That has created a financial crisis with the potential to destabilize the government — which was ousted a year ago after mass protests over corruption and unemployment — touch off fighting among armed groups, and empower Iraq's neighbor and longtime rival, Iran.
They also noted that Mr. Trump had waged his trade wars on fronts well beyond North America and China. New trade battles loom this year, including one between the United States and France over a French push to impose a new tax that hits American tech giants like Google and Amazon.
Singling out Mr. Trump and his administration, Democrats said that they were making good on promises to voters across the country who vaulted them into the majority with demands to clean up corruption and influence-peddling in Republican-controlled Washington.
On Capitol Hill, Democrats tried to use leverage of their own to force Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to come to the table and pressure Mr. Trump. On Monday, Democrats said they would vote against advancing a package of bipartisan Middle East policy bills slated for consideration this week unless Republicans allowed a vote on bills to reopen shuttered federal departments already passed by the House — a decision that could scuttle its prospects if Democrats stick together.
NEW DELHI — Prime Minister Narendra Modi led his party to a landslide victory in India's largest state on Saturday, consolidating his power and putting him in a strong position to win re-election in 2019.
One of his targets is the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Kathleen Kraninger, whom Mr. Brown said he had advised during a phone call to resign. A bureau spokeswoman said that the two had last spoken on Dec. 10 and that Mr. Brown had thanked Ms. Kraninger for keeping him informed of the bureau's actions and rationale. Ms. Kraninger, the spokeswoman said, informed Senator Brown that she was supporting the requests from the transition team and how she would continue to carry out the bureau's mission.
The bullish case for the China agreement is that it will ease that uncertainty. Some economists say the U.S.M.C.A. could do the same. For months, administration officials have touted a study by the United States International Trade Commission that predicted that the North American trade deal could raise growth by 0.35 percent, largely by reducing uncertainty over trade in digital services.
His candidacy has been called Trump-like. Wynalda rejects the label, but he also has spent months eviscerating the very organization he hopes to soon lead, and he has insisted that he alone has the skills to run an organization with more than $125 million in annual revenues most effectively, even though he spent part of the last decade warding off creditors during a period of personal financial turbulence revealed by public records and not previously reported.
Two bedrooms, including the master with en-suite bath, are on the first floor. Five more bedrooms, two with their own bathrooms, are on the second floor. The remaining bedrooms are on the third floor, and were once servants' quarters.
The fast start by the Golden Knights has, for now, allayed fears that the N.H.L.'s decision to put another team in a desert city would lead to financial trouble. (See: Coyotes, Arizona.) Commissioner Gary Bettman has for years pushed for new teams in the Sun Belt, with mixed success, and aiming for Las Vegas, in particular, seemed like an overreach.
Dr. Lubarsky suggested that the state should hand more vaccine doses over to health care providers, who already have the ability to reach out to patients selectively, including harder-to-reach patients like those with lower incomes or who are undocumented. We know who's at risk, he said. Jonah Frohlich, a San Francisco-based health care consultant, said that a combination of factors had left county public health departments scrambling to cope with a deluge of monumental tasks. The same institutions that are trying to manage testing, contact tracing and supports for people, Mr. Frohlich said, are the same people who are managing the distribution of the vaccine. Worse, he said, they must work with often outdated and overwhelmed information systems, and organize it all on the fly. This is the kind of program and process that should take years to implement, he said. The counties are doing the best they can, Mr. Frohlich said, but there is a real human cost to delaying the rollout of the vaccine.
If it says your payment was sent to an account you do not recognize, it's not necessarily an indication of fraud, the I.R.S. said. It might just mean you were linked to a temporary account, and you should continue to watch your bank account for a deposit. More than 100 million stimulus payments have already been deposited directly into recipients' accounts, the I.R.S. said. About 8 million payments will arrive in the mail on prepaid debit cards. By law, the I.R.S. said, it must issue the stimulus payments by Jan. 15. After that, those who are entitled to a payment but haven't received one must instead claim a credit on their 2020 returns. Filers can fill the so-called Recovery Rebate Credit on line 30 of the 2020 Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

Wall Street's investors see Democratic control of the Senate as leading to a large amount of deficit spending in the early days of the Biden administration, a potential boon to the still-struggling American economy.
The governor's address comes two years after Democrats retook full control of state government in 2019, when the Legislature had one of the most productive sessions in recent memory, passing a flurry of progressive priorities that had long been stymied by Republicans who controlled the State Senate. By contrast, many of the objectives Mr. Cuomo unveiled last year were derailed or overshadowed by the response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Auto sales have since rebounded, leading to shortages of automotive-grade semiconductors.

More than two dozen senators and Assembly members from districts served by the agency got a chance to ask Mr. Lhota about the needs and problems of their particular districts.
It's probably too much to claim that helping children pays for itself. But it surely comes a lot closer to doing so than tax cuts for the rich.
In addition to the nearly 200,000 American deaths caused directly by Covid-19 from Jan. 26 to Oct. 3, another roughly 100,000 so-called excess deaths from other causes were recorded, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported. The greatest rate of excess deaths was found among young adults and people of color. Calculations of the death toll from injuries — a category that includes suicide, homicide, drug overdoses and firearm deaths — were not included in the new data, as reporting on these deaths frequently lags. But a separate N.C.H.S. provisional report on drug overdose deaths during the 12-month period ending in June 2020 found an 18 percent increase over the previous year to 79,251 deaths, up from 67,821 deaths during the previous 12-month period ending in June 2019. In total, there have been more than 384,000 known virus-related deaths in the United States. As of Wednesday, the seven-day average was 3,346 deaths a day, according to a New York Times database.
With both Democratic candidates in the lead in Georgia, the Nasdaq composite index opened around 1 percent lower on Wednesday on expectations that technology companies could be hurt by higher corporate taxes and stricter antitrust scrutiny.
Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce join a push for digital vaccination credentials. Tech companies are working to create a digital version of the Covid-19 vaccination cards that are used to track vaccination timelines. Credit... Tim Gruber for The New York Times Airlines, workplaces and sports stadiums may soon require people to show their coronavirus vaccination status on their smartphones before they can enter. A coalition of leading technology companies, health organizations and nonprofits — including Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, Cerner, Epic Systems and the Mayo Clinic — said on Thursday that they were developing technology standards to enable people to obtain and share their immunization records through health passport apps. For some period of time, most all of us are going to have to demonstrate either negative Covid-19 testing or an up-to-date vaccination status to go about the normal routines of our lives, said Dr. Brad Perkins, the chief medical officer at the Commons Project Foundation, a nonprofit in Geneva that is a member of the vaccine credential initiative. That will happen, Dr. Perkins added, whether it's getting on an airplane and going to a different country, whether it's going to work, to school, to the grocery store, to live concerts or sporting events. Vaccine passport apps could fill a significant need for airlines, employers and other businesses. In the United States, the federal government has developed paper cards that remind people who receive coronavirus vaccinations of their vaccine manufacturer, batch number and date of inoculation.
It is laziness on the part of anyone to force these folks to take a vaccine. I believe that we need to be putting all of our energy into respecting, honoring and valuing the work they do and educating them on the benefits to them and the folks they take care of in getting vaccinated. A survey of about 5,900 employees at Jackson Health System in Miami found that only half wanted to get a vaccine immediately, a hospital spokeswoman said. Others said they would consider it later. In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine said last month that roughly 60 percent of nursing home workers had declined vaccination. In New York City, at least 30 percent of health care workers said no to the shot in the first round, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday. Rebecca Robbins, Sabrina Tavernise and
One of the other companies severely hurt in the calculator wars was Commodore International, which was dependent on other companies for the chips it used and was therefore limited in how much it could cut costs. Since then, Commodore has vertically integrated. When Commodore and T.I. faced off again in home computers, Commodore was the winner. Mistake number one for T.I., analysts and competitors say, was getting into a price war with a more agile, lower-cost producer.
A top W.H.O. official in Europe urges tighter measures to stave off new coronavirus variants. Nursing home residents in Reims, France, received the Covid-19 vaccine last week. Credit... Andrea Mantovani for The New York Times Europe has reached a tipping point as it grapples with the spread of new coronavirus variants, the World Health Organization's top official in the region said on Thursday, calling for tighter public health controls to slow their transmission. The new variants have been identified in 25 of the European region's 53 nations, Hans Kluge, the W.H.O. 's regional director, told a virtual news conference. We were prepared for challenging times in 2021, and it has been just that, he said. The region had 26 million confirmed coronavirus infections last year and more than 580,000 related deaths, he said, and in the past week alone recorded 1.8 million new cases. He said that the health authorities could not yet assess the full extent of a surge in infections resulting from increased social gatherings and relaxed precautions over the year-end holidays, because testing and reporting also dropped. But he said that the availability of vaccines offered hope for the months ahead. 2021 will be another year with the virus, but it will be more manageable and more predictable, Mr. Kluge said. As the year began, over 280 million people in Europe were living under national lockdowns, and several countries are set to add new measures in the hope of reducing new infections and easing the pressure on strained health facilities.
Companies, moreover, are run by humans, subject to normal human failings. Mr. Trump's suspension may have been motivated by a sincere desire to resist efforts to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power, as Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, put it. But other politicians might be suspended because their policies are bad for corporate profits or contrary to the owners' political ideologies.
One such journalist is the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, who grew up tending sheep on a small family farm in rural Oregon in the 1960s and '70s. In Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope, he and the journalist Sheryl WuDunn, who is also his wife, offer a litany of stories from across the country, revealing the structural causes of countless so-called personal failures among the working poor. Most of these stories come from Kristof's hometown of Yamhill, population 1,105.
The answer, I'd suggest, goes beyond the fact that children can't vote, while seniors can and do. There has also been a poisonous interaction between racial antagonism and bad social analysis.
To compete with Tesla, G.M. will promote its electric cars and adopt a new logo. General Motors is introducing a new logo, replacing one that it had for nearly 50 years. Credit... via General Motors General Motors wants to shake up its image. The automaker said on Friday that it would start a marketing campaign next week to highlight a new corporate logo and the battery technology it had developed for use in at least 30 electric vehicles it intended to introduce over the next five years. The 113-year old company wants to reposition itself as a forward-looking producer of high-tech electric vehicles and to shed its reputation for being plodding and unexciting. Company officials believe its image has hampered their efforts to compete with Tesla, the maker of luxury electric cars. Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, are widely admired in the business and automotive world. The company's reputation for innovation has helped build a following of customers, fans and investors. The stock market values Tesla at more the $800 billion, more than many large automakers combined. G.M. makes far more vehicles and is substantially more profitable but has a market value of around $60 billion. G.M. will use the tagline, Everyone in, and some of the company's ads will feature the author Malcolm Gladwell.

A W.H.O. team is in China to investigate the virus. It's already meeting obstacles. Experts from the World Health Organization at the airport in Wuhan, China, on Thursday. Credit... Ng Han Guan/Associated Press More than a year after a new coronavirus first emerged in China, a team of experts from the World Health Organization arrived on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan to begin hunting for its source. But in a sign of Beijing's continuing efforts to control the investigation, the team of scientists and W.H.O. employees almost immediately ran into obstacles. Two scientists were unable to enter China at the last minute and remained in Singapore because they had tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, the W.H.O. said on Twitter. The Chinese authorities required the remaining 13 experts to undergo two weeks of quarantine in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in late 2019. The investigation, which aims to gain an understanding into how the virus jumped to humans from animals, is a critical step so that another pandemic can be avoided. But getting answers is likely to be difficult. Here's what to know about the investigation. China set up hurdles and pushed for control. Apparently worried about drawing renewed attention to the country's early mistakes in handling the pandemic, Chinese officials have used a variety of tactics over the past year to hinder the W.H.O. investigation. After resisting demands from other countries that it allow independent investigators onto its soil to study the origin of the pathogen, China let two W.H.O.

Travel from Portugal to the U.K. will also be suspended given its strong travel links with Brazil, Mr. Shapps added, although truck drivers transporting essential goods from Portugal will be exempted. Britain has already banned flights from South Africa. Brazil banned flights from Britain on Christmas Day. British authorities have come under criticism from opposition lawmakers for delaying a travel ban from Latin America, but they have argued that implementing such measures takes time, and that travelers coming from these countries had to quarantine for 10 days upon arrival.

In the past week, Britain has faced some of its deadliest days since the beginning of the pandemic, and health authorities have warned that the country's health care system was on the brink of collapse. Authorities have warned that they may tighten nationwide lockdown measures if the public doesn't stay at home. Britain has reported nearly 85,000 deaths, the heaviest death toll in Europe.
The document, grandly titled A New Foundation for American Greatness, encapsulates much of the America first message that powered Mr. Trump's campaign. It calls for an increase in military spending of 10 percent and spending more than $2.6 billion for border security — including $1.6 billion to begin work on a wall on the border with Mexico — as well as huge tax reductions and an improbable promise of 3 percent economic growth.
And because I like business and finance, I find myself spending more time paying attention to what is going on in the market. I will see or read something intriguing about the transportation industry, for example, and say to myself, I wonder if I should buy X. And then there will be a feature on an up-and-coming online retailer and I'll go: I should keep an eye on it and maybe buy on a dip.

Q: In the 1980s, when our children were very young, my husband and I left Park Slope, Brooklyn, for Levittown to raise our family, even though neither of us were from Long Island. Our children are now grown and have moved back to the city, where we visit them frequently. We're interested in moving back to Brooklyn, but we're torn. We're in our early 60s, so how would we adjust to being renters again? Or to owning an apartment rather than a house? I'd miss having a backyard and my husband likes coming home to the suburbs. When do we know it's time to move?
3. A failure to understand Nancy Pelosi. Apparently, Mr. Trump never got around to reading The Art of War, or at least not Sun Tzu's admonition to know your enemy. If he had, the president would have tried to develop at least a basic working relationship with Ms. Pelosi. The White House clearly assumed that, at some point — maybe after she secured the speaker's gavel — Ms. Pelosi would bend to Mr. Trump's will. But the speaker is not impressed with bluster. She is seldom cowed by political pressure from her own team, much less the opposing one. She plays the long game, and her will is as formidable as Mr. Trump's, possibly more so. One key difference: Ms. Pelosi knows how the legislative process works.
Under its revised shutdown plan, the F.A.A. will have 3,113 employees in its aviation safety organization who are considered essential to protect life and safety, and those employees will work without pay.

The president made the comments on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Despite promises to reduce the federal budget deficit, it has ballooned under Mr. Trump's watch as a result of sweeping tax cuts and additional government spending.
Some are concerned with the newness of the vaccines. Others are worried about potential side effects. And the failure to get the virus under control has eroded their trust in the groups now urging them to take the shot: the federal government, politicians and their employers.

The whole house was designed so all the rooms had a view of some garden, Ms. Cazarin said.
The effect on stocks is more mixed, with diversified indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 flat or up as the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank. Companies whose fortunes are linked closely to the overall economy would benefit from a bigger stimulus and infrastructure spending. Efforts to accelerate vaccination programs would also help industries that rely on in-person interactions get back in business.
The nearly five hours of questioning, during which Mr. Lhota was joined by other M.T.A. officials, came as the authority is facing questions about its performance, about several high-profile accidents and about claims of deceptive practices. In addition, the agency has been caught in the middle of a public feud between Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo over how New York City Transit should be funded and improved.

The administration has now provided Democrats details they were seeking about how any border security money would be spent, and officials have incorporated at least one Democratic idea, to allow migrant children seeking asylum to apply in their home countries rather than make a treacherous journey to the United States border.
Brian Chesky, Airbnb's co-founder and C.E.O., spoke exclusively to Andrew last night about the company's announcement today that it will think about all stakeholders when it comes to corporate governance, not just investors.
Nursing-home workers are refusing vaccines. Employers are offering incentives. Health workers preparing vaccinations in Rockaway, N.J. Credit... Sarah Blesener for The New York Times Anxious about taking a new vaccine and scarred by a history of being mistreated, many frontline workers at hospitals and nursing homes are balking at being inoculated against the coronavirus. But hospitals and nursing homes, worried about their patients' health and scarred by many thousands of deaths in the past year, are desperate to have their employees vaccinated. These opposing forces have led to unusual measures: In addition to educating workers about the benefits of the vaccines, employers are dangling incentives like cash, extra time off and even Waffle House gift cards for those who get inoculated, while, in at least a few cases, threatening to fire those who refuse. Officials at two large long-term care chains in the United States, Juniper Communities and Atria Senior Living, said they were requiring their workers, with limited exceptions, to be vaccinated if they want to keep their jobs. For us, this was not a tough decision, said Lynne Katzmann, Juniper's chief executive. Our goal is to do everything possible to protect our residents and our team members and their families. Critics say it is unethical to strong-arm low-paid workers into being vaccinated. This is a population of people who have been historically ignored, abused and mistreated, said Dr. Mike Wasserman, a geriatrician and former president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine.
The pandemic has hurt China's reputation, with many foreign governments still angry that Beijing did not do more to contain the crisis in its earliest stages. So Chinese propagandists are trying to use the W.H.O. inquiry to help shore up China's image and portray the country as a mature superpower. Complicating that effort could be new virus flare-ups in recent weeks that have prompted fresh lockdowns in China. In all, more than 22 million people have been ordered to remain inside their homes — double the number affected a year ago in Wuhan. On Thursday, China's National Health Commission reported a coronavirus death in the mainland for the first time since May. The major concern here is the origin of the outbreak has been so politicized, said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. That has really narrowed the space for the W.H.O. to have an independent, objective and scientific investigation.
Men died of Covid-19 at far higher rates than women during the second quarter of last year, with 148.1 deaths per 100,000, compared to 124.6 per 100,000 for women. When the figures were adjusted to account for the age differences between the sexes, the disparities were even more stark: the Covid-19 death rate for men was 133.9 per 100,000 during the second quarter of 2020, compared with 86.9 per 100,000 for women. The center has collected data on racial and ethnic disparities in death rates, but has not yet published the research. Another paper published on Thursday, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, calculated that Covid-19 has reduced life expectancy for all Americans by about a year on average, but found that the impact differs dramatically by race. While the life expectancy of white Americans has been shortened by less than a year, to 77.84 years on average, life expectancy among Black and Hispanic Americans has been reduced by two years and three years, respectively, to 72.7 years and to 78.7 years. (Hispanic Americans live longer on average than white or Black people.) The reduction represents the single largest single drop in life expectancy in 40 years. The N.C.H.S. report is not the first to show that the pandemic has increased deaths from a variety of causes.
Mr. Brown's staff, the senator said, is also compiling a list of rules made final by Trump appointees, including Ms. Kraninger, so Democrats could try to scrap them using the Congressional Review Act, a law that lets Congress vote to reverse regulators' actions.
U.S. lost 140,000 jobs in December, the first decline since April. The already sputtering economic rebound went into reverse in December, as employers laid off workers amid rising coronavirus cases and waning government aid. U.S. employers cut 140,000 jobs in December, the Labor Department said Friday. It was the first net decline in payrolls since last spring's mass layoffs, and though the December loss was nowhere near that scale, it represented a discouraging reversal for the once-promising recovery. The U.S. economy still has about 10 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic began. Job growth reversed for the first time since April Cumulative change in all jobs since before the pandemic By Ella Koeze · Seasonally adjusted · Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics The December losses were heavily concentrated in leisure and hospitality businesses, which have been hit especially hard by the pandemic. The industry cut nearly half a million jobs in December, while sectors less exposed to the pandemic continued to add workers. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7 percent, down sharply from its high of nearly 15 percent in April but still close to double the 3.5 percent rate in the same month a year earlier. We're losing ground again, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. Most notably, this is still very much a low-wage recession, and the losses were where we first saw them when the pandemic hit.
It turned out I'd been signed up for a dubious program that purported to protect users' credit in certain emergency situations. My bank had been accused of fraudulent practices in connection with it and fined $700 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government agency that was Senator Elizabeth Warren's brainchild. I tried, maddeningly, to seek redress from the bank — cycling through phone trees, screaming at automated operators. No one could tell me how I'd been enrolled in the program, or for how long.
But hospitals and nursing homes have been scarred by many thousands of Covid-19 deaths and are desperate to have their employees inoculated. And they're coming up with carrot-and-stick strategies that other organizations may mimic to handle vaccinations among reluctant employees.
Participants in Moderna's early clinical trials are being offered a booster shot. A nurse administering the Moderna vaccine in New York. Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times People who received two shots of the Moderna Covid vaccine in its earliest, Phase 1 clinical trial are being offered a third shot, a so-called booster, as part of a continuing study to determine whether repeated vaccinations are needed, and whether they are safe and effective, the company said on Thursday. The vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer, both using genetic material called mRNA, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19 when administered as a two-shot regimen. But they have not been in use long enough to tell how long the immunity lasts, or whether additional booster shots will be needed. We anticipate that an additional dose could further boost the levels of neutralizing antibodies, should such a boost be required, and that this is expected to be an advantage of mRNA vaccines, Colleen Hussey, a Moderna spokeswoman, said in a statement. Neutralizing antibodies are made by the immune system in response to a virus or a vaccine and can block the virus from breaking into cells. The company's statement said the boosters were being offered to participants six to 12 months after their second shot. Volunteers in early trials received different doses of the vaccine, as part of the company's attempts to calibrate the most effective amount of active ingredient to use.
The wildly optimistic projections balance Mr. Trump's budget, at least on paper, even though the proposal makes no changes to Social Security's retirement program or Medicare, the two largest drivers of the nation's debt.
Another big issue that these companies are likely to face is how they use repatriated cash if tax reforms are passed in Washington. Mr. Trump made job creation central to his campaign, but many chief executives want to use repatriated cash to do stock buybacks and make deals instead.
The question I have is: When are the Democrats going to start negotiating? Mr. Pence said.
These days, political support for programs that aid children is surely hurt by the fact that less than half the population under 15 is non-Hispanic white. But even before immigration transformed America's ethnic landscape, there was a widespread perception that programs like Aid to Families With Dependent Children basically helped Those People — you know, the bums on welfare, the welfare queens driving Cadillacs.

But there are hundreds of newspapers throughout the nation and several major TV networks. Facebook and Twitter have no major rivals in their media niches. The public relies on them as matchless mechanisms for unfiltered communication, including politicians' communications with their constituents.
Under the governor's proposal, developers who set aside 25 to 30 percent of a project's apartments for low- and moderate-income tenants, can get a full property tax exemption for 35 years, compared with less generous subsidies in either the 2015 legislation or the mayor's proposal.
Adolescents and teenagers between ages 10 and 19 were more likely than younger children to spread the variant, but not as likely as adults. Over all, though, the variant was more contagious in each age group than previous versions of the virus. The mutant virus will result in more infections in children unless schools shore up their precautions, experts said. The variant is not necessarily affecting children particularly, but we know that it's adding on more transmissibility to all age groups, Dr. Cevik said. We need to find ways to return these kids back to school as soon as possible; we need to use this time period to prepare. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain had promised last year to do all he could to keep schools open. But he changed course in the face of soaring infections and buckling hospital systems, and ordered schools and colleges to move to remote learning. Other European countries put a premium on opening schools in September and have worked to keep them open, though the variant already has forced some to close. In the United States, the mutant virus has been spotted only in a handful of states but is expected to spread swiftly, becoming the predominant source of infections by March. If community prevalence rises to unmanageable levels — a likely proposition, given the surge in most states — even elementary schools may be forced to close. But that should be a last resort, after closures of indoor restaurants, bars, bowling alleys and malls, several experts said.

The move is Mr. Chesky's take on the Business Roundtable's recommendations last year that companies consider employees, the environment and more in their business decisions.
The main entrance is through a corner tower, which opens into a large dining room with wood floors, a fireplace and an unusual barrel-vaulted stone ceiling. The Gothic arched windows, set within alcoves, are typical of those throughout the house.
As the United States awakens from one of its foundational myths — that we are a democracy without castes — the official record of our times is being written largely by people born to socioeconomic advantage. This irony, in which those on the fortunate end of historic wealth inequality attempt to chronicle a populist movement produced by that inequality, often results in dubious journalism.
How did we get into this sorry situation? A meltdown of this magnitude typically has many causes. In this case, the president's inability to reach some sort of deal rests heavily on several basic failures of understanding by him and his team. These include:
Mr. Kraft saw a similar trend in Paris and throughout France. Normally, foreign buyers represent at least 50 percent of our clientele, he said. In 2020, this number was down to a mere 7 percent. The agency had many inquiries from abroad, but only a few international buyers have pulled the trigger due to the inability to visit properties in person.
Mr. Ghosn made it onto a private plane bound for Turkey and arrived in Lebanon early Monday, the WSJ adds. (A Lebanese news media outlet claimed that he had hidden in a box meant for musical equipment; the world's tabloids, perhaps with an eye on that movie version, reckon it must have been a double bass case.) He entered Lebanon on a French passport.
We have to expect fiscal policy to be looser than if Republicans had kept their majority, wrote Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a research note. That could mean higher inflation, he added, which could be why U.S. Treasury bonds also saw selling pressure on Wednesday. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes climbed above 1 percent for the first time since March.
After rolling out trade actions on washing machines and solar panels that were nominally aimed at China, the administration is considering sweeping action to protect American intellectual property from Chinese incursions. American negotiators are working to rewrite trade pacts with Mexico and South Korea, in large part because these countries run large bilateral trade surpluses with the United States.
The Golden Knights' success, camp and all, is an encouraging sign for the N.F.L., which last year approved the Raiders' plan to relocate to Nevada. (The San Antonio Stars of the W.N.B.A. moved to Las Vegas in the off-season, and will begin play as the Las Vegas Aces in May.)
Other N.H.L. teams in areas that attract transplanted retirees — like the Arizona Coyotes and the Florida Panthers — also tend to have strong crowds supporting the opposition. The Golden Knights, though, appear to have specifically designed their game nights like most things in their city: as tourist attractions.
From visits, they knew that Valley Stream — a village in Nassau County, in the town of Hempstead — was neat, clean and safe, Mr. Gandham said, so they arranged to see the house. With six bedrooms and three baths, it was big enough to accommodate not just the couple, but also their grown children: their son, Christi, 32, and daughter, Sherleen, 29. (It's an Indian custom, Mr. Gandham said, for unmarried children to live with their parents.) They bought the house in 2015 for $514,000.
The slowest states to roll out vaccines are in the South. A training session for coronavirus testers in West Virginia. Credit... Kristian Thacker for The New York Times Several states in the American South have been the slowest in the country to roll out Covid-19 vaccines. Georgia has faced a raft of logistical and bureaucratic snags. In South Carolina, the governor gave reluctant health care workers until Friday to get their shots or risk losing their priority status. And Alabama has the distinction of administering the fewest vaccines per capita in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This was a herculean effort, said Dr. Karen Landers, the assistant state health officer for the Alabama Department of Health. It has been a challenge. And, of course, it's disappointing that we're not where we need to be. Alabama has stuck to vaccinating health care workers and nursing home residents and staff and will not officially start vaccinating people 75 and older until Monday, though some counties have started earlier. South Carolina officials, too, have acknowledged disappointment. We are frustrated, Gov. Henry McMaster said last week, giving health care workers 10 days to get their vaccine appointments. And we are determined to eliminate the bottlenecks that are slowing this down. West Virginia, by contrast, has fared much better, administering the most vaccines per capita out of any state in the country.
'The very health of our nation is at stake': Biden proposes a $1.9 trillion virus package. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. speaking in Delaware on Thursday. Credit... Kriston Jae Bethel for The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a $1.9 trillion rescue package to combat the economic downturn and the Covid-19 crisis, outlining the type of sweeping aid that Democrats have demanded for months and signaling the shift in the federal government's pandemic response as Mr. Biden prepares to take office. The package includes more than $400 billion to combat the pandemic directly, including money to accelerate vaccine deployment and to safely reopen most schools within 100 days. The very health of our nation is at stake, Mr. Biden said. We have to act and we have to act now. Mr. Biden detailed his so-called American Rescue Plan in an evening speech in Delaware, effectively kicking off his presidency. The Biden package, which would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing, flows from the idea that the virus and the recovery are intertwined. The $20 billion national vaccine program he announced envisions community vaccination centers around the country. Mr. Biden also called for a public health jobs program that would address his goals of bolstering the economy and the Covid-19 response while also rebuilding the nation's fragile public health infrastructure. The proposal would fund 100,000 public health workers to engage in vaccine outreach and contact tracing.
experts visit in July to lay the groundwork. They were not allowed to visit Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. For months, China delayed approving a visit by a full team of experts, frustrating the health agency's leaders. When the visit seemed to be finalized this month, it fell apart when Beijing declined to provide visas for the visitors, according to the health agency. Now that the investigators have arrived, critics say Beijing's desire for control means the inquiry will probably be more political than scientific. Tracing the virus will be a painstaking task. The team that has come to Wuhan will face a city radically transformed from when the virus first emerged, in late 2019. The city, which went into lockdown on Jan. 23 last year and became a symbol of the virus's devastation, has since been held up by Chinese officials as a success story in vanquishing the virus. The W.H.O. experts have decades of experience plumbing the depths of viruses, animal health and disease control. But tracing the source of the virus that as of Thursday had killed almost two million people worldwide and infected more than 92 million will be painstaking. While experts believe the virus originated naturally in animals, possibly bats, little else is known. How much access the team gets in China will be critical, public health experts say. The team will have to sidestep attempts to politicize its inquiry.
It was unlikely that anybody in attendance had a vote in the election, but that did not matter to Wynalda. In a crowded field of eight candidates, Wynalda, 48, has positioned himself as the voice of the frustrated American soccer fan, a surging demographic since the men's national team failed to qualify for this summer's World Cup. But in that populist role, he has challenged the very pillars upon which soccer in this country has been painstakingly built over the past three decades.

The United States got its first hint of the novel virus — a case of an unusual pneumonia in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 30, 2019 — from monitoring news reports and through a notification from Taiwan. While American officials tried various tacks to get them to cooperate — including praising China in public as they pressed them very hard and very firmly in private, they were unsuccessful, he said. Our teams were also pressing for the Chinese government to send us viral isolates from patients there. And China has still, one year later, failed to provide the first-generation viral isolates, Mr. Azar said, describing events in late January. It was not until Feb. 16, he said, that an international team including American experts was allowed into China to investigate. By this time, he said, Chinese intransigence meant that the window of opportunity had passed. Outbreaks had been seeded around the world. On Thursday, a team of experts from the World Health Organization finally arrived in the central city of Wuhan to begin hunting for the source of the coronavirus. But in a sign of Beijing's continuing efforts to control the investigation, the team of scientists and W.H.O. employees almost immediately ran into obstacles. Two scientists were unable to enter China at the last minute and remained in Singapore because they tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, the W.H.O. said. The Chinese authorities required the remaining 13 experts to undergo two weeks of quarantine in Wuhan.
Yes, President Trump tried to break our democracy and turn the United States into an authoritarian state controlled by him. He failed — because of the safeguards the founding fathers built into the Constitution. The framers were fearful of a rogue tyrant abusing the power of the presidency, as Mr. Trump did over and over during his four years.

Pool photo by Jacquelyn Martin Representative Adriano Espaillat, Democrat of New York, announced on Thursday he had tested positive for the coronavirus, as concerns continue to mount on Capitol Hill that efforts to corral lawmakers into secure locations during last week's siege by Trump supporters may have led to a super-spreader event. Mr. Espaillat, 66, who received his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine last week, said he was not experiencing any symptoms and that he was isolating at home. In a statement, he said he understood that it took time for the vaccine to be fully effective and that he had continued to take all necessary precautions. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that people who test positive for the virus should isolate for at least 10 days after their symptoms start. The two vaccines cleared for emergency use in the United States, made by Pfizer and Moderna, were shown in clinical trials to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19. But neither vaccine is perfect, and researchers remain unsure of how well the shots curb the ability of the virus to silently infect people.
The agreement also marks a major political victory for Mr. Murphy, who made raising the minimum wage and legalizing marijuana central promises during his run for governor. Though he said during his campaign that he wanted to raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2021, the governor said he was willing to negotiate with legislative leaders to get it passed early this year.
WASHINGTON — House Democrats unveiled on Friday the details of ambitious legislation devised to lower barriers to the ballot box, tighten ethics and lobbying restrictions and, in a swipe at President Trump, require presidents and candidates for the nation's highest offices to release their tax returns.
China, after reporting a rare virus death, says its active caseload exceeds 1,000. A quarantine center under construction in Shijiazhuang, a city of 11 million people in northern China. Credit... Yang Shiyao/Xinhua, via Associated Press China's National Health Commission said on Friday that more than 1,000 people nationwide were being treated for Covid-19, a day after the country reported its first coronavirus death on the mainland since May. The commission said that 144 new cases had been recorded on Thursday, the highest daily figure since a series of new outbreaks began at the end of last year. Of 1,001 total patients in China, the commission said, 26 were reported to be in serious condition. While the toll remains far lower than in other countries, the surge is challenging the government's much-touted success in wresting the coronavirus under control. Hebei, the northern province surrounding Beijing that has been hardest hit in the latest surge, reported 90 more cases on Thursday. New outbreaks have also appeared in the central province of Shaanxi and in Guangxi, a southern province that borders Vietnam. The new outbreaks suggest that the virus is once again spreading widely despite the measures China has taken, including electronic monitoring and new lockdowns. More than 28 million people have been ordered to remain inside their homes — more than the number affected last January when the central government locked down Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first reported.
Senate Democrats did not indicate whether they are ready to block other bills, but their position raised the prospect that a significant portion of the chamber's work could halt until the Senate gets to vote to reopen the parts of the government now closed.
It is one of the largest changes made by a government agency to address the need to maintain an essential service since the shutdown began last month. The Internal Revenue Service is planning to bring back tens of thousands of furloughed workers for tax season, and the Food and Drug Administration has said it is bringing hundreds of workers back to step up food safety inspections.
BAGHDAD — In the wholesale market of Jamila, near Baghdad's sprawling Sadr City neighborhood, a merchant, Hassan al-Mozani, was surrounded by towering piles of unsold 110-pound sacks of flour.
The new administration should also re-establish the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, whose members resigned en masse in 2017 after Mr. Trump's response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. (The artists who resigned included the director George C. Wolfe, the author Jhumpa Lahiri, the actor Kal Penn and the architect Thom Mayne.) To use a metaphor I detest but politicians seem to like, this committee should be the sizzle to the steak that is the Office for Culture. Any transformation this large needs a sales pitch; well-known actors, writers and musicians should be the pitchmen, linking Broadway and Hollywood to the town library and the school theater.

The residents of Ghazni, a provincial capital of 280,000 about 110 miles south of the capital, Kabul, on a main highway, can hardly tell anymore who's in charge, and fear has become an everyday companion.
I've always been wary of arguments about art's necessity. But a soul-sick nation is not likely to recover if it loses fundamental parts of its humanity. Without actors and dancers and musicians and artists, a society will indeed have lost something necessary — for these citizens, these workers, are the technicians of a social catharsis that cannot come soon enough. A respiratory virus and an insurrection have, in their own ways, taken the country's breath away. Artists, if they are still with us in the years ahead, can teach us to exhale.
During last year's campaign, Mr. Biden had a phrase he invoked with almost musical regularity: the election, he always said, was a battle for the soul of America. As a piece of political rhetoric, it might have been just a platitude. How can I deny, though, that the near-sacking of the Capitol — in a week when, for the first time, the daily death toll from Covid-19 reached an unendurable 4,000 Americans — indicates that the United States has undergone, these last years, a kind of soul-death? And if you were treating a patient whose soul had curdled, what sort of medicine might you prescribe?
Consider, too, that the app for Parler, a social network popular with Trump supporters, was removed on Saturday by Apple and Google from their app stores, and blocked by its hosting company, Amazon Web Services, because of concerns that some of Parler's users were inciting violence. Merely refusing to forbid certain speech, much of which is constitutionally protected, is now a basis for blacklisting.
It began giving shots to people 80 and older a week ago and to people 70 and older on Wednesday. Teachers 50 and older are also getting vaccinated. In Alabama and Georgia, state officials say they have administered more vaccines than the numbers indicate. Officials in Georgia said part of the problem is the state's 20-year-old database. It is cumbersome and difficult for providers to quickly enter information about administered doses, said Dr. Kathleen E. Toomey, the commissioner of the state Department of Public Health. Some vaccine providers, particularly hospitals, also held back some of the state's limited supply, to ensure that booster shots would be available, Gov. Brian Kemp and officials from his administration said on Tuesday. They called that misguided. If this issue continues, the state will take possession of those doses and ensure that vaccinations continue, the governor said. If it takes me firing up my pickup truck and doing it myself, so be it. At first, Georgia also found a mismatch of vaccine supply and demand. Vaccines went to rural parts of the state where 60 to 70 percent of nursing home workers did not want them, Mr. Kemp said, leaving those areas flush with doses while demand crushed supply in urban areas. The governor said vaccinating all of Georgia's nursing home residents should be completed by the end of the month. But he also acknowledged that the state still has a long way to go. Many local health departments are being inundated with calls, Mr. Kemp said.

With talks to end the shutdown at a standstill, Mr. Pence said the president had directed the Office of Management and Budget to take steps to mitigate its effects, including an order to the Internal Revenue Service to issue tax refunds.

In Switzerland, where the number of new Covid-19 infections has fallen in recent days, the authorities announced new restrictions that take effect next week because of the threat posed by the highly transmissible variants. Restrictions on businesses and social life in the country had been limited, and ski resorts have been allowed to remain open in a bid to minimize the impact on the economy. Switzerland is also keeping its schools open. But starting Monday, all shops selling nonessential goods will have to close, the limit on private gatherings has been cut to five people from 10, and the required closing of bars, restaurants, cultural centers and sports facilities has been extended until the end of February.
The announcement of an agreement between Mr. Murphy, Stephen M. Sweeney, the senate president, and Craig Coughlin, the speaker of the assembly, amounts to a fait accompli; both Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Coughlin had said they would not introduce a bill unless it could pass and Mr. Murphy would sign it. With Democrats in control of both houses of the legislature, passing the bill will be a formality.
Mr. Cuomo long opposed legalization — he described weed as a gateway drug just a few years ago — but his position evolved in 2018 as neighboring states spearheaded similar efforts and Mr. Cuomo faced a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, a progressive who made marijuana legalization a tenet of her campaign.
2. A failure to understand the costs of playing only to the base. While Republican lawmakers may be awed by Mr. Trump's command of their party's troops, Democrats are more motivated by the fact that the bulk of the electorate is tired of the president's divisive demagogy. Time and again, Mr. Trump has chosen partisanship over leadership, doing nothing to expand his appeal. This puts him at a disadvantage in wooing the public to his side of the wall debate.
Some left-leaning groups that support the president's promises to end offshoring embraced the view that the administration's trade policies simply haven't gone far enough.
Mr. Hogan brings a different set of skills than Cecilia Malmstrom, whom he succeeded as the European Union's top trade official at the beginning of December. Some in Brussels think his rawer style will make him a better match for the current occupant of the White House.
T.I.'s home computer was first introduced in 1979 for $1,150 and was an embarrassing failure. T.I. discovered in 1982 that it could sell large volumes by cutting the price and offering rebates. But the T.I. 99/4A, which was little different from the machine that was originally designed to sell for $1,150, was no match cost-wise for Commodore's VIC-20. As Commodore and T.I. started their downhill race, it was inevitable that prices would get so low that T.I. would start losing money while Commodore stayed profitable. T.I.

A few years ago, when I was self-employed and had recently had my second child, my husband went combing through my credit card statements, looking for tax deductions that I'd missed. I'm financially disorganized at the best of times, and with a baby and a toddler, I was barely even trying to keep track of my business expenses. So it's not surprising that I hadn't noticed the hundreds of dollars of weird recurring bank charges that my husband discovered.

The government's real grudge may be not with Mr. Priesner but with the United Nations and other international institutions. The program Mr. Priesner headed worked on electoral reform in Bangladesh, where Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina won the 2014 election essentially by default after major opposition groups boycotted the vote. The next general election is scheduled for next year, and will probably be closely scrutinized.
City officials and developers have argued that the construction of rental buildings would halt without 421-a benefits. The number of permits taken out by developers soared in the first half of 2015, in anticipation of the program's expiration.
This spring, when the federal government disbursed billions of dollars in emergency pandemic funding, the traditional K-12 public schools in Los Angeles got an average of about $716,000.
Indeed, just before Mr. de Blasio's expected announcement, the incoming Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said that he and Mr. Biden had reached a deal for the federal government to cover the full costs of state and city expenses related to a disaster declaration from last March, when the virus was first discovered in New York. The move is expected to save the state and city about $2 billion, money that Mr. Schumer's office said can be used to tackle Covid-related budget gaps. And on Thursday, Mr. Schumer was promising more to come. This is just prelude of better days ahead out of Washington for New York, he said. With Biden as president and me as majority leader, it's going to get better. Still, few expect the federal government to be able to fully meet the budgetary needs of state and local governments.

Little if any of the bill, named H.R. 1 to underscore its primacy, is likely to become law; in its sprawl and ambition, the measure is less a legislative vehicle than a political platform for the Democrats heading into the 2020 presidential cycle.
We can be grateful that Mr. Trump failed and will be gone in a few weeks. Mr. Trump may have weakened our democracy, but whether that weakening is fatal is up to us.
We also shouldn't overstate the danger of corporate power. Facebook and Twitter, unlike the government, can't send us to jail or tax us.
Many economists have praised the agreements for reducing uncertainty, but few have raised their growth forecasts because of them. That is in part because they say the deals still leave a large number of tariffs in place — particularly those against China, but also on some steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines imported from other countries.
What that meant was if I could just match the benchmark — mainly, the S&P 500 — I would be ahead of the majority of investors who were listening to the underperforming professional advisers. I became a firm believer in what was then, in the early 1980s, a relatively new idea — index funds. I remain a huge fan.

The scale of the victory in Uttar Pradesh's legislative elections was all the more stunning because it followed Mr. Modi's politically risky decision to eliminate most of India's cash. The vote was seen as a referendum on the prime minister, who campaigned vigorously in recent days in Uttar Pradesh, which, with a population of more than 200 million, would be the world's sixth largest country if it were independent.
After enduring years of street noise in their apartment in Flushing, Queens, Devanivas Gandham, 58, and his wife, Wilma, 55, began looking for a quieter place several years ago. We saw many, many houses, Mr. Gandham said. And we didn't like anything. Then a cousin who lived in Valley Stream, on Long Island, alerted them to a promising listing.
The administration's credibility continues to suffer, as Democrats call out Mr. Trump for falsehoods about the crisis, such as his assertion that former presidents had told him privately that they should have built the wall. On Monday, former President Jimmy Carter joined the list of presidents who said they had never discussed a border wall with Mr. Trump.
In the longer term, Mr. Brown said, he wants to get the Federal Reserve to set up bank accounts for members of the public who don't have accounts at commercial banks. The so-called public option would allow users to cash paychecks and receive government benefits, such as refunds from a new child tax credit that he and other Senate Democrats have proposed.
But the magnitude and the suddenness of the loss surprised and puzzled analysts. An after-tax loss of $100 million in the second quarter for the company as a whole translates into a pretax loss on home computers alone of $200 million to $250 million.
But, Mark Willis, a research fellow at New York University's Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, said that property tax exemptions are essential to development of mid-rise housing in areas with moderate- to low-market rents. If fewer mixed-income units were built, he said, it could only intensify our current affordable housing crisis.

First, the deal calls for China to begin purchasing what the administration says will be $200 billion worth of American crops and other exported goods and services. Those purchases should increase exports from the United States to China, which, all else being equal, would promote growth.

We sold less, but what we see is as soon as the confinement stops, there is a big increase of sales, Mr. Jottras said. That means people want to buy. They couldn't materially do it during the stay-at-home, but now they can do it, and we have a very, very big increase of sales after the second confinement.
While hockey is certainly the central focus of game nights, the Knights have added a medieval motif, sometimes comically. The Zambonis that drive on the ice have jousts mounted on their sides to simulate a duel. The arena includes a 24-foot knight's helmet and three castle structures, including one for cheerleaders with pompoms. Catapults are used to launch T-shirts into the crowd.
Ms. Warren and Senator Cory Booker, among others, have recently endorsed the idea of a Green New Deal, a call to reimagine an environment-first economy that would phase out fossil fuels. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez thrust that issue into the national dialogue after she joined a sit-in protest in the office of then-incoming House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi, in one of her first, rebellious acts in Washington.
Job losses can be traced to the virus surge, with restaurants and hotels hard hit. Why did job growth go into reverse? It's simple: the resurgent pandemic. As virus cases rose across the country in the fall, governors and mayors reimposed restrictions on businesses and consumers pulled back on activity. Job losses soon followed: Restaurants and bars cut 372,000 jobs in December. Hotels cut 24,000 more. Private schools and colleges cut more than 60,000. The leisure and hospitality industry was hit hard in December, while other sectors made small gains Cumulative change in jobs since before the pandemic, by industry By Ella Koeze · Seasonally adjusted · Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics It's more pandemic-induced job loss, said Nick Bunker, head of North American research for the career site Indeed. It's a really vivid demonstration that the labor market can't bounce back in any sustainable form until the pandemic is under control. Industries less exposed to the virus, on the other hand, mostly kept hiring. Manufacturers added 38,000 jobs. Construction companies added 51,000. Even retailers, hit hard in the spring but able to adapt more readily, added 120,000. Mr. Bunker said the hiring in those areas was encouraging, suggesting that the economic damage was contained and potentially allowing for a faster rebound once the pandemic was under control. But the concentration of job losses also means that low-wage workers, many of them Black or Hispanic, are again bearing the brunt of the crisis.
DHAKA, Bangladesh — The sale of a used car is developing into an unusual criminal case and a potential diplomatic sore point between the United Nations and Bangladesh, whose government has frequently bristled at criticism from the international community.

The I.R.S. is trying to redirect millions of stimulus payments that went to unused accounts. Some Americans who used tax preparation services have temporary accounts on file with the I.R.S. Credit... Eric Gay/Associated Press The Internal Revenue Service misdirected stimulus payments for an estimated 13 million accounts, but the agency on Friday said it is trying to redirect to the money to the proper place. If you're anticipating a stimulus payment that hasn't yet landed, continue to monitor your bank accounts — and your snail mail. The I.R.S. was taking immediate steps to get stimulus payments to the correct accounts, the agency said in a statement on Friday. Many additional taxpayers will receive payments following this effort, the IRS added. Here's what happened: Millions of payments were sent to temporary accounts, which are often set up by companies like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt when they prepare returns. They use the accounts when customers opt to have their preparation fees deducted from their refund, for example, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest. The accounts may then be closed or become inactive — but may remain linked to the taxpayer's I.R.S. records. Tax prep companies have said they're working with the I.R.S. to resolve the issue. TurboTax said affected customers can expect to receive direct deposits starting on Friday. You can check the status of your stimulus payment through the I.R.S. 's Get My Payment tool.
Even that would not have been too bad had T.I. been able to make up for low-priced computers by making large profits on software and peripheral equipment as it had hoped. But there is a flaw in such a razor-and-blade approach to profits in the home computer market.

President Trump was clear when he met with business leaders on Monday: Bring back domestic manufacturing jobs or face punishing tariffs and other penalties.
Markets continue to climb, shaking off a grim jobs report. By: Ella Koeze · Data delayed at least 15 minutes · Source: FactSet Financial markets continued to rally on Friday, fueled by bets that a Democrat-led government in Washington would robust fiscal stimulus and despite fresh evidence that the United States economy is backsliding as the pandemic surges. The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent, climbing further into record territory and bringing its gains for the week to 1.8 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 was 0.7 percent higher, and the FTSE 100 in Britain rose slightly. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Japan closed with a gain of 2.4 percent, climbing to a level it last hit in 1990. Though Washington continues to focus on the pro-Trump mob that overran the Capitol building on Wednesday, the investing world is instead focused on the wave of spending that could come as Democrats assume leadership of the White House and both houses of Congress That enthusiasm also helped investors look past the Labor Department's report on December payrolls, which showed that U.S. employers cut 140,000 jobs last month, the first drop since last spring. The weak report bolsters the argument that more economic stimulus is needed. Stocks dipped Friday afternoon, but they recovered after President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said he was targeting trillions of dollars in spending. We should be investing significant amounts of money right now, to grow the economy, he said.
Ford will idle a Kentucky factory as the auto industry grapples with a semiconductor shortage. A Ford Exposition SUV being assembled in Louisville, Kentucky. Credit... Nick Carey/Reuters Ford Motor said on Friday that it will idle a plant in Louisville, Ky., for one week beginning Monday because of a shortage of semiconductors that is causing disruptions in auto factories around the world. Ford's Louisville assembly plant operates two shifts a day, employs about 4,000 workers, and makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair sport-utility vehicles. The automaker said it would cancel a week of downtime scheduled for later in the year at the plant to leave its output unchanged for the year A second Ford plant in Louisville has not been affected by the semiconductor shortage. That plant makes the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Explorer S.U.V.s, and the company's F-series Super Duty pickup trucks. Volkswagen last month warned that the semiconductor shortage would likely cause production delays at its plants in China and elsewhere. Honda and Nissan have also been affected by the shortage, according to Nikkei, the Japanese news organization. General Motors said on Friday that it has not been affected by the shortage but is monitoring the matter closely. Semiconductors play an increasingly important role in cars, controlling engines, brakes, transmissions, driver displays and other systems. Earlier this year, when auto sales fell because of the coronavirus pandemic, semiconductor manufacturers shifted their production to chips used for consumer electronics, Volkswagen said last month.
Mr. Brown has already raised some of his agenda with his Republican colleagues. He said he and Mr. Toomey had taken advantage of an unexpected opportunity to discuss the committee's future: They put their heads together last Wednesday, while both were locked for hours in a secure location as rioters stormed the Capitol.

The history of the personal computer business, brief as it is, has shown that the successful machines are the ones that have the most and best software available for them. It has also shown that no single company can write all the software itself. It must take advantage of the cottage industry of programmers.
A hallway from the dining room leads to the family room, which has oak-beamed ceilings, an exposed stone wall and a fireplace. The adjoining eat-in kitchen has a flagstone floor, gas range and a farmhouse-style sink. Also on the ground floor are a utility room with laundry hookups and a study with French doors opening onto a patio.
Except for having a bit of a temper — Wynalda was shown a red card in his first World Cup game — his soccer credentials are unimpeachable. Wynalda played in three World Cups, and for professional teams in Germany's Bundesliga and Major League Soccer, before he became television analyst and lower-division manager.
California just made it easier for people to get vaccinated. For many, it feels harder than ever. Credit... Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times Gov. Gavin Newsom's announcement on Wednesday seemed sweeping: California would open up eligibility for a coronavirus vaccine to anyone 65 or older, effectively abandoning a rollout plan that was meant to ensure that the most vulnerable would be first in line. A day later, residents of the vast and varied state were trying to navigate what many described as vaccination chaos. Some counties shifted gears immediately, among them Orange County, which said anyone 65 or older could book an appointment at the vaccination site it opened this week at Disneyland. But the scheduling website was quickly overwhelmed, making finding a shot seem like trying to score Taylor Swift concert tickets. Neighboring Los Angeles County, however, stuck with its strict priority rules, and said that vaccines there would continue to be available only to health care workers. The dueling approaches illustrate the tension across the country between two competing imperatives: getting as many doses as possible out quickly, and getting those who are at the most risk protected first. As of Thursday, about 11.1 million people in the U.S. had received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a figure that is far short of the 20 million the Trump administration had hoped to reach by Dec. 31. Most have received only the first of the two necessary doses so far.
At this point, however, we know that cultural explanations of social collapse were all wrong. The sociologist William Julius Wilson argued long ago that social dysfunction in big cities was caused, not by culture, but by the disappearance of good jobs. And he has been vindicated by what happened to much of the American heartland, which suffered a similar disappearance of good jobs and a similar surge in social dysfunction.

Coronavirus may change financial and political calculations about many issues: Since last March, no state has had more deaths than New York, with more than 39,000.
This is a stupendous achievement, said Ashok Malik, a fellow with the Observer Research Foundation, based in New Delhi. Here you had a prime minister making himself the face of the election in the absence of a local leader and stitching together a coalition across the state.
He is more direct, said Luisa Santos, the director for international relations at BusinessEurope, an industry group. Gender may also play a role, Ms. Santos said. There is a widespread perception in Washington and Brussels that Trump officials were not comfortable with Ms. Malmstrom, an assertive Swede.
He did not provide the exact date of her departure, but he said her resignation would take place before Parliament returns at the end of the month.
But there is no federal system that people can use to get easy access to their immunization records online and establish their vaccination status for work or travel. A few airlines, including United Airlines and JetBlue, are trying Common Pass, a health passport app from the Commons Project. The app enables passengers to retrieve their virus test results from their health providers and then gives them a confirmation code that allows them to board certain international flights. The vaccination credentialing system would work similarly. The U.S. vaccination program has been stymied by logistical hurdles as states scramble to set up new systems for booking appointments. Demand is high, but the rollout has been progressing far more slowly than hoped, marred by crashing servers, busy signals and confusion. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday that about 11.1 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, far short of the goal federal officials set to give at least 20 million people their first shots before the end of 2020. At least 541,000 people in the United States have been fully vaccinated as of Jan. 12, according to a New York Times survey of all 50 states.
It's only human nature for people to think the worst of their adversaries' views — including by labeling them hate speech or fake news or incitement — while giving their allies the benefit of the doubt. And sometimes just the risk of suspension will pressure politicians to avoid taking positions a company dislikes.
