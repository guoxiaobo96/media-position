John Kelly, Trump's former chief of staff, says he would vote to invoke the 25th Amendment. John F. Kelly, a former chief of staff to President Trump, also called for the 25th Amendment to be invoked. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times John F. Kelly, a former chief of staff to President Trump who has criticized him on several occasions since leaving his post two years ago, said on Thursday that if he were still in the cabinet, he would vote to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Mr. Trump unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. I don't think it'll happen, but I think the cabinet should meet and discuss this, because the behavior yesterday and the weeks and months before that has just been outrageous from the president, Mr. Kelly said on CNN. And what happened on Capitol Hill yesterday is a direct result of his poisoning the minds of people with the lies and the frauds. When the CNN host Jake Tapper asked whether he would support invoking the 25th Amendment if he were in the cabinet, Mr. Kelly paused for a moment before saying, Yes, I would. Mr. Trump's incitement of the mob that stormed the Capitol on Wednesday led multiple administration officials, including Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, to resign and has drawn criticism even from Republicans who previously stood by the president.
I do not consider what happened in Kansas to be some run-of-the-mill shooting. No way. It was horrific. It had an ugly racial dimension and it turned into a major diplomatic incident. And I happen to share the reader's personal concern — I might have been a victim too if I had been in that bar at that time. But which label best applies to the crime is more a question for law enforcement than The Times. Was this a hate crime? Was it terrorism? There are specific legal conditions that must be met for those labels to be applied. I can assure this concerned reader that we'll keep on top of this case and pass along all that we find.
Unfortunately, however, it misses what would be most effective — namely, removing the corrupt power of oil companies and other wealthy interests over government. This power is exerted through the legal bribery of public officials with lobbying and other money by the rich heads of private industries.

If the managers divide their total of 24 allotted hours evenly over three days, the arguments could go until 9 p.m. or later depending on breaks. The White House could pre-empt the arguments with a motion to dismiss on Wednesday morning, but allies said it was unlikely to do so because it does not have enough votes.
That's actually a relatively healthy number for the president compared with his national approval rating (around 41 percent), but it could be a conservative estimate, and voters' views might be unusually entrenched, given the stability of his ratings.

The tax law overhaul of late 2019 eliminated the home office deduction for employees from 2018 through 2025. Employees who receive a paycheck or a W-2 exclusively from an employer are not eligible for the deduction, even if they are currently working from home, the I.R.S. said. Read more. How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can't include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.

The political rethinking about the deficit — especially in times of economic weakness — is a stark change from earlier eras. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton highlighted his success in cutting the deficit and creating a budget surplus as a political achievement for Democrats. Concerns about excessive federal spending and the national debt also helped fuel the ascent of the Tea Party in the late 2000s, giving rise to a new breed of Republican who succeeded in ushering in austere spending caps that continued to bedevil lawmakers. But after 2014, Republicans have joined Democrats in waiving those caps, and a bipartisan, bicameral deal struck in 2019 ensures their expiration this year.

Some of the Republicans might think wistfully that Mike Pence — even Mike Pence — would be a big improvement over the guy we've got now. For the country, maybe, but not for Mitch McConnell. Trump is the perfect president for Mitch. For the past three years, the senator from Kentucky has basically been running the government. Somebody has to do it, and the administration's people are barely capable of opening their office doors.

Instead, these voters appeared to be drawn back toward the Democrats by some of the party's bread-and butter-issues, and in spite of others. On issues like gun control, health care and the environment, these voters look remarkably like the Democratic Party's base — those who voted for Obama in 2012, Hillary Clinton in 2016 and a Democratic House candidate in 2018. Eighty-four percent of Obama-Trump voters who voted for Democratic House candidates in 2018 want to ban assault rifles, compared to 92 percent of the Democratic base. By contrast, 57 percent of Obama-Trump voters who stayed with Republicans in 2018 support an assault weapons ban (which has far less support among the Republican base).
Monthly deficits appear likely to swell again in the months to come, as the pandemic continues to rage and President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. pushes lawmakers to approve another large stimulus plan. Even many fiscal hawks, who typically decry high deficits, have called for more deficit spending to help people, businesses and state and local governments survive until coronavirus vaccines are widely distributed and the crisis abates.

Taking money out of retirement accounts can sometimes be a difficult adjustment for savers, after years of squirreling away money. But failing to take mandatory distributions on time can be costly. The penalty is 50 percent of the money you did not withdraw. So, for instance, if you were required to take out $10,000, but only withdrew $5,000, the potential penalty would be (ouch) $2,500. It's a big whack, Ms. Setzfand said.

A new impeachment would be more than a do-over of the drive that failed last year because this time the crime was not a phone call to a foreign leader captured on the dry pages of a transcript but the siege of American democracy played out live on television for all to see. Insurrectionists incited by Mr. Trump attacked our nation's Capitol to stop Congress from accepting the Electoral College results, said Representative Ted Lieu of California, who began drafting the article of impeachment while sheltering during the Capitol takeover and sponsored it with Representatives David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Jamie Raskin of Maryland, two fellow Democrats. Still, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, indicated that under Senate rules a trial could not begin until Jan. 19, the day before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s inauguration. Some of Mr. Trump's critics argued that it would be important to hold a trial even if he is already out of power in order to bar him from ever seeking office again, a penalty envisioned by the Constitution. The Constitution specifically provides for the Senate to bar anyone convicted from holding federal office in the future, a secondary penalty that can be approved in a separate vote but requires only a simple majority of 51 senators rather than two-thirds. The Senate has applied this penalty to impeached judges in the past.
SB: I'd answer it this way: The days of Wall Street running the banking committee are past, and with Democrats in control of the Banking/Housing Committee, things are going to be different. It will mean hearings to unearth special deals that Wall Street has extricated. When Wall Street runs things, the stock market goes up and C.E.O. pay explodes, but wages barely budge, the middle class shrinks — those days need to be over.
To think of Mr. Trump as an influencer is to suggest that his message can be contained. That his ideas live and die with him and his ability to broadcast them. To suggest that Trumpism is something bigger — that it is a platform itself — is to argue that Mr. Trump and his followers have constructed a powerful, parallel information ecosystem that is as strong and powerful (one could argue even more powerful) than any system built to oppose it. But anyone plugged into the pro-Trump universe realizes that Trumpism is bigger than the figurehead.

Could he reach a compromise with Democrats to end the shutdown by coupling wall funding with a pathway to citizenship for the young immigrants known as Dreamers? Mr. Trump responded that Democrats lost interest as soon as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld an injunction against his administration's termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Shortly before the election, the old majority had voted 3 to 2 to hire a new superintendent on a four-year contract. Under the previous superintendent, a state audit found that the high school had a longstanding practice of improperly boosting students' grades from failing to passing to improve the district's statistics. The new superintendent was Shimon Waronker, a former army intelligence officer who had started several schools in New York City and was a favorite of the former city schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein.
School funding in California changed before 1978 as a result of a state court case, Serrano v. Priest, in the early 1970s. The courts held that school funding had to be equalized across districts, which took local financial decisions out of the hands of local school boards. That's why Sacramento assumed control of allocating education dollars.

Credit... Greg Baker/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The World Health Organization has criticized China for not authorizing a team of international experts to enter the country to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, a highly anticipated trip that has been months in the making. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O. 's director general, said at a Tuesday news conference that two members of the U.N. agency's 10-person team were already in transit to China when they were informed that the necessary visa permissions had not yet been granted. The team had been expected to go to Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged. Dr. Tedros, who has been criticized for praising China despite the country's early mishandling of the outbreak, said he was very disappointed by the news and was in touch with senior Chinese officials to resolve the issue. Michael Ryan, the head of the emergencies program at the W.H.O., said that one of the experts in transit had already returned home, while the other was staying in a third country awaiting further instructions. The rest of the team, consisting of experts from the Netherlands, Japan, the United States and elsewhere, had not yet left for China when news of the visa delays came through.

And while running big deficits might have once stoked fears about inflation — as too many dollars chased too few goods — price gains have been too low for comfort for years. Add to that the emergency needs prompted by the pandemic, and even the Fed's leader, who had long warned about the nation's debt load, has said this is a reasonable time to spend money.
Despite solid gains in most businesses last year and more progress on cutting costs, however, the bank, run by Brian Moynihan, eked out an annualized return on equity of only 7 percent with its $4.7 billion of net income. The $600 million of additional interest income that Bank of America reckons it can earn in the next three months because of rate increases would add, after tax, only around half a percentage point to its return.

It has taken us 10 years to get congestion pricing back into the public discourse, and in those years, technology has transformed what is happening on our streets. Hailing and microtransit apps have introduced a convenient way to get around town and increased the number of vehicles in the city. The rise of on-demand delivery has made shopping and meals a click to order and given rise to an epidemic of double-parking. Had we instituted congestion pricing back then, the shape and use of these services would be wholly different today.

In an interview, Mr. Dopp said he was unconvinced that some of the problems he had seen in the estate transactions were simply mistakes. Mistakes like this don't happen in a vacuum, he said.
The sergeants-at-arms are responsible for security in their respective chambers and related office buildings, while Mr. Sund oversaw more than 1,800 Capitol Police personnel. It was unclear immediately who would replace Mr. Stenger and Mr. Sund. In his statement, Mr. McConnell said Jennifer Hemingway, the deputy sergeant-at-arms, would serve as acting sergeant-at-arms. Lawmakers in both chambers and from both parties vowed on Thursday to find out how those responsible for Capitol security had allowed a violent mob to infiltrate the Capitol. House Democrats announced a robust investigation into the law enforcement breakdown. Mr. McConnell said in a separate statement that a painstaking investigation and thorough review were needed after the events of Wednesday, which he described as a massive failure of institutions, protocols, and planning that are supposed to protect the first branch of our federal government. Mr. McConnell added that the ultimate blame for yesterday lies with the unhinged criminals who broke down doors, trampled our nation's flag, fought with law enforcement, and tried to disrupt our democracy, and with those who incited them. But this fact does not and will not preclude our addressing the shocking failures in the Capitol's security posture and protocols.

Jan. 6, 2021, 6:14 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 6:14 p.m. ET Woman shot in the Capitol has died. Police officers in riot gear lined up in front of the Capitol on Wednesday night after it was overrun by a mob. Credit... Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images A woman who was shot inside the Capitol building after it was overrun by a pro-Trump mob has died, Washington D.C. police officials said on Wednesday. The woman has not been identified and no information has been released about who may have shot her. Chief Robert J. Contee of the Metropolitan Police Department said earlier that she was a civilian and that his officers were leading the investigation. The woman was pronounced dead at a local hospital, Dustin Sternbeck, a spokesman for the police department, said in an email. Mr. Sternbeck said he did not yet know who shot her or have any other details. A video posted to Twitter earlier on Wednesday appeared to show a shooting in the Capitol. The woman in the video seemed to climb onto a small ledge next to a doorway inside the building immediately before a single loud bang is heard. The woman, draped in a flag, fell to the ground at the top of a stairwell. A man with a helmet and a military-style rifle stood next to her after she fell, and shouts of police could be heard as a man in a suit approached the woman and crouched next to her. Where's she hit?

Big businesses often donate to both political parties and say that their support is tied to narrow issues of specific interest to their industries. That became increasingly fraught last week, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and some Republican lawmakers tried to overturn Joe Biden's win in the presidential election. A flurry of companies have since reviewed political giving via their corporate political action committees.
Donald Trump is a lawless president and revolting person who richly deserved his impeachment and, in a better world, would be convicted in the Senate and removed from the White House. That's my view, as it is the view of a plurality — albeit a narrow plurality — of the American people.

In the aftermath of Donald Trump's 2016 election victory, analysts fiercely debated the role of the approximately six million voters who supported President Barack Obama in 2012 but shifted their support to Mr. Trump in 2016. Democratic strategists also had to worry about their future behavior: Was 2016 a temporary blip or were these voters gone forever? With newly available data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study survey, the largest publicly-available election survey, we can now analyze what happened with these Obama-Trump voters in 2018 and what that might portend for Mr. Trump's re-election campaign.

Anyway, the puzzle. Mr. DiPietro uses THE IDES revealer at 38A to give us a hint to his theme set in the Down entries, all beginning with the homophonic contraction I'D. For example, at 20D, we have the clue 'Yes, how nice of you to offer' and the answer is I'D BE HONORED. Collectively, the four theme entries make up THE IDES.
While it was one of the more significant investments to emerge from the state budget, some say it should be viewed as a down payment. Steve Englebright, a state assemblyman who heads the Environmental Conservation Committee, has said $80 billion to $100 billion is required to address the state's aging water infrastructure.

I've long been puzzled by the seemingly arbitrary mention of the family background of subjects in Times' obituaries. This is particularly striking in the case of people of Jewish ancestry. Two obituaries this week illustrate the point. Here is Alan Colmes: Mr. Colmes, a Brooklyn-born grandson of Jewish immigrants from Ukraine, worked in radio and as a stand-up comic before Fox News recruited him. And here is Kenneth Arrow: Kenneth Joseph Arrow was born on Aug. 23, 1921, in New York City. There is no mention of Arrow's parents, who were both Romanian-Jewish immigrants to the United States, a fact that is easily found and seems more relevant to his obituary than Colmes' grandparents to his. There are many other examples of this kind of contrast. I wonder what the criteria are for including information about an obituary subject's religious background and ancestry.

This tragic loss is a reminder of the bravery of the law enforcement who protect us every day, Mr. Ryan wrote. Mr. Sicknick's death brings the death toll from Wednesday's mayhem to five. One of the people participating in the pro-Trump rampage, Ashli Babbitt, was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer inside the building as she climbed through a broken window leading to the Speaker's Lobby. Three other people died after experiencing apparent medical emergencies in the area around the Capitol, the police said. Officials have said that some 50 police officers were injured as the mob swarmed barricades, threw objects, battered doors, smashed windows and overwhelmed some of the officers who tried to resist the advancing crowd. Capitol Police reported 14 arrests during the incursion, including two people who were detained for assaulting a police officer. Local police arrested dozens of others, mostly for unlawful entry and violations of the city's Wednesday night curfew. Steven Sund, the Capitol Police chief, handed in his resignation on Thursday after facing pressure from congressional leaders. The sergeants-at-arms of the House and Senate also resigned.

Some of us protested bitterly against this policy turn, arguing that a period of mass unemployment was no time for fiscal austerity. And we were mostly right. Why only mostly? Because it's becoming increasingly doubtful whether there's any right time for fiscal austerity. The obsession with debt is looking foolish even at full employment.

Medicare for all is surprisingly popular among all Obama-Trump voters, but especially those who voted for Democrats in 2018. Eighty-three percent of those who switched back to the Democratic Party in 2018 support Medicare for all, nearly as high as the 93 percent support the policy achieves among the most solidly blue Democratic voting bloc.

The exact amounts are hard to come by, but what is known is jaw-dropping. In a one-month period in early 2017, the president spent $13.6 million on just four trips to his Mar-a-Lago property in South Florida, according to estimates by the Government Accountability Office. That's an average of $3.4 million per trip — at minimum. The actual price tag is most likely higher, the agency noted in a report released last February, but greater accounting precision was impossible because the White House refused multiple requests for information. Compounding the challenge, the Secret Service tends to be lax in fulfilling its reporting requirements.
In recent days, Mr. Carter filed a bill that would get rid of the union-weakening right to work statute that has been in place since 1947, as well as another bill that would give public employees, including teachers, the right to strike.
We turned off the moral lens. You probably know the example of the Israeli day care centers. Parents kept showing up late to pick up their kids. To address the problem, the centers experimented with fining the late parents. But the number of late pickups doubled. Before, coming to pick up your kid on time was a moral obligation — to be fair to the day care workers. After, it was seen as an economic transaction. Parents were happy to pay to be late. We more or less did this as an entire society — we switched to a purely economic lens.
Mr. Trump insisted that only the United States could tax American-based companies, and threatened to retaliate with American tariffs of up to 100 percent on French wine, cheese, handbags and more.
Mr. Salazar, noting that Ms. Mathai had already been suspended from the force since October on another matter, said at a news conference on Friday that he had referred the video to the F.B.I. and to the internal investigations department. Ms. Mathai could not be reached for comment. Thomas Goldie, a Pennsylvania police officer, posted pictures of himself on Facebook from the rally wearing a Trump cap, but there was not yet any indication that he had been in the Capitol, said Jim Miller, chief of the Zelienople Police Department, a 10-member force in a small town 29 miles north of Pittsburgh. Him being there is not a problem — he had a right to be there, but not to break into the Capitol, obviously, said Mr. Miller, adding that the legal department was reviewing the matter. Mr. Miller said Mr. Goldie was on vacation and had yet to return. Mr. Goldie did not respond to telephone messages. In Seattle, the Police Department announced on Friday that two officers were being placed on administrative leave after attending the demonstration. Internal investigators would determine if the officers were directly involved in any of the illegal events, Chief Adrian Diaz said in a statement. And in Troy, N.H., Richard Thackston, the head of the town Board of Selectmen expressed support for the police chief, David Ellis, after there were calls for his resignation for attending the events in Washington. Neither man responded to telephone messages left at the town hall and with the police dispatcher.

The pandemic has warped notions of national identity, truth and time itself, but it has also created a shared vulnerability. The whole world seems to be alone together, cut off from the pre-Covid conceptions of what life was supposed to look like. It's been tough, said Fabrizio Topi, a cafe owner in Rome struggling to make ends meet. But it's the same the world over. That search for unity in itself is something. Taking lessons from natural disasters, charity groups and mental health advocates have emphasized the importance of staying connected and fostering communities that recognize that many are in a similar situation. Other people are looking within themselves for resilience and even improvement to beat back despondency. But nearly a year into the crisis, after any New Year's buzz has worn off, talk of common fragility and self-actualization can feel like whistling in the dark.
Mine is a before-and-after of the kind that is often promised in midafternoon infomercials: a transformation so stark that it's impossible not to derive a little stab of pleasure from people's faces when I show them pictures of what my face looked like in 2015.

As N.Y.C. 's positivity rate tops 9%, the debate on keeping schools open heats up. Again. Students arrived for in-person learning at Public School 93, William Prescott, in Brooklyn's Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood, on Tuesday. Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times New York City's rising coronavirus numbers are once again forcing high-stakes decisions about whether to keep schools open, leaving students, parents and educators with newfound uncertainty. The United Federation of Teachers has warned the city that it believed all schools should close if the positivity rate reached a certain threshold. But the mayor's office has said it is determined to keep schools open. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said the roughly 190,000 children in lower grades and those with complex disabilities who are back in classrooms should have the option to stay there, even as positivity rates top 9 percent citywide and individual school buildings are closing at an accelerating rate because of positive test results among staff or students. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo appeared to support Mayor Bill de Blasio in his desire to keep schools open, announcing on Monday that the state would not stick with its plan to close schools if the positivity rate hit 9 percent by the state's metrics, and would instead leave the decision to local leaders. (Because of the difference in how the state and city tabulate virus test results, the state's metrics have New York City at more than 6 percent positivity.)
In the decade since, people who were close to retirement have struggled to replenish their lost savings and now are focused on financial security.

The state, in theory, should have already been in that position, but President Trump rarely adopted stances that benefited his former home state. That is expected to change with Mr. Schumer, with Democrats across New York thrilled to have a direct line to a man in charge of vitally needed federal aid and other assistance.
As the pandemic continues to rage nationwide and a vaccine program to control it struggles, governors are increasingly turning to the National Guard to help expedite the process. At least 16 states and territories are using Guard members to give shots, drawing on doctors, nurses, medics and others skilled in injections.
Mr. Cuomo is also known to have a good relationship with Joe Biden, which could help as well, though he has clashed with Mr. Schumer in the past.
Teachers and other employees in the Los Angeles Unified School District are demanding higher pay, smaller class sizes and more support staff like counselors and librarians.

About the same time, Mr. Manafort was also trying to curry favor with Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian billionaire close to the Kremlin and an associate of Mr. Kilimnik. In July 2016, Mr. Manafort, then the Trump campaign chairman, told Mr. Kilimnik that he could offer Mr. Deripaska private briefings, according to emails reported by The Washington Post. Mr. Deripaska had claimed Mr. Manafort owed him millions from a failed business venture, and Mr. Manafort may have been trying to use his status in the campaign to hold him at bay.

But the teachers' union quickly poured cold water on that plan by saying it wanted schools closed if the city hit the 9 percent state mark. The renewed tension over opening schools makes it even less likely that the city's middle and high schools will reopen in the next few months. Those schools were open for just a few weeks last fall before the mayor closed them again. The city does not yet have the testing capacity to open those schools, officials have said, and the teachers' union has said it would oppose plans to reopen middle and high schools this winter. As the city's positivity rate has climbed over the last few weeks, educators have expressed incredulity that elementary schools and classrooms for children with the most complex disabilities would remain open in the new year. One faction of the United Federation of Teachers called on the union and the city to immediately close all schools for in-person learning, rather than waiting to see if the numbers worsen. Too many students, families and staff will become sick, if schools remain open, U.F.T. Solidarity, a left-leaning caucus within the union, said in a recent statement. Eliza Shapiro and

On Tuesday night I watched the first day of the Senate impeachment trial, which, I felt, was not unlike a dissident's court case in Vietnam — it is likely that no witnesses will be called or documents allowed to be presented, only state-generated photos and video clips are provided, and a ready-made ruling is seemingly in store. The only difference is that the defendant in the Senate case — the president of the United States — will most likely be acquitted.

In a small surprise, Mr. Cuomo also said that he would ask the Department of Health to study how New York would be affected by neighboring states like New Jersey and Massachusetts legalizing or moving toward the legalization of recreational marijuana.

When Minnesota made vaping more expensive, they found, smokers kept smoking instead of switching to e-cigarettes. A longstanding decline in adult smoking in the state slowed way down, while smoking in states that hadn't imposed big vaping taxes continued to fall. The researchers concluded that making e-cigarettes more expensive discouraged Minnesota smokers from trying them and caused fewer of them to switch away from smoking. By measuring the difference in the trends, the researchers estimated that Minnesota caused around 32,000 more adults to keep smoking cigarettes.

In 1980, there were 4,600 wholesalers in the country, and most markets had four or five competing wholesalers. Today, fewer than 3,000 remain, and in most local markets over 90 percent of the beer is controlled by distributors for these same two companies — one of which is dependent on AB InBev for most of its volume, and the other on Miller Coors.
Those who object to the border-adjustment proposal — chiefly retailers who sell imported goods — claim that there will be exorbitant price increases for consumers. But there is reason to think any such increases would be smaller than critics suggest, as the tax would be applied only to the (lower) wholesale price at the border, not to the (higher) retail price in their stores.
U.S. attorney's office opens probe into deaths of Capitol Police officer and protester. Officer Brian D. Sicknick died from injuries sustained during the storming of the Capitol on Wednesday. Credit... U.S. Capitol Police The U.S. attorney's office in Washington is leading investigations into the deaths of a woman who entered the Capitol building with a crowd of rioters on Jan. 6 and an officer who was killed while trying to police the violent mob, according to Michael Sherwin, the office's top prosecutor. Prosecutors in the office's Civil Rights division have opened a formal, federal excessive force case into the shooting death of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by a Capitol Police officer as she and a group of President Trump's supporters swarmed the building. The investigation into Ms. Babbitt's shooting is routine, standard procedure whenever an officer deploys lethal force, a Justice Department spokeswoman said. The U.S. attorney's office has also opened a federal homicide investigation into the death of Brian D. Sicknick, a Capitol Hill police officer who died after pro-Trump rioters struck him with a fire extinguisher. Mr. Sicknick died on Thursday from injuries sustained while physically engaging with pro-Trump rioters who descended on the U.S. Capitol the day before. Both investigations are being led by detectives from the Metropolitan Police Department. A total of five people died in the wake of the rampage on Jan. 6, including three other individuals who died after experiencing what were believed to be medical emergencies in the area around the Capitol.

The speaker of the West Virginia House, Roger Hanshaw, quickly condemned Mr. Evans's actions, saying on Wednesday that Mr. Evans would need to answer to his constituents and colleagues regarding his involvement in what has occurred today. On Saturday, Mr. Hanshaw, who is also a Republican, said in a statement that he hoped the House could move forward with its session without any further distraction. In announcing his resignation, Delegate Evans said he accepted responsibility for his actions and apologized to those he's hurt, he said. In this time of overheated, hyperbolic political rage, I think that's a good first step for us all to take right now.

In a five-page letter sent on Monday, the government watchdog group, Common Cause New York, requested that the city's Campaign Finance Board and its Conflicts of Interest Board look into the mayor's actions and those of the groups, which, Common Cause asserts, run afoul of broadly worded sections of the city charter and of campaign finance law, as well as the spirit of those regulations.
The widening deficit comes despite a booming economy and a low unemployment rate that would typically help fill the government's coffers. Federal spending outpaced revenue by $317 billion over the first three months of the fiscal year, which began in October, the budget office reported. That was 41 percent higher than the same period a year ago, or 17 percent after factoring in payment shifts that made the fiscal 2018 first-quarter deficit appear smaller than it actually was.
Yet party elites struck a Faustian bargain to secure tax cuts for wealthy Americans, business-friendly deregulation and conservative court picks. They understood that in a world of economic anxiety, disempowerment of the middle class and colossal income inequality, such policies would deliver majorities. The successful combination is most likely to encourage many Republicans to continue to embrace it. It lets them mobilize, at least in some places and at least for now, a majority of voters. With the party's elite disinclined to grapple with extreme wealth inequalities and the increasing immiseration and insecurity of the American middle and working classes, the only way to win votes may be to pander to cultural resentment.
But opponents may have come around since the brewery opened in 2012. Mitten closes earlier than bars in the area, Mr. Andrus said, and we attract a lot of families. The brewery, which is profitable, seems to have also attracted investment in the neighborhood. Across the street is a gin distillery, in a former clothing store, and another corner has a barbecue joint, in a former hamburger stand. Other breweries have also arrived in the area.

The addition of sexual harassment to the budget process may create an awkward optic: There are no women among the four men who are charged with negotiating the budget — Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Flanagan, Mr. Klein, and Carl E. Heastie, the speaker of the Assembly. For his part, however, Mr. Klein said on Tuesday that he expected to be vindicated. We have to strengthen our sexual harassment laws, he said. And I intend to push to make that happen.
Retirement, in the sense of living off his savings, is probably not an option. The president has spent all his adult life trying to tie his name to the idea of incredible riches. In truth it was mainly incredible borrowing. Now the rats — OK, be fair, the financiers — are leaving the sinking ship and he's surrounded by debt disasters. The banks that have lent him tons of money want it back.
The proposal would temporarily increase the size of two tax credits in a manner that would effectively provide more cash from the government to low-income workers and families.
At 60, she was not ready to retire, and available jobs paid $20 an hour compared with her previous six-figure salary, so she began providing outplacement services.

The larger unit is about 1,750 square feet, with a galley kitchen from Arclinea on the left, just past the front door, and a bathroom with a shower on the right. Beyond the kitchen, the living-and-dining area has resin flooring installed over older Carrara marble, and the living room has a long, narrow terrace. Stairs lead to a mezzanine overlooking the living-and-dining area and to the first bedroom, which has built-in storage and a bed tucked under a sharply sloping ceiling. (The furniture is included in the asking price.) Adjacent is a room in the building's tower that could be used as a library, bedroom or sitting area, Mr. Scandolera said. The master bedroom is reached by walking through the first bedroom; it has a sitting area, an en-suite bathroom and a terrace with views of the sea and town.
Pat Baer, the longtime technical director for U.C.B., said in a post on Twitter that he was losing his job.
Now I am no longer laughing because it is no joke. President Trump's lawyers blatantly lied in their legal brief. They have argued that impeachment based on abuse of power is a radical concept and that the framers did not want Congress to judge whether presidents abused their discretion. When a majority of constitutional scholars agree that impeachment is the very tool available to Congress to stop a president's abuse of power, saying that theory is radical and unfounded is a baldfaced lie.
That might be the case in the near term, but not in the longer run, and therein lies a very big problem of the Republicans' own making. Republicans are relying on a BAT to raise over $1 trillion in the next 10 years to be used for — what else? — compensating for big cuts in business and individual tax rates. Substantial BAT revenue is plausible in the near term because imports are currently far larger than exports; as a result, the BAT on imports would raise more revenue than would be lost by exempting exports from tax.

For an employee deemed excepted from furlough during a shutdown — which is to say, forced to work without pay — walking off the job could carry a similar penalty. Guidance from the federal Office of Personnel Management prohibits excepted employees from taking any sort of leave, including vacation or sick days, during a shutdown.
The most significant reductions last year were around transportation, which remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, said Kate Larsen, a director at Rhodium Group, a research and consulting firm. But as vaccines become more prevalent, and depending on how quickly people feel comfortable enough to drive and fly again, we'd expect emissions to rebound unless there are major policy changes put in place.
Now quoting people is very Trumpian, but who do you think he specifically had in mind? Anybody besides his family and Rudy Giuliani? One of the more terrible aspects of Trump's dwindling presidency is that Rudy is left as the guy with the chief executive's ear.

Currently, you can be insured as a dependent on your parent's health insurance plan until age 26 — unless you can get insurance through your job. If you cannot piggyback on your parent's plan and you do not have a job with health insurance, you may need to buy a policy through a health insurance marketplace.

Arizona is facing 'dire circumstances,' its outbreak even worse than summer's surge. Banner Health personnel prepare doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine during a vaccination drive held at the Arizona State Fairgrounds, in Phoenix on Monday. Credit... Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times The summer surge that raged across the Sun Belt started in Arizona. For more than a month, from early June until mid July, the state added cases at the highest per capita rate in the country. Thousands died. Hospitals were stretched thin. At the peak, more than 3,800 cases were emerging each day. As a new year begins, Arizona is again in dire shape, with a higher rate of new cases than any other state. Hospitalizations and deaths have surpassed records. Over the last week, the state has averaged more than 8,000 cases a day, more than double the summer peak. It shouldn't have to have taken this amount of destruction for folks to take it seriously, said Kristin Urquiza, who spoke of losing her father to the coronavirus at the Democratic National Convention last summer. In recent months, she said, she has been in Phoenix, helping her mother but also watching the city around her be overtaken by the virus that killed her father in June. There might be some hope that people will begin to think about it differently if they see it take hold of people they love, she said.
DAVOS, Switzerland — The last time President Trump arrived at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, his trip was treated with deep skepticism, if not disdain, by the business and political leaders who gather once a year in this ski town in the Swiss Alps. It was 2018 and even with his newly enacted tax cuts, his populist, antiglobalist rhetoric and Twitter outbursts were more than enough to make the event's collection of plutocrats uneasy.

So all the rage is based on lies. But what's almost as striking as the fantasies of the rioters is how few leading Republicans have been willing, despite the violence and desecration, to tell the MAGA mob that their conspiracy theories are false.
So wages, salaries and other forms of workers' compensation dropped only a little — $43 billion over the nine months — despite mass unemployment. But there is more to the story.
Relatedly, the ratio of the adult population that was employed soared from 60.1 percent in January to 60.4 percent in February, then held that level in March.
The American Funds College 2024 Fund and College 2027 Fund also buy both stocks and bonds. The two target-date college funds don't invest directly in those securities but do so through other funds in the American family, which is managed by the Capital Group. Both college funds, for example, hold shares of the American Mutual Fund and the Bond Fund of America, which have been part of the American lineup for decades.
The tax law expanded the availability of the deduction for medical expenses not just for 2018, but also for 2017. The deduction previously applied to medical expenses over 10 percent of adjusted gross income, but the law lowered the bar to 7.5 percent for those two years. (So if your adjusted gross income is $40,000, you can write off medical expenses over $3,000, rather than over $4,000.) But there is a catch: You must itemize to take the deduction. After 2018, the bar is scheduled to move back up to 10 percent.
A trade deal, signed into law in Britain in the early hours of Thursday, less than 24 hours before it took effect, means the country and the European Union will trade goods without tariffs. Businesses, however, will still face significant changes that they had been urged to prepare for even during the lockdowns, closures and other social restrictions that the government has introduced to contain a surging coronavirus pandemic.
One of the biggest things has been trying to keep in mind that by electing a socialist, my constituents have made the choice to reject the status quo, he said. They want someone to go and fight, even if that person is on the losing end.
This 13th-century house in Bruges, in northwest Belgium, was fully renovated in 2009. The property is in the city center, near picturesque canals, medieval churches and market squares, and has a historic designation.
Fed policymakers also said at the meeting that they expected the combination of the tax cuts signed by Mr. Trump last year and a bipartisan congressional deal this year to increase federal spending to give economic output a significant boost in the next few years.
If you've received your formal tax bill, it may be too late to file an appeal — sometimes called an abatement request.
G.M. said auto sales fell in 2020 but were up in the final three months of the year. Sales of Chevrolets and other makes in the fourth quarter offset a 10 percent drop in sales of Buicks, General Motors reported on Tuesday. Credit... David Zalubowski/Associated Press General Motors said its vehicle sales in the United States fell 12 percent in 2020, but increased 5 percent in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier, a hopeful sign for the auto industry at the end of a difficult year. The automaker reported solid performances from its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac brands in the final three months of the year. They offset a 10 percent drop in sales of Buick vehicles. Overall, G.M. sold 2.5 million cars and light trucks in 2020, down from nearly 2.9 million a year earlier. Auto sales fell sharply last spring as consumers stayed away from dealerships because of the coronavirus pandemic. G.M. and other automakers were forced to halt production for most of the second quarter when government officials forced many businesses to shut down to stop the spread of the virus. But sales rebounded once factories restarted in part because of pent-up demand for cars and trucks. Some Americans bought cars in order to avoid mass transit and shared rides. It helped that people had more disposable income because they were spending less on travel, dining and entertainment. G.M. said its strong sales momentum continued through the end of the year.
Justin Levinson, a former reporter who became frustrated by the high turnover in the East Village, decided the best way to call attention to the issue was visually, with a map.
Homes sales and prices continue to ease in Toronto after last year's housing bubble, but it's not all good news. Canada's Mortgage and Housing Corporation said recently that the city's market has responded to surging demand for homes with a housing supply that is significantly weaker than other Canadian metropolitan areas.

Trump isn't exactly mending broken relationships. Fresh from the violence-packed assault on the Capitol by his crazed supporters, he's managed to disparage almost everyone who hasn't broken into a federal office building on his behalf. Even Vice President Mike Pence.
The proposal is such a perversion of the law that it has prompted an unusual split among federal agencies. Federal banking regulation is a byzantine mess, and enforcement of the Community Reinvestment Act is a prime example. Responsibility for supervising the compliance of the nation's roughly 5,200 banks is divided among three different agencies. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency supervises most large banks, which make about 70 percent of the loans covered by the law. Supervision of the remaining banks, mostly smaller, is divided between the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve.

The building boom made Brooklyn ascendant, with Queens not far behind, and some major residential mixed-use projects are now also underway in the South Bronx. There are already signs of the market and neighborhoods pushing back against the glut of new development and subsequent gentrification. In Manhattan, where the surplus of new luxury condos could take more than six years to sell, there is already a shift toward smaller, relatively less expensive units. Sweeping rent reforms in 2019 could also shape what gets built, and for whom, in the years to come.
Investors in the United States are waiting for the outcome of a pair of runoff elections in Georgia that will determine which party controls the Senate and how successful President-elect Joseph R Biden Jr. might be in getting his agenda through Congress. That agenda includes more government spending to bolster the economy, which would be good news for stock investors. At the same time, however, Mr. Biden has said he plans to raise some taxes.
He is the first to admit that these bills have little chance of passing this session, since Republicans hold a slim majority in both chambers of the state legislature, and even some Democrats oppose them.
But eventually it all comes back in a rush of clarity. You might be pushing your toddler through the park on a glorious sunny day off when suddenly you ask yourself: Did I say Dallas was the capital of Texas last week? Yes. Yes, you did. You idiot.
But given that members of the Trump administration will be out of a job in 13 days and that Democrats will control the White House and both chambers of Congress, the resignations and rebukes have little, if any, practical significance. In his interview on CNN, Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump simply did not listen to dissent within his administration. You don't survive on telling this president the truth, he said. Not for very long, anyway.
If confirmed, Judge Garland would inherit a department that grew more politicized under President Trump than at any point since Watergate. He would decide whether to pursue investigations into Mr. Trump, his associates and his former and current cabinet members, a topic that has divided Democrats and even employees inside the department. Mr. Biden himself has said that he is not eager to prosecute the past. But it is unclear whether the extraordinary events that unfolded in Washington on Wednesday — as Mr. Trump said he would never concede the election and his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol — would affect that the issue.
She voted for Hillary Clinton because she objected to President Trump's proposed border wall and his characterizations of immigrants. I can't say that I would have voted for her just because of the economy, Anna said.
But after being unveiled with great fanfare four years ago, the project's future is unclear. New Jersey Transit, which operates the state's sprawling rail network, said recently that no funding was available so far for the plan.
A quirk of the calendar is giving taxpayers more time to file their returns this year. (The traditional filing day, April 15, falls on a Saturday, but the next Monday is a holiday in Washington, bumping tax day to Tuesday.)
Business has been growing for the last year and a half, since Argentina's political climate has improved, Ms. Laich said. We're also seeing a lot of Europeans coming to South America, which they see as safe.
More broadly, the president-elect and his team are setting higher expectations for a legislative agenda now that his party controls Congress. Efforts like expansion of the Affordable Care Act and an ambitious overhaul of the nation's immigration laws are more likely than they were with the Senate in Republican control. Several immigration advocacy groups issued statements urging Mr. Biden to quickly put the Democratic gains to use.
To keep it simple, my goals would be what energy innovator Hal Harvey has dubbed the four zeros. 1. Zero-net energy buildings: buildings that can produce as much energy as they consume. 2. Zero-waste manufacturing: stimulating manufacturers to design and build products that use fewer raw materials and that are easily disassembled and recycled. 3. A zero-carbon grid: If we can combine renewable power generation at a utility scale with some consumers putting up their own solar panels and windmills that are integrated with the grid, and with large-scale storage batteries, we really could, one day, electrify everything carbon-free. 4. Zero-emissions transportation: a result of combining electric vehicles and electric public transportation with a zero-carbon grid.
So should you make that leap?
Of the hundreds of bills that were signed into law, many won't be enacted until later this year. Starting in July, Californians will be prohibited from buying more than one semiautomatic rifle in a 30-day period. Proposition 19, which narrowly passed in the fall, will require people who inherit property to use it as their primary residence or have its tax value reassessed starting in February. And a flavored-tobacco ban that was set to go into effect last week now probably won't be adopted until at least 2022.

Skerkowski — whose own imposing physique belies his gracefulness on ice — resolved to teach them. He arrived early to make sure a Zamboni driver flooded the surface, which mitigates skate scars (a stray hair can redirect a stone), and to help bolt starting-block-like hacks into place. Then, using a hose from a shoulder-borne water pack, he sprinkled the frozen surface, creating pebbles for the rocks to slide on. When the curious recruits arrived, he gave them lessons in how to crouch, push off from a hack and deliver a 42-pound stone, diamond-cut from one of the world's only two quarries, in Wales and Scotland, that have the right quality of granite; how to sweep the ice with a broom to make the rock go farther and straighter while en route to the bull's-eye-like house. By last September, he had trained enough beginners to hold an actual league season. Now, just three months later, several of his more ambitious disciples were eager to enter national tournaments, or bonspiels. When Skerkowski gently encouraged them to focus on gaining experience, he began to hear rumors of an imminent leadership coup.

Ms. Bowser and the governors of Virginia and Maryland have been clear that visitors should not travel to the D.C. metro area for the Inauguration, the company said in a statement. Additionally, we are aware of reports emerging yesterday afternoon regarding armed militias and known hate groups that are attempting to travel and disrupt the inauguration. Airbnb said it would refund guests for their reservations and reimburse hosts at its own expense. The company declined to say how many reservations would be canceled, the dates the cancellation policy would be in effect or how far from Washington its policy would apply. But two Airbnb hosts who contacted the company about the status of existing reservations were told by customer service representatives that Airbnb was canceling reservations that started on or after Jan. 15 and ended by Jan. 21, according to screenshots provided to The New York Times. Airbnb also said it had banned numerous individuals associated with known hate groups or otherwise involved with the mob at the Capitol. It declined to provide more details.

In the most basic sense, the addition of two Democrats — the Rev. Raphael Warnock, who has won his race, and Jon Ossoff, who is maintaining a lead in his — to the Senate would redefine Mr. Biden's approach to lawmaking, giving him more power but possibly challenging his preferred approach of broad bipartisan deal-making.
But today's politicians face an obstacle that the class of '74 could mostly ignore: the enormous cost of campaigns. Republican members fell out of touch with their districts in part because they were increasingly dependent on a few large national donors, operating through super PACs and political nonprofits such as the Congressional Leadership Fund, which get the bulk of their donations from billionaires in Las Vegas, New York, Texas and Florida. Democrats, too, relied on these outside groups and their own billionaires, but 2018 brought an enormous wave of small donors. And while much of that came from fired-up progressives in solid Democratic districts, even in the highest-profile races, a surprising share came from the candidates' own constituents — for example, more than 54 percent of Beto O'Rourke's contributions came from Texans. A majority of Democratic challengers also refused corporate PAC money, which often runs through Washington lobbyists.

The National Emergencies Act of 1976 authorized the president to initiate emergency powers of government, but with the condition that he or she specify the particular provisions in detail. (This is the authority President Trump has reportedly explored as a way of funding his wall.) Intelligence reforms imposed limits on the C.I.A. and F.B.I., whose surveillance and national security operations had greatly enhanced the president's power. Last but not least, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 sought to watch against a replay of Watergate by establishing the Office of the Independent Counsel to ensure that there would be independent investigations into executive branch corruption.
The monetary fund is right. Requiring the country to run big budget surpluses when its economy is growing at an annual rate of only 0.4 percent is cruel and counterproductive. Based on current trends, the fund projects that the country's debt will increase to more than 250 percent of G.D.P. during the next several decades. European officials are much more optimistic, but that hopefulness is based on the dubious assumption that Greece can run large budget surpluses for decades to come.
The fact is that the dire predictions of deficit scolds never came true, and there is now widespread agreement among economists that debt is far less of a problem than conventional wisdom asserted. Among other things, while the level of federal debt may seem high, low interest rates mean that the burden of servicing that debt is actually very low by historical standards.

A C.D.C. analysis describes anaphylaxis after people have received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as 'rare.' Any site that administers the currently authorized vaccines must be prepared to recognize and treat a severe allergic reaction that may occur, though it is a rare outcome, federal health officials said. Credit... Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times Of the nearly 2 million Americans who received coronavirus vaccinations developed by Pfizer and BioNTech during a 10-day stretch last month, 21 experienced a serious and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, federal health officials said Wednesday. Although the risk is ten times higher than the risk for anaphylaxis after a seasonal flu vaccine, officials described the reaction as a rare outcome. The rate of anaphylaxis following vaccination was estimated to be 11.1 per million doses administered, compared with 1.3 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses of influenza vaccine administered, officials said. We know that safety is one of the public's biggest concerns about the Covid vaccine, said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The anaphylaxis rate may seem high compared to the flu vaccine, but I want to reassure you: This is still a rare outcome. Any site that administers the vaccine must be prepared to recognize and treat a severe allergic reaction that may occur, federal health officials said.

When controlling for changes in a state's economy and welfare policies, the researchers estimated that a $1 increase in the minimum wage corresponded with a 3.5 percent decrease in the suicide rate for those with a high school education or less. Without some of the controls, the decrease in the suicide rate was 6 percent. The effect was most pronounced during times of high unemployment.
But nowhere is the hemorrhaging of Greece more severe than in the departure of young people. Greece has seen mass emigration in the past, as poverty, war, dictatorships and lack of prospects drove mostly unskilled people to seek their fortunes in America, Australia, Europe and Africa. This time, though, most of those leaving are depriving the country of their skills and of its investment. Some 92 percent are university or technical college graduates, with 64 percent of the total holding postgraduate degrees, including doctorates, the ICAP consultancy found in a survey of 1,068 Greeks in 61 countries. Some 18,000 medical doctors have left during the crisis; each had cost the state 85,000 euros to train, according to the Athens Medical Association.

I don't think that they thought about baseball when they thought about this change, said Kari Smoker, an accounting professor at SUNY Brockport who has consulted for the N.B.A. and National Hockey League players' associations in legislative disputes over sports taxation. It raises all kinds of issues, which I think were easier to ignore, probably, when we had a simple rule that it was a like-kind exchange.
Mr. Falcone, once one of the richest men in the hedge fund industry, is not a party to the settlement and is not required to pay any of the back taxes. He did not assume ownership of Harbinger's management company until the latter half of 2009, and technically he was an employee brought in by Harbert to run the fund and make the investment decisions during the time taxes were not paid.

Unsure of exactly what he had when his soccer hacking turned up hundreds of thousands of pages related to the companies controlled by Ms. dos Santos and her husband, Mr. Pinto asked Mr. Bourdon, according to the French lawyer, if he could take a hard drive containing the data to a whistle-blower platform Mr. Bourdon had set up in Africa.
Mr. Trump testified that Kaszycki & Sons fell behind, and that he only vaguely recalled complaints of payment problems. He said he did not remember threats against an employee.
Whom do we have to blame for the attempted coup by President Trump and his supporters? Mr. Trump himself and the lawless thugs who participated, of course. But, more important, the sycophants in the Republican Party who have supported and encouraged Mr. Trump for the past four years; the propagandists at Fox News who have conspired with him to spread falsehoods, conspiracy theories and anger to line their own pockets; and a number of so-called pillars of our society — wealthy businesspeople who have supported a patently dishonest, racist, incompetent and hateful president to preserve their tax breaks.
The grim scene in Whiteclay has scarcely changed for decades. Particularly in the warmer months, Native Americans can be seen openly drinking beer in town, often passed out on the ground, disheveled and ill. Many who come to Whiteclay from the reservation spend the night sleeping on mattresses in vacant lots or fields.
What is the lagoon now used to be the football field on this island, Mr. Nizar said on a recent afternoon. I have to leave this guesthouse if it keeps eroding. I am sure of it.
Four other Democrats have already entered the primary race in the Second Congressional District, which cuts across New Jersey's southernmost counties and stretches from Cape May to the Pennsylvania border.
Two generations ago, when newspapers still ran gender-segregated ads, there were virtually no women on Wall Street aside from the secretaries. But once women were grudgingly welcomed to the business world, Wall Street was not their first choice. Male brokers largely worked for commissions alone — an eat what you kill mentality that did not appeal to women. Instead, professional women gravitated to stable sources of income in fields like law, education or medicine.
Dead is an exaggeration. Steel production has been in decline, as has the number of employees in the industry. But the metals industry still employed over 360,000 workers and produced 80 million tons of raw steel in the year before Mr. Trump took office.
Michelle Obama calls on social media companies to 'stop enabling' Trump and ban him permanently. Michelle Obama in 2019. Now is the time for Silicon Valley to stop enabling this monstrous behavior, she said of the president in a statement on Thursday. Credit... Paul R. Giunta/Invision, via Associated Press Michelle Obama, the former first lady, called on social media companies to permanently ban President Trump on Thursday in the aftermath of a violent mob he incited at the Capitol. Now is the time for Silicon Valley to stop enabling this monstrous behavior — and go even further than they have already by permanently banning this man from their platforms, Mrs. Obama wrote in a lengthy statement posted on Twitter. If we have any hope of improving this nation, now is the time for swift and serious consequences. Earlier on Thursday, Facebook said it would block Mr. Trump on its platforms at least until the end of his term on Jan. 20, as the mainstream online world moved forcefully to limit the president after years of inaction. Mrs. Obama also highlighted the contrast in police response to the mob at the Capitol, when compared with the Black Lives Matter protests that were met with brutal force last year. In city after city, day after day, we saw peaceful protesters met with brute force.
With that decision, Mr. Trump acceded to pressure from retailers and conservative advocacy groups, but the move could deepen the challenge of passing a broad tax overhaul in Congress, where concern about the swelling federal deficit runs high. His plan would put off the difficult part of a tax overhaul: closing loopholes and increasing other taxes to limit the impact of tax cuts on the budget deficit.
The portions were meager, raising concerns about whether children were getting enough nutrition during the coronavirus pandemic, and the government had overpaid for them, the critics said.
Republicans were largely silent on the plan, which includes the type of state and local aid that became a sticking point in last year's stimulus negotiations. Congress was able to agree on a $900 billion package in December only after such aid was excluded. But Mr. Biden outlined his rationale for including such funding, saying it was vital to avoiding cutbacks and layoffs that would set back the fight against the virus and further damage the economy.
To the surprise of many Davos regulars, the economic results have yet to prove as disastrous as they expected — and, at least in the short term, have seemingly proven to be quite positive. (The long-term effects, of course, are still unknown.)
I think we are in one of those times right now, where people feel like things as they are going, aren't working, that we're bogged down in the same arguments that we've been having and they're not useful. And the Republican approach I think has played itself out.
5,000 more National Guard troops are heading to D.C. The National Guard patrolling the perimeter of the Capitol Thursday morning. Credit... Todd Heisler/The New York Times The Pentagon is deploying more than 5,000 additional National Guard troops from six states to Washington, and the troops will stay through the inauguration later this month, a senior Pentagon official said Thursday. After pleas from Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, the Pentagon mobilized all 1,100 available District of Columbia National Guard troops on Wednesday afternoon to confront the violent mob that had stormed the Capitol. About 340 D.C. National Guard had been called up earlier in the week to help with crowd and traffic control. An additional 5,100 Guard troops from Virginia, Maryland, New York, Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey are expected to arrive in Washington over the next several days and remain through Jan. 20 for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s inauguration, the senior official said. That will bring the total number of Guard troops in the capital to 6,200. Pentagon officials said that the additional Guard personnel would support local police and federal law enforcement officers. In June, some 5,000 Guard troops — from the District of Columbia and a dozen states — were rushed to the streets of the capital to help in the crackdown on mostly peaceful protesters and occasional looters after the killing of George Floyd in police custody.
Extreme weather events are already causing economic havoc. The California wildfires last year were estimated to have caused $25.4 billion in damage. Pacific Gas & Electric, the largest energy producer in the state, has filed for bankruptcy.
Based on a one-man autobiographical stage show, the movie finds Josh Kornbluth recounting his possibly real-life exploits of failing to file tax returns for seven years, and the troubles that resulted from his attempts to rectify the situation.
Russia has been dragging its feet. By March, the International Energy Agency said, Russia had cut about 170,000 barrels a day in output. The Saudi oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, grumbled that the non-OPEC producers were in a learning process on the need to actually follow through with cuts. Aleksandr Novak, the Russian energy minister, said on May 2 that Russia had reached the targeted reduction.
That was what happened when federal investigators battled with the company over iPhone encryption after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people in 2015. In that case, the government was trying to get Apple to break the protection of the suspect's phone by demanding it create what Apple called in a court filing a GovtOS (that is, a government operating system), giving it that metaphorical key to a backdoor to all phones. The F.B.I. director at the time, James Comey, and President Barack Obama pressed Apple to help it crack into a device that one of the gunmen had owned.
Legend has it that the British economist John Maynard Keynes, asked why he had changed his position on a question of economic policy, responded: When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?
Béatrice Duval, the head of Le Livre de Poche, France's biggest paperback publishing house and a former editor at Gallimard, said that Gallimard's business strategy largely focused on winning prizes.
How can the Senate hold a trial if Trump is out of office? There is no precedent for the Senate holding an impeachment trial after a president has left office, but it has done so for other government officials. Democrats who control the House can choose when to send their article of impeachment to the Senate, at which point that chamber would have to immediately move to begin the trial. But even if the House transmitted the charge to the other side of the Capitol right away, an agreement between Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate would be needed to take it up before Jan. 19, a day before Mr. Biden is inaugurated. Since Mr. McConnell said on Wednesday that he would not agree, the trial cannot start until after Mr. Biden is president. That could clog the Senate floor in the early days of Mr. Biden's administration, at a time when he will be eager to have the chamber confirm members of his cabinet. Would impeaching Trump disqualify him from holding office again? Conviction in an impeachment trial would not automatically disqualify Mr. Trump from future public office. But if the Senate were to convict him, the Constitution allows a subsequent vote to bar an official from holding any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States. That vote would require only a simple majority of senators. There is no precedent, however, for disqualifying a president from future office, and the issue could end up before the Supreme Court.
This small percentage of tax dollars ensures access to meaningful cultural experiences close to home. The Kansas Humanities Council, primarily funded through the N.E.H., supported more than 700 events in 126 Kansas communities last year. These programs are the lifeblood of many small and rural groups.
Murkowski Is Latest G.O.P. Senator to Signal Possible Support for Convicting Trump The timing of the Senate's impeachment trial remains unclear.

As a general rule, it is important to be on a sustainable fiscal path, the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, a Republican, said at a news conference last month. From my way of thinking and many others', the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when unemployment is low, and taxes are, you know, are pouring in.

From the state's point of view, subsidies have translated into real economic progress. A spokesman for the governor said the unemployment rate had dropped to 4.7 percent statewide in November, its lowest level since November 2007, and that New York State had added 759,300 private jobs since Mr. Cuomo took office. In central New York, the region around Syracuse, unemployment has fallen from 8.3 percent before Mr. Cuomo took office to 4.9 percent in November, according to figures provided by the governor's office. The region has added 9,300 private jobs in the same period.
The story of the labor movement is the story of low-wage and higher-wage workers uniting together. I think that inadvertently, the progressive left has made the mistake of internalizing Reagan and thinking that the labor movement is only made up of low-wage workers.
Feminists pushed back, arguing that the choice they had been fighting for was never between working or staying home. They always wanted changes in workplace culture, public policy and men's involvement at home, along with career opportunities.
Free tax help from trained volunteers is available for low- and moderate-income filers through the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program; sites generally open near the end of January and users can search online for a location nearby.
Because the cars would operate on city streets, the project is not expected to be subject to state approval — meaning it would not require the blessing of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who last year was quick to quash a major State of the City proposal by Mr. de Blasio to build lower-cost housing over train yards in Sunnyside, Queens. (Mr. Cuomo said the yards, which are partly controlled by the state, were not available.)
The new political calculations were on display just hours after the results of the Georgia races were clear on Wednesday, when Mr. Biden revealed he had selected Judge Garland of the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as attorney general. Before Tuesday's elections, some Democrats had expressed worry that choosing Judge Garland would allow a Republican-controlled Senate to replace him on an important court. Now that Democrats are in control, that is no longer a concern.

Mr. Carter has been a vocal opponent of the incentive package, worth more than half a billion dollars, used to lure one of Amazon's new headquarters to Crystal City, Va. And he fought against a bill overhauling the state's energy grid, arguing that it gave away too much to Dominion, a powerful for-profit utility.
SEATTLE — Three corporate behemoths — Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase — announced on Tuesday that they would form an independent health care company for their employees in the United States.
Fair point. It's a fact that we, as individuals, are embedded in systems that affect how much greenhouse gas we emit. And, changing those systems is tougher than changing our own behavior. It's hard to ride a bike to work, for example, if your community doesn't have bike lanes.
Warren's presidential agenda has several other easily understandable ideas, like a $200-a-month increase in Social Security benefits, a price reduction for insulin and other popular drugs, the cancellation of up to $50,000 in student debt and a wealth tax. During a recent interview with her, I mentioned that she seemed to believe that bigger ideas were sometimes easier to accomplish than more modest ones. I do, she replied. Big ideas can inspire people; tax credits do not.
Pence plans to attend Biden's inauguration. Vice President Mike Pence presiding with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to certify the results of the presidential election. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Vice President Mike Pence will attend President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s inauguration on Jan. 20, an aide to the vice president said on Saturday, a split with President Trump's decision not to go. Mr. Pence and Mr. Trump have not spoken since Wednesday, an administration official said, before pro-Trump loyalists swarmed the Capitol as Congress convened to tally the Electoral College votes. As president of the Senate, Mr. Pence had the constitutionally designated task of opening and counting envelopes sent from all 50 states and announcing their electoral results. In the days leading to the joint session of Congress, Mr. Trump had publicly and privately pressured Mr. Pence to overturn the certifications and throw them back to the states so that Mr. Trump could try to undo results in states that he had lost. Mr. Trump confirmed on Friday that he would not be attending the inauguration. Mr. Biden said this week that he was happy not to have Mr. Trump there, but that Mr. Pence was welcome and that it would help with the transition. Mr. Pence had always been likelier to attend the inauguration than Mr. Trump, who was almost certain to skip the ceremony. But after the Capitol breach on Wednesday that left at least five people dead, Mr. Pence's decision was expected.
I'm not a high-paid salary, federal bureaucrat in Washington. I'm an air conditioning mechanic. My husband is an electronics technician in the United States Coast Guard. I work at the United States Department of Agriculture. My husband is an attorney for the Department of Commerce. We work for the U.S.D.A. in rural housing. My husband is active duty. I've been a government employee, now, for 29 years. Today, was the first time in my life that I actually filed for unemployment insurance. It was quite a moment. It's just my husband and I. I'm coming to the point to where I don't know if I should just go ahead and apply for unemployment. If I should look for, maybe, temporary work. We're going to need another income pretty soon. The prospect that, for no reason at all, I may have to find another permanent job is very frustrating and it speaks to a kind of waste. You know, the taxpayers would have to fund the whole hiring process for my replacement. I have an autoimmune condition that causes severe nerve pain and made the decision to cut back work hours so I could focus on my health and get more treatment. But we can't now get on my husband's plan because my husband works for the federal government and they're not processing the special enrollments right now. I was due to retire from the government on Dec. 30. The lady that was processing my, my pension has been furloughed. I can't even retire.
Mr. Trump championed ideas that had been bubbling up among the Republican grass roots since the late 20th century. His great political talent has been to see the extent of these resentments and rhetorically, and to some extent politically, speak to those concerns. His hold on his supporters is not just a cult of personality but grounded in a set of deeply rooted and increasingly widespread ideas within the Republican Party: ending birthright citizenship for immigrants, militarizing the border, disenfranchising Americans under the guise of protecting the integrity of the ballot, favoring an isolationist nationalism.
WASHINGTON — The attorney general for the District of Columbia filed suit on Wednesday against President Trump's inaugural committee, accusing the organization of wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars in violation of a local law prohibiting self-dealing by nonprofit organizations.
Still, Democratic leaders are facing pressure to find significantly more money for public schools. The scrutiny is now turning to Mayor Eric Garcetti and Gov. Gavin Newsom. Austin Beutner, the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, has suggested that the mayor use some of the city's budget to help pay for student services. And many observers say that an agreement between the union and the district will ultimately require more money from Mr. Newsom's budget.
When she saw that number, Ms. Jeanchaiyaphum assumed she must have made a mistake on her paperwork. She tried without success to speak with someone at Wells Fargo. She also reached out to the local S.B.A. office, where she said an official told her the loan couldn't be increased. Frustrated and defeated, Ms. Jeanchaiyaphum accepted the tiny loan.
Is it heartless for the schools to even consider home equity? After all, not every family has the income or creditworthiness to qualify for a home-equity loan or line of credit. Still, financial aid experts repeat the following like a mantra: An asset is an asset is an asset.
Considering the state's financial straits, Mr. Cuomo leaned heavily on proposals that would need little or no state funding, like banning gun ownership for people who have committed certain misdemeanor crimes in other states, banning foam food containers and outlawing synthetic opioids similar to fentanyl.
If the new members of Congress are able to govern as they campaigned, tirelessly, unafraid of hostile audiences, deeply connected to their districts, focused on improving individual lives, they might eventually pull politics out of the box in which either one party pushes through an entire unpopular agenda or Congress is paralyzed. A newfound focus on the local will also allow new members to bring forward innovations in local government and civic engagement.
Another new problem faced by large retailers with international locations: Rules-of-origin requirements, which determine whether a product leaving Britain is British enough to qualify for tariff-free trade with the European Union. International retailers who use sites in Britain as distribution centers are now finding that they can't automatically re-export their products to their stores in the European Union without facing tariffs — even if the product came from the bloc.

The meeting was the first under the Fed's new chairman, Jerome H. Powell. At the session's conclusion, officials announced that they would raise interest rates for the sixth time since the end of the Great Recession, in the range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. Officials released economic projections indicating that they expected to raise rates three times next year, more than the two increases in 2019 that they had forecast in December. The Fed said at the time the economy was continuing to get stronger and that the central bank remained on track to keep raising rates gradually. Mr. Powell echoed those sentiments at a news conference after the meeting.
Like all platforms, Mr. Trump is a natural engine of radicalization — for those who support him and those who oppose him. Consuming more of him leads only to a hardening of one's ideology. Each rally and every successive tweet is more extreme than the last, propelling most of Mr. Trump's followers deeper down the rabbit hole and intensifying their enthusiasm or disgust for the president. For this reason, like any good platform, Mr. Trump is a time suck. Evenings, weekends, holidays, you name it — are all derailed by his demand for your time and attention. Both are the ultimate currency to the Trump platform, allowing him to remain the central figure in American life.

But Block's tax sophistication can sometimes stupefy. The program gave me four options for a depreciation method for my new desktop Mac. I went with the default, having no idea what the terms GDS vs. ADS or regular vs. straight-line meant.

Shortly before the U.S. attorney, Byung J. Pak, abruptly resigned on Monday, the acting deputy attorney general, Richard Donoghue, relayed Mr. Trump's dissatisfaction with his efforts to investigate false claims of mass voter fraud in his district, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose details of the phone call. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Pak was also upset when he discovered that Mr. Trump had criticized him during his phone call last Saturday with Mr. Raffensperger. While Mr. Trump did not call out Mr. Pak by name, he falsely claimed that not enough had been done to uncover mass voter fraud in Fulton County, where Atlanta is. He added, You have your never-Trumper U.S. attorney there. Mr. Pak had planned to announce his departure on Monday, the day before the Georgia runoff elections, according to a person familiar with his job search. But dismayed by Mr. Trump's comments, he believed that it would be better to accelerate his departure and resign effective immediately, rather than give several days' notice, according to a third person with knowledge of Mr. Pak's departure. Mr. Donoghue has also faced pressure to stand up unproven and false claims by Mr. Trump that he would have won the election but for extensive voter fraud in states like Georgia.

Ms. DeVos was one of the most effective, polarizing and longest-serving Cabinet members in the Trump administration. She was seen as fiercely loyal to the president, at least publicly. In her resignation letter, Ms. DeVos praised President Trump for championing her school choice agenda, in which she sought to bolster voucher programs that allow students to seek alternatives to public schools. She also saluted one aspect of his coronavirus response, saying that she believed history will show we were correct in our repeated urging of and support for schools reopening this year. But it was loyalty to her constitutional oath, Ms. DeVos said, that had prompted her to resign. Impressionable children are watching all of this, and they are learning from us, she said. They must know from us that America is greater than what transpired yesterday. Ms. DeVos's resignation drew cheers from her opponents, particularly teacher's unions and groups that had forcefully opposed her rollbacks of civil rights protections for children of color and transgender students. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, issued a two-word statement: Good Riddance. But other critics praised her for protesting the president's actions.

Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regularly scheduled briefing on Wednesday that the government was doing its best to resolve the issue but that the question of the virus investigation is very complicated. It appeared to be the latest example of China's efforts to stymie an independent investigation into the origins of the virus, which has infected more than 86 million people and killed 1.8 million around the world since the initial outbreak in Wuhan more than a year ago. The W.H.O. has discussed sending an investigative team to Wuhan since last January, but the Chinese government has delayed those plans while promoting flimsy theories that the outbreak started outside of China. Last summer, two W.H.O. experts were allowed into China to negotiate the terms of the investigation, but they did not go to Wuhan. The Chinese government has yet to release crucial information about its own internal investigations into the virus's origins, including data from animal samples taken in and around Wuhan. Most scientists say the virus probably jumped to humans from an animal, probably a bat. They say that solving the mystery of its origin is critical to preventing future pandemics and helping to develop vaccines and treatments. In the absence of more solid information, numerous conspiracy theories about the virus have flourished. China has largely, but not entirely, subdued the virus within its borders. In Hebei Province near Beijing, a small flare-up in infections led the local authorities to declare wartime mode this week.
The idea behind WikiLeaks is simple, and ingenious: an online drop box that provides maximum security for whistle-blowers in the digital age. Anyone determined to disclose corporate or government misbehavior — from tax fraud to war crimes — can be sure that the heavily protected WikiLeaks's submission system ensures their emails and uploads cannot be traced.
Right now, we see the biggest risk in the global economy as one of talking ourselves into a recession, Mr. Corbat said in a conference call with analysts.
That would cost several hundred million dollars or more. That may seem like a steep price tag, but it's a tiny fraction of the $16 trillion in economic losses that the United States is estimated to have sustained because of Covid-19. We need some sort of leadership, said Dr. Charles Chiu, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, whose team spotted some of the first California cases of the new variant. This has to be a system that is implemented on a national level. Without that kind of dedicated support, it's simply not going to get done. With such a system in place, health officials could warn the public in affected areas and institute new measures to contend with the variant — such as using better masks, contact tracing, closing schools or temporary lockdowns — and do so early, rather than waiting until a new surge flooded hospitals with the sick. The incoming Biden administration may be open to the idea. The president-elect supports a national testing program that can help stop the spread of Covid-19 and find variants, said T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for the transition. That means more tests, increased lab capacity and genome sequencing. This is vital to control Covid-19 and to prepare the United States to detect and stop future disease threats. Experts point to Britain as a model for what the United States could do.

WASHINGTON — President-elect Joseph R.

How the new Republican tax plan approved late last year will affect housing isn't completely clear yet, but buying a home in 2018 will likely become more expensive, especially for buyers who live in high-tax states. Taxpayers used to be able to deduct all of their state and local taxes, including property taxes, state income taxes and city income taxes, from their federal taxes. Now those deductions are capped at $10,000 — and at $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately.
If Warren or Sanders is the candidate, he said, it's going to be harder to bring those Democrats who voted for Trump over.
City Hall officials said that the market value of the tax class that includes hotel, retail and office properties has fallen by 15.8 percent, putting the city's budget in a precarious position for the foreseeable future: Roughly half of the city's tax revenue comes from real estate.

Mr. Cuomo also said that the state would seal certain cannabis-related criminal records, though he did not specify which ones. Several legislators and advocacy groups have demanded a social justice component to any legalization bill.
President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday promoted the Senate runoffs in Georgia as an opportunity to break the gridlock that has gripped Washington, and his team was cautiously optimistic about the outcome.
Like other European countries, France has long been frustrated that platforms like Google, Facebook and Amazon have large digital presences and conduct a lot of commerce in their country, but pay few taxes because they have little physical presence there. In July, France passed into law a 3 percent tax on the revenue some companies earn from providing digital services to French users.

The most prominent of the groups is Campaign for One New York, which has hired the mayor's top outside political consultants and, as a nonprofit, has raised money for his political agenda outside the city's limits on campaign donations.
Seems like magic, right? Well, it works nicely just as long as you can afford to save in the first place and as long as you don't skimp on necessary care to keep your account balance high. A high balance doesn't help if you die because you did not want to spend your H.S.A. money to have a doctor check a mysterious lump.
When President Trump suggested to an interviewer at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland that he would, at some point, look at cutting entitlement programs, his Democratic critics seized on the comments as evidence that Mr. Trump would gut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in a second term.
We are grateful to Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez for his help ensuring that this debate will proceed without the disruption of a labor dispute, Chris Shelton, president of the Communications Workers of America, said in a statement.

Everyone in the world will be taking a look at them, said Tucker Reed, the president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, a local development corporation. The barrier to entry for a lot of those folks will be how high land values have gone. I'm sure they will fetch a very high sales price. Mr. Reed estimated the value of the three properties being marketed as somewhere between $850 million to $1 billion.
Here's what we know about the problem.
Some 4.2 million people are in arrears to the state, with delinquent tax debts of around 103 billion euros. Authorities have confiscated salaries, pensions and assets of more than one million people. Overdue debts to social security funds are currently at 34.4 billion euros.

Before the judging, Ru announced that another queen would be returning. (No, it wasn't Shangela. She's walking in the woods.) The competitors visibly blanched as Ru introduced the Season 9 contestant Farrah Moan … who was quickly Ru-vealed to actually be Farrah's doppelgänger, the guest judge Christina Aguilera. Ms. Aguilera did a quick bit that reminded us why Burlesque was her last notable acting job, then pulled out a hand-held mic from seemingly nowhere and did a quick melismatic run. The queens swooned.
Biden must not make the same mistake. It's OK for him to spend a few days giving some Republicans a chance to get on board, but he can't let the pursuit of cross-party support lead to watered-down policies.
11D. I will freely admit that I did not see this one coming, at least not until I got the final I from 37A. A digital filing service? is not about tax returns; it refers to fingers and toes, and the answer is MANI PEDI.
The National Association of Manufacturers, long one of the more conservative business lobbying groups, has been particularly harsh. It called out Republicans who cheered on Trump during his disgusting effort to overturn the election, which it said had inflamed violent anger. The association added: This is sedition and should be treated as such.
The way most economists score a tax proposal is to ask how it would change revenue levels compared to what you would expect the government to collect if the tax cut had not passed — what economists call a baseline.
We understand the desire to permanently suspend him now, but it should concern everyone when companies like Facebook and Twitter wield the unchecked power to remove people from platforms that have become indispensable for the speech of billions, said Kate Ruane, an A.C.L.U. lawyer. President Trump can turn to his press team or Fox News to communicate with the public, but others — like the many Black, brown and L.G.B.T.Q. activists who have been censored by social media companies — will not have that luxury. As it happens, the Supreme Court may decide as soon as Monday whether to hear a case about Mr. Trump's Twitter account, one that nicely illustrates some of the distinctions raised by the recent developments. Lower courts have ruled that Mr. Trump violated the First Amendment by blocking users from his account.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has embraced a different approach: ignoring the facts.
Billions of dollars that could have gone to maintaining and improving the subways, which use a signaling system that dates to the 1930s, have been wasted on exorbitant costs. Projects have also been delayed by mismanagement.

writes that if the president wants to follow through on pro-union campaign promises, there are many pro-labor things Mr. Biden can do even without Congress. Chye-Ching Huang argues that one of the best ways for the president to pay for ambitious policies and help honest taxpayers is to restore the funding the I.R.S. needs to effectively battle tax cheats.
The Detroit People Mover, an almost three mile, 13-stop monorail system, has a station on the third floor of the center. The fare is 75 cents, and the system normally runs from 6:30 a.m. to midnight on Monday through Thursday; 6:30 a.m. to 2 a.m. on Friday; 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. on Saturday; and noon until midnight on Sunday. There will be extended hours on select dates, including Sunday, Jan. 14, when the People Mover will run from 11 a.m. to midnight, and Friday, Jan. 19, when the system will run from 6:30 a.m. until 2:30 a.m. On the weekends during the public viewing of the auto show (Jan. 20 to 21 and Jan. 27 to 28), the People Mover will begin operations at 8 a.m. The system connects visitors to some of Detroit's most well-trafficked areas and notable attractions, including the Renaissance Center, the world headquarters of General Motors, Greektown, Campus Martius Park, Grand Circus Park and the Detroit Opera House.
To really address the issue, he and others said, Italy needs to undertake deep structural and cultural reform that streamlines bureaucracy and improves transparency rather than relying on people who come back home because the food is worse abroad and the weather is bad.
For first-time applicants, most of the original rules apply. A company or nonprofit organization must generally have 500 or fewer workers, although companies in some industries can qualify with more employees. The applicants also must certify that current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support their continuing operations.
On the 11th floor of 120 East End Avenue, a 14-room estate-condition apartment listed for $6.25 million recently went into contract, after a price drop of more than $2 million. Four years ago, a seventh-floor apartment with a similar floor plan that was in need of some updating sold for $10.25 million.
The research was conducted by Henry Saffer, Michael Grossman, Daniel L. Dench and Dhaval M. Dave, who used data from a detailed census survey about tobacco use to measure what happened to the smoking rate. Their goal was to find out whether e-cigarettes helped adult smokers quit smoking cigarettes, which are linked to a wide range of illnesses and are estimated to contribute to one in five deaths in the United States.
The new option for loan payments may seem odd because the main goal for saving in a 529 account is to avoid borrowing for college in the first place. And 529 rules allow an account's beneficiary to be changed to another family member at any time. So extra cash can easily be reallocated to another student to help pay for college expenses.
As globalization has shuttered factories and decimated entire industries, federal employment has been a bastion of stability. It has not grown, and occupies a shrinking share of the overall labor market, but it remains an equalizer for African-Americans and women, who are far more likely to earn high salaries working for the government than they would with a company.
The tax, a 5 percent value-added rate on sanitary products such as tampons and pads, is the minimum required for members of the European Union, which classifies those goods as nonessential.
This is not rocket science, said Richard L. Brodsky, a former state assemblyman who has long criticized the use of tax deals to promote private development. If the taxpayer is going to subsidize these projects, the taxpayer needs to see a return, and they're not getting much back for their tax dollars. There's a growing sense that you cannot subsidize your way into economic progress.
It's really the McConnell era, and we ought to be discussing that every day, particularly whenever Donald Trump is within earshot.
But there is no reason to believe that the projected BAT revenue would last beyond the 10-year window. By Republicans' own argument, which is shared by some economists, the import tax would shrink the trade deficit — and as the deficit shrinks, so would BAT revenue. Even if that didn't happen, projections of long-term revenue growth from a BAT would require an unsustainably large trade deficit to last forever — which isn't a reasonable assumption.
My husband is working without pay. We're very stressed about our bills and how we're going to manage them.

You know, we're trying to, you know, make meals that last. No spending in excess. You know, as much as I want that Starbucks it's not happening. My medicine is getting low. I have diabetes and I'm a breast cancer survivor. Some of my medications are getting low. If the shutdown keeps going on, then I can't delay my care anymore. I'll get a lot worse. So, it really means my husband is not going to have a paycheck. I'm going to have a paycheck that's a lot lower than it was and we're going to be paying a lot more. We need to come together and realize that this hurts all of us. And it's going to start hurting everyone pretty soon. So, please stop and put your petty differences to the side and open us back up. If the issue's with the wall, deal with the wall later. But open us back up. We want to work.

Nicholas Kamm/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Education Secretary Betsy DeVos submitted her resignation in a letter to President Trump on Thursday, saying she would step down the next day over the rampage at the Capitol by his supporters. Ms. DeVos joins a growing exodus of administration officials in the final days of the Trump administration. She is the second cabinet-level official to step down; Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, also resigned on Thursday. We should be highlighting and celebrating your administration's many accomplishments on behalf of the American people, Ms. DeVos wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times. Instead, we are left to clean up the mess caused by violent protesters overrunning the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the people's business. That behavior was unconscionable for our country, she added. There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me. Ms. DeVos was one of the first cabinet secretaries to condemn the violent mob on Capitol Hill. The peaceful transfer of power is what separates American representative democracy from banana republics, Ms. DeVos said in a statement posted to Twitter on Wednesday evening, hours after the storming of the Capitol. The work of the people must go on.

The cars would directly link Brooklyn and Queens, two boroughs that can be difficult to travel between without a detour into Manhattan. And though an exact route has not been made final, the system would most likely serve growing commercial centers like the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Long Island City, Queens. About 45,000 public-housing residents live a short walk from the route, the administration said, a priority for Mr. de Blasio, who has focused on combating inequities.
Once on board, Mr. Romney was greeted by supporters of Mr. Trump chanting Traitor! Some Republicans, like Senators Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Todd Young of Indiana, both of whom voted to certify President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory, tried to reason with their constituents, working through their concerns point by point in scenes captured on video outside the Capitol. But Mr. Cramer and Mr. Young could not persuade them that what the president and many of their Republican colleagues had told them was wrong — that there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the election, and no way for Congress to overturn the results.

Jan. 6, 2021, 6:11 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 6:11 p.m. ET 'I thought we'd have to fight our way out,' a congressman says. The House gallery was evacuated during the invasion. Credit... Andrew Harnik/Associated Press Within minutes of the mob breaching the Capitol complex, rioters were pounding on the doors of the House gallery, where a group of lawmakers were trapped. I thought we'd have to fight our way out, said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq. Mr. Crow said he moved other members away from the barricaded door inside the gallery, helped them don gas masks, told them to take off the lapel pins assigned to all House members and took out his only possible weapon — a pen. After 15 minutes, he said, Capitol Police and SWAT team members on a rescue mission hustled the members out by clearing a path outside the gallery, above the House floor. With police in the lead, guns drawn, the lawmakers entered a scene of chaos and mayhem, Mr. Crow said. Some police rushed to barricade doors to block rioters. Others pinned protesters to the ground to allow the lawmakers to pass. We heard yelling through the halls, said Mr. Crow, who described bringing up the rear to ensure all the members made it to safety.
Ms. Pelosi said of the cabinet. She said she hoped to have an answer from Mr. Pence by the end of the day on whether he would attempt to use the 25th Amendment. The two leaders tried to call the vice president directly on Thursday but were left on a holding line for 20 minutes without him picking up. It was unclear how quickly Democrats could move to impeach Mr. Trump. There is no clear precedent for putting a former official on trial in the Senate, and with only 13 days left in his term, it was not certain Democrats could actually accomplish such a complicated and politically fraught process on a compressed timetable. Mr. Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, said: What happened at the U.S. Capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president. This president should not hold office one day longer. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden transition, did not take a stand on the 25th Amendment or impeachment. President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris are focused on their duty — preparing to take office on Jan. 20 — and will leave it to Vice President Pence, the cabinet and the Congress to act as they see fit, Mr. Bates said. In the meantime, Donald Trump must stop blocking cooperation with the transition that could harm the readiness of the United States government to overcome the pandemic and the other crises he has worsened.
The real strategic question in the next election is which platform — moderate or progressive — will resonate with the greatest number of voters in the battleground states. It is clear that Bret Stephens prefers the moderate — a candidate focused on infrastructure spending, a carbon tax and modest increases in taxes on the wealthy matched to the promise of a balanced budget.

On Wednesday, Microsoft announced a commitment of $500 million to advance affordable housing solutions in the greater Seattle area. While it was striking for the company to acknowledge how supremely difficult it is for lower- and middle-income workers to afford to live close to where they work, 95 percent of its commitment would be in the form of loans to housing developers, much of it for market-rate housing that will benefit more-affluent residents.

Republican lawmakers join calls for Trump's removal. Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland during a news conference in Annapolis, Md., on Thursday. He said President Trump should resign or be removed from office. Credit... Brian Witte/Associated Press Some Republican lawmakers on Thursday joined a chorus of Democrats calling for the removal of President Trump from office for his role in inciting a riotous mob to storm the U.S. Capitol. They did not, however, say if they would support impeaching the president, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi had threatened if Vice President Mike Pence and Mr. Trump's cabinet failed to strip the president of his powers by invoking the 25th Amendment. Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois and the first Republican lawmaker to call for invoking the 25th Amendment after the riot, said that Mr. Trump had abdicated his duty to protect the American people by inciting an insurrection. The president has become unmoored, not just from his duty, or even his oath, but from reality itself, Mr. Kinzinger, an early opponent of efforts to subvert the results of the election, said in a video posted on Twitter. It is time to invoke the 25th Amendment and end this nightmare. Gov. Larry Hogan, Republican of Maryland and a frequent critic of President Trump within his party, echoed those calls. I think there's no question that America would be better off if the president would resign or be removed from office, Mr. Hogan said in a news conference addressing the violence. Enough of the lies.

In phone calls and meetings in recent weeks, Mr. Trump pressured and berated politicians and officials, including Mr. Donoghue and the acting attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, for not doing enough to overturn the results of the election, according to a person familiar with the conversations. Despite Mr. Trump's entreaties to do more on voter fraud, neither Mr. Rosen nor Mr. Donoghue has made any public statements on the matter. They have not supported Mr. Trump's false claims that he won the election or undermined comments made by former Attorney General William P. Barr that there was no need to appoint a special counsel to investigate the matter. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that a top Justice Department official had called Mr. Pak. Officials at the department have quietly pushed back on efforts to undo the election, defending Vice President Mike Pence in a federal lawsuit that sought to pressure him to overturn the results, a move that took Mr. Trump by surprise, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The case was dismissed. Adam Goldman contributed reporting. Richard Fausset and
The rooms cost more than they otherwise would, generating about $28 million in additional revenue. But Stephenson cautioned against assuming that the money had stayed in Indianapolis; in fact, there was heavy leakage.
That's why he indulged in behavior that would come back to haunt him in the White House: He never planned on moving there. He wasn't supposed to come under this kind of glare or have to lie this much (though lying comes easily to him). If victory had really been the point, he might not have left himself so exposed.
LOS ANGELES — There are 900 schools, 30,000 teachers and more than 600,000 students in the Los Angeles public school system. By the end of the week, a teacher strike could throw them all into crisis.
Distressed cities like Detroit and Hartford marshaled civic and business leaders to make their cases, seeing the investment as a chance to transform their economic prospects. New Jersey's former governor Chris Christie dressed up Newark's bid with $7 billion in potential tax breaks. The contest even prompted the mayor of Stonecrest, an Atlanta suburb, to rename the town Amazon and make Mr. Bezos mayor for life if he chose the town.

Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette condemned what he called a tragic event in our Nation's Capitol. Politically-motivated violence, regardless of ideology or cause, must always be condemned in the strongest possible terms, he wrote on Twitter. No American should excuse wanton disregard for one of our Nation's most sacred institutions. Health Secretary Alex M. Azar II wrote on Twitter that people must immediately and peacefully disperse. I am disgusted by the attack on the Capitol we witnessed today. Physical violence and the desecration of this hallowed symbol of our democracy must end. Housing Secretary Ben Carson also posted on Twitter calling for an end to the violence. Violence is never an appropriate response regardless of legitimate concerns. Please remember: if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt condemned the violence and praised the actions of the U.S. Park Police, an agency in his department, on Twitter on Wednesday. Today's violence and lawlessness at the U.S. Capitol cannot and will not be tolerated. Thank you U.S. Park Police for always fulfilling your selfless duties to safeguard lives and protect our symbols of democracy. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia on Wednesday called the attack a low point in the history of our democracy. We must immediately rise above this.

To understand the potential ramifications of Obama-Trump voters in 2020, it's worth understanding how they voted in 2018. Among those who voted, three-quarters stuck with the Republican Party. But Democrats did win back about one-fifth of the Obama-Trump group in 2018, which would amount to a net swing of about 1.5 million votes. While the idiosyncratic governing style of Mr. Trump may have been one key factor in bringing Obama-Trump voters back into the Democratic fold, it wasn't the only reason. It's true that most Obama-Trump voters who stuck with the Republican Party in 2018 strongly approved of the job Mr. Trump was doing as president, but interestingly even half of those who flipped back to the Democratic side at least somewhat approved of Mr. Trump. Democrats won back a significant share of Obama-Trump voters not because those voters disliked Mr. Trump, but in spite of the fact that many actually approved of him.
At the end of a winter in which the free-agent market has shriveled for pricey stars and journeyman veterans alike — pitcher Jake Arrieta and third baseman Mike Moustakas, who could reshape a rotation or a lineup, remain unsigned — there is palpable frustration at the so-called Camp Jobless, the baseball complex at the IMG Academy here where about 30 players have gathered for the last two weeks to train while waiting for a call.
The property includes a 1,300-square-foot shop space, where the owners ran an art restoration business, and a cellar converted into a workshop. (The business has moved.) It also has a very large original fireplace (no longer working) on the ground floor, as well as a lavabonis, or wall alcove where a sink would have been, said Joke De Spiegelaere, the listing agent with Engel & Völkers.

The paper didn't include close measures of whether people who stopped smoking completely quit nicotine, the most healthful possible outcome for smokers. While it is clear that most vaping products are safer than cigarettes, it is not yet clear by how much. New research is emerging that vaping products may cause some long-term lung and heart disease. And a recent poisoning outbreak associated mainly with THC, in which 55 people died, suggests that there can be acute health risks for some users.
Furthermore, the solar investment tax credit is pretty smart. It's structured so that as solar power becomes more efficient, the effect of the credit on each watt produced becomes smaller. Ideally, we would let markets decide the winners on their own, but so long as government is intervening in markets, it should do so in an evenhanded way. Similarly, any government support for the solar industry should be impartial, rather than having government bureaucracy pick and choose favored companies as it does through its loan guarantee program. The solar investment tax credit comes close to that ideal.
The focus also allows Mr. Bloomberg, who is a billionaire, to take a view of inequality that largely skirts the criticism that the very rich wield outsize power and influence in an era of extreme income and wealth concentration in America.

Over the next 10 years, we're probably going to see the introduction of self-driving cars. Whoever owns one is going to send it out to run all sorts of errands, many of them with no one in the car. Those empty personal cars aren't going to care about sitting in traffic. We need to charge a price that makes owners think twice about sending out a car during peak times with few or no people inside.

The case hinged partly on whether CNN could be considered a so-called joint employer of the Team Video Services workers, meaning that it had legal obligations to them under labor law even though it didn't hire them directly.

Despite these warnings from staff, Secretary Mnuchin instructed Treasury officials to allow the otherwise ineligible tract to qualify for the incentive, the lawmakers wrote in seeking the inquiry.

Pressure on Trump Intensifies as Resignations Roil End of His Term Speaker Nancy Pelosi threatened to pursue impeachment if the Trump cabinet did not invoke the 25th Amendment to strip the president of his powers. Vice President Mike Pence is said to oppose the measure. Two cabinet members, Elaine Chao and Betsy DeVos, resigned on Thursday.

So let's be clear. Trump's ideology is not an impeachable offense. However much you may disagree with Trump's tax policy — and I disagree vehemently — it is not a reason to remove him from office. Nor are his efforts to cut government health insurance or to deport undocumented immigrants. Such issues, among others, are legitimate matters of democratic struggle, to be decided by elections, legislative debates, protests and the other normal tools of democracy. These issues are not the treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors that the founders intended impeachment to address.
Trade in components has grown in recent years, as American industrial prowess has become increasingly dependent on access to the global supply chain. Back in 2009, American factories imported some 20 percent of the electronic products and computers they folded into their operations, according to an analysis by the United States International Trade Commission. By 2016, the share had risen to 25 percent.
The latest dismaying detail comes from a report by Brian Rosenthal in The Times, which concludes that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that runs the subway system, spends far more to build tunnels and extend train lines than agencies doing comparable projects elsewhere. Its construction projects have more workers than those in other cities, and workers are kept on hand even when there is no need for them. Contractors add a premium to their bids, claiming it compensates them for dealing with the M.T.A.'s bureaucracy. And some unions and contractors negotiate wages and work rules without any say from the authority.

Mr. Trump's style of personalistic authoritarian populism is his alone. It is unfamiliar to most American politicians, and the messianic loyalty he commands among his most martial followers is unlikely to be replicated by those within the party who seek to pick up his mantle. But Mr. Trump's Republicanism, despite his belief that everything is about him, has always been about more than that. He has forged what is likely to be the Republican blueprint for the future, absent his most unhinged behavior. Without major party reset, the heirs apparent to Trumpism, probably with the party elite's blessing, will continue to pander to visceral cultural resentments, champion outsider status, war against the very government they are part of and in the process continue to weaken our already fragile democracy.
So after the company settled on Hudson Yards, the vast mini-city taking shape on Manhattan's Far West Side, existing tenants were told to move and a small army of construction workers quickly began to revamp the building even before a lease had been signed.

Despite the blue wave of the 2018 midterms, the Republican Party still holds 61 percent of state legislative chambers. Their struggle is compounded by the tilted playing field created by Citizens United, especially at the state and local levels: A study looking back at the 2010s conducted by Anna Harvey, a professor of politics at New York University, published this fall in the journal Public Choice, concluded that Citizens United led not only to greater likelihoods of election for Republican state legislative candidates but also to larger within-district increases in their conservatism.

Mr. Deneen is a trenchant critic of what he calls a liberal anticulture. He characterizes the current orthodoxy of humanities teaching as a pastless present in which the future is a foreign land, where the hermeneutics of suspicion expose the culture of the past as a repository of repression.

But who is and who is not recognized as an Indian is a hotly debated, hugely complicated issue. The vast island of Newfoundland, roughly the size of New York State, remained a British colony when Canada was formed in 1867. It did not join Canada until 1949 — on the condition that none of its people would be registered as Indians. But thousands of Newfoundlanders traced their ancestry to the Mi'kmaq, the original inhabitants of Canada's Atlantic coast, who were first encountered by the Breton explorer Jacques Cartier on his 16th-century voyages of discovery.

Chase earned $36.4 billion last year, up from $32.5 billion in 2018. It earned $8.5 billion in the final three months of last year, also a record. Citi could not quite match that performance, but its $19.4 billion profit for 2019 beat the previous year, and its $5 billion result for the year's final quarter surpassed the profit it earned in the same period in 2018.
That $1.9 trillion figure is a lot of money, to put it mildly. Congress passed a $900 billion relief program in December, and its package in March was about $2 trillion.

Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, has said he would consider articles of impeachment from the House. And in a reflection of how unpopular the idea is even with Republicans who have criticized Mr. Trump's role in the riot, seven House Republicans wrote to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Saturday and implored him to ask Speaker Nancy Pelosi to stop efforts to impeach Mr. Trump. The lawmakers, led by Representative Ken Buck of Colorado, argued that starting such a process would be divisive and overly hasty. Each of them had vocally opposed their colleagues' bid to overturn the election results. In the spirit of healing and fidelity to our Constitution, we ask that you formally request that Speaker Nancy Pelosi discontinue her efforts to impeach President Donald J. Trump a second time, the lawmakers wrote. A second impeachment, only days before President Trump will leave office, is as unnecessary as it is inflammatory. In her own letter to Democratic lawmakers on Saturday evening, Ms. Pelosi indicated that she intended to press ahead in her consideration of advancing impeachment proceedings, and hinted that action could come as soon as the coming week. We will be proceeding with meetings with members and constitutional experts and others, Ms. Pelosi wrote. I continue to welcome your comments. I urge you to be prepared to return to Washington this week.
Politicians, social scientists and jurists have long clashed over how far the government and institutions should go to repair the harm caused by racial discrimination — and the extent to which past racism should influence today's decisions. In creating the Oregon Cares Fund, lawmakers took the rare step of explicitly naming a single racial group as the beneficiary, arguing that Black residents have been subjected to unique discrimination that put them at a disadvantage during the pandemic.

Elaine Chao, Trump's transportation secretary, resigns. Elaine Chao is the first cabinet official to join a growing exodus of administration officials in the final days of the Trump administration. Credit... T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times Elaine Chao, the secretary of transportation, is resigning after President Trump's incitement of a mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, she announced in a letter posted on Twitter. Ms. Chao, who is married to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, is the first cabinet official to join a growing exodus of administration officials in the final days of the Trump administration — largely symbolic resignations given that most would have been out of jobs with the change of administration anyway. In the letter, she said that she would leave her post on Jan. 11 and that her office would cooperate with President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s nominee for transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg. Yesterday, our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the president stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed, Ms. Chao wrote.

'SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: TAKE ONE' at the Metrograph (March 10 and 12). In this landmark of self-devouring cinema, the director William Greaves stars as a caricature of himself: He plays William Greaves, a filmmaker shooting a movie in Central Park. But no one seems to know what that movie is about, or how filming should proceed — matters that the (fictional?) Mr. Greaves largely cedes to his cast and to his crew members, who muse about his intentions when he isn't around. Symbiopsychotaxiplasm is at once a great New York film, a time capsule of the freewheeling spirit of 1968 (when it was shot) and a mind-bending examination of how choices shape movies.
The most familiar challenge stems from the fact that in the midst of national security crises, much of the nation remains willing to allow presidents to respond to its perceived enemies. Despite the War Powers Act and the larger lessons of Vietnam, Congress has continued to allow presidents to send troops into combat without a formal declaration of war. In response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Congress passed legislation authorizing a vast expansion of the national security system that gave President George W. Bush and his successors access to new organizations, programs and institutions through which to pursue national security goals without congressional support.
In a phone call with the president before Saturday's proposal announcement, Mr. McConnell encouraged Mr. Trump to extend the offer with temporary immigration protections as a way to reach out to Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats with a more appealing overture, according to a person familiar with the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.
This wasn't even in the realm of my thought or possibility, said Clippard, a two-time All-Star who turned 33 this month.

Roger is one of the greatest strategic servers who has ever played, said Annacone, Federer's former coach. You give him that space, particularly on a fast court, and that's a problem.

He can stay up on the baseline, and if Roger doesn't hit his targets, Novak will punish him.

That distinction was crucial. Until this year, the like-kind provision allowed owners of similar types of property, such as machinery or fleet vehicles, to swap their assets without paying taxes on either party's gains until the asset was sold. In a baseball or basketball trade, the assets aren't players, they are the players' contracts — and the I.R.S. was allowing them to be exchanged without fear of taxation.

The important Lost Causes in history have all been at heart compelling stories about noble defeats that were, with time, forged into political movements of renewal: the French after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 and the profound need for national revanche; Germany after the Great War and its stab in the back theory that led over the 1920s to the rise of the nationalism and racism of the Nazis; and the white South after our Civil War. All Lost Causes find their lifeblood in lies, big and small, lies born of beliefs in search of a history that can be forged into a story and mobilize masses of people to act politically, violently, and in the name of ideology.

That may help explain Allergan's hunger for a deal. In addition to aesthetic drugs, it has, since the start of 2016, bought or licensed gastrointestinal drugs, gene therapy for eye disease, and long-shot treatments for Alzheimer's and other neurological disease.
Allergan's deal machine received a $40 billion injection, before tax, from the well-timed sale of the company's generic drugs unit to Teva Pharmaceutical last year. Brent Saunders, Allergan's chairman and chief executive, used the pick-me-up to shrink debt and repurchase shares. He is also trying to refill the pipeline by ramping up research and development spending and acquisitions. The company's biggest drug, Botox, faces tougher competition, while its second-biggest drug, Restasis, may soon lose patent protection.

Born from an article that Schwartz, a science reporter for The Times, wrote in 2015 about realizing he was ill-equipped for retirement, this book uses his personal story to walk readers through the financial steps they should take to improve their finances. With self-deprecating humor, Schwartz highlights some of his and his wife, Jeanne's, money mistakes as young professionals and, later, as midlife adults. Through the writer's follies and his analyses of current financial attitudes, as well as punch lists in each chapter that offer action items, readers learn about managing debt, buying a house, writing a will and otherwise preparing for a comfortable retirement.

I think it's fair to say that the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10, 15 years, in the sense that they were challenging conventional wisdom. Now, you've heard it all before. You look at the economic policies that are being debated among the presidential candidates, it's all tax cuts. Well, we've done that. We've tried it. It's not really going to solve our energy problems, for example so some of it's the times.
The tax law overhaul of late 2019 eliminated the home office deduction for employees from 2018 through 2025. Employees who receive a paycheck or a W-2 exclusively from an employer are not eligible for the deduction, even if they are currently working from home, the I.R.S. said. Read more. How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can't include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.
The new prices apply only to foreigners living in Qatar who have valid permits to buy alcohol.
• Introduce more funds that avoid stocks related to fossil fuels.
John J. Ferriola, the chief executive of Nucor, said that the falling stock price is head-scratching because he believes that the industry is on solid footing. While Mr. Trump's tariffs have provided a tailwind, a strong economy, tax cuts and anti-dumping measures put in place by the Obama administration have revived the steel industry, Mr. Ferriola said.
Her father died in September of a brain hemorrhage, followed weeks later by her uncle.
I knew him first from afar, as the impresario behind performances I reviewed in the '70s. Many of them were great, but the academy, which had become provincial and poorly attended before he arrived in 1967, was still finding its footing. That only really happened in the early '80s, with the transformation of the Brooklyn Academy of Music into BAM and the advent of the Next Wave Festival. Harvey was not the first to discover Philip Glass, Merce Cunningham, Robert Wilson, Bill T. Jones, Laurie Anderson and Mark Morris, let alone Peter Brook, Pina Bausch, Robert Lepage and William Christie. But his instincts told him they were great, and he provided key support for their careers. And those artists, in turn, created the latter-day image of BAM as a mecca for trendy, black-clad hipsters.
Mr. de Blasio's administration said it would move aggressively this year to install more protected bike lanes and cameras to catch speeding drivers.
Qualcomm's chief executive will retire in June. Steve Mollenkopf led Qualcomm for nearly seven years. Credit... Guerin Blask for The New York Times Qualcomm said its chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, will retire in June after nearly seven years leading the big mobile chip maker through stiff legal and business challenges. Mr. Mollenkopf will be succeeded by Cristiano Amon, a Qualcomm veteran who has been the public face of the company's effort to develop 5G wireless technology. Mr. Mollenkopf, 52, grappled with a hostile takeover attempt by Broadcom that was blocked by the Trump administration, an aborted $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors, and an adverse 2019 ruling in an antitrust suit brought by the Federal Trade Commission. The ruling was overturned by an appeals court in August, and Qualcomm's share price is up more than 40 percent since then. The company said it was Mr. Mollenkopf's decision to hand the top job to Mr. Amon, 50, who previously held the title of president. Mr. Amon helped push acquisitions that has allowed Qualcomm to begin selling new categories of radio chips for smartphones.
If Democrats win both seats, they would effectively retake control of the upper chamber, drastically expanding the legislative possibilities available to the incoming Biden administration. Mr. Biden has promised to spend heavily as a response to the pandemic and to make long-sought upgrades to the nation's infrastructure.
Americans' income from unemployment insurance benefits was 25 times higher from March through November 2020 than in the same period of 2019. That partly reflects that millions more jobless people were seeking benefits, of course. But it also reflects a $600 weekly supplement to jobless benefits that the act included through late July — along with a program to support freelance and contract workers who lost jobs and who otherwise would have been ineligible for benefits.
The New York Times has compiled this brief guide to help you get your affairs in order, depending on how much time you have to devote to the task.
Now a father himself, J. Paul Getty disapproves of his own sons, but for slightly different reasons: He was given comparatively little from his father, but he succeeded; Getty's sons were given opportunities but failed. What seems to matter most is that both his father and his sons disrespected Getty the tycoon. None have given him the appreciation that likely would have validated — and maybe softened — Getty the man.
It helps his case that the Labor Department published a jobs report for December that soared past expectations. China's not doing very well now, Mr. Trump said in a news conference at the White House, hours after the report came out on Friday. It puts us in a very strong position. We are doing very well.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose health has become a preoccupation of the American public as the Supreme Court hews rightward under President Trump, announced this week that she was cancer-free.
He and others in this boat don't at all like the composition of this particular easing of fiscal policy. It is focused on tax cuts for businesses, rather than on investment in roads and bridges or worker training. The latter would be the kinds of steps more likely to have long-term payoffs and to benefit working-class Americans, they believe. (A big chunk of the additional spending will go toward the military.)
At any rate, Mr. Trump continued, we've already built a lot of the wall and renovated a tremendous amount of wall. (The Trump administration has replaced some existing barriers with new barriers, and will begin constructing 14 miles of new wall in February. But to date, construction on his border wall has not started.)
And yet there are historians who now believe that it's all in how you look at things and that the senators felt that Caesar was a major fun-suck who was getting in the way of some righteous plundering of lands.
Jan. 6, 2021, 8:53 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 8:53 p.m. ET Congress resumes vote-counting as leaders on both sides repudiate siege. The House of Representatives reconvenes to continue the process of certifying the 2020 Electoral College results. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Rattled but defiant, members of Congress returned to the Capitol on Wednesday night to resume counting the electoral votes from the November election, a process that leaders on both sides of the aisle said would not be derailed by the earlier siege of the building by President Trump's supporters. This temple to democracy was desecrated, its windows smashed, our offices vandalized, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said as the Senate reconvened. Mr. Schumer, who is poised to become the majority leader after Democrats won both of Tuesday's runoffs in Georgia, said that January 6, 2021, was a date that would live in infamy, invoking President Franklin D. Roosevelt's phrase after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. He called Mr. Trump's supporters who stormed the building goons and thugs. Moments earlier, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, called the rioters unhinged and referred to the siege as a failed insurrection. We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation, he said. From the dais of the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol during the breach, thanked law enforcement officers for restoring order and protecting leaders. Violence never wins, Mr. Pence said. Let's get back to work. Read more
The I.R.S. said its ruling would provide appropriate relief to borrowers by waiving taxes on both federal and private loans that are forgiven because their schools misled them or closed abruptly. Such borrowers could otherwise be left with cripplingly high tax bills.
It was the first time the median price fell below seven figures since crossing the million-dollar listing threshold in 2015. A report from another firm, Brown Harris Stevens, noted a similar decline, but found the median apartment sale price to be $1,050,000.
The charge stems from a 2013 civil investigation by the Manhattan prosecutors into the role that some of Ms. Veselnitskaya's clients — Prevezon Holdings and its owner, Denis P. Katsyv — played in a scheme to launder ill-gotten money through New York real estate purchases.
WASHINGTON — Jay Sekulow, who will lead President Trump's impeachment defense team with Pat A. Cipollone, is one of Mr. Trump's longest-serving personal lawyers, an achievement in itself as the legal team's revolving door spins wildly.
Ladies and gentlemen! May I have your attention, please? Skerkowski's voice ricocheted off the boards. He called roll for the teams and informed them that the pitchers of beer being carted out onto the ice were courtesy of the club. (Pairing curling and imbibing is tradition, presumably begun with Scotch.) I'm so excited, he continued. Look at this beautiful trophy. That's solid gold. At least that's what I reported on my tax returns.
It will basically change 200 years of practice, Ms. Weingarten said.
Boone was the sole architect and beneficiary of this tax fraud scheme and, contrary to her assertions now, engaged in it out of pure greed — to line her own pockets by cheating the system, the prosecutors wrote.
Tax forms are confusing, said Amanda Renteria, chief executive officer of Code for America.
It's not only that millions are drained from the public coffers each time President Trump takes a golf break at one of his resorts — which he does with marked frequency. When his adult children head out on holiday or to promote the family business, taxpayers must subsidize their adventures as well.
And it's not just the cost of rent that is lower — the water bill is lower; the trash bill is lower; the cost of a family dinner at a restaurant has fallen significantly. Mr. Boydas said he hadn't even known about the taxes.
Some of the favorite gurus of tech workers are already there, like Tim Ferriss, life-hacker, who left for Austin in 2017, and Ryan Holiday, whose writing about stoicism is influential among the start-up set.
Four years ago, in a small warehouse in central China, a team of Chinese archaeologists showed me objects that they had unearthed from a nearby ancient tomb. Laid out on a folding table was an exquisite array of vases, ritual vessels and a set of heart-stoppingly beautiful silver gilt tigers and dragons that fit in the palm of my hand, perhaps part of a long-forgotten regal board game.
The house is nearly 4,000 square feet, with three bedrooms and three full and two partial bathrooms, as well as a finished basement and a three-car attached garage. A separate carriage house, converted from a horse barn built in the early 1900s, could be used as guest or staff quarters.

I think it's politically naïve, Todd Gitlin, a professor at the Columbia Journalism School and a prominent liberal writer, said of Mr. Sanders's press criticism, but also analytically misguided, and overlooking the significance of the investigations that the news media have delivered in the last three years.
The attorney general, Karl A. Racine, said the committee, which organized Mr. Trump's January 2017 inaugural celebration, vastly overpaid to use ballrooms and meeting rooms at the Trump International Hotel near the White House. For example, the hotel charged the committee $175,000 to use a ballroom that another nonprofit group had just rented for $5,000, according to the complaint, filed in Superior Court in Washington.
Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, used a response to the president he streamed live on YouTube to brand Mr. Trump a liar, and ticked down a list of misstatements the president uttered during his address.
Mr. Hughes is one of the co-founders of Facebook, for which he did three years' worth of work for nearly half a billion dollars, as he puts it, emphasizing the extreme nature of his success. He and Mark Zuckerberg were roommates at Harvard, and early on, Mr. Hughes ran the company's communications and marketing department. The social network's colossal success fast-tracked Mr. Hughes's career. In 2008, he joined Barack Obama's first presidential campaign to launch and manage My.BarackObama.com, a robust system that organized Obama supporters and was viewed as instrumental to his victory. In 2012, when Facebook went public and The New Republic came up for sale, he bought it, hoping to herald the publication into a digital future and expand its reach. His tumultuous ownership ended in 2016, when he sold the magazine. Later that year, he joined with Mr. Warren and Ms. Foster to form the Economic Security Project.
Liberal skeptics of this new age of anti-austerity also don't like the timing. Mr. Bernstein, no one's idea of a deficit hawk, notes that never in its modern history has the United States run deficits as large as those now on the horizon while the unemployment rate was as low as it is now. That creates the risk that the government will have less capacity to respond to future recessions.
The state's budget bills that are slated to be approved by April 1, the start of the fiscal year, are often a vehicle for nonfiscal policy, and this year was no exception, with the actual budget bills packed with issues like same-day voter registration and bail reform. Mr. Cuomo used the speech as a platform to propose a range of changes to sexual harassment policies in the state in light of the #MeToo moment; he called it a national crisis, which was given new life in Albany last week when a powerful senator, Jeffrey D. Klein, was accused of forcibly kissing a staffer in 2015. (Mr. Klein was in the audience, and has denied the allegation.)
Jesse Rhodes, also a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, questioned in an email whether Democratic donors support the goal of reducing economic inequality:
As cases surge and shutdowns linger, Cannes Lions plans an in-person festival this summer. The first day of the advertising industry's Cannes Lions festival in June 2019, in Cannes, France. Credit... Richard Bord/Getty Images The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, typically a rosé-drenched networking extravaganza and one of the biggest events on the advertising industry's calendar, confirmed on Wednesday that it planned to go ahead with an in-person event this summer, even as Covid-19 cases surge around the world. The availability of multiple vaccines offers hope that we can be together in June, even if we need to limit the numbers of delegates who can safely attend, Philip Thomas, the festival's chairman, said in a statement. It's clear from talking to the global industry that everybody is very keen to come together again. The festival is scheduled to take place June 21-25 on the French Riviera. As the coronavirus mutates, countries have scrambled to respond with new lockdowns, quarantines and border closures. Passengers flying to the United States will need to show proof of a negative coronavirus test starting on Jan. 26. One branding executive on Twitter described the Cannes news, which was first reported by AdWeek, as a bullish, optimistic event announcement that sits at odds with the slow vaccine rollout and rising Covid-19 numbers. Cannes Lions can be expensive to attend, and much of the advertising industry, famous for its excess, has trimmed costs sharply during the pandemic.
Larry Fink, BlackRock's chief executive, showed up to meetings wearing a wool scarf that represented the decades of warming since the industrial age, a Christmas present from a nonprofit organization that works on climate issues.
Both companies charged their fees, whether we made or lost money.
This new era was set to make its public debut at the Grammys on Sunday, led by a fresh crop of nominees like Lizzo, Lil Nas X and Billie Eilish. But last week, after just five months on the job, Ms. Dugan was abruptly placed on leave, sending the organization into code-red chaos on the eve of the 62nd annual ceremony.
This time, OPEC, Russia and the other smaller producers agreed in December to a six-month reduction of 1.8 million barrels a day from Jan. 1 until June 30, with the goal of reducing currently bulging global stockpiles to their average level over the past five years. The agreement on Thursday extended those cuts.
A border adjustment tax would adjust our tax bill by no longer allowing deductions on imports. At the same time, it would exempt companies from income taxes on goods sold abroad, as an incentive for exporters to base their manufacturing in the United States.
The first property the Witnesses put up for sale was 360 Furman Street, which sold for $205 million in 2004. Now a luxury waterfront condo called One Brooklyn Bridge Park, it is home to a penthouse on the market for $32 million, one of the priciest listings in Brooklyn. The Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn Heights, which once hosted the Brooklyn Dodgers, and was used by the Witnesses as residences for staff members and out-of-town guests, sold for $81 million in 2012. It is being turned back into a hotel.
To do that, we'll need a more comprehensive and aggressive form of pollution pricing. Your article highlights the laudable effort by Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State to tax fossil fuel pollution directly and reinvest the revenue in renewable energy. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York will soon have the same opportunity.
Instead, shortly after 9 p.m., Mr. Drouet was hustled into a police van by riot police officers.
Prosecutors rejected that argument in court papers this week, arguing that Ms. Boone had achieved a measure of financial stability and comfort that most people can only dream about and should serve 30 to 37 months in prison.
Viral Capitol mob figures arrested and charged for involvement in the siege. Jake Angeli was arrested for participating in the breach of the U.S. Capitol Building on Wednesday. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times A man who was photographed carrying the lectern of Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the raid on the U.S. Capitol this week and another who roamed through the halls of Congress while wearing a horned fur headdress have been arrested and charged, the Justice Department said on Saturday. Adam Johnson, 36, of Parrish, Fla., was arrested by U.S. Marshals on Friday night after a widely circulated photograph showed him sporting a wide smile as he waved to the camera with one hand and hauled off Ms. Pelosi's lectern with the other. On his head he wore a Trump knit hat, with the number 45 on the front. Jail booking records from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office provide scant details about the arrest of Mr. Johnson but show that he was arrested on a federal warrant. He was charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, one count of theft of government property, and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. The office of Michael Sherwin, the top federal prosecutor in Washington, said on Saturday that it had also charged Jake Angeli, a well-known conspiracy theorist who was photographed in the Capitol on Wednesday.
Mr. Stack turned out to be right. He lowered his recommended asset allocation for United States stocks from 82 percent last January to 72 percent in September, when stocks hit new all-time highs. He urged investors to raise cash in October, and at the end of November he recommended an even more defensive posture — including putting money in a fund whose value would rise when stock prices dropped. That brought his recommended net exposure to stocks to just 55 percent, the lowest since the depths of the last bear market in early 2009.
There was another pedestrian death on New Year's Day. A 74-year-old woman was killed by an S.U.V. as she crossed a street in Queens.
The stock markets this week have reflected the jitters.
He's got to think of something to do. Trump's advisers seem to have finally gotten him to accept the fact that after next week, he won't be president. He will no longer be able to set national policy, or carry out the parts of the job he seemed to find genuinely rewarding — like pardoning turkeys.
This happens all the time, said William D. Zabel, founding partner at Schulte, Roth and Zabel, and one of the country's leading trust and estate attorneys. Disputes are especially common in small towns, said Mr. Zabel, who is not involved in the McKee case. The banks collaborate. They close their eyes. They usually hurt the outside child who's gone off and relies on the siblings for information. You constantly have cases of siblings versus siblings over the mishandling of family trusts.
While Apple avoided an iPhone tax in the first rounds of tariffs, it might not be so lucky if Mr. Trump is looking for more products to target. If that happens, Apple will be in a pickle. Its supply chain is entrenched in China, and finding another country that can match China's scale and skill in the labor market will be difficult. The iPhone is also already among the world's most expensive phones. Increasing the price to pay for tariffs would most likely scare away even more buyers.
And speaking of the labor force, the good news is that most of the extraordinary improvement in February was maintained. There was a gain of 806,000 Americans either working or looking for work in February; the March number gave back less than one-fifth of that.

It was a big night for President-elect Joe Biden, as the results in Georgia's Senate runoff elections appear set to give Democrats control of the chamber, and therefore Congress. That makes it more likely that Mr. Biden will be able to advance his policy agenda — within limits.
This editorial is correct about the destructiveness of President Trump's actions on climate change. It accurately and poignantly portrays the status of the climate change movement. It is buttressed with historical and scientific fact. It impassionedly appeals to our hearts, minds and souls.
On Friday evening, a somewhat shellshocked president retreated to the White House residence to grieve and assign blame. In a search for scapegoats, he asked his advisers repeatedly: Whose fault was this?
And when they do, Mr. Kostelanetz, 77, a writer and an artist known also as Kosti, holds court at a small card table in a tiny corner room of the building.
Their hearts, minds and wallets were taken advantage of, Ms. Mace said, her voice rising in fury. Millions of people across the country who were lied to. These individuals, these hardworking Americans truly believe that the Congress can overturn the Electoral College. Many Republican members of Congress stoked that belief this week when they objected to Mr. Biden's victory in battleground states and backed the challenges in votes that illustrated their party's rift. In the House, more than half the Republicans, including the party's top two leaders, voted in support of the challenges, while in the Senate, fewer than 10 Republicans did so and the leaders were vocally opposed. The videos that emerged from the standoffs dramatized the yawning distance between elected Republicans in Washington who are increasingly desperate to peel away from the president and their constituents who say they will never let go. On Friday, supporters of Mr. Trump swarmed Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, at his gate at Ronald Reagan National Airport, calling him a traitor. You know it was rigged, you know it was rigged, a woman yelled as he was ushered away by a security detail. You garbage human being. It's going to be like this forever, wherever you go, for the rest of your life. And a maskless woman approached Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, on Tuesday night as he waited to fly to Washington, calling him a disgusting shame for not standing with the president.
Rising rates have myriad consequences, including making it more expensive for companies and individuals to borrow money, like for buying a home or a car. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 4.2 percent, up from less than 4 percent at the end of 2017.
With average hourly earnings rising only 2.7 percent over the last year, there is not much evidence of the kind of inflationary pressure that might make the Federal Reserve more inclined to tap on the brakes. There is nothing in the March job numbers that is likely to make the Fed rethink its direction one way or the other.
WASHINGTON — President Trump loves to set the day's narrative at dawn, but the deeper story of his White House is best told at night.

The property includes two units: a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, and a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment, with a shared terrace and entrances next to each other on the elevator landing. The units could be connected by opening a wall between them, said Matteo Scandolera, the director of LiguriaHomes Casamare, a partner of Knight Frank, which has the listing.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said to reporters in Georgia that he was disappointed in the president for inciting the mob, adding it was not the right thing to do. I'm very discouraged by the people who were there that felt compelled to breach the Capitol and do the things they did. We're going to go forward as America. We have a new president. Robert L.

The United States economy is expected to expand 3.5 percent this year, while in China, where the virus first emerged, the economy is projected to expand 7.9 percent. The forecasts are based on the assumption that the rollout of the vaccine will be widespread by the middle of the year. However, if logistical problems arise or if people resist vaccinations, the global economy could expand at a much slower rate of 1.6 percent, the World Bank said. The pandemic has cast millions of people into poverty as governments locked down their countries to contain the virus. As many as 150 million people are expected to be pushed into extreme poverty by this year, the World Bank said in October. Policymakers will need to take steps to reverse the devastating increase in extreme poverty, Mr. Malpass said in a briefing on Tuesday. It may take years for people at the bottom of the income scale to see a sustained improvement in their circumstances, he said. The World Bank has $12 billion to help countries coordinate vaccine distribution. The world economy faces an Amber Alert when it came to debt, Mr. Malpass said, and the bank will be working to help poor countries ease their debt burdens so that they can focus their resources on health care needs.
Mr. Cuomo made no mention of the bail reform on Wednesday during his speech, which included quotations from George Washington, Henry David Thoreau and the singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, and an extended nautical theme, with mentions of rocky shores, rough seas, and a political and social superstorm of anger and divisive rhetoric.
For the country's sake, there is only one acceptable outcome, just as there was after Americans realized in 1974 that a criminal was occupying the Oval Office. The president must go.

In a court filing on Tuesday, prosecutors said some of the funds Mr. Zuberi donated to the inaugural committee came from other people, including an unnamed American man who wrote a $50,000 check to Avenue Ventures to secure exclusive access to certain inaugural events promised by Mr. Zuberi.
The growth of small donor contributions online has lessened the dependence of Democratic candidates on the network of Washington-based PACs and lobbyist-run fund-raisers. The question now, Walter Shapiro, a fellow at the Brennan Center, writes, is whether Democrats can withstand the inevitable pressure to adapt to business as usual in Washington by resisting the traditional advice to court big-money contributors.
We're living off the legacy not of our parents but of our grandparents, he said.
Some students and families may not have copies of their 2015 tax returns to refer to when filling out the form. (Starting with the current filing season, in a move aimed at making it easier to file the form early, the Fafsa requires year-older tax returns — meaning filers need returns from tax year 2015, rather than 2016.)
While I agree with Bret Stephens's thesis that the defeat of Donald Trump in the 2020 election is not a given, I disagree with his prescription for a Democratic win. Yes, the more radical ideas of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, which in fact might help Middle America the most, would never pass Congress and will never gain favor with conservative rural Americans.
But the Great Recession, and the years of slow growth that followed, put an end to that kind of blue-sky optimism across the economic spectrum.
Good morning. Happy New Year! How are you? Hope you're not feeling woozy and dry-mouthed and sad, with Ian Fleming's great line from Moonraker echoing in your head: Champagne and Benzedrine! Never again. It's time to start over, time for new chances. It's time to cook better, more often, and with more joy in your heart. (Really it is. You do what I'm saying, and the food becomes more delicious, and the people you serve are happier. It's weird.)
If they don't have a copy, or didn't use tax software or a professional preparer who can provide one, filers must request a tax transcript from the I.R.S., to make sure they have accurate information. You can request one electronically on the I.R.S. website. You will need a mobile phone account in your name, as well as information to verify your identity, like a credit card account number. Or you can request a transcript by mail, which can take five to 10 days.

The dual removals were a major blow to Parler, sharply limiting its ability to find new users and throwing its future into question, just as it appeared poised to capitalize on growing anger at Silicon Valley in conservative circles. With Mr. Trump now banned on Twitter and Facebook, Parler had been a logical choice to become his next megaphone. This is very huge, Amy Peikoff, Parler's policy chief, told Fox News on Friday, when Apple first threatened to remove the app. Without access to the App Store, she said, we're toast. The moves by Apple and Google against Parler were part of a wider crackdown by tech companies on President Trump and some of his most extreme supporters after Wednesday's deadly riot in Washington. Several upstarts have courted Mr. Trump's supporters with promises of unbiased and free speech social networks, which have proven to be, in effect, free-for-all digital town squares where users hardly have to worry about getting banned for spreading conspiracy theories, making threats or posting hate speech. Apple and Google's tougher enforcement could preclude such apps from becoming realistic alternatives to the mainstream social networks. They now face the choice of either stepping up their policing of posts — undercutting their main feature in the process — or losing their ability to reach a wide audience. Jack Nicas and
Still, like so many projects that were stalled by the financial crisis and Great Recession, the resort has re-emerged to find value in a diminished sense of self. Real estate agents like Trisha Sears are talking up the value of $350,000 condos that are now largely bought by locals instead of the out-of-towners who used to pay $1 million. In place of celebrity sightings, presidential visits and an ambition to be the next Vail, Colo., there is talk about a family-friendly vibe and the absence of crowds.
Re Trump Imperils the Planet (editorial, Dec. 28):
In 10 days the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy. No, no, no, no, no. The peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected President to the next. I committed to President-Elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.

In earlier testimony to show the Trump organization knew about the undocumented workers, John Szabo, an immigration lawyer who represented them, said someone who said his name was Mr. Baron telephoned on behalf of the Trump organization in 1980 and threatened to sue him if he did not drop the workers' claims of back payments.
Dr. Otto points to movements like Fridays for Future as having put a spotlight on the morality of fossil fuels. You have a new generation of young people and the majority of them have a completely different understanding of politics and of what has to be done, she said.
During the 2018 cycle, Mr. Biden maintained visibility with campaign visits to 24 states and at least 135 other speaking engagements, giving him a platform whenever he wanted. At a book-related talk in Missoula, Mont., in early December, he fueled coast-to-coast speculation about his plans by declaring himself the most qualified person in the country to be president.
Yes, it's almost impossible to avoid crowds in a modern Chinese city. But Wuhan is trying to push people to take more precautions. When you get in a cab now, there are reminders about opening the window and wearing a mask. Some of the famous street markets are now totally empty, surrounded by signs warning about the virus.
When Officer Amendola sought to stop him and others from entering the building any further, Mr. Leffingwell punched him repeatedly in the head and chest, according to the complaint. Mr. Leffingwell then spontaneously apologized. Prosecutors also unsealed charges against a Maryland resident, Christopher Alberts, accusing him of illegally carrying a black Taurus 9-millimeter pistol at the riot. Officers first saw Mr. Alberts leaving the Capitol complex around 7:30 p.m. and noticed a bulge on his right hip. When they stopped Mr. Alberts, the officers found the pistol, which had one round in the chamber and a magazine filled with 12 rounds, according to the complaint. They also discovered that he was wearing a bulletproof vest and had a gas mask in his backpack. After he was taken into custody, the complaint said, Mr. Alberts told the police that he had the weapon for personal protection and did not intend to harm anyone. Early Friday, a North Carolina pastor who is a descendant of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee condemned the rioters who carried the Confederate flag with them on Wednesday when they stormed the U.S. Capitol. The Rev. Robert W. Lee IV, a great-great-great-great-nephew of the general, said that images of the flag, including one of rioters who scaled a memorial to Ulysses S. Grant, the commander of the Union army who later became president, saddened him. The pinnacle of the Confederacy was January 6, 2021, and not during the 1860s, Rev. Lee said in an interview.
When he's confident, really confident and playing well, and he does this on clay, too, he'll start the point from a deep position and then you watch where he goes after he hits the return, Annacone said. He gets up right behind the baseline and then tries to dictate. If he stays back there after the return, that's when he's unconfident and a little bit vulnerable.
Although the N.E.A. grant was a small part of the exhibition's overall budget, it was crucial in persuading others to add their support. Similar grants have helped the Met mount exhibitions on the art of Jerusalem, India, Korea, Islam, Africa and Afghanistan.
Over the years, Apple has increased security for consumers through encryption. In the most simple terms, phones were built to be opened only with a user's passcode (this tech is also what enables fingerprint and face identification), and the company has built in no power to bypass that. The iPhone has been engineered to offer more and more user control.
Chinese and American trade negotiators are meeting today in Beijing, hoping to extend a delicate truce. Tariffs as high as 25 percent on Chinese imports have left American companies such as EBW trying to pass higher costs of foreign components to their customers, struggling to keep up with competitors abroad and considering whether to move their plants and jobs outside the country.
The Biden team is also preparing a wave of economic actions that will not require congressional approval. Mr. Biden's aides said on Friday that the president-elect would direct the Education Department to extend a pause on student loan payments that was initially issued under Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden called on Congress on Friday to take prompt action to raise the federal minimum wage to at least $15 an hour.
For almost five years, the estate of Prince has been one of the music industry's most drawn-out and complex legal thickets, as the star's heirs aligned in two factions and business conflicts developed over Prince's storied vault of unreleased music.

The Rise and Fall of Ultra Luxury
It comes up when people talk about the emperor Julius Caesar, whose head became so swollen from political power that he began to think of himself as emperor for life and was pondering declaring himself king, if you are a fan of William Shakespeare's take on his life. In fact, Shakespeare's historical play would have you believe that the Roman senators who murdered Caesar did so because they felt it would save the republic:
And there's nothing in free-market economic theory that precludes government support. Markets tend to underproduce what economists call positive externalities — that is, the broad social benefits, like a cleaner environment, that aren't captured on a company's balance sheet.
Instead, sales fell. Around $2.5 billion of legal cannabis was sold in California in 2018, half a billion dollars less than in 2017 when only medical marijuana was legal, according to GreenEdge, a sales tracking company.
The Paycheck Protection Program will open for most borrowers next week. Most applicants for Paycheck Protection Program loans can borrow up to 2.5 times their monthly payroll. Some lodging and food services businesses can borrow 3.5 times their payroll. Credit... Mohamed Sadek for The New York Times After giving small lenders a head start, the Paycheck Protection Program will open for all applicants on Tuesday, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday. The stimulus package passed last month included $284 billion in funding to restart the small-business relief effort, which made $523 billion in loans last year to 5.2 million recipients. The new funding will be available both to first-time applicants and to some returning borrowers. Borrowers seeking a second loan will need to demonstrate a 25 percent drop in gross receipts between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020. Second loans will also be limited to companies with 300 or fewer workers, and the amounts will be capped at $2 million. First- and second-time applicants can borrow up to 2.5 times their monthly payroll. (Those in the lodging and food service business who are seeking a second loan can borrow 3.5 times their payroll, a concession to the devastation those industries have faced.) The loans — which are made by banks but backed by the federal government — can be forgiven if borrowers spend least 60 percent of the money paying workers and use the rest on other allowable expenses.
The story demands a religious loyalty. It must be protected, reinforced, practiced in ritual and infused with symbols. What is the Trumpian claim of a stolen election but an elaborate fiction that fights to make the reality and truth of the unbelievers irrelevant. Some myths are benign as cultural markers; but others are rooted in big lies so strong as engines of resentment that they can fill parade grounds and endless political rallies, or motivate the storming of the U.S. Capitol in a quixotic attempt to overthrow an election.
Tax refunds will go out, Russell T. Vought, acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told reporters in an afternoon briefing.
Anyway, serious question: Is it too late to impeach Trump again?

For years now, people have been telling you cowards that if you let the president lie about our democracy over and over and then join him in that lie and say he's right when you know for a fact that he is not, there will be a terrible price to pay. But you just never thought you'd have to pay it, too. — STEPHEN COLBERT
New Jersey Environmental Infrastructure Trust, $73.9 million of debt securities. Competitive.
The road rebuilding might be expensive, but at least that money is going to pay people and businesses to do their work. The cost for society over all is that the resources that go to rebuilding the road are not available for something else that might be more valuable. That's a setback, but it's not a permanent reduction in economic potential like the less fertile farmland. And in a recession, it might even be a net positive, under the same logic that fiscal stimulus can be beneficial in a downturn.
Roll the individual onto his or her back, and push the person into a seated position. Reach around and give them a big old bear hug from behind, Lethgo says. Grab a wrist. Carefully lift the person to a standing position using your legs, not your back. Lock their knees out, says Lethgo, which will help keep the person upright as you maneuver to the front side. Put your back against the chest. Holding a wrist in each hand, bend your knees and pull up until the person's armpits are over your shoulders. Draw the arms down and in close to your body to keep them in place. Lean forward slightly in the direction of travel, and then move, Lethgo says. Once your load is aloft, don't stall for even a second; transporting a slack, full-size human will tax every muscle in your body. Have a plan before you even touch the individual, because once he or she is your cargo, you are responsible for that person. If you move them, Lethgo says, you own them until you get them the help they need.
He adds: Do you think that bastard Joe Kennedy would have countenanced simpering idle wasters for children? No Sir!
But the First Amendment limits only government actors, and neither a social media company nor a book publisher is the government. Indeed, they enjoy their own First Amendment rights not to have the government require them to associate with speech when they prefer not to do so. Mr. Hawley's book, titled, as it happens, The Tyranny of Big Tech, was to have been published in June. In canceling it, Simon & Schuster said that it will always be our mission to amplify a variety of voices and viewpoints but that Mr. Hawley had crossed a line in light of the disturbing, deadly insurrection that took place on Wednesday in Washington. The publisher was free to make that decision, Professor Magarian said, but that does not mean it was the right one. I want a wide range of ideas, even those I loathe, to be heard, and I think Twitter especially holds a concerning degree of power over public discourse — Hawley's right about that much, he said. But any suggestion that people like Trump and Hawley, and the viewpoints they espouse, will ever lack meaningful access to public attention is ludicrous. We should worry about private power over speech, but presidents and senators are the last speakers we need to worry about. The American Civil Liberties Union, too, said the free speech interests involved in suspending Mr. Trump's Twitter account were complicated.
The plan, which was outlined in a report released Friday, would create a congestion zone stretching from 60th Street south to the Battery, from the Hudson River to the East River. Trucks and commercial vehicles would be charged a fee of $25.34 to enter during peak traffic times. The plan would also impose a surcharge of $2 to $5 on trips in for-hire vehicles, including yellow taxis and Uber cars, in much of Manhattan.
Once President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes office on Jan. 20, wide segments of his party are eager to see investigations and prosecutions of an array of Trump aides and allies — an effort, they say, that would bolster the rule of law after a presidency that weakened it and serve as a warning to future presidents that there will be consequences for illegal actions taken while in office.
The social safety net depends on public support to survive. And one way to generate that support is to make it as strong and expansive as possible, with the most ambitious policies you can bring to fruition. Conservatives understand this in their bones. As Democrats debate their choices and decide on a presidential nominee, they should also keep this lesson uppermost in their minds.
As companies scramble to catch up to the rule changes, the question is: What does Britain do with the sovereignty and freedom it has secured from leaving the European Union? The government has to decide how much it wants to diverge from Europe's rules, where it might want to deregulate, and if it wants to pay the price for that.
WASHINGTON — Republicans are pouring government stimulus into a steadily strengthening economy, adding economic fuel at a moment when unemployment is at a 16-year low and wages are beginning to rise, a combination that is stoking fears of higher inflation and ballooning budget deficits.
Not long after the incident, Mr. Frisch received a call from the administration telling him that there had been complaints about his analogy, that some students were offended and that he should not come to school the following morning. A period of limbo preceded a suspension, and on March 9, the day after the school's gala and auction, he was fired.

The infrastructure engineering corps was disbanded in 1983, according to the official biography. A few years later, Mr. Ren and business partners founded Huawei in what he called, in a 2016 interview with the official news agency Xinhua, a run-down shack.

Mr. Rylance, Mr. Terfel, Mr. Davies and Mr. McCullin all received knighthoods, entitling them to the honorific Sir, while Ms. Wintour and the actress Patricia Routledge received damehoods. Among other arts figures, the theater director Rupert Goold received a CBE, and the Oscar-winning costume designer Jenny Beavan received an OBE, as did the fashion designer Victoria Beckham, the artist Patrick Brill (known as Bob and Roberta Smith) and the actress Naomie Harris. The theater director Richard Eyre and the percussionist Evelyne Glennie, who are already a knight and dame, were made Companions of Honor, a special award for service of national importance.
And while there has been lots of recent progress, it seems unlikely that Tamarack will fulfill the original idea of a high-end resort for skiers flying in from around the world.
Rule #3: Don't worry about inflation. Constant warnings about soaring prices, combined with false claims that the government was hiding the true rate of inflation (no, this sort of thing didn't begin with Trump) also marked the Obama years; but inflation never took off. Nonetheless, the usual suspects are ramping up to try it again.
Bookshelves line one wall of the square living room, which opens to a balcony with a hanging fireplace and a trellis. Between the living room and the kitchen is the dining room, which has a pair of pendant lamps and room for a table that seats eight. (The furniture is not included in the price, but is negotiable.) Stainless steel appliances, including a full-size wine refrigerator, oven and microwave, run along one wall of the kitchen. An island with a cooktop is topped by a rectangular fan hood. Behind the kitchen is a staff room with a small bath.

The Obama stimulus remains the canonical example. Out of a well-intended desire to get Americans to spend more of their stimulus tax cut, the administration snuck the money into people's paychecks, rather than sending one-time checks (as George W. Bush had done in 2001) that families might have saved.
From 2014 through 2016, more than $3.3 million of federal funding enriched Kansas communities through grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, according to the American Alliance of Museums. These agencies account for about 0.01315 percent of the federal budget.
Senate Republican leaders evidently think their back-room approach gives them the best chance to devise a health care bill that can squeak through the Senate, given their narrow majority and the policy differences in their conference.
The Yankees sent two minor leaguers — second baseman Nick Solak and right-handed pitcher Taylor Widener — to the Tampa Bay Rays, who shipped outfielder Steven Souza Jr. to the Diamondbacks. The Rays will also get left-handed pitcher Anthony Banda and two players to be named later from the Diamondbacks.
At 1,000 feet, the coffers ran dry, but the mayor said he would find more money and ordered the drilling to continue. Ten feet later, the drill hit gas, spitting the drill bit out of the ground like a watermelon seed. The mayor was just getting dressed and ran down to the well with his suspenders hanging around his knees, according to a city historian.
Where had he been for so long? And doing what?
In recent days many on his team had downplayed the idea that they would command a legislative majority in the Senate — out of superstition, several jittery Democratic aides suggested in the days leading up to the election.
The tax law overhaul of late 2019 eliminated the home office deduction for employees from 2018 through 2025. Employees who receive a paycheck or a W-2 exclusively from an employer are not eligible for the deduction, even if they are currently working from home, the I.R.S. said. Read more. How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can't include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.
Why are there such wide discrepancies in these reports, all of which aim to be regarded as industry standards?
Another vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, is being tested in a late-stage trial in the United States that is nearing its final stages. It is right around its goal of recruiting 30,000 participants, though a few sites are still recruiting minority populations, Dr. Slaoui said. He said AstraZeneca could seek emergency authorization as early as the first week of March. Dr. Slaoui said last month that the AstraZeneca vaccine — which has been authorized in Britain, India, Mexico and several other countries — likely will not be available in the United States until at least April. Dr. Slaoui confirmed on Wednesday that he will stay on as a consultant under the new Biden administration, though he suggested the role would be more limited than his current position. Here's other vaccine news from around the country: In Texas, Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican, announced late Tuesday night that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, even though he received the first dose of Pfizer's vaccine on Dec. 18. Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines have been found to be highly effective at preventing serious illness from the virus, but the trials tracked only how many vaccinated people became sick with Covid-19, leaving a possibility that some people may still get infected without developing symptoms. Mr. Brady's positive test comes days after a fellow Republican representative, Kay Granger of Texas, also tested positive after receiving her first dose of the vaccine, according to The Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Facebook's push to accommodate its booming operations is part of a rush by the West Coast technology giants to expand in New York City. The rapid growth is turning a broad swath of Manhattan into one of the world's most vibrant tech corridors.
This unwillingness to use effective antitrust enforcement to protect American economic interests is in stark contrast to how the rest of the world operates. Before approving AB InBev's latest merger, antitrust authorities in China required it to sell its $1.6 billion stake in China's largest brewer back to the Chinese government at a bargain-basement price. South Africa required guarantees of lifetime employment for its citizens, and the Monopolies Commission in the European Union required divestitures by SABMiller and AB InBev to keep their new, combined market share to 9 percent.
Ms. Taylor, now 42, has earned a reputation for defending the rights of individuals condemned by the court of public opinion before they have set foot inside an actual courtroom. Her clients have included Mr. Assange and Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, a son of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the deposed Libyan strongman.
Theoretically, tax systems should collect revenue efficiently and distort markets as little as possible. But in an age of large-scale market distortion driven in part by the consumption taxes of our foreign competitors, why should American companies like mine be unilaterally disadvantaged because of misplaced fealty to an idealized tax system?
In an update to its contract in November 2014, Uber said that it would levy its commission on the pretax or net fare. If cities or other jurisdictions require taxes to be imputed in the fare, Uber shall calculate the service fee based on the fare net of such taxes, the contract stipulated.

And prices would still vary from place to place, based on demand and geography. It's easier to build in Phoenix (plenty of flat land), and harder in San Francisco (lots of hills and nearby water). But while building in the San Francisco metro area is more expensive than in other places, it's not that expensive. By the paper's calculations, a home in the San Francisco area should cost around $281,000.
While many of the original details remain intact, including extensive stained glass and exposed timberwork, the house is not a listed historic structure, though nothing's been altered, Mr. Hoyle said. When I've had to update things, they've all been put back to how they originally were, because that's just how I wanted it.
Those losses are an ominous reminder of how hard it can be to make money in an industry widely viewed by political leaders and business executives as an important part of the global effort to address climate change. Solving this problem could help determine whether the use of residential solar power is quickly and widely adopted.

The audit appeared to be an effort to placate Mr. Trump and his allies, who repeatedly, and baselessly, argued that he lost the election in Georgia by around 12,000 votes because of a rigged system. On Dec. 29, the office of Mr. Raffensperger, a Republican, announced that the audit had found no evidence of fraud. The December call to the investigator, like the call Mr. Trump made to Mr. Raffensperger, was recorded, the official said. But unlike the call directly to the secretary of state, the newly reported call's audio has not been made public. A number of legal scholars have said that Mr. Trump's call to Mr. Raffensperger, in which the president seemed to vaguely threaten Mr. Raffensperger with a criminal offense, may have violated state and federal laws prohibiting election interference, though some also said it may be difficult for prosecutors to pursue the matter. Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called Gov. Brian Kemp, urging him to convene a special session of the Georgia legislature in hopes that lawmakers would overturn the election results. Mr. Kemp and Mr. Raffensperger have rejected all of Mr. Trump's efforts to get them to help him overturn the election results, even though both are conservative Republicans. The U.S. attorney in Atlanta faced similar pressure related to false claims of election fraud.
Another problem with the BAT revenue estimate is that it does not take into account that importers would devise ways to avoid the tax, a serious concern given Republicans' pledge to deeply cut spending on tax enforcement.
Democrats Demand Answers From Justice Dept. About Trump's Role as Impeachment Threat Looms House Democrats intend to introduce an article of impeachment on Monday charging President Trump with willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States. President-elect Joe Biden prioritizes the economy, saying there is a a dire, dire need to act now.
More than 20,000 new apartments in New York, both for sale and for rent, will open their doors this year — and likely just a fraction will find residents by year end.
But the presence of a single labor representative on a 17-member board did not translate into meaningful results for workers. At one point, Mr. Fraser did vote against a plush executive pay package, but he was the only nay. He stepped down in 1984, and Chrysler eliminated the union seat altogether in 1991. Only a handful of other companies tried worker representation, the unions didn't fight for it, and the American experiment in co-determination was over before it began.
Why does Trump want to leave this court case hanging? Partly because his side would probably lose. As I said, the lawsuit is ludicrous, although, given the partisanship of Republican-appointed judges, it might prevail anyway.
Most states don't regulate tax preparers. Ms. Wu advises asking preparers what formal training or professional credentials they have, how long they have been preparing tax returns and what the specific fees are for tax preparation and for any advance or loan. Additional tips for choosing a preparer are available from the Consumer Federation of America.
Mr. Biden has promised to reinvigorate the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration — part of the Labor Department — which has been criticized for failing to protect workers during the pandemic, including through lax oversight of workplaces like meatpacking plants. And he has pledged to provide more economic aid to small businesses, particularly those run by Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American owners.

Neither Mr. Sanders nor Mr. Biden has specified the exact size of the next stimulus bill, though the president-elect is expected to outline his economic plan on Thursday. Mr. Sanders said the legislation, which could cost more than $1 trillion, should look to raise revenue in a progressive manner, suggesting he would push to include tax increases on the wealthy and on corporations. Under Senate procedure, the details of any tax increases would come from the Finance Committee and be spearheaded by a liberal Democrat, Ron Wyden of Oregon, who has also vowed to move aggressively on stimulus and raising taxes for corporations and the rich.

In filings with the U.S. Tax Court, it is clear that the estate and the federal government differ greatly on the value of many of Prince's assets, including real estate, music rights and the value of Prince's name and likeness.

If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history — if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9-11 — if I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens — if I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high.
In the Senate, the temporary ban on donations will also affect Rick Scott of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas and a few other members. In the House, the group includes more than half of the Republican caucus, including its two top leaders, Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise.
Mr. Biden has long been self-deprecating about his relative lack of wealth, compared with some politicians. He and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, left office with assets worth between $277,000 and $955,000 (not including their house near Wilmington, Del.), as well as a mortgage of $500,000 to $1 million and other smaller loans, according to a 2015 federal disclosure. The report gives values in ranges.

What's implicit in the conservative logic is that good mothers make the right choice, and the right choice is to prioritize your family, Ms. Swinth said — though she said this logic applied primarily to married, middle-class, white women.
argues that one of the best ways for the president to pay for ambitious policies and help honest taxpayers is to restore the funding the I.R.S. needs to effectively battle tax cheats.

On an Amtrak train taking chattering lobbyists, aides, journalists and lawmakers to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's annual budget address on Tuesday, the progressives on board were giddy, a strange feeling for them on a trip to Albany in January.

To answer that question, you need what those in the military call situational awareness, or a rapid assessment of the scene using all your senses: Where are potential hazards? Is the person bleeding? Breathing? What made him or her unconscious? Are others nearby who could help? Don't take forever with it, Lethgo says, but make sure the person actually needs to be carried. Dragging somebody is not a bad option, he says, especially if you're smaller and don't have far to go. If you're alone and you must move an inert body more than, say, 200 feet to safety, Lethgo recommends what's called the pack-strap carry, which looks something like a piggyback ride.
If they all adopt the per-capita consumption habits of today's Americans, we're going to burn up, heat up, eat up, plow up, choke up and smoke up the planet, whether the climate changes or not. That means that clean power, clean cars, clean manufacturing, clean water and energy efficiency have to be the next great global industries — otherwise, we humans are going to be a bad biological experiment, whether the climate changes or not.

Here, in the state's largest city, the conditions that led to the law are in plain view.
My guess is they'll stick to their political options. So far, they've taken careful steps away from the nuclear deal (though I doubt they'll dramatically increase production of nuclear fuel) and used their influence in Iraq to get its Parliament to push for the withdrawal of American forces.
The 2018 figures contradict that argument, too.
In short, while a Warren or Sanders presidency might drastically rearrange the furniture in our common democratic home, it will not — as Trump's has — seek to blast away at the foundations. What's more, a decisive loss by Trump might have the added benefit of chastening conservatives who abandoned their former free people, free markets convictions in favor of Trump's nativist demagogy.

Some high-end co-ops restrict home improvement — in any case, demolition — to the summer months, thus potentially stretching out a full-on renovation for years.

Solar panels, and the companies that make them, are replete with such benefits: They eliminate redundant power plants that otherwise lie idle, empower consumer choice and have fewer negative consequences than most other forms of energy. But markets don't always reflect these, which is why it makes sense for subsidies to enter the picture.

As soon as the new faction took power, it put the brakes on Dr. Waronker's agenda, firing the master teachers and canceling the contract with his nonprofit. It also fired a law firm that Dr. Waronker said was investigating possible corruption in the food service program and rehired two other law firms that an external audit had found to have charged exorbitant fees. It reinstated Mr. Strachan, who in an interview said he was not aware of there being any truth to Dr. Waronker's accusations.

So starting from that point, a lot of debates will be framed around that. That includes the legalization of marijuana, which the governor proposed — again — on Wednesday.

The key question is, 'How does this impact my money?' said Steve Norcini, senior equity portfolio manager Wilmington Trust and the author of a recent paper on sustainable investing. We view climate change as one of the many risks that need to be evaluated with a company.

We haven't heard much recently about Theranos, the seemingly miraculous blood-testing start-up that last year turned out to a giant fraud. But that may change on Monday, when a federal court in California holds a hearing on criminal charges against Theranos's former chief executive, Elizabeth Holmes, and its former president, Ramesh Sunny Balwani (also Ms. Holmes's erstwhile boyfriend). Indicted on charges of conspiracy and wire fraud last summer, they could each face prison sentences of up to 20 years.

Fallout roundup 17 Capitol Police officers are under investigation one week after rampage. National Guard troops deployed to the U.S. Capitol prepare to head out for a shift change on Thursday. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times With less than a week to go before the presidential inauguration, the police force charged with protecting the grounds of the Capitol is in crisis, as law enforcement agencies across the city brace for more potentially violent gatherings, based on intelligence reviewed in recent days. The chief of the Capitol Police and two other top security officials resigned after an angry mob of Trump loyalists stormed the Capitol last week. Three officers have been suspended, and 17 more are under investigation, according to a senior Congressional aide, including an officer who took selfies with people in the crowd and another who wore a Make America Great Again Trump hat and directed rioters into the Capitol. And lawmakers have demanded a full investigation into what some have referred to as a severe systemic failure. Currently, the Capitol complex, which is usually a bevy of activity, is cut off from its surroundings by National Guard troops and an imposing backdrop of seven-foot-tall, unscalable fencing.
If ever there was a policy that had a disparate impact on African-Americans, Syracuse's obdurate refusal to keep its assessments up-to-date would be it. Under current Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) rules, families in Syracuse's black neighborhoods can file a complaint with HUD alleging that the illegally out-of-date assessment system has a disparate impact upon homeowners like themselves, violating the Fair Housing Act. To start the legal process, they would simply have to show that the assessment delay had caused African-Americans unfairly high tax payments. The city would then have to try to defend the delay by showing it had a legitimate justification for failing to keep assessments up-to-date. Even if the city did so, the homeowners could still prevail by showing that there was a reasonable alternative to the city's practice that would not have such a discriminatory effect.

Others in the party, led by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, were pushing back hard against a conviction, warning it would harm the party and the country, as federal authorities cautioned about continued violent threats from pro-Trump extremists. With Mr. McConnell sending mixed signals about where he would come down, Republican strategists and seniors aides on Capitol Hill believed he could ultimately swing the result one way or another. If all senators voted, it would take 17 Republicans joining all Democrats to convict Mr. Trump. If they did, it would only take a vote by a simple majority of senators to disqualify Mr. Trump from ever holding office again.
But automakers are betting big on that future, and how quickly the industry takes off depends not just on choice but on a shift in customer expectations.

That, especially, can be a deterrent given electric cars' shorter range.

The acting head of the top federal banking regulator is stepping down. Brian Brooks, who warned that requiring customers to wear masks during the pandemic could lead to more bank robberies, is stepping down as the country's top bank regulator, according to an announcement on Wednesday. Mr. Brooks has served as acting comptroller of the currency since late May. As of Thursday night, Blake Paulson, a career employee of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, will take over. It has been an honor to serve the United States as acting comptroller, Mr. Brooks said in a statement. I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished. In the months after he took over the agency following the departure of Joseph Otting, Mr. Brooks rushed to enact a number of changes, including one that would prohibit banks from cutting off credit to the fossil fuel industry and another establishing guidelines for how banks could measure their activities in low-income and minority neighborhoods as required under an anti-redlining law. Until recently, Mr. Brooks was in line for his job to be made permanent. Despite having already lost the 2020 election, President Trump said on Nov. 17 that he intended to nominate Mr. Brooks to become the comptroller for a five-year term. But the chances for Mr. Brooks to be confirmed during the lame-duck period of Mr. Trump's presidency were low, and the Georgia runoff elections have given Democrats control of both chambers of Congress.

The Democratic caucus has announced plans to make a package of political reforms, including the provisions to encourage small donors long championed by John Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, their top priority, bearing the symbolic bill number H.R. 1. In addition to highlighting corruption and the corrosive consequences of the post-Citizens United era, such reforms, if they were ever to pass, could give elected officials a way to stay in better touch with their districts, spending more time with voters and that way keeping the vital, diverse local dimension of politics alive even in a time of deep national polarization.

The widening deficit under Mr. Trump shows the degree to which economic growth on his watch has been helped by fiscal stimulus — increased borrowing by the government that injects more money into the consumer economy.

How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can't include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.
Yesterday's violence at the Capitol was reprehensible and contrary to the tenets of the United States Constitution. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos resigned on Thursday night. She condemned the violence in the immediate aftermath on Wednesday, writing that an angry mob cannot be allowed to attack our Capitol. The peaceful transfer of power is what separates American representative democracy from banana republics. The work of the people must go on. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao resigned on Thursday. She was the first cabinet official to join a growing exodus of administration officials in the final days of the Trump presidency. Our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the president stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed, Ms. Chao wrote in a letter posted on Twitter. It has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside. Chad F. Wolf, the acting homeland security secretary, denounced the president's supporters who participated in the riot and called on Mr. Trump to more forcefully condemn them. What transpired yesterday was tragic and sickening, Mr. Wolf wrote in a statement posted on Twitter. We now see some supporters of the president using violence as a means to achieve political ends. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will remain in his post and carry out his responsibilities until the inauguration, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Mr. Mnuchin, who was traveling in Israel on Thursday, condemned the violence but made no mention of the president.

What, then, are we, the leaders of our institutions of higher education, to do when faced with a president who denies facts, who denies science? Is it best to stand by when he repudiates climate science and revives the credibility of discredited theories about autism? Facts and photographs did not stop him from rejecting the evidence regarding the election results or the size of crowds at his inauguration. He has undermined public confidence in the electoral system. In the face of this, standing up for the truth — which is, after all, higher education's business — might appear to be an act of political partisanship. But this is not about political parties. It is about the proper role of the academy in a troubling time.

Beyond the official preparations, a group of Washington community organizations, including the city's Black Lives Matter chapter, called on area hotels to close in the lead-up to the inauguration to signal to Trump supporters that white supremacists are NOT WELCOME in D.C.! And after some of the rioters last week targeted reporters and photographers in the Capitol, the Committee to Protect Journalists advised anyone covering the inauguration to avoid wearing press lanyards and to carry as little equipment as possible. Since the attack on the Capitol, Mr. Trump has begrudgingly and inconsistently pledged a peaceful remainder of the transition period — something he refused to commit to for more than two months after he lost the election. Mr. Pence tried to assure Americans more explicitly.

And though there is less information about reactions to the Moderna vaccine than to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Dr. Messonnier said, At this point we really don't have enough data to say there's any difference in the risks, so the recommendations apply to both. Recipients who experience anaphylaxis after receiving the first dose of the vaccine should not receive the second dose, officials said. Other than the anaphylaxis reactions, which occurred shortly after vaccination, Our vaccine safety systems haven't picked up any worrisome signals, Dr. Messonnier added. The known and potential benefits of the Covid vaccine outweigh the risk of getting Covid-19. The C.D.C. 's analysis of adverse reactions, published on Wednesday, included only those to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine administered between Dec. 14 and Dec. 23. One case of anaphylaxis was reported among the first 224,322 recipients of the Moderna vaccine, which became available later, between Dec. 21 and Dec. 23, the report said. The vast majority of anaphylaxis reactions — 90 percent — occurred in women, who made up slightly more than half of vaccine recipients. A surprising number of those who went into anaphylaxis — 14 of the 21 — had never experienced an anaphylactic reaction prior to receiving the vaccine, and four had no known allergies at all. Of the 21 who had reactions, 20 had recovered or been discharged home, and information was lacking on one individual. Nineteen were treated with epinephrine, and four were hospitalized, including three in intensive care. Seventeen were treated in an emergency department. The C.D.C.
The bank's per-share earnings and revenue were both higher compared with a year earlier without the tax charge.

For the year, net revenue in that business fell 30 percent.

While appreciative of the attention to atheists and agnostics in Mark Oppenheimer's article, I dispute the cartoonish caricature of the free-thought movement and its conferences.

An outbreak on a long flight raises questions about airline safety meaures. A takeoff at Dubai International Airport last April. Credit... Karim Sahib/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images An outbreak of at least four new coronavirus infections occurred on a September flight from Dubai to Auckland, New Zealand, despite numerous containment measures, researchers reported on Wednesday, suggesting that airlines may need to tighten their precautions still further to prevent in-flight transmission. The new infections were detected after the plane landed in New Zealand, which requires incoming travelers to quarantine for 14 days before entering the community. The analysis, led by researchers at the New Zealand Ministry of Health, found that seven of the passengers tested positive during their quarantine, and at least four appeared to have been newly infected on the flight. The passengers came from five countries, and five had tested negative at different points before boarding. They were seated within four rows of each other for the 18-hour duration of the flight, and the viruses they carried were virtually identical genetically — a strong indication that one person initiated the outbreak. The findings are not definitive, cautioned the authors, led by Tara Swadi of the health ministry. But, they wrote, they underscore the value of considering all international passengers arriving in New Zealand as being potentially infected, even if pre-departure testing was undertaken, social distancing and spacing were followed, and personal protective equipment was used in-flight.
The Treasury's schedule of financing this week includes Monday's regular weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills and an auction of four-week bills on Tuesday.
Mr. Murdoch's publicists had previously indicated that he did not expect Mr. Trump to recapture the presidency, and another Murdoch publication, The New York Post, trumpeted President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory even as Mr. Trump refused to accept the results. The Post, in its own unsigned editorial on Thursday, stopped short of arguing that Mr. Trump should prematurely exit the White House, instead urging his aides to stay and stop the crazy. But given Mr. Murdoch's influence on his publications' political views, the Journal's blunt words for Mr. Trump — who once craved Mr. Murdoch's approval — signal that the mogul is now looking ahead to the start of the Biden presidency.

Rule #4: Don't count on Republicans to help govern. The original sin of Obama economic policy was the underpowered stimulus of 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act helped stabilize the economy, but it was much too small given the depths of the crisis. This isn't hindsight; some of us were very publicly tearing our hair out in real time.
The rule's focus on how much of a raise could be spent, rather than how much should be saved, helps keep people from feeling deprived, Mr. Wendel said.
Several more Capitol rioters have been arrested including man who carried a Confederate flag inside building. Kevin Seefried has been identified as having carried a Confederate flag into the Capitol during the siege last week. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times A man seen holding a Confederate battle flag, a person identified as striking a police officer with a flagpole and a retired firefighter identified as having thrown a fire extinguisher at officers were among those arrested Thursday for their role in the riot at the U.S. Capitol last week. A federal prosecutor in Texas also said on Thursday that a retired Air Force officer who stormed the Senate chamber dressed in military-style clothing and holding zip ties had intended to take hostages. The retired officer, Larry Rendell Brock, was arrested in Texas on Sunday on one count of unlawfully entering a restricted building and another of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, the Justice Department said at the time. He means to take hostages, the Texas prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Weimer, said on Thursday, The Associated Press reported. He means to kidnap, restrain, perhaps try, perhaps execute members of the U.S. government. The Justice Department has said that images from the Capitol siege appeared to show Mr. Brock wearing a green helmet, a tactical vest, a camouflage jacket and trousers holding zip ties that are used by law enforcement officers to restrain and/or detain subjects.

But the measure, the PFAS Action Act, already has a veto threat looming over it, and its prospects in the Senate, like those of other House bills addressing environmental regulation and climate change, are slim to none. In the meantime, critical legislation passed in the Christmas rush last month was signed into law, with environmental provisions and climate change measures watered down or omitted altogether.
It is not unusual for lawmakers to draft major legislation in private, but they usually refine, debate and amend it in open committee sessions. The House bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act did not receive a hearing, where outside experts could have testified. But lawmakers dissected its contents and were able to propose changes at three stages: in the Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Budget Committees.
Banks don't like lending in lower-income neighborhoods, even as they profit from deposits taken from those same communities.

I do feel that something is wrong with the current system, Mr. Zwirner said on Wednesday, the first day of the conference. It's not good that a few galleries are getting more and more market share and the younger galleries are having a harder time to compete.
On its face, the border adjustment tax, or BAT, appears to discourage imports and encourage exports, and thus to dovetail with President Trump's antitrade rhetoric. There is, in fact, debate over its potential effect on trade, but that has not stopped Republican proponents from claiming that it would narrow the trade deficit while raising substantial revenue.
But unlike the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, which passed along party lines, the effort to loosen the post-crisis rules is somewhat bipartisan. A group of Senate Democrats has joined Republicans to support legislation that would mark the first major revision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a signature accomplishment of President Barack Obama that has been deemed a disaster by President Trump.
Senate sergeant-at-arms resigns following House's top security official stepping down. Michael C. Stenger had been the Senate sergeant-at-arms since April 2018. Credit... Win Mcnamee/Getty Images Three top security officials on Capitol Hill are stepping down a day after a mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, congressional leaders said on Thursday. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California announced during her weekly news conference that Paul D. Irving, the House sergeant-at arms, intended to resign from his position, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said Thursday evening he had accepted the resignation of Michael C. Stenger, the Senate sergeant-at-arms. News of Mr. Stenger's resignation came after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said he would fire Mr. Stenger as soon as Democrats took the majority. Steven Sund, the Capitol Police chief, will also leave his position on Jan. 16 after Ms. Pelosi called for his resignation, saying Mr. Sund, he hasn't even called us since this happened. Mr. Sund, in his letter of resignation, said he would use his remaining paid sick leave — 440 hours, about 55 days — after departing. The swift departure of the top three security officials just two weeks before a presidential inauguration reflected bipartisan outrage over the law enforcement failure to prevent a mob of violent protesters from storming the Capitol as lawmakers debated the formal certification of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory.

Susan Wild, Democrat of Pennsylvania, on the floor of the House early Thursday debating objections to confirming the Electoral College vote from Pennsylvania. Credit... House Television, via Associated Press A day after members of Congress were relocated to secure locations as a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, raising fears about widespread transmission of the coronavirus, a House member revealed on Thursday that he had tested positive for the virus. Representative Jake LaTurner, Republican of Kansas, announced on Twitter — hours after sharing space with colleagues on the House floor throughout a late-night session to confirm President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s Electoral College victory — that he had received a positive test, prompting further concern that the virus might have spread more widely. While in lockdown on Wednesday, Representative Susan Wild, Democrat of Pennsylvania, told CBS News by phone that about half of the people sheltering in the secure location in the Capitol complex had refused to wear masks, even though masks were made available. When asked which lawmakers had declined to cover their faces, Ms. Wild said they had been people from the Republican delegation. It's what I would call a Covid superspreader event, she said. It's exactly the kind of situation that we've been told by the medical doctors not to be in, you know — close proximity — especially with people who aren't wearing masks.
And while we debate the ideal health system, we mustn't forget that Trump and his allies are as determined as ever to undo the progress we've made.

Because of the delay in the refunds, Ms. Wu said, she expects there will be more demand for tax refund advances, loans often offered by professional tax chains. As a result, she said, choosing a preparer carefully is very important, to make sure consumers aren't charged excessive fees or interest.
The abrupt shift in circumstances invigorated Democrats who had been deflated in November when they failed to gain a Senate majority on Nov. 3 despite Mr. Biden's victory. Given the traditional advantage Republicans have had in Georgia runoff elections, many Democrats had become resigned to the prospect that they would be sentenced to another two years in the Senate minority, stymied in delivering on Mr. Biden's priorities.

Police officers who traveled to Washington are being investigated for connection to the Capitol melee. Officials are investigating whether off-duty police officers played a role in the Capitol siege on Wednesday. Credit... Stephanie Keith/Reuters Police departments across the country have suspended officers or referred them to internal reviews for attending the events on Jan. 6 in Washington that devolved into an assault on the U.S. Capitol. The commanding officers or officials involved in the cases in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington State stressed that while the officers attended as private citizens, the question of whether they broke the law would be investigated. In San Antonio, Sheriff Javier Salazar of Bexar County said he had referred Lt. Roxanne Mathai to the internal investigations department after she posted a video of herself on Facebook from near the Capitol, wearing a red, white and blue face mask and wrapped in an American flag. The officer waxed enthusiastic about the day but stated explicitly that she would not enter the Capitol. Plumes of tear gas waft in the background of the video, and Mr. Salazar said investigators would determine whether police had declared the gathering an unlawful assembly. If that is the case and she remained on scene and began filming and began making challenging statements, that means breaking the law, the sheriff said.

Murkowski signals she is open to convicting Trump as the timing of the Senate impeachment trial remains unclear. Senator Lisa Murkowski speaks at a news conference in the Capitol building. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said on Thursday that the House had acted appropriately in impeaching President Trump, signaling possible support for convicting him at a Senate trial in a statement that called his actions unlawful and said that they warranted consequences. Ms. Murkowski said the second impeachment of Mr. Trump stood in stark contrast to the first, which she and virtually every other Republican opposed. She said Mr. Trump had perpetuated false rhetoric that the election was stolen and rigged and launched a pressure campaign against his own vice president, urging him to take actions that he had no authority to do. And though Ms. Murkowski did not commit to finding the president guilty, saying she would listen carefully to the arguments on both sides, she strongly suggested that she was inclined to do so. On the day of the riots, President Trump's words incited violence, which led to the injury and deaths of Americans — including a Capitol Police officer — the desecration of the Capitol, and briefly interfered with the government's ability to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, Ms. Murkowski said.
It's true that so far repeated Republican attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act have failed. In 2012 the Supreme Court rejected claims that the whole law was unconstitutional. In 2017 a Republican-controlled Congress narrowly failed to repeal Obamacare. And a variety of narrower efforts to undermine health reform and send insurance markets into a death spiral have fallen short: Markets seem to have stabilized, and one by one, states that initially rejected Medicaid expansion have been relenting.

The man, Robert Sanford, is charged with assaulting a law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of official duties and civil disorder among other crimes. Mr. Sanford went to the Capitol following the president's instructions, a complaining witness told the F.B.I. Another man was charged on Thursday after law enforcement officials identified him as the person seen repeatedly striking an officer with a flagpole on the stairs of the Capitol in a video posted on Twitter. That man, Peter Stager of Arkansas, was charged with obstructing law enforcement, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint also identified Mr. Stager as saying in another video posted on Twitter that everyone in the Capitol is a treasonous traitor and that death is the only remedy for what's in that building.

While congestion pricing has been adopted in cities around the world including London, Stockholm and Singapore, it has never been tried in New York despite repeated attempts going back to at least the 1970s. Its basic premise is that traffic can be reduced by charging a fee or toll at peak hours that would serve as a disincentive to drivers. An effort by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2008 would have charged a fee of $8 to drive into Midtown and Lower Manhattan, but it died in the State Assembly without coming to a vote.
The proposed $11.52 fee is part of a congestion pricing plan proposed by a state task force appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that aims to address the gridlock on New York City's busiest streets and provide badly needed money to overhaul the failing subway system below.

Let's go! I would urge my colleagues, don't take perhaps the easy path. And the Electoral College is the mechanism by which the people select the president. But if Congress gets to decide which states get to vote in the Electoral College, then clearly, Congress is selecting the president, not the people.

Sunrun and Sunnova, two of the nation's biggest home solar companies, lost a combined $500 million in the first nine months of the year, and their operations and purchases of solar systems collectively used up $1.3 billion in cash. The companies and their Wall Street supporters say the losses are occurring because solar installations are growing rapidly and require a lot of upfront investment, and because investors in the companies get to use the losses to offset their tax liabilities. Still, residential solar is a fiercely competitive and expensive business, and Sunrun and Sunnova must contend with hundreds of smaller rivals, many of which have been turning a profit for years.

He relented, they said, only after The New York Times and other news media outlets reported in early February 2019 that Mr. Zuberi's name and that of his company were included on a subpoena for documents sent to Mr. Trump's inaugural committee as part of a wide-ranging investigation into the inauguration and its financing.
'MANHATTAN' at Film Forum (March 10-21). Gordon Willis's wide-screen compositions, strains of George Gershwin and some of Woody Allen's funniest one-liners return to Film Forum for another revival of this 1979 film by Mr. Allen, one of his greatest achievements. As a bonus, Tony Roberts will appear for a sidebar showing on Monday at 7 p.m. of Annie Hall, in which he starred alongside Mr. Allen and Diane Keaton. Because the screening is in New York, rather than Los Angeles, he won't need a radiation suit to keep out the alpha rays.
As boards go, the Met's is high end and old school. An international jewel of the art world, the museum sits atop the hierarchy of major New York cultural institutions and a spot on its board has long been considered the pinnacle of prestige.
How Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Will stimulus payments be taxed? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction? Probably not, unless you're self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker.
The federal government owes us this, said the chairman of one tribe. We prepaid with millions of acres of land.
Those employees will not be paid until the shutdown ends.
On Feb. 14, Ben Frisch, in his 34th year teaching at Friends Seminary, a private school in downtown Manhattan was seeking to demonstrate an obtuse angle in an 11th grade math class. Straightening his arm and pointing it outward, he mimicked the Nazi salute and said, Heil Hitler.
The attack on the U.S. Capitol yesterday by supporters of President Trump was among the lowest moments I have seen in my career covering everything from 9/11 to the 2008 financial crisis to the pandemic. It was unfathomable to witness this violent effort to upend the certification of the election, incited by the president. The damage to America's reputation is real.
Mr. Frisch's father was an Austrian Jew who suffered traumatic anti-Semitic attacks as a child in Poland before World War II and lost his grandparents in the Holocaust. Mr. Frisch, a devout Quaker, has been considered one of the most spiritually serious members of the faculty at the school, founded in 1786, by members of the Religious Society of Friends. No one believed he had suddenly become a Third Reich sympathizer, but at the same time not everyone found his professed effort at comedy particularly whimsical.
Some of the revenue is kicked up the chain, all the way to officials in Kabul, the capital, ensuring that the local authorities maintain support from higher-ups and keeping the opium growing. And Garmsir is just one example of official involvement in the drug trade.
Pelosi threatens to pursue impeachment if Trump's cabinet does not strip him of powers. Video Following the U.S. Capitol riot, Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday called on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to strip President Trump of his powers. Credit Credit... By Reuters The top Democrats in Congress called on Thursday for President Trump's immediate removal from office for his role in urging on the violent mob that overtook the Capitol a day before, disrupting the ratification of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s electoral victory. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York called on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows him and the cabinet to wrest the power of the presidency from Mr. Trump. If Mr. Pence declines to act, they said, Democrats were prepared to impeach Mr. Trump for a second time. While it's only 13 days left, any day can be a horror show for America, Ms. Pelosi said, calling Mr. Trump's actions on Wednesday a seditious act. The speaker's plan was announced during an extraordinary news conference in the reclaimed Capitol, hours after the building was overrun by a mob of Trump supporters who temporarily halted Congress's confirmation of Mr. Biden's victory in the presidential election. Speaking to reporters, Ms. Pelosi singled out members of the cabinet by name, asking why they would not intervene. Are they ready to say for the next 13 days this dangerous man can assault our democracy?
The connected living and dining rooms have cherry floors, 12-foot ceilings and walls painted in a pale gray shade from Farrow & Ball. Each room has a fireplace (gas-burning in the living room, wood-burning in the dining room) with a black marble surround and mantel. The powder room was renovated with a paneled wainscot topped with Art Nouveau-style wallpaper.
Not anymore. The subways on the East Coast that allowed New York, Washington and Boston to thrive are showing their age and suffering from years of neglect, while cities on the West Coast are moving quickly to expand and improve their networks.

Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a phone interview from Davos that his firm had created a special sustainable portfolio for people in its private client group. The strategy had $1 billion in 2018 and has grown to $9 billion today, with some clients putting the bulk of their wealth into it.
Thank you so much for your powerful and insightful editorial. In 20 or 30 years we can look back on climate change and see if we should have done more about it sooner.
Mr. Biden proposed a wide range of efforts to help those who have suffered the most under the economic shutdowns, including emergency paid leave to 106 million Americans, regardless of the size of their employer, and extending tax credits to many families to offset up to $8,000 in annual child care costs.
The Senate health committee approved its version in July 2009 after considering hundreds of amendments over 13 days. The Senate Finance Committee cleared its version in October 2009, after more than a year of hearings, round-table discussions and other spadework. A group of Democrats and Republicans from the Finance Committee had met for months behind closed doors, trying — but ultimately failing — to draft bipartisan legislation.
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump will sign an initial trade agreement with Beijing that will help cool tensions between the world's two largest economies but leaves many of the biggest issues unresolved. Key details of the agreement remain murky, the text remains under wraps and more complicated matters, like China's financial support for companies that compete with American firms, have been pushed until after the 2020 election.
Similarly, analysts at Goldman Sachs predicted a Democratic Senate majority to allow for greater fiscal policy changes, including additional stimulus, perhaps followed later by a limited amount of tax increases.
Mr. Trump's Lost Cause takes its fuel from conspiratorial myths of all kinds, rehearsed for years on Trump media and social media platforms. Its guiding theories include: Christianity under duress and attack; large corrupt cities full of Black and brown people manipulated by liberal elites; Barack Obama as alien; a socialist movement determined to tax you into subservience to big government; liberal media out to crush family and conservative values; universities and schools teaching the young a history that hates America; resentment of nonwhite immigrants who threaten a particular national vision; and whatever hideous new version of a civil religion QAnon represents.
Replicating something akin to Scotland's law in the United States would be difficult, period equity activists point out, because of the difference in population size; Scotland's population is just half the size of New York City. But the United States, too, has begun enacting its own set of local and federal policies that help make period products more widely available.
The latest attempt is a lawsuit claiming that the 2017 tax cut, which reduced the penalty for not having insurance to $0, somehow made the entire Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. It's a ludicrous claim, both in terms of substance — would the law suddenly become constitutional if the penalty were a penny? — and because it's clear that this was not legislators' intention.
Aging stadiums are usually demolished after their expiration date; like plastic bags, they can be tedious to recycle. And in the New York area, several newer or renovated venues canceled out the need for a concrete cavern that dated back to 1981.
Shame on all of these people! They knew full well the character of the person they were supporting, and Wednesday's events should be no surprise to them.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tweeted a six-word statement in the hours after the riot on Wednesday: Violence is never the proper solution.
On Tuesday, Mr. Le Maire met with Phil Hogan, the new European trade commissioner, who will travel to the United States next week to discuss how to respond to potential American tariffs. If no deal is struck at the O.E.C.D. and American tariffs are imposed, France has vowed to retaliate with its own levies, as well as call on the European Union to move ahead with a broader European project for digital taxation.
Even so, the wall still isn't popular in Michigan or Pennsylvania, important battleground states. And voters in Ohio, a politically similar state, opposed the wall.
Answers to all of your questions and more are below, as we've rounded up the best of our advice for filing your taxes.
For all of the focus on the president's base over the last two years, there is not much reason to think that the base, alone, is enough for the president to win re-election in a one-on-one race against a viable Democratic candidate. This could change. It has before. But with the midterms over, this is now the central political challenge facing the president. By that measure, it's hard to see where a shutdown over the wall fits in.
The enthusiastic group, gathered at Toledo's Huntington Center, nodded again as Mr. Trump insisted that America's farmers, who have been hurt by the trade war with China, were winners and as he asserted, incorrectly, that American importers were not paying for the tariffs.
As president, Mr. Trump has visited his properties outside the Washington region more than 50 times, according to The Washington Post. His sons Eric and Donald Jr. have taken business trips to far-flung locales including Dubai, Ireland and India. A single visit in 2017 by Eric Trump to a Trump property under construction in Uruguay cost taxpayers nearly $100,000 just in hotel bills for Secret Service agents and embassy staff members.
Dr. Waronker, who has a doctorate in education from Harvard, quickly brought in some of his former associates from New York City. At his urging, the outgoing majority on the board entered into a $450,000 contract with a Brooklyn-based nonprofit he founded, the New American Initiative, and approved the hiring of four master teachers, whose job, Dr. Waronker said in an interview, was to implement teacher rounds, a form of collaborative professional development modeled on medical rounds.
Alternatively, save at least 33 percent of your raise. If your take-home pay increased by $1,000, you should save at least $333.
There will be other items affecting earnings and capital. Deutsche has outlined its relevant restructuring costs, as well as the presumed capital benefit from selling its stake in a Chinese lender. And the risk-weighted assets against which banks measure their equity for regulatory purposes would almost certainly increase because of changes to global standards; Morgan Stanley estimates that they will rise 12.5 percent by the end of 2018.
This is incredible power for a politician who's never been elected to national office and isn't even popular in his home state — one recent poll put him at the very bottom of the Senate, with a 37 percent positive voter rating in Kentucky.
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will direct the Internal Revenue Service to issue tax refunds during the ongoing federal government shutdown, reversing previous policy, officials said Monday.
I'm proud that we are today delivering on our promise to scrap the tampon tax, Chancellor Rishi Sunak of the Exchequer said in a statement. Sanitary products are essential so it's right that we do not charge VAT.
For decades, lawmakers all over the world were largely silent about the issue of period poverty. But as policymakers and advocates have begun to break the taboo, with female political leaders putting a spotlight on women's health needs, countries around the globe are devising policies to make these products more accessible. In most instances this means helping to cut costs, but some are taking a bolder approach: Last November, Scotland became the first country to make period products free for all, meaning local authorities are mandated to ensure anyone who needs them can access them.
There is some question about whether a border-adjustment tax would be rejected by the World Trade Organization as an import barrier or export subsidy. But an American border tax would not be different in any relevant way from the longstanding consumption taxes that our foreign competitors currently enjoy with the blessing of the W.T.O., so it should not be judged any differently. If the W.T.O. — principally a bureaucratic collaboration of America's competitors — were to reject an American border-adjustment tax, it might well be time for the United States to re-evaluate its relationship with that organization.
The app renewed a debate about who holds power over online speech after the tech giants yanked their support for it and left it fighting for survival. Parler went dark on Monday after Amazon's web hosting platform shut down Parler's account.

After Hebei reported 63 new cases in a day, officials in Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital, on Wednesday imposed tougher travel controls, barred gatherings and moved elementary and middle schools to online learning. The W.H.O. 's criticism of China marks a rare public fissure in what has otherwise been a close relationship. For months, the W.H.O. has publicly praised China for its response to the coronavirus, in the hope that such a soft-handed approach would yield crucial access and information. Critics say that in doing so, the organization allowed the Chinese government to whitewash its mistakes and portray itself as a transparent and cooperative global partner in the pandemic response. Some have expressed concern that by now, the inquiry has become so politicized it is unlikely to yield concrete findings. But one thing is almost certain: If and when the W.H.O. team does arrive in China, another delay is expected. Like all other Chinese citizens and foreign visitors, the investigators will be required to quarantine for 14 days.
Here are other developments in the fallout from the Capitol siege: A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill in the House on Thursday to award Eugene Goodman, a Capitol Police officer, the Congressional Gold Medal because of his efforts to keep the violent mob of Trump supporters from accessing the Senate last week. Mr. Goodman was captured on video running up the stairs in the Capitol. The F.B.I. has warned police departments across the country to be on high alert for extremist activity and violence in their communities ahead of the inauguration next week. It also cautioned law enforcement agencies to look for armed militias and extremists who want to trigger a race war.
If he is taken out wide on the backhand, he uses a lot of right arm to be able to muscle that ball into play, Cahill said. No one else from that far back in the court can throw the ball up with that amount of spin and give it enough hang time to make it uncomfortable for the opponent to put away that first ball. It's just difficult to do that.
Here are the reasons more federal workers are still showing up for work despite not getting paid.
But Amazon had also successfully opposed a city corporate tax to raise funds to address homeless and affordable housing The first commitments in Amazon's new Housing Equity Fund include about $382 million below-market loans and grants to the Washington Housing Conservancy, which buys and preserves affordable housing for moderate- to low-income residents near Arlington, Va., where Amazon is building a second headquarters. It also gave about $185.5 million below-market loan and grants to the King County Housing Authority, which works in the Puget Sound region, where Amazon's Seattle and growing Bellevue campuses are based.

For Big Tech, the events of the past week raised tricky questions about politics, free speech and radicalization of people online.
The new report comes at a moment when airlines are increasingly requiring pre-trip negative test results and requiring some social distancing between passengers and mask wearing. In this case, two of the people who tested positive acknowledged not wearing a mask during the flight, and two did not get a Covid test before boarding. Previous analyses of the infection risk of air travel had produced mixed results, and airlines' air filtration systems are thought to reduce risk even when a flight includes an infected person or persons. But at least two recent reports strongly suggest that in-flight outbreaks are a risk: one, of a flight from Boston to Hong Kong in March; the other of a flight from London to Hanoi, Vietnam, also in March. But the new report is the first of an in-flight outbreak late in the year, when both airlines and passengers were being far more cautious than in the spring.

For the full year, according to official data, the Chinese economy grew 6.6 percent. That's the weakest pace of growth since 1990, when China's economic miracle stumbled in the aftermath of the crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square the year before.
Signing a player to a nonguaranteed offer sheet is technically not against league rules, nor is waiving him shortly thereafter. But because McCaw lasted only a week in Cleveland before the Cavaliers released him, some around the league have suggested that the move was designed more to help McCaw extricate himself from the Warriors than because of any true interest in the player on Cleveland's part.
That did not mean Mr. Trump has joined the globalism chorus. He has spent much of the last year trying to dismantle the international political and economic system represented by the Davos consensus — ripping up or renegotiating trade agreements, threatening or imposing tariffs on imports and working to curb the flow of immigration. In his speech on Friday, Mr. Trump insisted that cross-border trade had to be made fairer and vowed to take action against predatory practices.
The managers will present their two articles of impeachment charging Mr. Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress as they begin what will be as much as 24 hours of opening arguments over three days. With no guarantee of being able to call witnesses later, these three days may be the main opportunity for the prosecution.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is up for re-election this year, almost certainly faces a legislative battle over congestion pricing, especially with lawmakers from the boroughs outside Manhattan who fear that a congestion plan would hurt their constituents who drive because they have limited access to subways and buses. Mr. Cuomo once expressed doubt about the chances for congestion pricing before declaring in August that it was an idea whose time has come.
The Democratic majority in the House shrank in the last election, emboldening Republicans and giving Speaker Nancy Pelosi less wiggle room in what is likely her last term. More than half of House Republicans voted to throw out certified presidential election results from Arizona and Pennsylvania overnight Wednesday and Thursday without evidence of fraud, reflecting both the extreme character of the House Republican conference and what is sure to be a reluctance to work with Mr. Biden.
Here's how that happened: Companies like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt sometimes set up temporary accounts for clients when they prepare returns. For example, clients who choose to have preparation fees deducted from their refund may be issued one of these accounts, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest. After that, the accounts are generally closed or inactive — but may still be linked to the taxpayers in I.R.S. records. Payments that cannot be processed by the receiving financial institution must be returned to the Treasury.
Susan Waldron, an H & R Block spokeswoman, said preparers hired after completing the initial course must take an additional 21 hours of training and complete 10 practice returns before working with clients. In addition, she said, returning preparers must take 32 hours of continuing education and skills training each year.
After two hours, a 10-minute warning bell signaled the final throws of the night; winners and losers alike then headed to the bar upstairs for a club-sponsored pizza party. Except for Skerkowski himself, who lingered, as was his habit, to bait bystanders with a free tutorial.
The case challenges a decision to shut down a program that provided tax breaks to donors who funded scholarships that families could use at private schools, including religious ones. Montana discontinued the program after a ruling by its high court found that it had violated a provision in its Constitution that prohibited the use of government funding, either directly or indirectly, for religious purposes. Such provisions, known as no-aid provisions or Blaine Amendments, exist in 37 states and were driven initially by anti-Catholic bias. They are now seen as the last line of defense against widespread acceptance of school voucher programs.
If you are among the millions of Americans who put in hours of unpaid labor last year arguing about or responding to national politics, you may be entitled to a tax credit of at least $45.
It's very hard. It's hard to go in there and do my job 100 percent like I'm supposed to, knowing that I'm not going to get paid. Having to go back to work is going to be an expense that I simply can't afford. It's going to require, you know, getting gas for my car to go to work. I can't afford that right now. I've got to try to keep the lights on or keep the water on and I got to keep my phone on and I don't know how I'm going to be able to do all of that. Like, It's not our fault. We've done our job up to this point. You know, we were working overtime before all this, to be able to meet the taxpayers' needs. I'm under the impression that we are not eligible for unemployment because we are still working. And my employees, many of them are struggling to have money for fuel to come to work. You know, I just bought a house. Nov. 13, 2018, and five weeks later, we have a shutdown. So, you know, I was able to make my first payment. We didn't ask for any of this. We didn't want to be — we just wanted to go to work and do our job. Period. Well, there's all of this coverage about people in the D.C. area who are getting free lunches and going to food banks and that there is some level of community support there.
distributed guidance to its field offices that says agents may nominate someone to be considered a known or suspected terrorist if they have particular negative information to support their suspicions, like an allegation that the suspect has terrorism ties that is corroborated by at least one other source. But mere guesses or hunches, the bureau said at the time, are not enough. The Terrorism Screening Database is maintained by the F.B.I. 's Terrorist Screening Center. Some of the data used by the Terrorist Screening Center comes from a larger database maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, an interagency clearinghouse for intelligence about potential terrorist threats. Being on the watch list can restrict people from entering the country, deny them government benefits or contracts, and subject them to greater scrutiny at airports and by the police. A subset of the people on the watch list are also placed on the so-called no-fly list, which bars them from being aboard planes in American airspace. The vast majority of people included in the database are foreigners abroad, but some are American citizens or lawful permanent residents. Court records suggest that in 2017, the F.B.I. 's Terrorism Screening Database had about 1.2 million people in it, including about 4,600 such American or green-card holders. The government has said a broader database of terrorism suspects called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment had about 1.6 million names in it, of which about 16,000 were Americans.

TJS: Looking at so many of your priorities: A lot of it seems impossible unless you all pass things through simple majorities rather than through the bipartisan wrangling needed to get to the 60-vote filibuster-proof threshold required under normal circumstances.
The downsides of working in Italy also worry Ms. Parisi, who is concerned that her professional advancement would be stymied in what she sees an Italian business world that has narrow scope for younger workers. She allowed that London's lack of sun was bleak and British food was bad for her skin, but said that other things were important in life, too.
Lawyers may make arguments to a court based on differing analyses of the facts. But they cannot misrepresent the facts. Today I am ashamed to be part of a profession that includes the lawyers representing Mr. Trump.
Over the past couple of decades, the number of innovative locally owned restaurants has grown in Montreal and other Canadian cities, and they are gaining national and international recognition. So there was dismay among many of the chefs at those restaurants when the province's lottery agency, Loto Quebec, which oversees the casino, turned to an acclaimed chef from Paris to create a signature restaurant for its casino. Adding to the insult, in their eyes, it appears that the lottery agency is heavily subsidizing the L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon.
As anathema as it may be to some participants, Mr. Trump may be the new Davos Man.
Yet Democratic leaders expressed confidence that their members would not break from their leaders' strategy, notwithstanding Mr. Trump's attempts to entice them.

In the Pensacola case, Apple has said it has given up all the data it has to the government. But law enforcement officials, as all law enforcement officials tend to do, are asking for more, claiming this time that they want only to look at the particular phones in the Pensacola case, and are not seeking a back door for all phones or a special operating system.
We would still see homes of different sizes and styles — condos in some places, single-family homes in others — depending on the market in each city. A New York home would be smaller than one in, say, Houston.
They said it the way one child pulls another child's hair, the way a bad kid flips off a teacher. They said it because it was funny, and borderline improbable. And they said it because Mr. Cole, in his intense aesthetic sobriety, had become the avatar for a style of hip-hop that the young generation had no use for: lyrical, meditative, concerned rather than concerning.
Yet the cases keep pouring in, with no sign of slowing and little indication, some Arizona health care leaders say, of the kind of widespread public vigilance that might bring the outbreak under control. At the same time, vaccines in the state are being administered at among the lowest rates in the country. Most Americans don't want to know, don't want to acknowledge, don't really want to recognize and certainly — even as it's descending upon us — do not appear to understand the dire circumstances that we are facing, said Dr. Marjorie Bessel, the chief clinical officer at Banner Health, Arizona's largest hospital network. Arizona is by no means alone in its struggle. Nationally, it has become routine for more than 200,000 infections and more than 2,500 deaths to be announced in a single day. California, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Oklahoma are all identifying cases at extraordinarily high rates. The outlook is especially alarming in Southern California. In just two weeks, more than 240,000 cases had been identified in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. That is more cases than at least 19 entire states have identified over the entire pandemic. Hospitals have become so crowded that the Los Angeles County emergency medical services agency directed ambulances not to transport patients who cannot be resuscitated by emergency responders out in the field. The hospital system in Arizona is not at that point yet, but it is close.
That also masks the weakness of the earnings in A.I.G.'s main business. Mr. Hancock's plan is to elevate return on equity next year to a subpar 9 percent. MetLife is expected to do slightly better, according to Thomson Reuters data, when it reports last year's profit later this week. Prudential is on track for 14.4 percent.
While it has drawn far less interest than a special House election in Georgia, the Montana race is drawing the attention of both parties. Senator Steve Daines of Montana announced on the call that Vice President Mike Pence would campaign with Mr. Gianforte, setting up something of a proxy fight between the administration and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is set to stump later this month with the Democratic nominee, Rob Quist.
The Democrats named as possibilities were all moderates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.; or the latest entrant, the billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg.
The surprise disclosures about Mr. Manafort were the latest in two years of steady revelations about contacts between associates of Mr. Trump's and Russian officials or operatives. In another development on Tuesday, the Russian lawyer who met with senior campaign officials at Trump Tower in June 2016 was charged with obstruction of justice in an unrelated case. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said that the lawyer, Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, had pretended to a federal judge that she was purely a private defense lawyer when in fact she was working with the Russian government to thwart the civil prosecution of a Russian company.
Other dissenting voices will be in attendance this year, including the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who will attend for a second time.

But despite widespread agreement from education experts that the law harms low-income schools, it is widely seen as a third rail of state politics and changing it would require statewide voter approval. There is now an effort, supported by both district and union leaders in Los Angeles, for a 2020 ballot measure that would change the law to increase commercial property taxes, but not change the law for homeowners.
It basically worked. We've had four long economic booms since then. But there was an interesting cultural shift that happened along the way. In a healthy society, people try to balance a whole bunch of different priorities: economic, social, moral, familial. Somehow over the past 40 years economic priorities took the top spot and obliterated everything else. As a matter of policy, we privileged economics and then eventually no longer could even see that there could be other priorities.
When Danielle Town realized she needed to gain control of her money, she turned to her father, Phil, the best-selling author of the personal finance book, Rule #1: The Simple Strategy for Successful Investing in Only 15 Minutes a Week!, to teach her about investing. They turned their conversations into a successful podcast called InvestED, which educates listeners on value investing, a strategy popularized by Warren Buffett. This book is the culmination of that project. Written by Town with her dad, Invested tells the story of her financial education and lays out a 12-month plan for readers to learn the basics of investing — including when to buy and sell, and for how much — and become more confident in navigating the stock market.

It can be very tricky to come up with the plans, and it can be very costly to administer it for the business because of the management of them, the turnover of them, the matching of them, Mr. Polyoka said. Any kind of uniform retirement planning approach at Foodshed needs to have the personality to match the company culture, he said.
His relationship with Mr. Manafort dates back years. The two men worked together to promote a Russia-aligned politician, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who rose to Ukraine's presidency, was ousted in a popular uprising and fled to Russia in 2014. The two men continued working together over the next three years as Mr. Manafort's financial troubles grew and investigators began to investigate a fraud scheme that eventually led to his conviction for 10 felonies.
In November, the Trump administration stepped away from a major escalation in relations as it quietly allowed a deadline to impose tariffs on European cars to expire. But it has moved ahead with other tariffs on European products — some in response to a dispute over aircraft at the World Trade Organization, and others in response to France's new tax on digital services.
The initial rollout would bring in much less revenue, projections show: Budget documents included no revenue from marijuana regulation and taxation for the 2020 fiscal year, and $83 million for 2021.
There was not enough talent in France's small literary world to establish a jury system with new judges very year, Mr. Nora said. He suggested that changing a third of each jury every five years would be more feasible and bring in new faces.
The move is the latest salvo in two years of public complaints by good government advocates over the groups, run by close allies of the mayor, that grew out of Mr. de Blasio's 2013 campaign. They have since advocated for his policies, beginning with the push for universal prekindergarten and, now, the battle over rezoning and affordable housing.
American officials have called the tax discriminatory and unreasonable and detailed a plan to retaliate by imposing tariffs on porcelain, soap, handbags, wine, yogurt, lipstick and other French products, though they have not specified the rate or total dollar value of the tariffs that might be imposed.

Democrats want Biden to investigate Trump and his allies. A window is boarded up in a hallway of the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington on Friday. President Trump's role in inspiring the mob violence had prompted many Democrats to support investigations into Trump and his aides. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Twelve years ago, when the last Democratic president took office, he did not seek broad inquiries into officials from the previous administration for their use of torture practices, or for domestic eavesdropping. Nor did he pursue prosecutions of Wall Street executives for crimes that led to the 2008 financial crisis. This time, Democrats are not willing to be so accommodating: They want to hold President Trump, his family and his enablers accountable for acts they believe didn't just break norms, but broke the law. Once President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes office on Jan. 20, wide segments of his party are eager to see investigations and prosecutions of an array of Trump aides and allies — an effort, they say, that would bolster the rule of law after a presidency that weakened it and serve as a warning to future presidents that there will be consequences for illegal actions taken while in office. The rioting at the Capitol has only intensified that desire.
Mr. Bezos's phone had begun sending unusually large volumes of data, the NYT reports, citing a person familiar with the inquiry. Investigators hired by Mr. Bezos believed Prince Mohammed was used as a conduit because the message would not raise suspicions if it came from him.

She said she had called Ms. Pelosi on Monday to relay complaints by her constituents over the weekend about the shutdown, and has also been talking quietly with Republicans — whom she would not name — about how to find a way out of the stalemate.
California was the sixth state to introduce the sale of recreational marijuana — Alaska, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington paved the way — but the enormous size of the market led to predictions of soaring legal cannabis sales.
Just a few days ago, this would have been unthinkable, Judd Legum — the author of the Popular Information newsletter, who has done the best recent reporting on corporate donations — told me.
Instead of giving all the money to China, now we're going to get some of it back, said Kim Lewis, 65, a corn and soybean farmer from Jamestown, Ind., who drove four hours to see Mr. Trump's speech. He had the guts to stand up to these other countries.
In New Jersey, for example, the average 2017 property tax bill was $8,690 across the state, according to the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, and more than $11,000 in counties that make up the suburbs of New York City. Those homeowners are likely to blow past the new deduction cap before they're even done with their property taxes.
The best way to improve the image of government is not through soaring speeches by politicians. It's through a version of the old journalism cliché: Show, don't tell. You want people to be able to see the way government is helping them, Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist, says, and have a stake in defending it.
Mr. Sekulow, 63, coordinates the work of eight lawyers from a cooperative working space a few blocks from the White House, under the name Constitutional Litigation and Advocacy Group.
As someone who grew up in a small town in Middle America, I have a (hopefully) straightforward question: Why is this shooting not be discussed as a potential act of domestic terrorism (or more provocatively nativist extremist terrorism)? When immigration is the major political issue of the day, and the statements made by this individual clearly reflect an attempt to inspire fear that would affect a group of people, and when the connection between that group of people and a current hot-button political issue is pretty obvious, why is this not an act of terrorism? Imagine all the circumstances of this were reversed: If the same act had been committed by a person from another country, who was a member of a racial/religious group that was in the minority in America, and this person had targeted white Americans and shouted Death to your country instead of Go back to your country this would be on the front page as an act of likely terrorism. So why is this being treated so differently? Obviously, I care because the victim could easily have been me or my children. Vikaas Sohal, San Francisco
One solution being pushed by some activists is to create a system of public campaign financing parallel to the widened stream of private funds. Seattle has recently adopted a democracy voucher program, which distributes funds to voters who can then donate to the candidates of their choice. (Seattle has also recently restricted corporate involvement in local politics through foreign interference laws.) And New York State will match six to one donations by people who give less than $250.
She is seen as a relatively traditional choice for commerce secretary, a sprawling post that oversees relations with the business community but also technology regulation, weather monitoring and the gathering of economic data, among other duties. As governor of Rhode Island, Ms. Raimondo introduced training programs, cut taxes and eliminated regulations to support businesses. She clashed with unions but ultimately found compromise as she overhauled the state pension plan. Before running for office, she was a founding employee at the investment firm Village Ventures, which was backed by Bain Capital, and co-founded her own venture capital firm, Point Judith Capital. Ms. Raimondo has a law degree from Yale University and earned a doctorate from Oxford University, where she was a Rhodes scholar. As commerce secretary, Ms. Raimondo will control an agency that was at the forefront of an economic fight with China during the Trump administration. A sprawling agency with nearly 50,000 employees, the Commerce Department has used its vast power to curtail the access of Chinese companies to the American market and technology. The department also played a role in levying significant tariffs on trading partners on the basis of national security, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. It carried out investigations into the effect of imported steel and aluminum on the domestic industry, which led to President Trump imposing global metal tariffs. It also investigated whether imports of cars and car parts, uranium and titanium sponges posed a threat to national security.

Georgia officials reveal third Trump call trying to influence election results. Mr. Trump repeatedly called Georgia officials in an attempt to pressure them to find votes for him in the 2020 election. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times More than a week before President Trump called Georgia's secretary of state, pressuring him to find votes to help overturn his electoral loss, the president made another call, this one to a top Georgia elections investigator, in which he asked the investigator to find the fraud in the state. The earlier phone call, which came to light on Saturday, along with the revelation that White House officials pushed Atlanta's top federal prosecutor to resign, underlined a broader push by Mr. Trump to overturn election results in the state. Mr. Trump's phone call, made in late December, was first reported by The Washington Post. The content of the Post report was verified by a state elections official who requested anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak about the matter. In the call, Mr. Trump said the investigator would be a national hero for finding evidence of fraud. At the time, Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger's office was conducting an audit of more than 15,000 ballots in Cobb County, a populous suburb of Atlanta that was formerly a Republican stronghold but voted against Mr. Trump in both 2016 and 2020.

Mr. Trump has been cajoling Mr. Pence in public and private to find a way to use his role on Wednesday to give credence to his unfounded claims — rejected by the states and in scores of court cases and backed by no evidence — that the election was stolen from him through widespread fraud.
The committee also paid at least $300,000 for a private hotel reception for 1,200 guests to honor Ivanka Trump, the president's oldest daughter, and her brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, overriding the concerns of some staffers who argued the expenditure violated spending rules, the complaint states.
Dollar General, which has nearly 17,000 locations in the United States, said on Wednesday that it will give four hours of pay to hourly workers who receive a completed Covid-19 vaccination, and additional store labor hours to salaried employees who also do so. Dollar General is one of the first major employers to announce such incentives. It said that it did not want our employees to have to choose between receiving a vaccine or coming to work.
Many more states are using thousands more Guard personnel for logistical tasks, like putting together vaccine kits and moving them around, logging in patients and controlling lines at state vaccination sites. In West Virginia, for example, about 100 Guard troops are assisting with distribution across the state.

A ceremony at the White House can't hide the stark truth about the 'Phase 1' China trade deal: The deal does absolutely nothing to curtail China's subsidies to its manufacturers, Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which includes manufacturers and the United Steelworkers union, said in a tweet. All those 'forgotten men and women' in U.S. factories have, once again, been forgotten.
I don't agree with all of Warren's ideas (see: Medicare for All), but I think she is onto something important here. Creating a new era of progressive change — to take on problems like climate change and extreme inequality — depends on persuading more Americans that government is a force for good.
The $1,200 checks to most American households that were included in that legislation contributed a further $276 billion to personal income — much of which accrued to families that did not experience a drop in earnings.
Even as he sought to make clear that he does not have the power Mr. Trump seems to think he has, Mr. Pence also indicated to the president that he would keep studying the issue up until the final hours before the joint session of Congress begins at 1 p.m. Wednesday, according to the people briefed on their conversation.

He also pledged to ramp up efforts to slow the spread of the virus, which is now claiming 4,000 lives each day — more than those who perished during the Battle of Antietam during the Civil War, the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 or the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Biden's team said the president-elect would immediately provide more vaccines to states when he takes office, breaking sharply from Mr. Trump's practice of holding back some shots for second doses.
On that January day in Middletown, Bob Helligrass and Jaime Loughridge, friends from the Albany area, sat eating lunch at Tapped, a bistro next to Equilibrium that opened around the same time.
Many have also been silent on the issue of rising drug prices, even as the issue has enraged patients, who have been increasingly exposed to the prices that pharmaceutical companies set as insurers have asked them to pay a greater share of their drug costs. Last summer, patients and their families loudly protested the skyrocketing price of EpiPens, though the movement gathered steam on social media rather than through traditional patient-advocacy groups.
Among R.E.I.T.s, Mr. Almeida said, MFS prefers those with properties that are really hard to replicate.

Deutsche Bank's vast and opaque balance sheet is holding it back. Media reports that the German lender was considering buying back senior debt to strengthen its balance sheet sent its shares – and those of European peers – soaring on Wednesday. But Deutsche's shares are still down 35 percent since early January.

Many U.K. businesses — at least 150,000, according to data from Britain's tax agency — have never traded beyond the European Union, and so have no experience dealing with the customs systems.
Fears that the extra economic boost could spark faster inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to accelerate the pace of interest rate increases appear to be at least partially driving the stock sell-off that has rattled markets over the last several days. Higher interest rates would raise federal borrowing costs as the United States continues to borrow heavily — the national debt has topped $20 trillion and annual deficits are creeping up toward $1 trillion. Treasury officials said last week that the United States will need to borrow $441 billion in privately held debt this quarter, the largest sum since 2010, when the economy was emerging from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.
In 1981, the economist Gary Becker argued that free-market principles applied in the home as well. The family functioned like a small factory, with each person making rational choices to maximize value, he wrote in A Treatise on the Family (part of the body of work for which he would later win the Nobel Prize.)
The poor have become poorer while the middle class has struggled under a growing burden. Taxes on property jumped to 3.7 billion euros in 2017, from around 600 million euros before the crisis. Some 19 percent of taxpayers account for 90 percent of income tax revenues, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has acknowledged. Property values reflect the higher taxes and lower rents, with apartments losing an average of 41 percent in value between 2007 and 2017, according to the Bank of Greece.

He went on to discuss the plight of millions of Americans who lack health insurance, elderly people who have no retirement savings, millions more with crippling student debt and the specter of global climate change, arguing that those challenges were far more pressing than the one posed by illegal immigration.

Biden will say all the public things about how he needs to get Republican support, but the truth is that this fundamentally changes the dynamic, said David Krone, former chief of staff to former Senator Harry Reid, the last Democratic majority leader. Democrats now control the floor. So he can bring up all kinds of bills that would have been blocked by the Republicans, and force votes on big bills — like a major infrastructure package — that never would have seen the light of day.
Still, taken together, the end-of-the-year data in both reports suggested that New York City's real estate market continued the gradual slowdown that had characterized it for most of the year.
Because he is not yet eligible for arbitration, Drury will make close to the major-league minimum, giving the Yankees more flexibility to spend on pitching later this spring — or later this season — without endangering their goal of staying below the $197 million luxury tax threshold. The Yankees are currently about $20 million below the threshold.
Uncertainty about how the economy will react to rising borrowing costs has raised the blood pressure of investors. In one sign of a shift underway, a measure of expected market turbulence, the CBOE Volatility Index, jumped by more than 25 percent on Friday. The so-called VIX has spent months at historically low levels, reflecting a placid market mood that seems to have evaporated over the last week.

It tested and strengthened loyalty by forcing underlings to cheer statements they knew to be false and rallied the support of ordinary people who, Hitler realized, more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie because, while they might fib in their daily lives about small things, it would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths.
At Grasset, Mr. Nora said he began weaning his company off the business model of prizes when he took over two decades ago. Back then, Grasset used to give generous advances to authors who were jurors to secure their loyalty — a practice that eventually attracted the attention of the tax authorities, because the authors often did not bother delivering manuscripts.
I am a Jewish immigrant who came here as part of a family that was stateless, and my deep patriotism is rooted in that experience. I benefited from American humanitarianism, and I have worked my entire life to give back to this country. An America inhospitable to immigrants and foreigners, a place of fear and danger instead of refuge, is unthinkable in the context of the nation's history and founding principles. If a more practical argument is required, think of the consequences for the quality and future of our colleges and universities, and their highly prized superiority in science and engineering.

Many employers, drawing on behavioral economics research, now include automatic annual increases in paycheck contributions — sometimes called automatic escalation — in their retirement savings plans. But the option to automatically save a certain amount of a raise is less common, Morningstar said. The Plan Sponsor Council of America, an industry group, said it did not yet track whether companies offered such a feature.
A close look at Deutsche's capital position implies that the nervousness is overdone. First, consider litigation — the biggest potential danger. John Cryan, the bank's co-chief executive, has 5.5 billion euros of reserves for fines. That should suffice for whatever Deutsche might have to settle this year, unless it has to pay through the nose to settle an investigation into equities trades that may have allowed Russian clients to escape sanctions. Assume a total of €10 billion of penalties by 2019, which will create a substantial hit to the bottom line; such penalties are not tax-deductible.
Mr. Trump acknowledged that his deadline was tight, and that he became greatly concerned when Kaszycki & Sons fell behind. He said that he considered pulling them off the job, but realized it would cost him months. So he decided to put more money into their contract so they would have enough to move faster.
In hip-hop, Mr. Cole has more or less been a lone warrior — he lives in North Carolina, not far from where he grew up; he produces his own music; he essentially scorns collaboration. After flirtations with the conventions of major-label rap stardom, he retreated and began establishing a more tonally modest, historically minded and grown-up strain of hip-hop. He has things in common with Kendrick Lamar and Drake, and inheritors like Logic, but he is truly singular.
Mr. Cuomo's criticism of the federal government's response to the earthquakes focused on the fact that Mr. Trump still has not released hurricane-related federal funds that he said could be used to address damage from the earthquakes. The seismic activity began in late December and have forced thousands of fearful residents from their homes: More than 8,000 residents are scattered in more than 40 shelters, and thousands more are sleeping in makeshift tents and inside parked cars near highways.
WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Monday that the United States would soon announce a reciprocal tax on countries that take advantage of the United States on trade, including trading partners he described as so-called allies.

Jérôme Goeminne, who manages a group of hospitals in that region, said in an interview that it made sense to prioritize retirement and nursing homes to keep older and more vulnerable patients from overwhelming hospitals. And he said that some of the delays were inevitable. Still, Mr. Goeminne said that the government had not given the local health authorities enough flexibility. Once it's launched, things will roll ahead, but the execution is long, he said. There is a cultural aversion to risk in France, he added. Responding to the criticism, officials are speeding up their timetable. Health workers, firefighters and home-based care givers over the age of 50 are now able to get their shots — ahead of schedule. Olivier Véran, the French health minister, also announced on Tuesday that anyone over 75 would be eligible for vaccination by the end of January, that hundreds of vaccination centers would open by the end of the month and that any French person who wanted a shot would soon be able to sign up for an appointment. We are now going to amplify, accelerate and simplify our vaccination strategy, Mr. Véran told RTL radio on Tuesday, vowing that France would catch up with its European neighbors in the coming days. More than 66,000 people have died in France so far because of the virus, and the number of hospitalized patients is stuck at about 25,000. Museums and movie theaters are closed, as are bars and restaurants.
Greater income inequality alienates and discourages people from engaging with common affairs, thus leading to lower political participation. Yet, lower electoral participation leads towards a less equitable distribution of income. Hence, this study reveals a self‐reinforcing mechanism where the unequal distribution of income leads to political exclusion, which in turn leads to more inequality.
How Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Will stimulus payments be taxed? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction? Probably not, unless you're self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker.
These two options, however, work best for savers in their 20s, 30s and 40s and become less effective as people age. The spend twice your years to retirement rule works across all age groups, the report said, because it usually involves saving the most money. Still, it may be financially difficult for some people to put into action.

On Thursday, the best House speaker of modern times reclaimed her gavel, replacing one of the worst. It has taken the news media a very long time to appreciate the greatness of Nancy Pelosi, who saved Social Security from privatization, then was instrumental in gaining health insurance for 20 million Americans. And the media are still having a hard time facing up to the phoniness of their darling Paul Ryan, who, by the way, left office with a 12 percent favorable rating. But I think the narrative is finally, grudgingly, catching up with reality.
Mr. Trump appeared to be unclear both about the timing of already scheduled votes in Congress and about the difficulty of his demand — a repeal vote probably some time next week and a replacement very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.
As part of the deal, Mr. Trump agreed to reduce the rate on tariffs imposed in September and forgo additional import taxes in the future. But the United States will continue to maintain tariffs covering 65 percent of American imports from China, according to tracking by Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics. That leaves the United States with an overall tariff rate higher than that of any other advanced nation, as well as China, India and Turkey.
Bret: I wouldn't be surprised if nothing happens, at least for a while. It's what the Russians call a frozen conflict. Democrats get to tell their voters they've fulfilled their pledge to impeach the president and blame Senate Republicans for refusing to conduct a fair trial. Republicans can retort that Democrats were unable to muster anything more than a partisan impeachment, and now lack the courage of their convictions.
I believe in America, Mr. Trump told a jampacked auditorium on the last day of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos. As president of the United States, I will always put America first, just like the leaders of other countries should put their country first also. But America first does not mean America alone. When the United States grows, so does the world.
said it was still investigating another seven reports of anaphylaxis following the vaccine, which have not been confirmed. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System also identified 83 cases of nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions after the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccination; these people developed symptoms like rash and mild respiratory symptoms within a day of receiving the vaccine. Among the 21 vaccine recipients who experienced anaphylaxis, 17 were known to have allergies to a variety of triggers, including foods, insects, pets and medications. The median time for anaphylactic reaction was 13 minutes after immunization, but one patient developed the reaction two and a half hours afterward. Patients with known allergies have been warned to bring an epinephrine injector when they get vaccinated, and providers have been advised to keep patients with allergies for observation for 30 minutes following inoculation. The new information is disconcerting, said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research. The flaw in the system is that there was a small number of people who had a reaction 30 minutes or later, she said. It's one thing to say everybody should hang around for 15 minutes. But the range was up to 150 minutes, and people aren't going to hang around that long.

Around the world, the new year looks a lot like the old one so far. The largely deserted Horse Guards Parade in central London on Tuesday. England has been forced into a new national lockdown to try to combat a more infectious variant of the coronavirus. Credit... Andrew Testa for The New York Times ROME — People around the world counted down to the end of 2020 with relish, pegging their hopes on the idea that the new year would bring vaccines and something that felt like normalcy. But the coronavirus keeps no calendar. The bad news rolled in during the first days of 2021, including about the virus variant that has sent Britain into a desperate lockdown, serving notice that tougher times could be ahead. More than ever, hope is riding on the vaccine rollouts that have been fumbled and slower than promised around the world. So far, the new year doesn't look, or feel, so different. It's OK to be upset and feel down right now, Joe Wicks, a British fitness instructor whose online sessions last year drew millions of views, said as he broke down in a Monday night video reacting to England's new restrictions. Even places that much of the world looked to with admiration for their response to the pandemic have stumbled into the new year. In South Korea, infections soared to the largest daily increases yet during Christmas week. In Japan, a looming state of emergency for Tokyo is dashing long-harbored hopes.
Target saw strong holiday sales, a bump of 17% from last year. Shoppers wait outside a Target in Commerce, Calif., on Black Friday. The retailer saw sales rise both in-store and online this holiday season. Credit... Ringo H.W. Chiu/Associated Press Amid a mixed holiday shopping season for some retailers, and as coronavirus cases surged across the country, Target reported strong sales. The giant retailer said on Wednesday that its sales in November and December were up 17.2 percent from the same time the previous year, a rise driven both by in-store and online shopping. Its digital sales were the biggest area of growth, however, more than doubling from the 2019 holiday season. The vast majority of those sales were delivered from Target stores, which analysts say helped the company avoid some of the shipping delays caused by an overload of e-commerce orders. Fulfilling online orders from stores is also more profitable than paying to have items shipped through carriers like FedEx and UPS. Target's holiday results are further evidence of the growing gap between large retailers that are emerging from the pandemic stronger and more dominant and others that are failing and not likely to survive.

Janet L.

A few hundred colleges, mostly the more expensive private ones, ask families applying for financial aid to fill out an additional form, known as the CSS Profile. It does ask about home equity. The schools take different approaches to baking that number into their overall equations for making financial aid offers, though many will also use your income to place a cap on the amount of home equity they factor in.

They want to hear about how individuals can change their lives, rather than how structural reform can affect inequality or climate change.
I've never been a fan of Davos, that annual gathering of the rich and fatuous. One virtue of the pageant of preening and self-importance, however, is that it brings out the worst in some people, leading them to say things that reveal their vileness for all to see.
In December 2015, however, Uber changed this portion of the contract, replacing the phrase imputed in the fare with the phrase calculated on the fare. The new wording, while ambiguous, lent itself more strongly to an interpretation that the fare did not include taxes.
TJS: Finance experts I spoke to said that, as a consequence of the regulatory rollbacks in the latest relief bill — which allow major banks to hide from the markets the scale of their troubled pandemic-related loan restructuring — even civil servants at the Fed have no clear idea about what's actually going on with banks' balance sheets right now.
[Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo canceled the full shutdown of the L train between Brooklyn and Manhattan.]
Federal prosecutors are recommending that Mary Boone, the veteran art dealer, be sent to prison for as much as three years, saying she deliberately defrauded the government by filing false tax returns and evading $3 million in taxes.
Sahin Boydas, the founder of a remote-work start-up who had lived in San Francisco and its suburbs over the last decade, saw all of that. He looked at his wife and two young children, working and learning from home while crammed into a Cupertino rental that had seen better days. Much of the late summer, the air was full of smoke from wildfires. For days, electricity would go in and out at his house.
Luxury properties on or near the beach typically start at just under $2 million, she said, and can go as high as $20 million, while more modest homes are available farther from the beach, starting at around $200,000 for a small two-bedroom house.
Ms. Boone, who is to be sentenced on Jan. 18, pleaded guilty last year to two counts of filing false returns, a charge that carries a maximum three-year prison sentence. Her lawyers had asked Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan to spare her any prison time, writing that her offenses were the product of depression and anxiety brought on by childhood trauma rather than greed.
More than a dozen Democrats interviewed in recent days said the president's role in inspiring the mob violence had prompted them to change their positions: They now want the Biden Justice Department to investigate the president and his aides. So far, Mr. Biden has not taken a position on impeachment, let alone launching criminal investigations. He has said he would leave any decisions about it to his Justice Department, which he has promised will return to the pre-Trump norm of maintaining independence from the White House. His choice of Merrick B. Garland, a centrist judge, as his nominee for attorney general is another indication of his more measured approach to pursuing investigations and indictments. But interviews with more than 50 current and former Democratic elected officials, Democratic National Committee members and party activists found an overwhelming consensus across the party's ideological spectrum toward holding Mr. Trump personally accountable and launching congressional and Justice Department investigations into him, his family and his top aides — not only for inciting last week's violent mob at the Capitol but for a host of other actions during his presidency. The transgressions they cite include collusion with Russia, tax fraud, illegal pressure on state elections officials, using federal offices for political activity and violation of the constitutional provision that prohibits a president from profiting from foreign governments. Reid J. Epstein and
But changes that Uber made to its contract in 2015 suggest that the company has been aware of the issue and grappling with it since at least that year.
The members of her caucus cracked up, releasing years of frustration, their heads swinging back with joyous laughter. Ms. Stewart-Cousins threw up her hands like a champion, clapped and shouted, Yay!
Here are the highlights of Biden's $1.9 trillion 'American Rescue Plan.' Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:34 - 0:00 transcript Biden Outlines $1.9 Trillion Economic Rescue Package President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a spending package to combat the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. The plan includes $1,400 direct payments to individuals and more generous unemployment benefits. During this pandemic, millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. Millions of Americans never thought they'd be out of work — many of them never even envisioned the idea — are facing eviction, waiting for hours in their cars to feed their families as they drive up to a food bank. A growing chorus of top economists agree that the moment of crisis — in this moment of crisis, with interest rates at historic lows, we cannot afford inaction. Our rescue plan also includes immediate relief to Americans hardest hit and most in need. We will finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in cash relief to people who need it the most. The $600 already appropriated is simply not enough. One in seven households in America, more than one in five Black and Latino households in America, report they don't have enough food to eat. So we're going to extend emergency nutritional assistance for 30 — for 43 million children and their families enrolled in the SNAP program through the rest of this year.
Because it's up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still face. We have what we need to do so. We have everything we need to meet those challenges. After all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most respected nation on earth.
Before Obamacare, some states protected people with pre-existing conditions in this way, but most did not. Americans with prior illnesses like cancer, asthma, even acne, often had trouble buying insurance for themselves and their families. One state that did protect people with pre-existing conditions was New York, where the media executive and presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg currently resides and where Mr. Trump did at the time. (Mr. Bloomberg's recent television advertisements, which attack Mr. Trump's health care record, appear to have prompted the tweets.)
Indeed, New York State leaders kicked off the new legislative session on Wednesday with a singular, once-in-a-generation challenge: how to rescue a state in a pandemic-driven crisis.
Even with the extra three days, however, millions of taxpayers will not file on time — whether because of simple procrastination, or because they are missing crucial forms. Last year, 13 million taxpayers requested extensions, the I.R.S. said.
The tax law overhaul of late 2019 eliminated the home office deduction for employees from 2018 through 2025. Employees who receive a paycheck or a W-2 exclusively from an employer are not eligible for the deduction, even if they are currently working from home, the I.R.S. said. Read more. How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can't include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.
Mr. Ren has a reputation for being blunt in conversation. In 2010, Rick Perry, then the governor of Texas, spoke at the ribbon-cutting for Huawei's new American headquarters in Plano.
A March 25 Arts pages article discussed the survival of the arts in Hays, Kan., despite minimal government support. Although the article presented many necessary sacrifices to sustain arts groups without this support, the article and the online headline implied that the arts can thrive without Washington. We challenge this assumption. The arts can and will persevere, but cannot thrive without federal support.
Major employers, from Walmart to Caterpillar, have tried for years to tackle the high costs and complexity of health care, and have grown increasingly frustrated as Congress has deadlocked over the issue, leaving many of the thorniest issues to private industry. About 151 million Americans get their health insurance from an employer.
Trumpism has already become a lethal Lost Cause. It does not quite have martyrs and a cult of the fallen in which to root its hopes and dreams. But it does have a self-destructive cult leader about to leave power in a defeat that has been transformed into a narrative of betrayal, resistance and a promise of political revitalization.
According to S&P Global Platts, prices for American-made hot-rolled coil steel, the industry benchmark, jumped 41 percent in the first half of 2018 and then fell about 21 percent from that peak in the second half of the year. That trend is likely to continue this year.
This is not just the singular responsibility of the C.E.O., said Reynold Levy, the former president of Lincoln Center and an expert on nonprofits, speaking generally about the Met's culture and recent struggles. The board needs to hold a mirror up to itself and assess its own performance.
President Trump is to sign the Phase 1 trade deal with China in Washington this week. But there's already more trade trouble on the horizon, this time with the European Union. On Tuesday, Europe's new trade chief will meet with American officials in an effort to patch up relations that were strained by a new French tax on American tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon, which do a lot of digital business in France but have managed to keep their physical footprint — and taxes — to a minimum. In retaliation, Mr. Trump threatened punitive tariffs of up to 100 percent on French imports like wine, cheese and handbags. Let's hope they get this straightened out, for all of our sakes.
It might spur more jobs at higher wages.
In other fallout: The P.G.A. of America said it would no longer hold its signature championship at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J.; the social app Parler, popular among conservatives as an alternative to Twitter, went dark this morning after Amazon cut it off from computing services; the payment processor Stripe banned the Trump campaign from using its services; YouTube blocked Steve Bannon's podcast channel; and the debate continues over tech giants' influence over public speech.
Mr. Russo said Mr. Biden would be transparent about his finances if he ran. He will make available his tax returns, financial interests and other information that used to be — and should once again become — commonplace, he said, referring to Mr. Trump's defiance of a four-decade tradition of voluntary disclosure by presidents and many candidates.
Andrew here. I want to speak with you directly this morning, so this may feel a bit more personal than usual.
Other signs that the preparer may not be legitimate include charging a fee based on a percentage of your refund, telling you to take a deduction for an expense you didn't incur and refusing to sign the return.
But which Green New Deal? Mine is focused on innovation. I believe there is only one thing as big as Mother Nature, and that is Father Greed — a.k.a., the market. I am a green capitalist. I think we will only get the scale we need by shaping the market. If I were drafting a Green New Deal platform today, it would put in place steadily rising mileage, manufacturing and emissions standards; stronger building codes; and carbon market prices that would say to our industries and innovators: Here are the goals, here is the level of clean power or efficiency that you have to hit every year — and may the best company win.
A RENOVATED HOUSE IN THE HISTORIC CENTER OF BRUGES
At 101 members, the board is also unusually large, which means decisions tend to be made in committees, the most important of which are the executive and finance committees. Expectations for most everyone else are relatively simple: deep pockets, attendance at five meetings a year and a willingness to let the Met's top executives handle the details.
You are right in identifying the underfunding of teacher pension funds in Puerto Rico as a big problem: Teachers and public employees have fulfilled their commitment to their pensions by contributing year in and year out, yet politicians failed to properly fund them and engaged in risky financial bets that made things only worse.
I had a question this year about logging in a contribution to an individual retirement account for a self-employed person. I was working online on my tablet and chose the option of receiving a telephone call from an expert. I got a message saying I'd hear back within five minutes. A gentleman from TurboTax called within two. He suggested that I return to my desktop computer and search SEP Accounts to find the jump link, which would take me to the place where I should enter the information. That solved my problem.
supportive of progressive policies that would reduce economic inequality at the margins — e.g. shoring up Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, supporting increases in the minimum wage, and so forth — but I'm skeptical that they would be enthusiastic about more dramatic policy proposals that would require large tax increases on high incomes.
Indeed, the populist surge of 2016 is seen by many as a repudiation of the economic policies advocated for decades by global executives at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and by political leaders from both sides of the aisle, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama in the United States, and David Cameron and Tony Blair in Britain.
prepared for the Jan. 6 protest and what it is doing to investigate and hold responsible the domestic terrorists who attacked the Capitol and what it was doing to disrupt future violent plans to attack Washington.
While Vice President Mike Pence previously played down the shutdown's effects amid a roaring economy, White House officials are now cautioning Mr. Trump about the toll it could take on a sustained economic expansion. Mr. Trump, who has hitched his political success to the economy, also faces other economic headwinds, including slowing global growth, a trade war with China and the waning effects of a $1.5 trillion tax cut.
Biking has become increasingly popular in New York City in recent years, with nearly 500,000 bike trips each day.
Until today, I have always been proud to say I am an attorney. I've heard all the lawyer jokes about sleazy lawyers who will say and do anything, tell lies with impunity, to help their clients win. But I always laughed them away with the belief that they depicted a sad but small minority.
Trump's press secretary read a statement 'on behalf of the entire White House' condemning the violence. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:07 - 0:00 transcript McEnany Calls for Full Prosecution for Rioters Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday the Trump administration condemned the violence at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters on Wednesday and called for their prosecution. Let me be clear: The violence we saw yesterday in our nation's capital was appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way. We condemn it, the president and this administration, in the strongest possible terms. It is unacceptable. And those that broke the law should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. What we saw yesterday was a group of violent rioters undermining the legitimate First Amendment rights of the many thousands who came to peacefully have their voices heard in our nation's capital. Those who violently besieged our Capitol are the opposite of everything this administration stands for. The core value of our administration is the idea that all citizens have the right to live in safety, peace and freedom. Those who are working in this building are working to ensure an orderly transition of power. Now it is time for America to unite, to come together, to reject the violence that we have seen. We are one American people under God.
DAVOS, Switzerland — On the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump the candidate denounced what he called the false song of globalism. A year after taking office, President Trump came on Friday to tell the elites at Davos, who composed the song, that maybe they could still perform in harmony.
I will agree to take those tariffs off if we're able to do Phase 2, he said.
The National Labor Relations Act extends a right to strike to American workers — but it specifically does not give that right to government workers. A law passed during President Jimmy Carter's administration bars federal workers from striking. When air traffic controllers walked off the job in 1981, demanding better pay and working conditions, President Ronald Reagan ordered them to return to work. When they did not, he fired them.
If broadened to the federal level, public financing might free candidates from the disproportionate influence of affluent and corporate donors, while allowing much of the money currently geared toward electioneering to be rededicated to movement building.
Airbnb will cancel and block all Washington-area reservations for next week. Airbnb's headquarters in San Francisco. Credit... Gabrielle Lurie/Reuters Airbnb, one of the biggest players in the short-term rental market, will cancel all reservations made in the Washington area next week and block new rentals, the company announced in a statement on Wednesday. The decision came after the police and elected officials warned Americans not to travel to Washington for the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., citing the risk of the spread of the coronavirus and the threat of another attack similar to last week's violent siege at the Capitol. Law enforcement authorities have warned of threats of violence ahead of the inauguration on Jan. 20, and National Guard troops have flooded Washington in response. On Monday, the leaders of the District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland issued a joint statement telling potential visitors not to travel to the area, citing both the coronavirus pandemic and the riot. Already, 16 groups — some of them armed and most of them supporters of President Trump — have registered to stage protests in Washington, though Mayor Muriel Bowser has asked federal officials to cancel any public gathering permits issued. This week, Airbnb said it would review reservations in the Washington area and cancel those it determined were made by members associated with extremist or hate groups. On Wednesday, it said it would take the broader step of canceling all reservations in response to pleas for people not to attend.
In the meantime, if retailers intend to pass along the full cost of the tax to their customers, perhaps those higher prices could be mitigated for lower-income Americans by a tax credit phased out over, say, three years — during which time retailers should be able to find or help establish American suppliers to meet their needs at lower cost.
The price increases that went into effect on Tuesday are likely to be a delicate subject as Qatar prepares to host the men's soccer World Cup in 2022, when a country of 2.6 million people will open its doors to an expected 1.5 million international visitors. Many have wondered how much Qatari society might bend to accommodate guests who view drinking as a central part of the World Cup experience.
Here's what happened: Millions of payments were sent to temporary accounts, which are often set up by companies like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt when they prepare returns. They use the accounts when customers opt to have their preparation fees deducted from their refund, for example, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest.
The actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project's timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.
Earlier this month, two reporters for The Times, Stephanie Saul and Rachel Shorey, reported that
That rift has already surfaced this year, as the governor and other Democrats grapple with the political fallout from a new law that sharply reduced the use of cash bail. The law went into effect on New Year's Day, and since then, concerns over a spate of anti-Semitic incidents and other recent alleged crimes committed by those released have led to calls for changes in the law, including by Mr. Cuomo himself.
Buoyed by their success in rewriting the tax code, the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have now set their sights on helping the financial industry, which has been engaged in a quiet but concerted push to relax many post-crisis rules and regulatory obligations, particularly for thousands of small- and medium-sized banks.
Sam Sifton writes a Times newsletter, his recipes appear on Sundays in The New York Times Magazine and, because he apparently doesn't have enough to do, he is also the editor in charge of all things food related at the Times. He recently noticed that there was growing ferment on Twitter about the new restaurant at Montreal's government-owned casino and asked me to look into it. The product of that request appeared in the Food section this week.
The expert from Sotheby's would later say that, after the appraisal, there had been a spike in prices created by a large influx of Russian buyers eager to obtain old masters and that the painting had been cleaned before being sold.
The squeeze will continue for decades, as Greece is committed to an annual surplus of 3.5 percent through 2022 and will be under strict supervision until it repays its loans by 2060, according to its commitments. This problem is compounded by the enormous growth of private debt. Nearly half the total loans owed to the country's four main banks, or about 86 billion euros, are delinquent or close to it. This prevents them from injecting cash into the economy. Companies that try to borrow abroad face high interest rates.
Complicating matters further is that teams value players differently, and one player might help a certain team far more than another team. A struggling club with a surplus of starting pitchers might trade one to a playoff contender in desperate need of one, in exchange for position players who could improve a struggling lineup. In that case, both teams could, reasonably, be considered to have gained value in the trade, and thus would owe taxes on it.
The legislation will be considered in the Senate under an expedited procedure that precludes a Democratic filibuster and allows passage by a simple majority. But, Republicans say, Democrats will still be able to offer numerous amendments once the bill is on the Senate floor.
About 14.6 million babies were born in China in 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That was a nearly 4 percent fall from the previous year, and the lowest official number of births in China since 1961, the last year of a widespread famine in which millions of people starved to death. That year, only 11.8 million babies were born.
HUD's excuse for promulgating its new rule has been that the modification is required to comply with the 2015 Supreme Court ruling (in Texas v. Inclusive Communities) that upheld the use of disparate impact claims to enforce the Fair Housing Act. But the excuse is patently false. The court's opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is now retired, listed some recent cases in which an analysis of disparate impact was necessary to properly enforce the Fair Housing Act. One, for example, originated in St. Bernard Parish, an almost-all-white county bordering New Orleans. The county came up with one device after another to exclude African-Americans whose homes had been destroyed in Hurricane Katrina and who might try to resettle in the county.
He said that Mr. Trump had misinformed his supporters and stirred their outburst. They will be remembered for their role in this shameful episode in American history, he said of Mr. Trump's supporters. That will be their legacy. Former President George W. Bush, the only living Republican former president, also denounced the actions of those who stormed the Capitol. He did not mention Mr. Trump by name. It is a sickening and heartbreaking sight, Mr. Bush said. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic — not our democratic republic. I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions and our law enforcement. Read more
Also, Connecticut recently adopted new standards for commercial preparers, which will be phased in over several years. The new law aims to protect taxpayers and ensure that income tax preparers are qualified, in light of increased evidence of preparer error, unfair practices and even fraud, according to a statement from Kevin Sullivan, commissioner of the state's Department of Revenue Services.
Trump's supporters are confronting Republicans who voted to certify the election results, demanding answers. Supporters of President Trump prayed for Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, after questioning why he wouldn't vote to object to Electoral College votes from some states. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times In the hours before and after a violent mob urged on by President Trump stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, voters loyal to the president cornered Republican lawmakers who voted to certify the election results, demanding answers and promising revenge. The scenes — sometimes painful, always unresolvable — played out again and again in Washington this week. A distraught constituent accosted Representative Nancy Mace on Tuesday night at a restaurant in the nation's capital. Driven by Mr. Trump's fictitious claims that the election had been stolen from him — and that lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence could clinch him another four years in power during Congress's official electoral count — the voter had come all the way from Ms. Mace's home state of South Carolina to witness it. Now, the voter, shaking and in tears, demanded to know why Ms. Mace, a first-term congresswoman, had refused to join the effort. Calm but firm, Ms. Mace tried to explain that it was not Congress's role to subvert the results of an election — and that to do so would defy the Constitution. It didn't matter what I said, Ms. Mace said in an interview. They didn't believe it.
Shopping habits may be harder to change. As long as people keep buying clothes, books and groceries online, from sites like Amazon.com, bricks-and-mortar retailers may continue to have a hard time, said Mr. Evans of Walker Malloy.
The gender gap in finance looks increasingly like not only an ethical quandary but also a financial blow to millions of households. And its persistence stems from both explicit historical exclusion and a self-selecting process, in which the crowd most attracted to finance's clubby reputation pushes hardest to get in, then feels most at ease once there, perpetuating the reality.
NY Renews, a coalition of 140 environmental, labor and community groups across New York State, has been developing a proposal — likely to be introduced in Albany this year — to invest in job-creating clean energy and resiliency projects for coastal communities, using revenue from a polluter fee.
I really do hope you're enjoying those tax cuts — and those judges, because those judges are really going to be working hard. They're going to be busy throwing these idiots in jail — and by 'idiots' I include the Republicans who let this happen. Like you, Senator Josh Hawley, raising your stupid fist to the mob outside the Capitol. Look at that — it's like 'Black Power' but the opposite. There really should be a name for that. And, obviously, he has to keep his fist closed, because if he opened it, you'd see all the blood on his hands. — STEPHEN COLBERT

Republicans have often worried out loud about the deficit while passing policies that will have the effect of expanding it. For instance, tax cuts that cleared Congress earlier in Mr. Trump's administration were expected to increase the deficit by $1.9 trillion in the decade through 2028, based on a Congressional Budget Office analysis.

California's governor proposes state stimulus checks to augment federal aid. Gov. Gavin Newsom in July. Credit... Pool photo by Hector Amezcua Calling on state lawmakers to fast-track pandemic relief to Californians, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed on Wednesday that the state send $600 checks to an estimated four million low-income families in the state, including undocumented immigrants who file state tax returns. If the Legislature approves the idea, the state payments will roughly equal the federal ones established in the stimulus package Congress approved last month. It provides individual adults with an adjusted gross income of up to $75,000 for 2019 with a $600 payment. There is also a $600 federal payment for each child under 17 in families who meet those requirements. The state money would go to households that qualify for California's earned-income tax credit, meaning that they earn less than $30,000 annually. Some undocumented families and those with mixed immigration status would benefit. The governor's $2.4 billion pandemic relief plan, which also includes an extension of the state's soon-to-expire moratorium on evictions, is among several emergency measures he is proposing to buttress the economy of the state, where small businesses and low-income workers, in particular, have suffered during the pandemic. Mr. Newsom also has proposed speeding up about $1 billion in help for small businesses and $2 billion in spending to help schools reopen sooner for in-person instruction.
The incoming Biden administration will be much more amenable to the idea of a federal bailout of New York, plus there is the likely ascension of Senator Chuck Schumer as majority leader. He's a New Yorker, after all, and from Brooklyn to boot.
A potentially larger challenge in any Democratic effort to reduce inequality is that allied interest groups and individual donors — as progressive as they are — focus on issues that are not necessarily about reducing inequality for the poor and working class. Instead, the emphasis is often on social issues such as abortion and civil rights, or protecting the environment.

It was lawyers from PLMJ who in 2015 prepared a 16-page brief for Ms. dos Santos pointing out the tax advantages of domiciling companies in Malta. Ms. dos Santos subsequently used companies based in Malta for some of her most high-profile transactions. One of her Maltese companies was used as a middleman to hire consultants from firms such as Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey & Company and PwC for advice on overhauling Angola's state oil company, where she served as chairwoman from 2016 to 2017, after being appointed to the post by her father.
Some of the calls for violence during the riot on Wednesday were directed at Mr. Pence, who had made clear to the president that he did not believe he had the power to change the election result, and suggested that the vice president be hanged. Mr. Pence was whisked to a secure location at the Capitol as the rioters broke into the building, but rebuffed attempts by the Secret Service to evacuate him. Asked whether Mr. Trump had a response to his supporters making such a demand, Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said, We strongly condemn all calls to violence, including those against any member of this administration. He did not name Mr. Pence. The president and the vice president have not spoken since Wednesday morning, before the riot unfolded, an administration official said. Maggie Haberman and

As New York's sluggish vaccine distribution continues, de Blasio says 'we want to go further.' New York City police officers are next in line to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Credit... Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times The pool of people eligible for vaccination in New York City in the first phase expanded to include about 25,000 eligible Police Department employees, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday Mr. de Blasio said that the state had approved vaccines for some home care workers, Department of Corrections employees and other city staff members in emergency response or medical roles. He said that he hoped to vaccinate 10,000 Police Department employees by Sunday. All of Phase 1A is now eligible, Mr. de Blasio said, adding, we want to go further. Mr. de Blasio's announcement came after days of pushing the state to expand the group of people who could be vaccinated. New York City only gave the vaccine to about 10,000 people on Tuesday, which was about the same number of doses that the city provided on Monday. The mayor has pledged to accelerate the slow rollout of the vaccine and to deliver 100,000 doses this week, but the city will not likely reach that goal at the current pace. Mr. de Blasio has also pushed for the state to allow people over 75 to receive the vaccine, a group designated in Phase 1B, the next stage of the state's vaccine rollout. In that phase, Gov.
A group of Senate Democrats spent Tuesday evening taking turns on the Senate floor calling on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to bring up the House-passed legislation to reopen the government. The dozen Democrats, led by Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, plan to spotlight the harm from the shutdown on federal workers and those who benefit from government programs.
Bret Stephens: Belated happy new year, Gail. I was hoping we could celebrate the arrival of 2021 by never mentioning Donald Trump's name again, except maybe as a punchline to jokes involving foul-mouthed parrots. But then our friends at The Washington Post broke the news that the president begged and bullied Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, to find him the 11,780 votes he needed to flip the state's 16 electoral votes his way. To his credit, Raffensperger told him to get lost (proof, by the way, that not every Republican official has lost his soul).
A pause is not permanent. The suspensions coincide with the first quarter after a presidential election, which is typically light on fund-raising anyway. Efforts by some companies to pause PAC donations to all lawmakers — those who voted to uphold the election as well as those who sought to overturn it — are raising eyebrows. And companies can still give to dark money groups that don't disclose their donors but often raise far more money than corporate PACs.
The European Union agency said that it needed more information to reach a decision of its own on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and that it expected the developers to share more data in January. The makers of the vaccine have not yet formally submitted a request to the European Union for approval. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech decision in December and the Moderna decision on Wednesday were moved forward by the European Medicines Agency, reflecting the political and economic pressure on developed countries that have multibillion-dollar contracts with the pharmaceutical companies not to be seen as falling behind their peers in mass immunization campaigns. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, will need to formalize the regulator's approval before the Moderna vaccine is rolled out, a process that can take up to two days.
The de Blasio streetcars would travel about 12 miles per hour, with a trip between Greenpoint and Dumbo in Brooklyn lasting around 27 minutes, less than current routes on buses and subways. Barriers could physically separate the streetcars from automobiles along some portion of the route, although officials said those details would be determined later.
I would point very keenly to the level of planning and coordination we've been carrying out for more than nine months, Mr. Murray said, adding that he believed the security measures the Secret Service had planned for the inauguration would have prevented the Capitol attack had they been in place at the time. The Secret Service, which is leading the effort to secure the presidential inauguration, said on Thursday that it would establish a green zone in downtown Washington this weekend, shutting down traffic and train lines as National Guard troops continue to flood into the increasingly militarized city. Most of the streets around the Lincoln Memorial and the scene of the deadly siege of the Capitol would be shut down from Saturday morning until the day after the inauguration. A green zone will also be established in the downtown area, with National Guard troops in place to verify entering residents or business owners. The Memorial bridge connecting Washington to Arlington, Va., will also be closed and multiple train stations in downtown Washington will be temporarily inaccessible, according to the statement. The area around the National Mall on Thursday resembled a city under siege, with multiple military vehicles stationed at intersections and steel fencing erected along streets near the Potomac River. As of Thursday afternoon, there were about 7,000 National Guard members deployed from D.C. and 13 states. About 20,000 overall were expected to be in Washington for the inauguration.
As a general rule, when the government spends money on something, it's better to get something in return. Paying someone to empty trash bins in parks is better than paying that same person to sit at home, while the trash piles up, and then paying more, later, to actually empty the trash.
A moth-eaten curtain, Swiss cheese, the surface of Mars as zoomed back by the Curiosity rover: There is no dearth of resemblances I could invoke for the before, a pimple-dotted landscape that I used to bear with all the piousness of a reluctant martyr.
Scottish farmers are said to have invented curling in the 15th or 16th century, sliding water-worried channel stones over their frozen bogs. The sport appeared in modern form in the first Winter Olympics in 1924 before disappearing from the Games as a medal sport for the next 74 years. Its reappearance in 1998 was more fortuitous: When clouds enveloped the ski slopes of Nagano, Japan, TV stations scrambling for broadcast-worthy content discovered that curling produced solid ratings. The sport's viewership swelled during its subsequent Salt Lake City outing. From semiarid and subtropical armchairs across the land, there arose a common refrain: I could do that.
For federal workers who may need a safety net or financial assistance as they go without pay, Mr. Trump said the safety net is going to be having a strong border, especially because government employees support his wall. (A recent poll of more than 1,400 by Government Executive suggests the opposite: most oppose the shutdown and the wall.)
Now that the House has impeached Trump, what happens next? It is the first time in American history a president has been impeached twice. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Minutes after the House voted to impeach President Trump a second time, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, threw cold water on the prospect of the Senate beginning an impeachment trial before Mr. Biden's inauguration next Wednesday. He endorsed a later start to the proceedings and in effect handed responsibility for the process to Democrats, who will soon control the chamber. Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week, Mr. McConnell said. In light of this reality, I believe it will best serve our nation if Congress and the executive branch spend the next seven days completely focused on facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power to the incoming Biden administration. Here's what we know about what happens next. How does the impeachment process work? After the House has impeached the president — the equivalent of an indictment in a criminal case — members of the Senate consider whether to remove him, holding a trial in which senators act as the jury. The test, as set by the Constitution, is whether the president has committed treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.
Mr. Grossman typically has $20,000 to $25,000 invested in each standardbred horse — which includes a breeding fee of around $7,000 to $10,000 — and looks to sell the horse for around $60,000 after the first year, he said. His highest sale price was $240,000 for a horse he had invested $50,000 in.
Mr. Trump is planning a trip to the border in McAllen, Tex., on Thursday, while Democrats plan to bring up a succession of bills this week to reopen shuttered parts of the government, including the Internal Revenue Service, to allow tax refunds to be paid, and the Agriculture Department, to ensure that food assistance and farmer support payments can be made.
Does pointing out the possibility of incremental progress mean giving up on a truly universal system? No. By all means let's make something more ambitious, such as Medicare for all, a long-term goal. But this goal shouldn't stand in the way of policies that would immediately benefit millions of Americans, and save thousands of lives.
At least 28 cyclists died in New York City last year. That's the highest number in two decades, according to year-end statistics from Mayor de Blasio's administration.
Some analysts see even bigger potential effects: Deutsche Bank estimated on Thursday that in the worst case, the economy could contract in the first quarter because of an extended shutdown.
Two years later, the results are in. The annual federal budget deficit has topped $1 trillion. And it is even more difficult to understand how anyone could make such a claim.
If that provision is dropped, a bill that has already elicited deep misgivings among moderate Republicans — and stiff resistance from Democrats, health care providers and patient advocacy groups — could also generate concern among abortion opponents, as well as conservative lawmakers.
The idea to unmask lies and reveal illegitimate secrets has worked well. Whistle-blowers submitted material that proved corruption of the former Kenyan president, tax-avoidance strategies employed by big European banks, and indiscriminate killings of civilians by an American attack helicopter in Iraq. News outlets, including The Guardian, Der Spiegel and The New York Times, helped Mr. Assange spread the scoops.
There was very little defense of the U.S. system from Americans. The system's complexity can lead to many problems.
TAMPA, Fla. — Faced with the possibility of starting two rookies in their infield, the Yankees brought in some insurance on Tuesday, acquiring utility infielder Brandon Drury from the Arizona Diamondbacks in a three-team trade.

I've never seen a social issue explode like this, said Paul Tudor Jones II, the investor and founder of Just Capital, which ranks companies based on sustainability factors. Every single C.E.O. and board is having to figure out what their carbon footprint is and what they're going to do about it.
The attack, which came just a week after Niger's presidential election, is one of the country's deadliest ever. Prime Minister Brigi Rafini, in remarks broadcast Sunday on national television from a visit to the area of the assaults, put the death toll at 100 but did not say who was responsible, Reuters reported.
One hundred and fifty years after the emergence of the Confederate Lost Cause ideology, a new Lost Cause invaded the U.S. Capitol with the incitement of the president of the United States. Waving American, Confederate, Gadsden and, especially, Trump flags, Donald Trump's loyalists desecrated the greatest symbolic edifice of America.
The company cited the recent reduction in the corporate tax rate as one reason for its increased interest in investing more in the Permian Basin, which straddles West Texas and New Mexico. It is also a logical sequel to its acquisition of 275,000 acres of Permian fields in New Mexico from the Bass family of Fort Worth last year for up to $6.6 billion in stock and cash.
Mayhem, who crafted a cigarette-girl ensemble out of latex gloves and trash bags, leaked tears when she was named the winner of the challenge.

In 2020, as part of efforts to get more people to file for the credit, Code for America teamed up with dozens of VITA programs in 31 states to test a new digital tax preparation service called Get Your Refund. It expects to work with about 100 partners in the upcoming tax season, Ms. Renteria said.
Democratic moderates warn that a leftward tilt in the party's presidential nomination could alienate potential swing voters like Mr. Brady. Some point to Mr. Obama's recent warning that the average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system.

But it would be too easy to call him a bad one. One of the most promising aspects of this series is the attempt one assumes it will make to understand the psychology of this outwardly unfeeling billionaire. Why would the man once called the wealthiest private citizen in the world show no visible sadness at the death of a son? Or refuse to pay a ransom he can easily afford? Why would he install a pay phone at his mansion just to stop guests from freeloading long-distance calls?

The facial-recognition app Clearview sees a spike in use after Capitol attack. Trump supporters during the breach of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. Many of the rioters are being identified through the use of facial recognition technology. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times After the Capitol riot, Clearview AI, a facial-recognition app used by law enforcement, has seen a spike in use, said the company's chief executive, Hoan Ton-That. There was a 26 percent increase of searches over our usual weekday search volume, Mr. Ton-That said. There are ample online photos and videos of rioters, many unmasked, breaching the Capitol. The F.B.I. has posted the faces of dozens of them and has requested assistance identifying them. Local police departments around the country are answering their call. We are poring over whatever images or videos are available from whatever sites we can get our hands on, said Armando Aguilar, assistant chief at the Miami Police Department, who oversees investigations. Two detectives in the department's Real Time Crime Center are using Clearview to try to identify rioters and are sending the potential matches to the F.B.I. 's Joint Terrorism Task Force office in Miami. They made one potential match within their first hour of searching. This is the greatest threat we've faced in my lifetime, Mr. Aguilar said. The peaceful transition of power is foundational to our republic. Traditional facial recognition tools used by law enforcement depend on databases containing government-provided photos, such as driver's license photos and mug shots.

How Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Will stimulus payments be taxed? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction? Probably not, unless you're self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker.
Sales of electric autos were double those from the year before, but they were still dwarfed by their fossil-fuel-powered brethren. With a slew of new models promised for next year and beyond, and with charging station infrastructure still being built out, the tipping point for electric autos is still in the future.
A year ago, in the wake of President Trump's tax cut, euphoric investors pushed the Dow Jones industrial average past 25,000, a record. The Dow had just gained 25 percent in 2017, and the Nasdaq had leapt 28 percent. Volatility was so low that there wasn't a single day in 2017 when the S&P 500 fluctuated more than 2 percent.

The bureau's oversight over labeling has also made the shutdown difficult. From graphic design to alcohol warnings to listing the percentage of alcohol by volume, every new beer must have its label approved before it can be sold nationally. Some states do allow breweries to sell in-state before getting federal label approval.

A federal government shutdown might seem like a great way to save money: When agencies aren't open, they aren't spending tax dollars. But history shows us that closing the government actually costs more than keeping it open.
But the Trump administration has joined the suit and a partisan Republican judge has indeed ruled that the A.C.A. as a whole should be struck down.
• We're listening to The Daily. Our latest episode is about changes to the rules of President Trump's impeachment trial.
Republicans are scrambling to determine the political consequences of doing so, and whether they would pay a steeper political price for breaking with the president or for failing to. Senate Republicans are facing just such a dilemma as they contemplate how to vote in an impeachment trial that could start as early as next week. Both Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the minority whip, voted against impeaching Mr. Trump, though Mr. McCarthy said the president bore responsibility for the siege and deserved a censure. Ms. Cheney, by contrast, had issued a scathing statement the day before the impeachment vote in which she said: There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution. But she chose not to speak during debate on the House floor. Many Democrats — who have long reviled her and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney — quoted her approvingly in their own speeches.
Once candidates are in office, such a program would spare politicians (and their constituents) the indignity of their spending as much as 70 percent of their time asking donors for money, as members of Congress currently do. Those dynamics have a concrete effect: A now infamous 2014 study that analyzed American politics across three decades found that average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence on public policy.
There are few properties in the area that have a carriage house, said one of the listing agents, Dennis J. Plintz, of Sotheby's International Realty Canada. And the lot size is two or three times larger than most other homes in the community.

Jesper Brodin, the chief executive of Ikea, said his company was already feeling the impact. Severe flooding in the United States temporarily closed many of its stores. Energy prices in Sweden skyrocketed during a recent heat wave. Fires in Australia have disrupted business there.
The notion of a head tax isn't unprecedented, even in Seattle. In May 2018, faced with a crisis of homelessness and housing insecurity, the Seattle City Council levied a fee of $275 per employee on corporations whose annual revenues exceed $20 million — the most conspicuous of which is Amazon . (Microsoft is based in nearby Redmond, Wash.) The tax would have raised a modest but useful sum to build affordable housing units and fund social services. But just weeks later, after Amazon hinted that it might leave Seattle altogether, the Council voted overwhelmingly to reverse its decision.

Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, will testify before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday for the first time during the Trump administration. Some congressional Republicans, emboldened by the new president, are likely to see an opportunity to sharpen their long-running attacks on the Fed's performance as a financial regulator. Both Democrats and Republicans will also probably seek Ms. Yellen's blessing for their views on fiscal policy. But the formal reason for her visit is to deliver to Congress a biannual report on the Fed's conduct of monetary policy. Ms. Yellen will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. Binyamin Appelbaum

Here's a brief history of President Trump's record on pre-existing health conditions.
What he's really trying to say is that today's date, March 15, was known to ancient Romans as THE IDES of March, which meant the middle of the month to them.
He also condemned the violence that came shortly after he told his supporters to fight against the election results, falsely claimed that the vote had been stolen from him and said that Vice President Mike Pence could overturn the outcome. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation, Mr. Trump said, reading from a teleprompter. In his opening, Mr. Trump claimed that he immediately deployed the National Guard to expel the intruders, despite accounts from people familiar with the events saying he had resisted those calls and that it was, in fact, Mr. Pence who had ordered the National Guard to deploy. The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy, Mr. Trump said, a day after he had ended a video telling the rioters to go home but ended with, I love you. You do not represent our country, and to those who broke the law, you will pay, he said in the latest video. The video was vital in the sense that Mr. Trump's ardent supporters will only accept his words, not anyone else's, and officials throughout government are concerned about unrest for the next 13 days around the country. But the president has a long history of recording such videos only to undermine his own remarks a short time later. Now tempers must be cooled, and calm restored, he said. We must get on with the business of America. Maggie Haberman and

Mr. Biden has decided that instead of bypassing Mr. Norquist and plucking Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to run the Pentagon until there is a confirmed defense secretary, he will adhere to standard tradition. Under federal law, a confirmed deputy secretary automatically assumes the duties of the secretary during an absence. The decision to keep Mr. Norquist until a defense secretary is confirmed was first reported by Politico. Mr. Kirby, for his part, is a veteran government public affairs officer and a respected figure at the Pentagon. A retired Navy rear admiral, Mr. Kirby made a jump from the Pentagon to the State Department in 2015, and worked closely with Mr. Kerry during the Iran nuclear negotiations and for the last two years of the Obama administration. Mr. Kirby worked with Mr. Austin when they were both on the Joint Staff under Admiral Mullen, during the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He also spent a year as the Pentagon spokesman under Mr. Hagel, and has been the spokesman for the Navy as well as for retired Admiral Mullen when he was chairman.
It sounds corny, I know, said Jacqueline Simon, the director of public policy for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers' union. But federal employees are extremely devoted to the mission of their agencies, she said. They don't just fall into these jobs. They believe in public service; they believe in what they do. They're not just going to walk away. There may come a point when some of them have to, to feed their families, but no one wants to do that.
Will Congress pass ethics changes swiftly after Trump leaves office?
The Justice Dept. says it won't rule out investigating Trump's incitement of rioters. President Trump spoke to a crowd of supporters in Washington on Wednesday before a mob rushed the Capitol. Credit... Pete Marovich for The New York Times The Justice Department said on Thursday that it would not rule out pursuing charges against President Trump for his possible role a day earlier in encouraging a mob of his supporters to march on the Capitol just before thousands stormed the building. We are looking at all actors, not only the people who went into the building, Michael R. Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington, told reporters. Mr. Sherwin was asked whether such targets would include Mr. Trump, who exhorted supporters during a rally near the White House, telling them that they could never take back our country with weakness. Propelled by Mr. Trump's baseless claims of election irregularities, the protesters had gathered to demonstrate against Congress' certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s Electoral College victory and moved on to the Capitol after the president's rally. Mr. Sherwin said that he stood by his statement. We're looking at all actors, he said. If the evidence fits the elements of a crime, they're going to be charged. His comments were an extraordinary invocation of the rule of law against a president who has repeatedly pressured law enforcement officials to advance his personal and political agendas. The Justice Department generally views that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.
Visitors who want an alcoholic beverage have limited options. The authorities confiscate alcohol at Doha Airport, and drinking in public is banned. A few bars in international hotels do serve foreign visitors, selling beers for around 50 riyals.
The BuzzFeed report, published late Thursday, cites two unnamed law enforcement sources, and other news organizations have approached the scoop with varying degrees of caution and have been unable to corroborate it. If the account holds up, it's arguably the clearest evidence yet that Trump obstructed justice, recommending perjury in an effort to cloak his interests in Russia as Mueller investigated that very matter.
This nine-bedroom Victorian Gothic-style home was built around 1880 near the village of St. Asaph, in North Wales. Included in the 6.47-acre property are the original lodge house, built in 1878, and a contemporary three-bedroom gardener's cottage built using old bricks from a wall on the estate. Not included in the asking price, but available for purchase, are a converted barn and additional acreage, said Philip Hoyle, an owner of the estate, known as Plas-yn-Cwm.

Zeltiq may be a safer bet, despite its unusual beginning. It was founded after doctors noticed that children who ate Popsicles tended not to have chubby cheeks. Zeltiq applies this idea to other areas of the body. The treatment fits well with Allergan's other cosmetic surgery assets, such as Botox and Kybella, which reduces chin fat. Zeltiq customers pay out of their own pockets, rather than go through insurers and governments, which demand big discounts for more essential drugs.

Apple joins Google in cutting off Parler, an app that drew Trump supporters. Parler is one of several upstarts that have courted President Trump's supporters with promises of unbiased and free speech social networks. Credit... Kenny Holston for The New York Times Parler, a social network that pitches itself as a free speech alternative to Twitter and Facebook, is suffering from whiplash. Over the past several months, Parler has become one of the fastest-growing apps in the United States. Millions of President Trump's supporters have flocked to it as Facebook and Twitter increasingly cracked down on posts that spread misinformation and incited violence, including muzzling Mr. Trump by removing his accounts this past week. By Saturday morning, Apple listed Parler as the No. 1 free app for its iPhones. But hours later, Apple said it had removed Parler from its App Store. Google had made a similar move a day earlier. The companies both said that Parler had not sufficiently policed the conversation on its app, allowing too many posts that encouraged violence and crime. We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity, Apple said in a statement late Saturday. Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people's safety.

I guess I can understand where the president's coming from. But at the expense of 800,000 people's livelihood? I don't. I think a lot of people just don't realize that the food that's on their table, you know, for the most part is inspected by one or another governmental regulatory agency. And so this really is having an impact on everyone's life, just not on these 800,000 federal employees. Get us back to work. Get us our paycheck, and you guys continue your issues. You know, it shouldn't affect the smaller people in this.

The money-laundering case was not directly related to the Trump Tower meeting. But a federal indictment returned in Manhattan seemed to confirm that Ms. Veselnitskaya had deep ties to senior Russian government officials and rekindled questions about whether the Kremlin tried to use her as an intermediary to Donald J. Trump's campaign.

If the plan had been presented last year as a major change in the lives of those struggling to make ends meet in New York City, the reality, announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, is far less than anticipated: Only 30,000 New Yorkers — those who already receive cash assistance from the city and are employed — will be eligible for the cards starting this month.
What he proposed, however, was nothing so simple as changing the two-consecutive-terms limit set by the Russian Constitution. Mr. Putin doesn't like to tamper with the existing order, which is fully under his control, and the last time he pulled a fast one to prolong his stay in power — the infamous office swap with Dmitri Medvedev — Russians took to the streets in indignation.

Because there is nothing but malice and exorbitant legal fees in the story of the 27-year-old Temur Akhmedov and the divorce of his parents, the Russian billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov and Tatiana Akhmedova. It is a feel-awful yarn for a feel-awful era, offering the unhappy spectacle — livestreamed in December from the Family Division of the High Court of London — of a mother testifying against her son, and vice versa, as she sues him for nearly $100 million in cash and assets.

Right now, the government often does the opposite. Many programs are hidden in the tax code, as Suzanne Mettler of Cornell explained in her book The Submerged State. Upper-middle-class families receive thousands of dollars from the mortgage-interest deduction without thinking of it as a government benefit. Lower-income families sign up for the earned-income tax credit by visiting a tax-preparation company, which can make the benefit appear to come from H&R Block, rather than Uncle Sam.
If you really want to understand what Congress's true priorities are, you look at must-pass legislation — you look at what they give up and what they double down on, said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York and one of her caucus's most outspoken climate advocates. And if you look at must-pass legislation, this Congress is engaged in climate denial.
Income inequality and political polarization have become mutually reinforcing, creating the vicious circle that now manifests itself daily in the erosion of norms around civility and truth telling, the declining trust in political institutions, legislative gridlock and political dysfunction.
There are people who, in the past, would have thought Fifth or Park Avenue was too rich for their blood, but who have seen prices come down, Ms. Larson said. They're getting more bold about making offers in co-ops where they wouldn't have even looked during a seller's market.

The entrance is through a large enclosed porch with a tessellated floor and stained-glass window depicting images from Aesop's Fables. An arched door leads into an airy reception hall that has a fireplace with a timber mantel, a grand oak staircase and an ornate stained-glass window. Many of Plas-yn-Cwm's public rooms — including a sitting room, a drawing room, a dining room and a study on the ground floor — have 14-foot ceilings, as well as architectural details like intricately molded cornices, plasterwork, window seats and wood paneling. All have fireplaces, and the dining room has a glazed bay sitting area.
argues that one of the best ways for the president to pay for ambitious policies and help honest taxpayers is to restore the funding the I.R.S. needs to effectively battle tax cheats. Enrique Krauze writes that Biden, in working with his Mexican counterpart President López Obrador, can promote a moderate approach that might be of great benefit to the U.S.-Mexico relationship and to Mexicans.
Mr. Biden's only salaried work, according to Mr. Russo, is a Penn professorship that occupies about one day a week. Dr. Biden — who is writing one of the three books — earns $99,398 as an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College, state records show. Mr. Biden, who earned $230,700 a year as vice president, receives a hefty federal pension after 44 years of public service. The couple also receive about $66,000 a year in Social Security benefits and in other pension benefits paid to Dr. Biden, according to their last public tax return, from 2015.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, was accosted at Reagan National Airport by supporters of President Trump after he failed to uphold Mr. Trump's false claims of election fraud. Credit Credit... Alex Wong/Getty Images The confrontations — and the scenes of mayhem that unfolded on Wednesday — have brought Republicans face to face with the consequences of their yearslong alliance with Mr. Trump, providing human evidence of the downside of his deep influence on the voters who form their party's base. It helps explain the searing anger that has prompted many Republicans to belatedly turn against Mr. Trump after years of enabling him and seeking his validation. But it also reflects the conundrum in which the Republican Party finds itself, beholden to voters who have internalized the president's falsehoods and been emboldened by his divisive talk.
But assailing the mainstream media could prove tricky for the campaign. A recent Pew study found that 76 percent of Democrats believe journalists act in the public interest; many support what they see as the ferreting out of executive office malfeasance. Mr. Trump, highly unpopular among voters who will choose the Democratic nominee, routinely demonizes the press, labeling it the enemy of the people and attacking individual outlets in strikingly personal terms.
And the law's signature program to encourage businesses to keep people on their payrolls, the Paycheck Protection Program, prevented a collapse in proprietor's income — profits that accrued to owners of businesses and farms. This income rose narrowly, by $29 billion, but would have fallen by $143 billion if not for the P.P.P. and a coronavirus food assistance program.
The deduction for so-called pass-through businesses was a central feature of the sweeping tax-cut legislation that President Trump signed at the end of 2017. The vast majority of American small businesses are organized as pass-throughs, whose profits are divided up among owners and taxed as individual income. Many financial firms and real estate companies — including hundreds that are under the umbrella of the Trump Organization — are also set up as pass-throughs.

A slap in the face, a wake-up call — whatever you want to call it — the people left behind by globalization feel abandoned by the political elite, said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at the research firm IHS Markit.
The Democratic-controlled Senate is likely to accelerate consideration of the new president's political appointees. Nominees who had been expected to run into roadblocks — like Neera Tanden, a scathing critic of Republican senators and Mr. Biden's pick to oversee the Office of Management and Budget — now appear far more likely to be confirmed.
She was the first member of Parliament to announce that she had tested positive for the coronavirus in Canada. About a month after she recovered, she volunteered in a nursing home badly hit by the pandemic as a trained nurse, bathing, changing and administering medication to residents on an infected floor.
I think that, all things considered, there is probably more tension than alignment with this goal. To be sure, donors tend to be more ideological than non-donors, so donors to Democratic candidates and/or the Democratic Party are going to be fairly liberal on average. At the same time, donors, particularly significant donors, are likely to be fairly affluent, and therefore heavily invested in the status quo.
Mr. Ren was born in 1944, in the mountainous southwestern province of Guizhou. His parents were teachers; he was one of seven children. His father, Ren Moxun, was the son of a master ham maker in Zhejiang Province. When he was growing up, Mr. Ren wrote in a 2001 article, the family was so poor that he did not own a proper shirt until after high school.
The result thrusts the country further into political chaos 10 weeks before it is scheduled to leave the bloc, write Stephen Castle and Ellen Barry.
In the short term, the narrowness of Democratic control — a 50-50 Senate, with ties broken by incoming Vice President Kamala Harris, and a slim majority in the House — means that stimulus is more likely than changes to taxes. We consider it unlikely that the new Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, would pursue policies that could stifle the U.S. economic recovery. Given her dovish leaning, her focus will likely be on more stimulus instead, wrote Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank.
Swiss prosecutors have accused Mr. Steinmetz, a mining and real estate magnate, and two others of paying $10 million in bribes to a wife of Lansana Conté, the president of Guinea who died in 2008, to win access to iron ore deposits in the country's Simandou region.

Or to put it a bit more succinctly, when taxing the rich, all we should care about is how much revenue we raise. The optimal tax rate on people with very high incomes is the rate that raises the maximum possible revenue.

One reason for their success: the 2019 turnaround in the financial markets. The end of 2018 seemed to portend a reckoning as investors fretted over the trade war and the Federal Reserve's plans to drain cash from the financial system. But rate cuts by the Fed last year helped markets creep steadily to new highs.
Major new programs are difficult to pass. The struggle to make them happen is almost always divisive. But if you fight that fight and win, then in addition to passing the program, you've also laid groundwork for future political victories. Despite being undermined by the Supreme Court, the Medicaid expansion has found a toehold in American politics, producing a powerful constituency for itself.
BERLIN — David Zwirner, whose namesake art gallery is one of the world's largest, said he was prepared to pay more for space rental at art fairs if the extra money could help smaller galleries take part as well.
One way to avoid that happening is to wait until January of a grandchild's sophomore year to withdraw funds, Mr. Kantrowitz said. Because the federal aid application uses income from the prior two years, waiting will mean that no subsequent year's financial aid eligibility will be affected (assuming the student graduates in four years). The student may have to borrow for the first three semesters. But later, under the new rule, $10,000 from the grandparents' 529 fund can be used to help repay the debt.

British researchers sequence the genome — that is, the complete genetic material in a coronavirus — from up to 10 percent of new positive samples. Even if the U.S. sequenced just one percent of genomes from across the country, or about 2,000 new samples a day, that would shine a bright light on the new variant, as well as other variants that may emerge.
The 9,390-square-foot main house, which has high-pitched roofs, tall chimneys and a turret with a spire and mullioned windows, was held by the family of the original owner, Lucy Victoria Oldfield, until the mid-20th century, when it served as a preparatory school, before being sold to a third owner, said Mr. Hoyle.

The Mi'kmaq of Newfoundland fought for decades to be granted status under the Indian Act, which governs Canada's relations with its indigenous peoples. One band, as individual communities are called, was finally recognized in 1985. Nine remaining Newfoundland bands joined forces and fought the federal government for decades more. They eventually agreed in 2008 to be grouped together as a single band — the Qalipu, which means caribou in Mi'kmaq — with limited rights and no reserve land.
one of the big political advantages that business enjoys is that it is continually able to recruit good players and send them to play every game worth playing in the American political and legal system. And there are a lot of games worth playing. Those games might entail having key language inserted into a piece of legislation as it gets finalized by Congress, or sending a top-notch legal team to Federal District Court when a favorable way of interpreting a particular statutory provision is potentially at stake, or making sure that business views are amply reflected in the EPA's notice-and-comment rule-making process. And those are just some of the games that are being played at the federal level.
This 5,000-square-foot, six-bedroom house has four full bathrooms and two half-baths, as well as many elements typical of the era in which it was built, including high ceilings, carved stone and large bay windows. It was extensively restored by the current owner about 20 years ago, Mr. Montanaro said.

Here's what Trump's cabinet members have said about the storming of the Capitol. What transpired yesterday was tragic and sickening, Chad F. Wolf, the acting homeland security secretary, wrote on Thursday, after the violence at the Capitol. Credit... /EPA, via Shutterstock All but one of President Trump's cabinet secretaries condemned the violent mob that stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday. Some pointed to the president for inciting the violence, and two cabinet members resigned. Here's what they said: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a statement released hours after the melee, said, The storming of the U.S. Capitol today is unacceptable. Lawlessness and rioting — here or around the world — is always unacceptable. Jeffrey A. Rosen, the acting attorney general, called the violence an intolerable attack on a fundamental institution of our democracy in a statement on Wednesday. On Thursday, Mr. Rosen added that law enforcement officials were working to find, arrest and charge those who breached the Capitol. The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that those responsible for this attack on our government and the rule of law face the full consequences of their actions. We will continue to methodically assess evidence, charge crimes and make arrests in the coming days and weeks to ensure that those responsible are held accountable under the law. Christopher C. Miller, the acting defense secretary, wrote in a statement on Thursday that he supported a peaceful transition of power to President-elect Biden on Jan. 20.
Biden picks Gina Raimondo for commerce secretary and Martin Walsh for labor secretary. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has selected Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island for Commerce Secretary. Credit... Gretchen Ertl for The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. picked Gina M. Raimondo, the governor of Rhode Island, as his commerce secretary and Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston as his labor secretary, as he moves to fill key economic positions that are expected to play a significant role in his administration. Mr. Biden also named Isabel Guzman, a small business advocate and former Obama administration official, to run the Small Business Administration. Mr. Walsh, 53, led Boston's powerful Building and Construction Trades Council for two years before winning his race for mayor in 2013 with strong backing from organized labor. He is expected to work on fulfilling Mr. Biden's promise to implement stronger worker protections amid the pandemic and to boost worker pay. It will fall to the next labor secretary to revisit a number of key regulations issued by the department under President Trump, including a rule that makes it harder for employees of contractors and franchises to recover stolen wages from parent companies when their direct employers lack the resources to do so. Ms. Raimondo, a moderate Democrat with a background in the financial industry, has served as governor since 2015.

But those misgivings aside, this mix of budget-busting policies will provide the best test in years of some ideas that have percolated among economists, especially but not exclusively on the left. The former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, originally a George W. Bush nominee, spent years imploring Congress to spend more money in the near term to try to boost growth, to little avail.

Typically, cities and towns first send out a notice of assessment, showing how your home is valued for tax purposes. Property owners then have a certain amount of time to challenge the assessment, though the period varies from state to state and even city to city. Some areas give a two-week window, while others may allow several months. Assessors are generally strict about filing dates, so if you file paperwork late, your appeal may not be heard.
In direct, forceful language, Mr. Biden called the scenes of chaos in the halls of Congress a dark moment in the nation's history, appealed for calm and made clear that he held Mr. Trump accountable for instigating violence that left members of both parties and allies around the world appalled.

Wall Street Journal editorial board urges Trump to resign to avoid second impeachment. The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, normally a supporter of President Trump, wrote that it would best if he stepped down. Credit... Jeenah Moon for The New York Times The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, the American flagship of Rupert Murdoch's newspaper empire, denounced President Trump on Thursday for inciting a mob of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol, declaring his behavior impeachable and encouraging Mr. Trump to resign his office to prevent a second impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House. In an unsigned article titled Donald Trump's Final Days, the Journal's editorial page — a bellwether for the conservative establishment — excoriated the president for an assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election and said this week has probably finished him as a serious political figure. If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign, the Journal wrote, concluding, It is best for everyone, himself included, if he goes away quietly. The Journal's editorial page, led by the editor Paul Gigot, has criticized Mr. Trump in the past, sometimes harshly. But its latest salvo was a striking repudiation of the president by a news outlet controlled by Mr. Murdoch, whose Fox News cable network is home to several of Mr. Trump's most loyal and longstanding media defenders.

One reason the plan was too small was that Obama was trying to gain bipartisan support, rather than using reconciliation to push it through with Democratic votes (which is how Republicans passed the 2017 tax cut).

Citi said it had almost a half-billion dollars less in revenue in the year's fourth quarter than analysts had expected.

By the time Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002, Mr. Trump was not a builder in New York City so much as an entertainer, a brander and a licenser, and so had less business to conduct with Mr. Bloomberg than with two of the previous mayors, Mr. Giuliani and Ed Koch. Mr. Trump had a famously cantankerous relationship with Mr. Koch, but needed support from him and from Mr. Giuliani for his development projects.

The idea behind the tax is pretty simple. Right now, companies can write off the cost of imports, whether they're finished products or parts that are assembled domestically. In my industry — clothing and footwear — 97 percent of what is sold in America is contracted out to mills around the globe, then import the pieces for sale or final assembly here. In a market where consumers demand low-priced, high-quality products, it's nearly impossible to do it any other way; American mills are either outdated or too small, and American production costs are too high.

The formal living room has its original plaster molding, an ornate chandelier and a bay window. There is a fireplace in the dining room and a butler's pantry with built-in cabinets.
Moreover, what will become of the major government agencies of scientific research, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation? Will their research agendas be manipulated to fit Mr. Trump's view of reality? Will there be a continuing erosion of support for basic research as opposed to research that contributes to some commercial product? The greatest advances in medicine were a result of research conducted after World War II, motivated exclusively to enable humankind to better understand nature, not to come up with a new drug.

It's possible, they figured, that vaping might encourage more people to smoke, by providing a new way to try nicotine for the first time. It might also cause people who might have quit to just keep smoking, by providing a second way to get nicotine where smoking is restricted. The natural experiment of the Minnesota tax helped them measure what some overall effects really were.

Éric Drouet, a 33-year-old truck driver from the Paris exurbs who was one of the original organizers of the movement, was arrested Wednesday night in Paris for what the authorities said was organizing an undeclared demonstration. On Thursday, he was released pending a trial.

It is an incredibly exciting time to be in urban transportation, the commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, told a breakfast gathering of powerful New Yorkers, pointing to California's progress.
Jan. 6, 2021, 7:43 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 7:43 p.m. ET Twitter, taking a harder line, locks President Trump's account. Facebook does the same. President Donald Trump's taped message from the White House was removed by Twitter. Credit... Pete Marovich for The New York Times Twitter on Wednesday took the extraordinary step of locking President Trump's account, depriving the president of his favorite means of communication after violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and swarmed the streets of Washington. Twitter took the harder line after removing three of Mr. Trump's tweets, which it said had violated a company policy that forbids using the platform for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. Facebook later said it had assessed two policy violations against Mr. Trump's page, and said it was blocking him from posting on the platform for 24 hours. Twitter said it was acting as a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, D.C. This means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets, the company said on Twitter. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked. The tweets that were removed repeated Mr. Trump's false claims of election fraud and expressed praise and sympathy for those who had forced their way into the Capitol and disrupted Congress's certification of the election results.
Possible post-presidential employment: a new reality game show called Patriot or Pussy.
That said, some top staff members will undoubtedly decamp for a campaign if there is one, several advisers said. Whether all the groups could sustain operations is unclear, given that Mr. Biden could face pressure to suspend fund-raising to avoid improper influence.
Gail: Neither of those options is desirable in any way, shape or form. Let's go for a complicated, messy and nonviolent resolution that doesn't satisfy anybody. And by the way, I noticed that while this administration was going nuts about a political demonstration in Iraq, nobody was saying a thing about the fact that Vladimir Putin is bragging about his new cool weapon that can supposedly carry a nuclear warhead 3,800 miles an hour.
Clearly, this case is headed for the Supreme Court. But Trump doesn't want it heard until after the election.
Tamitude also seems to mean keeping a guarded sense of humor about the resort's humbled state. Take, for instance, the hotel. It has a fancy restaurant, a warm bar and a patio with wide mountain views. But since it's not uncommon for there to be just one or two guests on weeknights, there is a running joke that it feels like the hotel in The Shining.
To put the full power of the nation's chief executive behind such proposals was uniquely Trumpian, but the animating ideas have precedent in Republican politics. In Orange County, Calif., Republicans had already in 1988 stationed uniformed guards outside polling stations when rumors circulated that Democrats were planning to bus aliens to the voting precincts. They carried signs in English and Spanish warning Non-Citizens Can't Vote. Some intimidated immigrant voters by writing down their license plate numbers. Republican nativists warned of the takeover of America. Their greatest fear, according to one prominent Republican activist, was that illegal aliens will stuff the ballot boxes. Mr. Trump's genius was to recognize the opportunity to mobilize such anti-democratic resentments around himself. By articulating a right-wing America First populism already deeply rooted in many circles of the Republican Party, Mr. Trump turned himself into the messiah for MAGA-land. He was an innovator.
David Zwirner, owner of the namesake gallery that is one of the world's largest, indicated that he was having a rethink of his own. Something is wrong with the current system, he said, proposing that he and other large gallerists subsidize smaller ones at art fairs.
The proposed Trump Administration rule throws up many technical roadblocks to filing and pursuing such a complaint, but one new procedural hurdle wouldn't even let the black homeowners get in the door: Before the city would be required to provide a rationale for its failure to keep assessments current, the complainants would have to imagine every conceivable justification that the city might assert, and prove that each was not legitimate, without knowing what actual defense the city might claim or what standard of legitimacy HUD would impose. If the city then came up with a justification that the homeowners hadn't refuted to HUD's satisfaction (for example, that following state law requiring timely reassessments would be too costly), HUD could dismiss the disparate impact action. A process that requires complainants to refute defenses that haven't yet been offered is one that is designed to block civil rights, not protect them.
It was Saturday, Dec. 16, 2017, and 75 degrees outside the LongHorn Steakhouse at the Tampa Premium Outlets. Bernard Skerkowski, an accountant, was running late. When he arrived with his partner, Lisa Wycoff, they ordered the usual, a rum and Diet Coke and a Cosmo. We're not alcoholics, Skerkowski clarified. But once you see these guys, you'll know why we need a drink.
The box of 25 shells cost $5.48, plus tax. Ms. Margolles paid cash. The original receipt is on view next to the image. It will fade during the show's run, as receipts do, but you can take away your own reproduction, enlarged to poster size, from a stack at the gallery entrance. (When I photographed the stack, my phone invited me to scan the QR code for Walmart coupons.)
For a sense of the extent of spending, Jon Lieber and Clayton Allen of the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group suggested looking to the policy preferences of the most moderate Democrat in the Senate and a name you will hear a lot in the coming months: West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin. Increasing direct payments to $2,000 per person and extending unemployment insurance are among the likeliest priorities, they wrote.
The billionaire Mr. Bloomberg, who announced his candidacy in November, has emphasized his background as a self-made business executive. In an early advertisement, he described himself as a middle-class kid who made good. Mr. Patrick, a friend of Mr. Obama's, has positioned himself as someone who wants to bring people together and looks for middle ground.
One reason for the lower price for these racehorses — which pull a buggy and a jockey around a track — is that the winnings aren't as substantial. They're competing in races with prize pools of about $100,000 or less. The Kentucky Derby pool is expected to be around $2 million, with about two-thirds going to the winner.
However, the minutes reflect officials' uncertainty about how big that boost might be, and when it might come, because there is little historical precedent for such fiscal stimulus when unemployment is so low. The minutes also show that policymakers suggested that uncertainty about whether all elements of the tax cuts would be made permanent, or about the implications of higher budget deficits for fiscal sustainability and real interest rates, represented sources of downside risk to the economic outlook.
Our youth, our drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours. But that potential will only be realized if our democracy works. Only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people. Only if all of us, regardless of party affiliation or particular interests help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.
I think it all depends on whether Mr. Trump is, himself, a platform as formidable as some of the platforms he uses. I've spent the last four years thinking about this guy — almost subconsciously — as the ultimate social media influencer. But, occasionally, I wonder if maybe I've had it backward. Yes, Donald Trump is at times the influencer. But does he also behave like the platform?
Though partisanship dominates national discourse, polls show that large majorities remain united in the belief that corruption is the most important issue facing the country. Armed with this knowledge, House Democrats passed a sprawling democracy bill last year that would provide a six-to-one federal match for any donation of $200 or less. These people-powered matching funds could supercharge the democratizing influence on politics that small online donations have already demonstrated in limited doses.
Facebook said the risks were too great to allow the president's posts. Twitter followed suit. The focus shifted to Parler, a favorite app for right-wing figures. Citing posts on Parler that encouraged violence and crime, Apple and Google removed the app from their app stores. Then Amazon stopped hosting it.
The Department of Justice is allowing the damage to continue by greenlighting these two big brewers to extend their duopoly into craft beer by acquiring craft brewers. For example, in December the department approved AB InBev's acquisition of Karbach, one of the largest craft brewers in Texas, a state where AB InBev already controls 52 percent of the beer market. Drinkers buying cute-sounding brands like Goose Island or Terrapin or Ten Barrel are often unaware that these brands, some of them once independent, are now just subsidiaries of AB InBev or Molson Coors, which are not transparent about disclosing their true ownership anywhere on the bottle.
The 2018 election outcome demonstrated that the left has regained momentum and enthusiasm, but the interest group elite — the prime movers of the regressive distribution of income described by Drutman, Grossmann and LaPira — have demonstrated exceptional staying power.
Last year was a turbulent one for the central London real estate market. Increases in so-called stamp taxes on luxury homes, along with Britain's unsettling referendum vote to leave the European Union, sharply reduced the volume of sales. Rising prices have also been a stifling factor. Prices in the prime central London neighborhoods of Kensington and Chelsea, for example, have risen from an average of £810,781 (about $977,000) in January 2008 to £1,379,484 (about $1.66 million) as of last September, said Becky Fatemi, the managing director of Rokstone.

The New York Post names British tabloid deputy as its new top editor. The New York Post is getting a new top editor, News Corp announced Tuesday. Keith Poole, the deputy editor in chief of The Sun, the British tabloid that is also part of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, will become editor in chief of The New York Post Group, which encompasses the print newspaper and related websites. He will start in the new role in March, the company said, as Col Allan, a longtime Murdoch lieutenant, retires. Stephen Lynch, The Post's current editor in chief for print, and Michelle Gotthelf, editor in chief for digital, will report to Mr. Poole. Mr. Allan came out of retirement in 2019 to serve as an adviser to the paper in the lead-up to the presidential election. He had been editor in chief of The Post from 2001 to 2016. He was a driving force behind The Post's reporting in October on emails it said it had obtained from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden and that it sought to link to Joseph R. Biden Jr., then the Democratic presidential candidate. The paper's first article on the emails was published amid newsroom doubts, and its lead writer refused to have a byline. The Post has noticeably shifted its tone on the president in recent months. Previously supportive of President Trump, the conservative tabloid seemed to take a more critical view of him as his downfall became clear.
A slate of new laws that went into effect on Jan. 1 reflect the trials of the previous year, when wildfires, the pandemic and criminal justice reform were top of mind for many Californians.
Those divides have a way of calcifying. The Chartered Financial Analyst Institute — the premier global association for investment professionals — surveyed its members in 2016 and found that 83 percent of women and 80 percent of men chose their career before age 25. Only 18 percent of its members are women.

The president is the chief executive who is going to be a part of solving this problem, said Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, so I must trust him.

More pharmacies will begin distributing doses to high-risk groups, and other vaccine news. The next phase of the U.S. vaccine rollout will expand the number of pharmacies distributing coronavirus vaccines to high-risk groups. Credit... Jeenah Moon for The New York Times As the lagging rollout of coronavirus vaccines begins to pick up its pace in its fourth week, the Trump administration this week will launch a federal program to give out vaccines at pharmacy stores to high-risk groups, including older people and frontline workers, federal health officials said at a news conference on Wednesday. The next big push is to bring those online and make sure the governors have those available really to hopefully expand out to much larger swathes of individuals, said Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services. Some states have already begun using their pharmacies to give out vaccines, mainly to health care workers and older people. The program being activated this week, which was announced in November without a time table for its launch, is a partnership with 19 pharmacy chains and associations, including Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and Costco. States will be able to allocate doses of vaccines directly to these pharmacies, which can then give out the vaccines to high-risk groups designated by each state. Across the country, 40,000 pharmacy locations have enrolled to participate in the program, although in the first days of the program, only a few thousand pharmacies are expected to begin giving out vaccines.
Biden will keep a Trump appointee at the Pentagon until Austin is confirmed, and will name a new spokesman. John F. Kirby, a retired Navy rear admiral, will be the Biden administration's Pentagon spokesman. Credit... Win Mcnamee/Getty Images A low-profile deputy defense secretary will be the lone Trump holdover running the Pentagon until President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s defense secretary pick is confirmed, according to transition officials. Mr. Biden is also planning to install John F. Kirby — the former spokesman for John Kerry when he was secretary of state, Chuck Hagel when he was defense secretary and Mike Mullen when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — as the next Pentagon press secretary. David L. Norquist, who is now the No. 2 civilian at the Pentagon, will be Mr. Biden's first acting defense secretary — if only for a few days — transition officials said Wednesday. The transition team has been pushing to get Mr. Biden's choice for the top post, a retired Army four-star general, Lloyd J. Austin III, confirmed as soon as possible. But unlike the other top national security nominees on the Biden team, Mr. Austin will have to jump through three Congressional hoops before he is confirmed. The Senate and House must approve a waiver for him to serve at the helm of the Pentagon since he has not been retired from military service at least seven years, and then he must be confirmed by the Senate.
A staircase of oak and weathered steel leads from the shop to the second-floor living areas, which have oak floors and exposed wood ceiling beams, most of them restored originals. The original stone walls have been coated with a thin plaster. An open hallway, presently used as an office, connects the dining and living areas, which are lined with windows. The living room has a working fireplace and French doors that lead to a roof terrace and partially sheltered sitting area carved out of the attic of an abutting house. (The property belongs to the same owners, who rent it out to vacationers.)

writes that the right answer to human rights violations is an economic and diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics that would still allow American athletes to participate. Steven Greenhouse writes that if the president wants to follow through on pro-union campaign promises, there are many pro-labor things Mr. Biden can do even without Congress.
It is rare to find an apartment like this directly on the waterfront, said Monica de Champfleury, the managing director of Hammer Draff Great Properties, the Christie's affiliate listing the apartment. The Fontvieille neighborhood is also known for its tranquillity, she said, compared with other parts of Monaco, which is, like most cities, a rather noisy place.
Mr. Phoa said college funds present an unusual asset-allocation challenge in that investors — often parents — are seeking the savings growth that stocks can bring but they typically have only about 15 years to achieve that. That gives them less time to ride out down markets, like the fourth quarter's thumping.
There's no doubt that WikiLeaks, which Mr. Assange founded in 2006, has been a boon for global civil liberties. The problem is that the project is inseparable from the man. Mr. Assange has made little secret about his skepticism toward Western democracy and his willingness to work with autocratic governments like Vladimir V. Putin's Russia. His personal politics undermines WikiLeaks' neutrality — and the noble cause for which WikiLeaks used to stand. What we need is a WikiLeaks without the founder of WikiLeaks.
Students may also have to borrow unexpectedly, say, if generous grandparents mistakenly run afoul of federal student aid rules, Mr. Kantrowitz said. Money saved in a grandparent-owned 529 account does not affect a student's financial aid eligibility while sitting in the account. But once withdrawn, the distribution counts as student income and can reduce the student's eligibility for need-based aid by as much as half of the withdrawal. (Grandparents often own the accounts in their own names so they can meet the requirements for income tax deductions offered by some states for 529 contributions.)
The Affordable Care Act was a large and complex law, with many provisions that have proved controversial. But the protections for people with pre-existing conditions enjoy widespread public support.
Republicans, particularly in the Trump administration, sold the tax law on claims that it would pay for itself — even when economists outside the administration, like the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, released models contradicting them. As corporate tax receipts fell significantly last year, some Republicans began to insist that, in fact, the bill was paying for itself, because total tax revenues were very slightly up.
I started building out different kinds of insurance programs through the Freelancers Union, but it was all under the nonprofit. It became clear that wasn't scalable capital. So now we are starting to really lay the train tracks, like they did in the 1880s, to start to build out this infrastructure and to make it scalable and to recognize that no worker ever knew how to put together their benefits package. There's too much choice. People need to just answer a bunch of questions and get told what's helpful.

The current standard for judging whether a company like CNN is a joint employer was set during the Obama administration and allows a company to be deemed a joint employer even if it exercises only indirect control over workers employed by a contractor, such as requiring the use of software that locks in scheduling practices. The current labor board is widely expected to narrow this standard in the coming weeks, which would make it harder to hold parent companies liable for labor law violations.
Mr. Trump portrays his trade war as an unavoidable confrontation aimed at remedying decades of American victimization in the global marketplace. Pointing at trade deficits as indications that Americans have been ripped off — a contention dismissed by many economists — he has unleashed 25 percent tariffs on imports of steel and 10 percent on aluminum.
For J. Cole, a 33-year-old monastic who is nonetheless one of the most popular rappers of the day, it was maybe a shock to find himself the butt of the joke.

He explained that in addition to helping build U.S. Bank Stadium, the deal also fixed up the Target Center arena and provided funds to operate the convention center. It also spurred Wells Fargo to build two office towers near the stadium and has led to immense development in the Downtown East neighborhood, though the construction mirrors a trend seen across the country and cannot be credited simply to construction of the new stadium.
One possible bright spot: This is the first Fafsa season in which students could begin filing in October (previously, filers had to wait until Jan. 1). Because high schools encouraged seniors to file early, many had already filed their Fafsas before the data tool shut down. As of Feb. 17, high school Fafsa filings had increased by 74 percent compared with the same time last year, said Carrie Warick, director of policy and advocacy at the National College Access Network.
After taking legally allowed deductions for equipment, insurance, travel costs and other operating expenses, Ms. Jeanchaiyaphum reported and paid taxes on a profit of $458.

Cozying up to the president to spare Apple products from tariffs also risks angering Apple's employees in liberal Silicon Valley — even some of its customers.

People are sure to quibble with the economists' calculations, but their general conclusion — that an abundance of new homes would result in lower prices — is not remotely controversial. Many studies, from the McKinsey Global Institute, California's Legislative Analyst's Office and others, have shown that California's high home prices are largely a supply problem: The state doesn't build enough homes.

The federal government ran another record deficit in December. The monthly deficit in December — $140 billion — broke a record set in the 2009 recession, the Treasury Department said. Credit... Patrick Semansky/Associated Press The federal budget deficit was larger last month than in any December in American history, the Treasury Department reported Wednesday, another in a string of record-setting deficits that are a result of the pandemic and the government's efforts to mitigate its damage to the economy. The monthly deficit in December — $140 billion — was more than 10 times the size of the deficit the government ran in the same month a year earlier, and it broke a record set in the 2009 recession. The first three months of the fiscal year 2021, which began in October, have seen the nation run a deficit of nearly $600 billion in total — also a record, Treasury officials said. The fiscal year 2020 deficit was a record-smashing $3.1 trillion. Lawmakers responded to the pandemic-induced recession with trillions of dollars in government spending, including direct aid to individuals and businesses, tax cuts for corporations and increased spending on health efforts to combat the spread of the virus. Late last month, Congress approved an additional $900 billion economic aid package. But little of that money was flowing into the economy by year's end, Treasury officials said, so it did not materially affect December's deficit numbers.
For wealthier clients, Mr. Vanneman advises a strategy of direct indexing, in which they create a portfolio that mirrors an E.T.F. but with fewer stocks. Owning the individual stocks allows investors to benefit from tax losses that can pad their returns by as much as two percentage points.
In 2014, the board ordered CNN to bargain with the unions and provide back pay.

Usually around 6:30 p.m., or sometimes later, Mr. Trump retires upstairs to the residence to recharge, vent and intermittently use Twitter. With his wife, Melania, and young son, Barron, staying in New York, he is almost always by himself, sometimes in the protective presence of his imposing longtime aide and former security chief, Keith Schiller. When Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers, he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home.

For example, a company could not import jeans from Bangladesh or cheese from France into a hub in England and then send it on to a store in Ireland without facing export tariffs.

Mr. Trump is not there yet. Before becoming a presidential candidate, he seemed to have little fixed ideology. But as president, he has operated from the standard-issue Republican playbook, embracing many of the positions of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the party establishment. While he is angry and thirsty for revenge, he seems determined to swallow the loss in hopes of marshaling enough Republican support to pass spending bills, an as-yet unformed tax overhaul and a $1 trillion infrastructure package — legislation that could attract considerable Democratic support but has the potential to split the party.
President Trump plans to unveil a tax cut blueprint on Wednesday that would apply a vastly reduced, 15 percent business tax rate not only to corporations but also to companies that now pay taxes through the personal income tax code — from mom-and-pop businesses to his own real estate empire, according to several people briefed on the proposal.

The global real estate crisis of 2008 affected the housing market throughout Italy, with prices falling by 20 to 30 percent, and Piedmont followed the national trend, brokers said. But after several years of decreasing prices, Piedmont's housing market has begun to stabilize in the past 12 to 18 months, said Eli Anne Langen, owner of the brokerage Case in Piemonte. The region's 2014 designation as a Unesco World Heritage site contributed to that recovery, creating a noted increase in tourism and investor interest, Ms. Langen said.

If an excepted employee refuses to report for work after being ordered to do so, the guidance says, he or she will be considered to be absent without leave (AWOL) and will be subject to any consequences that may follow from being AWOL.
What we're expecting to see: Each of the seven House managers, led by Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, will present different elements of the case in a series of speeches. They will have a chance to make their points without being challenged by either senators or the White House lawyers, who will get their opportunity to make arguments later.

The new law breaks that peace, by limiting like-kind exchanges to real property, which is shorthand for land or other real estate.
Uruguay's housing market peaked around 2010, Ms. Sofio said, and then softened over the next few years, in large part because of economic and political tumult in neighboring Argentina and Brazil.
Bret: If Trump just wired his mouth shut and bandaged his fingers for the next 10 months to keep him from saying or tweeting something awful, he could just ride the economic numbers to victory.
And there's nothing unique about the government's support for solar. According to the Congressional Research Service, total government support for the oil and gas sector over the years dwarfs the amount of support for the solar industry.
And until the last couple of years, it just hasn't been the case that progressives have built up organizations that are federated, said Alex Hertel-Fernandez, a Columbia professor and author of the book State Capture: How Conservative Activists, Big Businesses and Wealthy Donors Reshaped the American States — and the Nation. He argues that, even now, rather than pool resources across states as conservative networks do, liberals in rich blue states tend to send money to single-issue nationally led organizations, like Planned Parenthood or the American Civil Liberties Union.
But in a conference call with analysts, G.E. disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation into the company's handling of its insurance obligations and how it accounted for certain services contracts.

In February, Judge Joseph H. Gale ruled instead that the expert had most likely placed a lowball estimate on that painting and a second work so as to curry favor with the owner, an estate facing a potentially large tax bill, and thus win the business of selling the works at auction.
Or maybe you would work less. After all, if you are happy with your current standard of living, lower taxes would mean that you could maintain it while putting in fewer hours at the office. Who needs that promotion when you're able to keep more of the money you already make?
You have to start with the proposition that everybody has to pay their fair share. Mr. Wyden said in an interview.
And then there's our relationship to the Trump platform, which should feel familiar to tech observers. It arrives unexpectedly and is nothing quite like what came before it. The shiny object becomes a media darling. Since it's a novel experience, the new platform is not taken seriously as a world-changing force. The new platform announces itself with a catchy motto explicitly stating its intentions: Make the world more open and connected, as Facebook declared in its early days; Make America Great Again, as the president declares today. But still we avoid asking the hard question: What would happen if the nascent platform achieves those goals? We don't think too hard about any of it. Even those who don't like it partake in the platform, feeding it our attention. What's the harm? After all, it's free.
On Monday, Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, the department that oversees indigenous affairs, sent letters to applicants and announced the results of the review on its website: Only 18,044, or about one in five, of those who applied had been accepted.
Where sexism permeates a culture, it would be strange if the free-thought movement were entirely free of it. Anonymous hater trolls are contemptible but are not unique to our movement. The free-thought movement as a whole is scrupulous in weeding out sexism and is predicated in part on freeing women from control by misogynistic religions.

A particularly visible contributor to this effort is Mr. Sirota, who even while working as a journalist seemed to delight in trolling the media from inside the house. Accepting the 2015 Izzy Award for special achievement in independent media (it is named for the radical muckraker I.F.

President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to nominate Judge Merrick B.

These heady times at the Capitol have some of New York's liberals pinching themselves.

The reciprocal tax is, simply, what you do to us, we'll do to you, the official said.
The claim that tax cuts don't cost money is a lie that won't die, because proponents of tax cuts have learned that many voters like to hear it. Republicans have steadily insisted for almost four decades that tax cuts are free, even as each new round of tax cuts fails to pay for itself. Mr. Mnuchin and other proponents of the most recent tax cuts were already peddling a delusion when they made the claim in 2017.
This is no solace for people who hate the bill's politics or the way it hits their personal finances. Still, there is potential for decluttering, which leaves us with a pressing question: Just what records should we be keeping and for how long, and what can we safely shred or delete?
But if removing him will not be easy, it's not as unlikely as it may sometimes seem. From the beginning, Trump has been an unusually weak president, as political scientists have pointed out. Although members of Congress have not done nearly enough to constrain him, no other recent president has faced nearly so much public criticism or private disdain from his own party.
Ergo, every American who feels this way has a moral obligation to vote for whoever winds up being the Democratic nominee, even if the nominee turns out to be Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Right?
His ruling came in a case where the estate challenged a determination by the Internal Revenue Service that the paintings had been valued too low.
The $1.5 trillion tax cut that President Trump signed into law late last year, combined with a looming agreement to increase federal spending by hundreds of billions of dollars, would deliver a larger short-term fiscal boost than President Barack Obama and Democrats packed into their $835 billion stimulus package in the Great Recession.
Lots of car news these days. The North American International Auto Show, one of the world's biggest, hits Detroit on Monday; electric cars are expected to be a hot topic. Fiat Chrysler agreed on Wednesday to pay nearly $650 million to settle lawsuits over its use of illegal software on diesel vehicles to produce false results on emissions tests. Tangentially related: The Chrysler building — once New York City's tallest structure — is for sale.
During my tenure as director of the Lincoln Center Festival, from 1994 to 1998, I got to know Harvey better. He felt threatened at first by what he feared would be big Manhattan money outbidding him. But we remained respectful and friendly. It would be unfair to me and Nigel Redden at the festival, or to Jane Moss and her Great Performers and Mostly Mozart and White Light programs, to say we slavishly copied Harvey. But it would be silly to deny BAM's influence on us and on performing arts series nationwide. Here, some of the artists who worked with him pay tribute to his achievement and legacy.
I am very disappointed that this article described the shooting as a Possible Hate Crime instead of calling it a possible terrorist attack. Terrorist attacks by alt-right or white supremacists have consistently been downplayed relative to terrorist attacks by Muslims. Our journalists and politicians need to start treating them as equal evils. If our alt-right government doesn't want to treat this terrorist attack as a terrorist attack, that doesn't mean that the NYTimes should do the same. Jason Dumelie, New York, N.Y.

Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, claimed that the entire White House abhorred the violence that Mr. Trump himself had incited, then walked off without answering any questions. She spoke for two minutes in the White House press briefing room and did not mention the president by name, or his speech that set the violence at the Capitol in motion. All of this unfolded amid the strange silence of a Trump-free Twitter, with the president's account temporarily locked after he tweeted praise for the mob that had ransacked the Capitol, leading to at least four deaths. Mr. Trump returned to Twitter late on Thursday after his suspension lifted and he posted a two-minute video that addressed the violence and acknowledged that a new administration would be sworn in on Jan. 20. Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.
Back then, the court was short-handed after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, and it deadlocked 4 to 4. Now that the court is back at full strength, it will almost certainly resolve the question.

Erin Schaff/The New York Times Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, condemned President Trump on Wednesday night for the breaching of the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, saying that the president bore direct responsibility for the violence that disrupted the counting of electoral votes by Congress. What happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the president of the United States, Mr. Romney said in a statement. Those who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy. Mr. Romney, the lone Republican in the Senate who voted to convict Mr. Trump last year on one of two articles of impeachment, has been the target of verbal attacks by Mr. Trump's supporters in recent days. Videos showed one of the president's followers confronting Mr. Romney before a flight at Salt Lake City International Airport earlier this week. He was later heckled by Mr. Trump's supporters aboard a flight. In his statement, Mr. Romney, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, said that the objections to the counting of Electoral College votes for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. was because of a selfish man's injured pride.
In the 1920s, everyone said labor was dead, and, boy, in the 1930s did they learn that was not true. Things are so cyclical. Just because they don't happen in your lifetime doesn't mean that they're not going to happen.
Mr. Biden, who has promised to get 100 million Covid vaccine shots into the arms of the American people by his 100th day in office, said last week that he intended to release nearly all available coronavirus vaccine vials once he takes office, rather than holding some back as the Trump administration had been doing.
The company sold 771,323 cars and light trucks in the final three months of last year in what it described as its strongest fourth quarter since 2007. We look forward to an inflection point for the U.S. economy in spring, G.M. 's chief economist, Elaine Buckberg, said in a statement. Widening vaccination rates and warmer weather should enable consumers and businesses to return to a more normal range of activities, lifting the job market, consumer sentiment and auto demand. Most other automakers are expected to report 2020 sales totals later on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, Toyota Motor said it sold 2.1 million cars and light trucks in the United States last year, 11 percent less than in 2019. In December, however, its sales jumped more than 20 percent, lifted by strong demand for sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks.

The revised estimates from the Council of Economic Advisers show that the shutdown, now in its fourth week, is beginning to have real economic consequences. The analysis, and other projections from outside the White House, suggests that the shutdown has already weighed significantly on growth and could ultimately push the United States economy into a contraction.
The deficit grew by 17 percent from 2018 to 2019, the Treasury data shows. That was a slowdown from the 28 percent growth in 2018, the first year President Trump's signature tax cuts were in full effect. Last year's deficit would have been even larger if not for a series of interest-rate cuts undertaken in 2019 by the Federal Reserve, which helped to push the cost of new government debt down.
The mayor also said that the city would open two mass vaccination sites that will operate seven days a week, day and night, in Brooklyn and the Bronx on Sunday. Dr. Chokshi said the city was pulling out all the stops to open new vaccination sites and speed up the process. The city opened 25 sites so far this week, he said. The positive test rate in the city also continued to climb to a seven-day average of 9.25 percent, the mayor said. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo continued to raise concerns about the pace of vaccination and need to keep the virus in check. A man in his 60s became the state's first confirmed case of a more contagious variant of the virus, which was initially found in the United Kingdom. Mr. Cuomo said that public health officials had discovered that the man had been in contact with an individual who had traveled to the United Kingdom, though he did not offer additional details. Mr. Cuomo said he had sent a letter to U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Wednesday, asking that all travelers flying into state airports from abroad provide proof that they were tested for the virus before leaving the airport. We don't want tens of thousands of people coming to our airports everyday from countries around the world who were not tested, Mr. Cuomo said. Daniel E. Slotnik, Troy Closson and
The national gasoline tax used to support the Highway Trust Fund was last raised to 18.4 cents in 1993. Taking action years ago to raise this tax by only pennies per gallon would have resulted in a robust Highway Trust Fund today.
Barr says Trump's incitement of the mob betrayed his office. Former Attorney General William Barr in September. Credit... Oliver Contreras for The New York Times Former Attorney General William P. Barr said Thursday that President Trump betrayed his office by encouraging a mob of supporters to intimidate Congress into overturning the election results by storming the Capitol, joining former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in blaming Mr. Trump for the violence. Mr. Barr, who stepped down from office last month under pressure from Mr. Trump, said in a statement to The Associated Press that the president's conduct betrayed his office and supporters and that orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable. Mr. Barr was widely seen as the cabinet member who did the most to advance the president's political agenda, and the statement was unusually strong given Mr. Barr's praise for the president in his departure letter even as Mr. Trump pressured the Justice Department to help his effort to overturn the election results. Immediately after a violent mob of Mr. Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, Mr. Mattis was among the first former cabinet officials to directly blame Mr. Trump, calling the attack an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule that was fomented by Mr. Trump. Former Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and retired Gen. Joseph Dunford, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Mr. Trump, also criticized the politicians who had supported Mr. Trump's claims and spread false information about the election.
Catch up: Nordstrom sales drop 22 percent; Dollar General offers workers a vaccine incentive. Nordstrom reported a net sales decline of 22 percent in the nine weeks ended Jan. 2 as retailers that specialize in apparel and accessories continued to face a challenging environment. The company appeared to take a blow from a decline in physical foot traffic, as digital sales accounted for 54 percent of overall sales in the period, up from 34 percent last year.
Recent polling by The New York Times/Siena College found that in Pennsylvania and five other battleground states, nearly two-thirds of voters with a similar pattern — supporting Mr. Trump in 2016 and a Democrat in the midterms — said they intended to back the president.
Changes in the American museum world in the last three years have been greater than at any time, I would say, certainly over my 30 years in the field, said Ann Temkin, chief curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday the Trump administration condemned the violence at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters on Wednesday and called for their prosecution. Credit Credit... Pete Marovich for The New York Times Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, read a statement to reporters on Thursday on behalf of the entire White House condemning the violence by Trump supporters at the Capitol complex a day earlier in the strongest possible terms. Those who violently besieged our Capitol are the opposite of everything this administration stands for, she said, though she made no mention of President Trump or his speech that set the violence in motion. The president's silence on the violent mob stretched to nearly 24 hours as Ms. McEnany spoke for two minutes, then immediately left the White House's press briefing room without questions from reporters. She called for full prosecution of those who breached the Capitol. What we saw yesterday was a group of violent rioters undermining the legitimate First Amendment rights of Trump supporters who had gathered by the National Mall to protest the results of the election, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly declared was stolen from him.
Corporate PACs aren't the only groups under scrutiny. The Republican Attorneys General Association is taking heat following reports that a fund-raising arm, the Rule of Law Defense Fund, urged people to march on the Capitol. Several companies told DealBook that they were reviewing their support of the group, though none said they planned to cut ties. (Most noted that they supported attorneys general from both parties, an issue Andrew addressed in a column last year.) A representative for the association said that it and the Rule of Law Defense Fund had no involvement in the planning, sponsoring or the organization of Wednesday's event.
While millions of Americans have lost their jobs during the pandemic, consumer spending on goods went up 7.2 percent from January to September, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. And some of that spending includes items people now regret. Some were meeting basic needs, from canned corn to houses. Others took advantage of big sales to buy clothes they won't wear this year. And still others bought goods from gadgets to boats they thought would keep them entertained, but are now sitting unused.

Still, Dr. Bessel acknowledged, there comes a point when resources can be stretched no thinner and more drastic measures, such as rationing care, might have to be considered. Campbell Robertson and
Aside from being a look at the highly competitive world of restaurants, the story raises questions about the highly uncompetitive world of government agencies that hold monopolies.

Mr. Ellis told New Hampshire Public Radio that he opposed the violence. At a regular meeting of the selectmen on Thursday night, Mr. Thackston said Troy residents and many outsiders had called for Mr. Ellis to be dismissed. He said that while the events at the Capitol were appalling, everybody has the right to participate in political events without fear of being fired. So, Dave Ellis in my book is just fine, Mr. Thackston added. And the rest of the world needs to go about and mind its own damn business.
How Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Will stimulus payments be taxed? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction?

In that case, however, why do we care how hard the rich work? If a rich man works an extra hour, adding $1000 to the economy, but gets paid $1000 for his efforts, the combined income of everyone else doesn't change, does it? Ah, but it does — because he pays taxes on that extra $1000. So the social benefit from getting high-income individuals to work a bit harder is the tax revenue generated by that extra effort — and conversely the cost of their working less is the reduction in the taxes they pay.
Any discussion like this has to begin with the Internal Revenue Service, because some of what you keep lives in storage only to satisfy an auditor who may one day ask after it.

But Clearview, which is used by over 2,400 law enforcement agencies, according to the company, relies instead on a database of more than 3 billion photos collected from social media networks and other public websites. When an officer runs a search, the app provides links to sites on the web where the person's face has appeared. In part because of its effectiveness, Clearview has become controversial. After The New York Times revealed its existence and widespread use last year, lawmakers and social media companies tried to curtail its operations, fearing that its facial-recognition capabilities could pave the way for a dystopian future. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the Oxford Police Department in Alabama is also using Clearview to identify Capitol riot suspects and is sending information to the F.B.I. Neither the Oxford Police Department nor the F.B.I. has responded to requests for comment. Facial recognition is not a perfect tool. Law enforcement says that it uses facial recognition only as a clue in an investigation and would not charge someone based on that alone, though that has happened in the past. When asked if Clearview had performed any searches itself, Mr. Ton-That demurred. Some people think we should be, but that's really not our job. We're a technology company and provider, he said. We're not vigilantes.
Old autocrats rarely resign, nor do they just fade away. So when Vladimir Putin slipped proposals for a few changes to the Russian Constitution into his annual state-of-the-nation talkathon last Wednesday, followed immediately by the resignation of the entire government, the presumption was that the president, who is 67, was laying the groundwork to extend his 20-year reign past the expiration of his current term in 2024.

When a Sotheby's official appraised a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Younger in 2005, he set its value at $500,000. But when the owner of the 17th-century work, St. George's Kermis With the Dance Around the Maypole, sold it at a Sotheby's auction in 2009, it drew more than four times that amount, or $2.1 million.

Public schools rely on government funding to keep the doors open and classes in session. But tuition paid by students doesn't come close to covering the cost of public colleges and universities, which educate 80 percent of undergraduates. Taxpayers have always footed much of that bill.
What Mr. Deneen identifies as liberal societies' pervasive amnesia about the past has further undermined the traditional culture of collecting. Salvator Mundi might have achieved a one-off, landmark price (in an auction of contemporary art), but generally old masters are now far less fashionable with the superrich than they were in the days of the Czar of Russia. On Feb. 1, Sotheby's annual evening sale of master paintings in New York raised $48.4 million, a seemingly substantial total, until one recalls that the company's biannual evening auction of contemporary art in November raised $310.2 million.

In the six seasons it ran from 2009 to 2012, Jersey Shore was a genuine phenomenon, drawing up to 9 million viewers an episode, giving MTV much-needed cachet and making unlikely cultural icons of its proudly unrefined leads.
When he announced his retirement as the president and executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1998, I argued in The Times that Harvey Lichtenstein had been the most innovative, influential performing arts administrator in New York history.

One person familiar with the spending of a major advertising holding company estimated the price tag of its presence at Cannes to be more than $15 million each year, including awards entry fees and production expenses. Last year, Cannes Lions featured a series of video presentations, and other major events popular with the marketing community, such as South by Southwest and the Consumer Electronics Show, have announced virtual settings this year. And several agency executives have voiced interest in continuing the virtual format of the upfronts, an annual courtship ritual between media companies and advertisers that usually sprawls across landmark New York locations.

A new Labor Department rule would classify gig workers as contractors. Construction is among the industries that may be affected by a Labor Department rule on criteria for employee status. Credit... James Tensuan for The New York Times The Labor Department on Wednesday released the final version of a rule that could classify millions of workers in industries like construction, cleaning and the gig economy as contractors rather than employees, another step under the Trump administration toward endorsing the business practices of companies like Uber and Lyft. Companies don't have to pay contractors a minimum wage or overtime and don't have to pay a share of contractors' Social Security taxes or contribute to unemployment insurance on their behalf. By contrast, companies that hire employees must provide them with those benefits and protections, which can raise labor costs 20 to 30 percent, according to estimates from industry officials. This rule brings long-needed clarity for American workers and employers, the labor secretary, Eugene Scalia, said in a statement, adding that the rule makes it easier to identify legitimate employees while recognizing and respecting the entrepreneurial spirit of workers who choose to pursue the freedom associated with being an independent contractor. The rule is scheduled to take effect on March 8, which will allow the incoming Biden administration to postpone it and perhaps set it aside.

That appeared to address the problem that Uber admitted to last week: computing a commission on a tax-inclusive fare. But whatever legal cover that might have provided, the company did not change its practices until now, continuing to base its commission on the full fare while telling passengers it included tax. (The company continued to remit the tax revenue to the state.)
Official numbers released on Monday show an economy that is posting new, but manageable, lows. For the last three months of 2018, growth came in at 6.4 percent compared with a year earlier. That's the slowest pace since a decade ago, when China was grappling with the global financial crisis.
After a short while, the couple headed south to Ohio's Appalachian region. There, the lieutenant said, they spent several years bopping around as Bill and Donna Richards, hitting swap meets, yard sales and flea markets as they tried to eke out a meager existence.
Property tax experts suggest taking some basic steps to check the accuracy of your property's valuation. If you added on to your house, your tax bill will probably be higher. But if the assessment shows that your home has four bathrooms, and you know it has two and a half, that's an error that should be corrected. You may be able to have the mistake fixed with a simple phone call to the assessor's office, depending on the department's workload.
It was not the first time. During the 2008 oil price crash, the deputy prime minister at the time, Igor I. Sechin, spoke of creating a national oil reserve, to squirrel away Russian oil and help lift global prices. His government, meanwhile, lowered two key taxes — the mineral extraction tax and export tariff — creating an incentive for Russian oil companies to export more oil.

Since the 1970s, Democrats and Republicans have sorted themselves by party, with less room for internal dissent and less of a will to criticize or challenge a president from one's own party. Both parties have been willing to grant the president more authority when it served their purpose. The main dynamic for Democrats has centered around party leaders supporting presidents who use executive action, through regulatory orders and rule making, to deal with urgent policy problems that congressional Republicans oppose. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton turned to executive power to deal with energy and climate change when Congress refused to do so. President Barack Obama did the same on immigration after congressional obstruction prevented compromise legislation from passing.

Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, celebrated the company's new factory in Shanghai by dancing onstage — badly — in front of a cheering crowd. (The internet was less impressed.) Known as the Gigafactory 3, the plant is Tesla's first outside the United States and will produce its Model 3 sedan and, eventually, the Model Y sport utility vehicle. It also helps Tesla tap into the Chinese market without paying tariffs caused by trade rifts with the United States. The company's stock price mirrored Mr. Musk's enthusiasm, rocketing past the combined market values of General Motors and Ford on Thursday for the first time.

A SIX-BEDROOM VICTORIAN HOUSE IN MONTREAL
Indoors: The sellers, who are the second owners, bought the house in 2009 and made substantial changes. They installed central air-conditioning, opened the second-floor stairwell and landing (which required some structural engineering to remove a load-bearing wall) and updated the kitchen and bathrooms. They also replaced windows, added period-appropriate crown moldings and other millwork and wired several first-floor rooms for sound.
As I wrote in my 2007 column: To spark a Green New Deal today requires getting two things right: government regulations and prices. Look at California. By setting steadily higher standards for the energy efficiency of buildings and appliances — and creating incentives for utilities to work with consumers to use less power — California has held its per-capita electricity use constant for 30 years, while the rest of the nation has seen per-capita electricity use increase by nearly 50 percent, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. That has saved California from building 24 giant power plants.
But because Mr. Bloomberg entered the race so late — in November, months after his leading rivals — he is still eligible for disclosure extensions deep into the primary calendar. And if Mr. Bloomberg were to drop out of the race before March 20 — say, after a disappointing showing on Super Tuesday — he could exit without making any financial disclosures of his fortune, which is worth an estimated $50 billion.
In August 2016, apparently just before Mr. Manafort was fired from the Trump campaign, he and Mr. Kilimnik met to discuss a plan for Ukraine that seemed to further Russia's interests. They also met several times afterward, including once in Madrid in early 2017. In an interview in February 2017 in Kiev, Ukraine's capital, Mr. Kilimnik suggested the plan would have involved reviving the political fortunes of Mr. Yanukovych, the ousted Ukrainian leader.
One option being considered, according to a person close to Mr. Trump, was having Mr. Pence acknowledge the president's claims about election fraud in some form during one or more of the Senate debates about the results from particular states before the certification. Mr. Pence will preside over those debates.
The result, Vacant New York, which he introduced in September, is more a snapshot in time than a dynamic database. But its findings have led him to a meeting with city officials, he said, as well as talks with a real estate brokerage.

The progressive billionaires — Oprah Winfrey, Warren Buffett — are a different breed of fat cat. Mr. Buffett, the third-richest man in the world, has been saying Tax me more for years — or at least, Tax me at the same rate as my secretary. Like Bill Gates, who is the second-richest man in the world, he has pledged to give away the bulk of his fortune.
The sewer system, covering parts of the towns of Islip and Babylon, was eventually built. But the project, which started coming on line in 1981, became so mired in corruption, delays and cost overruns that it spooked future elected officials.
Prosecutors said the director, Michael Gyure, failed to report roughly $433,000 in compensation between 2012 and 2016. That included reimbursements and payments he used for personal expenses including wine, international travel for himself and family members, clothing and groceries.
Here's what you need to know:
The unemployment rate may not have fallen further, but 4.1 percent is a comfortably low level, and it may well be that future improvement in the job market will show up in the form of a rising labor force rather than shrinking unemployment. One plausible path for the job market would be for the jobless rate to stay roughly where it is while people who previously weren't even looking for a job decide to seek work — and find it quickly.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. has no robust national program to track the new virus variant, experts warn. A testing site in San Diego on Saturday. The United States does not have a nationwide program in place to track variations of the coronavirus. Credit... Ariana Drehsler for The New York Times With no robust system to identify genetic variations of the coronavirus, experts warn that the United States is woefully ill-equipped to track a dangerous new mutant, leaving health officials blind as they try to combat the grave threat. The variant, which is now surging in Britain and burdening its hospitals with new cases, is rare for now in the United States. But it has the potential to explode in the next few weeks, putting new pressures on American hospitals, some of which are already near the breaking point. The United States has no large-scale, nationwide system for checking coronavirus genomes for new mutations, including the ones carried by the new variant. About 1.4 million people test positive for the virus each week, but researchers are only doing genome sequencing — a method that can definitively spot the new variant — on fewer than 3,000 of those weekly samples. And that work is done by a patchwork of academic, state and commercial laboratories. Scientists say that a national surveillance program would be able to determine just how widespread the new variant is and help contain emerging hot spots, extending the crucial window of time in which vulnerable people across the country could get vaccinated.
With a recently enacted $900 billion relief package that includes an extension of federal unemployment benefits, most of the jobless can at least look forward to more financial help.

Ford's sales fell 15 percent in 2020 because of the pandemic and model changes. Ford's sales of F-series trucks — including the F-150 and larger versions — fell 12 percent last year. Credit... Nic Antaya/Getty Images Ford Motor Company said on Wednesday that it sold about two million cars and light trucks last year, a decline of 15 percent from 2019, roughly in line with the broader auto industry. The coronavirus pandemic sharply slowed sales for automakers as people stayed away from dealerships and companies were forced to shut down factories for nearly two months last spring. Ford's sales were also affected by company's decision to phase out most sedans, including the Fusion and Fiesta, from its U.S. lineup. Ford said sales in the fourth quarter fell 10 percent. Cars made up just 7 percent of total sales; the rest were trucks and sport-utility vehicles. The company said its shift to focus on larger vehicles is paying off. Sales of sport utility vehicles, which generate much more profit for automakers than sedans, rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, Ford began selling a redesigned version of its F-150 pickup truck, which has long been the top selling vehicle in the United States. The transition to the new model caused a temporary shortage of pickups that slowed sales. Ford's sales of F-series trucks — including the F-150 and larger versions — fell 12 percent in 2020.

As longtime party leaders, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. McConnell have history with each other, much of it not good given their divergent ideologies. Ms. Pelosi was a harsh critic of the 2017 tax law that Mr. McConnell championed. They have also clashed bitterly over the Affordable Care Act and the economic stimulus program enacted by Democrats under Ms. Pelosi's stewardship during the first years of President Barack Obama's administration despite Mr. McConnell rallying his party in near blanket opposition to the Democratic agenda.

Trump has not lowered flags in honor of an officer who died from injuries sustained amid the riot. Capitol Police officers lowered the flag at the Capitol to half-staff on Friday in honor of a fellow officer who died from wounds after being attacked by a mob of Trump supporters. Credit... Todd Heisler/The New York Times President Trump has not ordered the flags on federal buildings to fly at half-staff in honor of Brian D. Sicknick, a police officer who was killed after trying to fend off pro-Trump loyalists during the siege at the Capitol on Wednesday. While the flags at the Capitol have been lowered, Mr. Trump has not issued a similar order for federal buildings under his control. A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Sicknick, 42, an officer for the Capitol Police, died on Thursday from brain injuries he sustained after Trump loyalists who overtook the complex struck him in the head with a fire extinguisher, according to two law enforcement officials. Hours earlier, addressing supporters at a rally steps from the White House, Mr. Trump denounced the 2020 election as stolen from him and instructed them to march peacefully to the Capitol while also repeatedly noting that his side needed to fight. Mr. Trump has not reached out to Mr. Sicknick's family, although Vice President Mike Pence called to offer condolences, an aide to Mr. Pence said.
Aides confer in the dark because they cannot figure out how to operate the light switches in the cabinet room. Visitors conclude their meetings and then wander around, testing doorknobs until finding one that leads to an exit. In a darkened, mostly empty West Wing, Mr. Trump's provocative chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, finishes another 16-hour day planning new lines of attack.

In addition, as a so-called interpretive rule, it does not have the same legal force as a regulation, and it applies only to the laws that the Labor Department enforces, such as the federal minimum wage and overtime. States and other agencies, like the Internal Revenue Service, may come to different conclusions about who has employee status. But the rule could still have a substantial impact because employers often base their labor practices on the department's approach. Determinations of employee status typically hinge on several factors, but the department's rule elevates two: how much control an employer exerts over the worker, and the extent to which a worker can increase his or her hourly income through entrepreneurial savvy rather than earning a set wage. Critics have argued that there is no legal basis for elevating these two factors above others, such as the degree of skill involved in the work or whether the work is indefinite or temporary, and that the approach will deny employee status to many who deserve it.
As in the past, I found Block's explanations the clearest; that's where Block's long history in the tax-return preparation business — it also runs a chain of about 12,000 retail outlets — shines through. The guidance prompted me to include legal expenses I'd incurred to incorporate in 2016. I'd neglected to log those into TurboTax. Once, it even managed to amuse me, warning against trying to deduct expenses for a facility, like a yacht or hunting lodge, that's mainly recreational. Do people with yachts do their own taxes?
And will Biden be able to enact the coronavirus policies he favors?
Where the D'Alesandros saw the downtrodden and immigrants as people to weave into the American dream, the Trumps saw suckers to squeeze.
Although the union and Mr. Beutner agreed that the state should spend more on public schools, they are locked in a bitter fight over how the district should use the money it already has — and cannot agree on how much that is.
Well, unearned arrogance is a Trump administration hallmark — witness Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, claiming that a respected national security reporter couldn't find Ukraine on a map. So it may not surprise you to learn that Mnuchin was talking nonsense and that Thunberg almost certainly has it right.
I think he did a lot — he met with dozens and dozens of members and made a lot of accommodations — but in the end, there's a group of people in this party who just won't say yes, Mr. Cole said. At some point, I think that means looking beyond our conference. The president is a deal maker, and Ronald Reagan cut some of his most important deals with Democrats.
Enough of the hate. Enough of the total dysfunction. Just, enough. Representative Steve Stivers, Republican of Ohio, said that he also supported stripping Mr. Trump of his powers through the 25th Amendment. He did not rule out supporting impeachment but argued that Congress could not remove the president through the impeachment process in the time remaining in Mr. Trump's term. The cabinet decides on the 25th Amendment, and if the cabinet decided to do that, I would not oppose it, Mr. Stivers, a former chairman of the House Republican campaign arm, said in a television appearance. I do not believe that an impeachment can happen in 13 days.
[More people are dying on New York City's streets. What went wrong?]
The union has pointed to a nearly $2 billion reserve, which it says could be used to pay for more educators so that class sizes are significantly smaller and that all schools have full-time nurses, counselors and mental health professionals. But Mr. Beutner has said the district is already spending far more than it brings in. A state-appointed fact-finder supported both claims, and both sides have pointed to the report to bolster their arguments.

Mr. Bloomberg's transactionalism — and interest in winning whatever contest he is part of — also has echoes of Mr. Trump's approach.
You can think of some of the interventions as variations on the theme when you know better, you do better. These include: Highlighting the moral implications of fossil fuels, strengthening climate education and engagement, and disclosing information on greenhouse gas emissions.
In the late 1970s, the United Aut­­­­­omobile Workers union had a brazen idea. During negotiations for a new contract, members asked Chrysler to give workers representation on its board, a practice called co-determination that had been germinating all over Europe.
PARIS — The French police have arrested a prominent leader of the Yellow Vest movement for a second time, in a clear sign that the government is following through on a pledge to crack down on the protests that have shaken France for much of the past six weeks.

This would increase safety from both extremists and infection, lower anxiety (not to mention costs) and present a picture to the world that we take violence seriously and that protection of our people is our priority. We don't have to prove anything with displays of grandeur.
But despite the best-laid plans, families — especially those with multiple children attending college — may find themselves with both leftover 529 funds and student loans, said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Savingforcollege.com. He recently discussed strategies for using 529 funds to pay student debt.
Among the more than 30 business owners, professionals and employees interviewed in the two counties, many said their votes were still up for grabs. But Medicare for all, free public college tuition and other left-leaning proposals championed by candidates like Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont aroused more skepticism than enthusiasm.
Having been stung by bad news in the city's subways during 2017's so-called summer of hell, a phrase coined by the governor, Mr. Cuomo is proposing an action plan of $254 million for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. This would be money taken from financial settlements and the accelerated transfer of funds from a tiny payroll tax paid in the 12-county M.T.A. service area.
In the hours and days after a mob of President Trump's loyalists stormed the Capitol, the nation's biggest tech companies began to shut down accounts that helped incite the rampage. In the days and weeks before the attack, President Trump had used his Twitter feed and Facebook page to spread the lie that he had won the November election. It was that falsehood that helped drive the mob to the Capitol last Wednesday after a speech by the president.
The $20 billion national vaccine program he announced envisions nationwide community vaccination centers.
The Davos forum, marking its 50th year, has always sought to foster a sense of multilateral unity. But Mr. Trump, along with his counterpart in Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, is seemingly moving the world into a tariff based, decoupled universe, based on bilateral negotiations and diplomacy by tweet.
He never said that, the statement went on. The Vice President and I are in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act.

Wall Street indexes hit all-time highs in January, driven in large part by a bevy of positive economic data, a new tax law that would drastically cut the overall corporate tax rate, and years of easy access to money as a result of central bank policies.
Justin Draeger, chief executive of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, said the group was urging the Education Department to take steps, like easing the criteria used to select forms for verification, to avoid a backlog in the processing of student aid.
The Trump Administration's E.P.A. is breaking its own promises every day that it delays and puts polluters ahead of the American people, she said before 24 Republicans joined all but one Democrat to pass the act, 247 to 159, on the chemicals, known as PFAS. In stark contrast, the House is taking action.
Presidential travel is always an expensive proposition, requiring elaborate security measures, including a sizable Secret Service detail. With a jet-setting first family such as the Trumps, the costs quickly balloon.
In today's Gilded Age — when chief executives are making well over 300 times what the typical worker brings home in pay — the idea is getting new life. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who recently announced her bid for president, introduced a bill last year to give workers the right to vote for two-fifths of all corporate board seats, with a companion bill in the House by Representatives introduced by Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico. A similar bill by Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin would entitle workers to elect one-third of the seats.
The arrival last year of Mr. Carter and 14 other newly elected Democrats made it possible for Democrats to expand Medicaid. Now the party is aiming to take control of the state legislature this coming November, a goal that once seemed out of reach.
The college debt situation threatens the future of the U.S. The best and brightest may not be able to take on debts, or may be forced to choose careers for which they are overqualified. Meanwhile, Europe is investing in its best and brightest. Even undocumented immigrants who meet the qualifications for university entrance do not pay tuition.

In a decision that will bring relief to tens of thousands of student loan borrowers, the Internal Revenue Service has expanded the pool of people who will not have to pay taxes on the balance of their forgiven loans.
No deep soil is overturned in The Neighborhood, but two things keep one turning the pages. For one, it's a confident book and confidence is contagious. It's filled with cliffhangers — when the journalist is murdered, Enrique is the prime suspect — and over-the-top incident. For another, it is warm to the touch, particularly as regards sex.
In the absence of much hard evidence, economists have been left guessing about the shutdown's impact. White House economists this week doubled their estimate of the damage being inflicted. The Council of Economic Advisers said the shutdown would reduce quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percentage points for every week that it lasted as federal contractors lost out on work and government employees went without pay.
We don't know it from this episode, but Getty's own father, who also made a fortune from oil, didn't just fork over wealth to his son. He paid Getty $100 each month to live and buy oil leases for cheap: If oil sprung, Getty profited 30 percent and his dad got the rest. Not a deal exactly. But by age 23, Getty had made his first million. And when his dad died, he inherited only a fraction of his father's fortune — his father was said to disapprove of Getty's lifestyle and failed marriages (ultimately, there were five, harem not included).
For example, there's been a striking shift in how corporations see themselves. In normal times, corporations serve a lot of stakeholders — customers, employees, the towns in which they are located. But these days corporations see themselves as serving one purpose and one stakeholder — maximizing shareholder value. Activist investors demand that every company ruthlessly cut the cost of its employees and ruthlessly screw its hometown if it will raise the short-term stock price.
At the close of the New York cash market on Friday, the rate on the outstanding three-month bill was 0.51 percent. The rate on the six-month issue was 0.65 percent, and the rate on the four-week issue was 0.50 percent.

Georgia's voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now, Mr. Biden said in a written statement on Wednesday morning. On Covid-19, on economic relief, on climate, on racial justice, on voting rights and so much more. They want us to move, but move together.
At the current rate of sales, it will take more than six years to sell all of the new development in Manhattan alone, which totals almost 8,000 units, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers and Consultants.
What doesn't get talked about is Chile and Peru, which are fundamentally strong countries. I don't think of them as high risk. High-yield debt is risk. There, you're lending to the lower-quality end of the U.S. corporate market, which is going to have to refinance a lot of debt at higher rates over the next two to three years.
And so it was for Steven Mnuchin, Donald Trump's Treasury secretary. First, Mnuchin doubled down on his claim that the 2017 tax cut will pay for itself — just days after his own department confirmed that the budget deficit in 2019 was more than $1 trillion, 75 percent higher than it was in 2016.
WASHINGTON — The federal budget deficit continued to rise in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and is on pace to top $1 trillion for the year, as President Trump's signature tax cuts continue to reduce corporate tax revenue, data released Tuesday shows.
You have to be prepared to do research, get quotes from vendors, run numbers and talk to people. Nothing is going to change unless you pick up the ball and move it.
Average hourly earnings for United States workers were 2.9 percent higher in January than the previous year, the fastest annual increase in years. Although a welcome development for workers, economists often view rising wages as an early indication of inflationary pressure. If faster price increases do begin to emerge, the Fed could try to head them off with more aggressive rate action.
Independent research conducted in San Francisco finds that the regular Uber and Lyft services average 2.1 passengers per vehicle, yet neither of them will get a tax break because the services aren't registered as shared for hire. Seventy-three percent of people who commute in their personal cars travel alone and won't be paying a fee at all.

For these reasons, it helps to have a guy at the top of a 501(c)(3) who both knows business and has the chutzpah to march up to an Oscar-winning actress at the dog run to ask if she'll come to a benefit. Which is exactly what Mr. Kratz did with Jennifer Connelly in Brooklyn in 2010, after which she became a fixture at his events.
Spain: Parliament narrowly approved Pedro Sánchez as prime minister on Tuesday, ending months of political stalemate and creating a fragile minority government whose survival might hinge on its ability to bring to an end the long-simmering dispute over Catalonia.
And that's something we can estimate, given evidence on how responsive the pre-tax income of the wealthy actually is to tax rates. As I said, Diamond and Saez put the optimal rate at 73 percent, Romer at over 80 percent — which is consistent with what AOC said.
Last year was also a period of transition for Mr. Cuomo: For the first eight years in office, Mr. Cuomo worked with a Republican State Senate, which often backed his pleas for fiscal austerity and batted back progressive reforms. That changed in the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats took control of the Senate with the help of a number of young, liberal candidates who repeatedly challenged Mr. Cuomo, sometimes leading to heated conflicts.
Biden introduces his attorney general pick, Merrick Garland, saying he will be 'the people's lawyer,' not the president's. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:54 - 0:00 transcript Biden Introduces Attorney General Nominee in Wake of Capitol Riot While introducing his nominee for attorney general, Merrick Garland, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said the nation needed to restore the independence and integrity of the Justice Department. What we witnessed yesterday was not dissent, it was not disorder, it was not protest — it was chaos. They weren't protesters — don't dare call them protesters — they were a riotous mob, insurrectionists, domestic terrorists. It's that basic, it's that simple. I wish we could say we couldn't see it coming. But that isn't true. We could see it coming. The past four years, we've had a president who has made his contempt for our democracy, our Constitution, the rule of law clear in everything he has done. We need to restore the honor, the integrity, the independence of the Department of Justice in this nation that's been so badly damaged. And so many former leaders of that department in both parties have so testified and stated that. I want to be clear to those who lead this department, who you will serve. You won't work for me. You are not the president or the vice president's lawyer. Your loyalty is not to me. It is to the law, the Constitution, the people of this nation, to guarantee justice.
No. The Fafsa form remains available online, but you must fill in tax information yourself.
As a psychiatrist, I usually help people relieve their feelings of guilt and shame. But there are times when shame is a justifiable emotion. Wednesday was arguably the darkest day in recent American history. Every American should feel deep shame over this egregious triumph of mob rule. It was truly our country's dark night of the soul.
No. The president was not in Washington and not in politics when the Affordable Care Act was written, debated and passed in 2009 and 2010. The health law established consumer protections for Americans who buy their insurance, including a rule that health insurers must offer coverage to anyone who wishes to buy it, with prices varying only by region and the age of the customer.
The ski industry already took a hit in the spring when the pandemic struck and many resorts had to close early, leading to $2 billion in losses and causing layoffs or furloughs of thousands of employees, according to the National Ski Areas Association, a trade group. The industry saw its lowest number of visits, 51 million, since the 2011 to 2012 season, the association said.

Of the various Russian intermediaries to the Trump campaign, Mr. Kilimnik appears to be one of the most important to Mr. Mueller's inquiry. A Russian citizen and resident, he faces charges from Mr. Mueller's team of tampering with witnesses who had information about Mr. Manafort, but Mr. Kilimnik is not expected to ever stand trial. He did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment on Tuesday.

On the longest stretch of passenger rails in New Jersey without a stop, the proposed station would address a glaring need, providing public transit to a bustling area and easing congestion on chronically gridlocked highways. An elevated rail track that is part of the project could funnel more commuter trains to New York City.
Mr. Alder recommended visiting Tokyo from November through February, when hotel rates are at their lowest and the weather is mild to chilly. The summer season commands higher hotel rates — not to mention the temperatures can be uncomfortably hot and the air incredibly humid.
JPMorgan Chase is halting donations through its PAC for six months. There will be plenty of time for campaigning later, said Peter Scher, the bank's head of corporate responsibility.

Births in China have now fallen for three years in a row. They had risen slightly in 2016, a year after the government ended its one-child policy and allowed couples to have two children, a shift that officials hoped would drive a sustained increase in the number of newborns. But that has not materialized.
In all of 2017, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index experienced no decline greater than 3 percent, the first time that had happened. And a widely followed volatility index known as the VIX closed below 10 on more than 40 days in a six-month period through late November, according to Citi Research. Before that, the VIX had not closed below 10 on more than six days in any six-month period.
During his first two dizzying weeks in office, Mr. Trump, an outsider president working with a surprisingly small crew of no more than a half-dozen empowered aides with virtually no familiarity with the workings of the White House or federal government, sent shock waves at home and overseas with a succession of executive orders designed to fulfill campaign promises and taunt foreign leaders.
I grew up looking at the price almost down to the penny on everything from a bottle of juice to a can of soda, he told me in early February, explaining why he wanted to get the most value out of philanthropy. We were sitting in the East Village office of the Economic Security Project, an organization Mr. Hughes co-founded with two other activists, Dorian Warren and Natalie Foster, to fund the work of technologists, academics, policymakers and others exploring the idea of a guaranteed basic income for low- and middle-income Americans.
The state of Florida launched an investigation Wednesday into a company accused of steering vaccines to rich donors. MorseLife Health System, a nursing home and assisted living facility in West Palm Beach, was accused of making vaccines available to its residents and to board members who made donations to the facility, according to The Washington Post. Rebecca Robbins and
Further complicating the measure's prospects, insurance companies, which took a leading role in the health care fights of 1993-94 and 2009-10 but have been conspicuously quiet this year, released a blistering letter objecting to Republican plans to remake Medicaid and cut its funding.
Flo settles F.T.C. charges of misleading users on privacy. Credit... Flo The developer behind Flo, a period- and fertility-tracking app used by more than 100 million women, on Wednesday settled federal charges that it had misled users about its data-handling practices by sharing their intimate health details with Facebook and Google. In its privacy policies, Flo had repeatedly promised users that it would protect private details about their menstruation cycles and fertility, and that the data would be used only to provide services to them, according to a complaint filed by The Federal Trade Commission. Instead, federal regulators said, Flo shared sensitive health details on millions of users for years with numerous third parties — including Facebook's and Google's analytics units, as well as with two mobile analytics services, AppsFlyer and Flurry. The private data included information related to users' periods, pregnancies and childbirths, the complaint said. Moreover, Flo did not put limits on how Facebook, Google and other companies could use the women's health information, federal regulators said, giving the third parties the ability to use the data for advertising and other purposes. The proposed federal settlement prohibits the app's developer, Flo Health, from misleading users about its data-handling practices. It also requires Flo to obtain users' consent before sharing their health details and to obtain an independent review of its privacy practices. In settling the case, Flo did not admit to any wrongdoing. In a statement, the company said it does not share information about users' health without their permission.
Experts say the slowdown is rooted in several trends, including the rise of women in the work force who are educated and don't see marriage as necessary to achieving financial security, at least for themselves. For Chinese couples, many cannot afford to have children as living costs increase and their jobs demand more time and energy. And attitudes have shifted.
Streetcars are a staple of European capitals, and have arrived in cities like Atlanta; Portland, Ore.; and Toronto. But they have failed, until now, to catch on in New York, where the Bloomberg administration rejected a proposed line in Red Hook, Brooklyn, as being too expensive.
Doing this, though, means some of the investments may not appear to tick a climate-friendly box.
Democrats ask the Justice Dept. what they are doing to prosecute those involved in the Capitol attack, including Trump. In a letter to Christopher A. Wray, director of the F.B.I., House Democratic leaders said that President Trump incited his supporters to travel to Washington and menace members of Congress. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Democrats have asked leaders of the Justice Department for more information about what the department is doing to investigate and prosecute the attack on the Capitol, including the role that President Trump played in the attack. Five people died in the riot, including a police officer, and dozens have been arrested. We write to request an immediate and urgent briefing on the steps the Federal Bureau of Investigation is taking to investigate and pursue for prosecution the instigation, planning, and execution of the deadly terrorist attack on the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by President Donald Trump, his supporters, and outside groups, Democratic leaders said in a letter on Thursday to Christopher A. Wray, director of the F.B.I. A Justice Department spokesman said Saturday that the department has received a separate request from Congress for information related to the riot and is working to fulfill it. When asked whether Jeffrey A. Rosen, the acting attorney general, would brief lawmakers, the spokesman said no decision had yet been made and that officials on the ground during the attack could be made available.
Downturns in consumer sentiment don't always translate into cutbacks in actual spending. And past shutdowns haven't done lasting damage to either confidence or spending. Jim O'Sullivan, the chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note that the Michigan index also fell in 2013, then bounced back quickly when the government reopened. But he cautioned that the current shutdown had already outlasted any previous one.
We saw cracked skulls and mass arrests, law enforcement pepper spraying its way through a peaceful demonstration for a presidential photo op, she wrote, adding that seeing the inequality of force used was so painful. It hurts. Yesterday made it painfully clear that certain Americans are, in fact, allowed to denigrate the flag and symbols of our nation, Mrs. Obama wrote. They've just got to look the right way.
One age-old way of raising revenue, of course, is taxes, and many in Albany — including a rising number of progressives — want the state to raise taxes on the wealthy, and have proposed a wide variety of those, including those targeting billionaires, corporations and capital gains.
People who have experienced higher inequality during their lives are less in favor of redistribution, write Christopher Roth and Johannes Wohlfart, economists at the University of Warwick in Britain and Goethe University in Germany, in their November 2018 paper, Experienced Inequality and Preferences for Redistribution. They are less likely to support left-wing parties and to consider the prevailing distribution of incomes to be unfair.
Britain on Friday became the latest country to transform its measures on sanitary products by abolishing the so-called tampon tax, no longer classifying the products as nonessential and eliminating extra costs that many have criticized as sexist.
Regardless of the innovation, the challenge remains the same: moving metal boxes through limited street space while allowing maximum access for people and goods. Getting the market signals right for parking, congestion, curb access, infrastructure and public transit matters more than ever. We shouldn't have waited 10 years to get to this point. We can't build our way out of it.
For one thing, not all subsidies are created equal, and the government actually has a good track record in promoting new energy technologies. New developments often face two market gaps that can potentially delay or even kill them: the technological valley of death, in which promising advances hit a technical brick wall, and the commercialization valley of death, in which an effective technology can't get to market. Government research labs and subsidies have supported a number of forms of energy — from nuclear energy, to hydraulic fracturing, to photovoltaic solar — through these troughs.
First, when people say that U.S. corporations have brought money home they're referring to dividends overseas subsidiaries have paid to their parent corporations. These did indeed surge briefly in 2018, as the tax law made it advantageous to transfer some assets from the books of those subsidiaries to the home companies; these transactions also showed up as a reduction in the measured stake of the parents in the subsidiaries, i.e., as negative direct investment (Figure 1).

MELBOURNE, Australia — More than five years ago, on two different continents and only days apart, an Australian woman and an Australian man entered indefinite detention.
Pence is an excellent example of how hard it is to satisfy the president. His great sin was refusing to pretend that Trump hadn't lost the election. As a result, Trump happily listened to that crowd of rabid backers yelling Hang Mike Pence. And he reportedly told the vice president that he was going to go down in history as a pussy.
Over the weekend, several large companies — Marriott, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Commerce Bancshares — announced a suspension of donations to members of Congress who voted against election certification. Yesterday, the list expanded to Amazon, AT&T, Comcast, Airbnb, Mastercard, Verizon and Dow, the chemical company. Hallmark has even asked for its money back from two of the senators who opposed certification, Josh Hawley and Roger Marshall.

The music filled the courtroom Wednesday, introduced by insistent beats and the wail of a siren. Sitting at the defense table, wearing baggy blue jail garb, the rapper Earl Simmons, known as DMX, nodded as a recording of his voice spit out lyrics he had written about his life.
While public safety is important, we have to ask whether getting into these phones is the only avenue the government has to pursue justice or find the truth. We must trust our public officials with confidential and sensitive information to allow them to do their jobs. But the need to guard users' data — especially in an age when hackers and more autocratic governments can use it for more nefarious reasons — still trumps the public-safety concerns Mr. Barr is raising.
In an effort to engage with society at large, the conference began inviting a wider slate of speakers, including Ralph Nader, the consumer rights advocate.
While the change in Senate control is momentous, particularly in easing the way for Mr. Biden to fill administration jobs and judicial vacancies, it does not mean that Democrats can have their way on everything — or even most things.
Some people are already experiencing delays getting their second stimulus payments. New Yorkers wait outside a store advertising to cash stimulus checks. Credit... Sarah Blesener for The New York Times The federal government has only just begun sending out a second round of stimulus payments, and many people are already waiting a little longer than expected for their money. Many payments have been sent to inactive or temporary accounts that taxpayers don't have access to. It's not clear how many people are affected, but the tax preparation company Jackson Hewitt said the Internal Revenue Service had sent payments to more than 13 million bank accounts that were no longer open or valid. Because of the speed at which the law required the I.R.S. to issue the second round of Economic Impact Payments, some payments may have been sent to an account that may be closed or no longer active, the agency said in a statement on Tuesday. Companies like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt sometimes set up temporary accounts for clients when they prepare returns. For example, clients who opts to have preparation fees deducted from their refund may be issued one of these accounts, allowing the tax firm to take its share and then pass on the rest. After that, the accounts are generally inactive — but may still be linked to the taxpayers in I.R.S. records. Payments that are sent to inactive accounts must be returned to the Treasury. By law, the I.R.S. must issue payments by Jan. 15.
Before we get to the how of Trump's removal, though, I want to spend a little more time on the why — because even talking about the ouster of an elected president should happen only under extreme circumstances. Unfortunately, the country is now so polarized that such talk instead occurs with every president. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama were subjected to reckless calls for their impeachment, from members of Congress no less.
Several Republicans, including some members of the Freedom Caucus, have begun to circle the wagons around her. The entire party would be wise to heed the words of Ronald Reagan: 'The person who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is a friend and an ally, not a 20 percent traitor,' said Representative Michael Burgess, Republican of Texas. Yesterday, Republicans jumped on the calls for unity and healing no matter how they decided to vote. Removing Liz from her leadership position would be divisive and a distraction we cannot afford. Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who also voted to impeach Mr. Trump, said that Ms. Cheney in the last week had gained immeasurable respect, and suggested that it was Republicans like Mr. Jordan who should be shoved aside in the wake of the siege and the impeachment it prompted. Since the discussion is opened, though, we may have to also have a discussion about who in our party fomented this, and their roles as ranking members, he said. The debate over Ms. Cheney's leadership post reflects the deep fractures in the Republican Party over Mr. Trump, who has demanded total loyalty from his party and, up until recently, largely received it. While prominent figures have recoiled from Mr. Trump's incendiary brand of politics in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot, worrying that it could spell ruin for their party, a large minority faction — many of them in the House — remains unwilling to abandon him.

The interest rate charged on student loans in the U.S. is beyond ridiculous. My average interest rate for all my loans is 7.2 percent; of the $80,000 I've paid back since I graduated six years ago, $50,000 has gone toward interest. It makes me nauseous just to type it out. — Joseph, Brooklyn
But hours later, the president contradicted Mr. Pence, saying in McAllen, Tex., that he would be open to a broader immigration deal that would simultaneously deal with the Dreamers and a wall — if senators would bring him one they could agree on.
The Economist wrote: Europe's industrialists are never happier than arguing with such folk what is wrong and what is right with free enterprise.

Coax people who had dropped out of the labor force to look for work.
About one in five workers in a survey by the personal finance website Bankrate, published this week, reported not saving any income. And although financial advisers typically urge people to keep enough savings to pay six months of bills, recent research by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that about two in five households lacked the cash to cover a $2,000 expense. The Federal Reserve's Economic Well-Being report for 2016 found that 44 percent of adults either could not pay an unexpected $400 expense or would borrow or sell something to do so.
So this time, mused the Kremlinologists, the president was starting his machinations four years in advance and keeping them sufficiently confusing to blunt resistance, head off an incipient succession struggle and keep everyone off balance.
In the many decades in which civil rights groups have brought disparate impact claims under the Fair Housing Act, no court has ever required such obstacles to having a disparate impact claim heard. Yet HUD proposes to impose them. Few minority plaintiffs will have the resources to hire the teams of lawyers who can jump through the hoops HUD is erecting, and then to take defendants to court after HUD has dismissed a complaint on spurious procedural grounds.
Top Fed officials say a long period of monetary help lies ahead. Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor, said she expected the Fed's purchases of government-backed debt to continue for quite some time. Credit... Cliff Owen/Associated Press Top Federal Reserve officials are making it clear they expect the central bank's massive bond purchases to continue well into the economic recovery, tamping down concerns of a quick return to a more normal policy setting as vaccines become available and the government sends more direct economic aid to Americans. In addition to holding interest rates at near-zero, the central bank is buying about $120 billion in government-backed debt per month. It has promised to continue doing so until substantial further progress has been made toward the Fed's two goals — maximum employment and stable price gains averaging around 2 percent. But recent comments from regional Fed presidents had fueled speculation that a rapid economic snapback in 2021 might allow the economy to meet those criteria earlier than many in the financial markets had expected. On Wednesday, two of the central bank's governors suggested that a move toward tighter policy is unlikely to come soon. I expect that the current pace of purchases will remain appropriate for quite some time, Lael Brainard said in webcast remarks sponsored by the Canadian Association for Business Economics.
They'll send in their product, and we won't charge them anything, the president said during a meeting with mayors and governors to discuss his proposal for rebuilding American infrastructure. And we send them our product — same product as they're sending us — and they'll charge us 50 and 75 percent tax, and that's very unfair.

Somalia has been at war for nearly three decades, wracked first by combat among clan warlords and then by violent extremism. For most of that time, it effectively had no central government, followed by a government with a tenuous hold and limited power.
Both the Senate and House would be required to approve such a measure by a two-thirds vote. Vice President Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol, should seriously consider working with the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to preserve democracy, the group said. Most of those calling for Mr. Trump's removal as president 14 days before he is slated to leave office were Democrats, but there were some exceptions. Governor Phil Scott, Republican of Vermont, said on Twitter that Mr. Trump should be ousted. The fabric of our democracy and the principles of our republic are under attack by the president, he said. Enough is enough. President Trump should resign or be removed from office by his Cabinet, or by the Congress. Read more
You have to show that there's this really close nexus between why you're using race and the outcome you're seeking, said Melissa Murray, a professor of law at New York University. And I think here it's going to be a real question as to whether funding just Black businesses through this Cares fund is actually the only way that you could address the problems that Black Oregonians have experienced during this particular period.
With that in mind, the 13-nation OPEC cartel had little choice but to work with Russia, despite the Kremlin's long history of trying to jawbone up global oil prices while doing as little as possible — or nothing at all — to actually curb output.

Mr. Trump was adamant in his demands for $5.6 billion in funding for a border wall, and he rejected Democrats' proposals to fund the government while the two sides negotiated further. The Democrats refused to increase their offer of $1.3 billion for border security.
An income tax refund may be the biggest check some people see all year. That makes tax season a great time to jump-start a savings plan, financial experts say.
Justice Department officials said that they needed access to Mr. Alshamrani's phones to see data and messages from encrypted apps like Signal or WhatsApp to determine whether he had discussed his plans with others at the base and whether he was acting alone or with help.
But no: Washington was obsessed with debt. The Simpson-Bowles report was the talk of the town. Paul Ryan's impassioned (and, of course, hypocritical) denunciations of federal debt won him media adulation and awards. And between the capital's debt obsession, the Republican takeover of the House, and a hard right turn in state governments, America was about to embark on a period of cutbacks in government spending unprecedented in the face of high unemployment.
Shuttered parks can't collect entrance fees. Furloughed workers will ultimately get paid for not showing up to work. And the government will wind up having to pay interest on missed payments to some contractors.
From the ongoing government shutdown to foreign policy changes in the Middle East, it's been a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you'd like to read further).
Electricians, plumbers, hairdressers, journalists, computer consultants and a variety of other self-employed workers have all taken the plunge. On a recent afternoon, Yiannis, a young television production designer, stood in line in a government office to de-register as a consultant. Had he not, he said, his take-home pay this year would amount to just 30 percent of earnings.
This three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath apartment with city views is on the ninth floor of the 10-story Horizon Mansion, on Hong Kong Island. The recently refurbished 1958 condominium is in the Midlevels Central area, where high- and mid-rise buildings line winding, hilly roads, about halfway up Victoria Peak and just above the central business district.
The stories are, by and large, inoffensive. Mr. Kornbluth, well-directed by his brother, Jacob Kornbluth, is a comfortable presence, shuffling and schlubbing through his own life. In the scripted scenes he's aided by an excellent supporting cast, including Harry Shearer as a Hollywood dealmaker, and Robert Reich, the labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, playing a former I.R.S. commissioner.
But he was persuaded by the success of TPG's previous Rise funds — $2 billion of which are in climate-related investments. At this stage in my career, I'm not looking to do a start-up. I'm in a hurry to make a difference, he said. Mr. Paulson and Mr. Coulter are looking to make investments in climate that are as profitable as any other kind of investment. Many other climate funds have a philanthropic stance or are willing to accept lower returns, but the market will not scale for concessionary or subsidized returns, Mr. Paulson said.

Lawyers at the Institute for Justice, the libertarian law firm that is representing three Montana families, said the case could produce one of the most significant education rulings in the last half-century. The Supreme Court has ruled that states may include religious schools in publicly funded school choice programs, but a ruling that would essentially require it would be groundbreaking.
This is not dissent, the president-elect said in remarks from Delaware as scenes of the armed takeover of the Capitol played out on television screens. It's disorder. It's chaos. It borders on sedition and it must end now.
Asked whether he knew about undocumented workers, Mr. Trump said, ''I really still don't know that there were illegal aliens.''
A second impeachment could set up a final showdown of the Trump era, testing accountability and the Constitution. Protesters being pushed back by police at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times Barely 11 months after President Trump was acquitted in a momentous Senate trial, the nation now confronts the possibility of yet another impeachment battle in the twilight of his presidency, a final showdown that will test the boundaries of politics, accountability and the Constitution. No president has ever been impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors twice. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi was weighing bringing a new article of impeachment to the House floor as early as Monday charging Mr. Trump with incitement of insurrection for encouraging the mob that ransacked the Capitol to disrupt the solemn process finishing his own election defeat. If Ms. Pelosi decides to proceed, the House could approve the article in days, this time with even some disaffected Republicans joining the Democratic majority to send the matter to the Senate. While it seemed unlikely that 17 Republicans in the Senate would go along with Democrats to reach the two-thirds necessary for conviction, the anger at Mr. Trump was so palpable that party leaders said privately it was not out of the question. The deadly storming of the Capitol by Mr. Trump's supporters transformed the politics of Washington in ways that were still hard to measure.
We should be ashamed to subject our citizens and visitors to such conditions. I recently visited Paris and was blown away by the improvements in its subway amenities. There are many more escalators (no traffic cones in sight!) and moving sidewalks! We can certainly do as well or better.

Republicans are happy to run up the deficit to cut taxes, but not happy to run up the deficit to spend more, said Michael Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.
Still, a fundamental question remained: How did a former public relations executive known primarily for working with blue-chip financial companies become such a well-connected art-world player? And if Mr. Kratz, the academy's president since 2009, has given the place a new currency, as Mr. Fischl asserted, may something bigger be in store for him and the board chairwoman, Ms. Guggenheim?
In the Assembly, Speaker Carl Heastie marred an otherwise banner start to the new year by engaging in a legal maneuver to try to keep a $50,500 pay raise for lawmakers while eliminating limits on outside income set by a special committee that enacted the raise. No doubt he has better ways to spend his time.
Especially in the case of the finance industry, Chen writes,
It is necessary to spend the money now, he said, apparently referring to his entire batch of economic plans, including both immediate aid and a larger bill that includes infrastructure spending. The answer is yes, it will be in the trillions of dollars.
A LOFT PENTHOUSE IN THE HEART OF MUNICH
The concern goes beyond Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence. Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, has also been asked to help resolve the wall impasse, but Mr. Kushner has no experience in crisis negotiations on Capitol Hill, and his attempts at intervention have borne little fruit. The day before Mr. Trump's prime-time Oval Office address to the nation, Mr. Kushner called Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a centrist known for his enthusiasm for bipartisan deals, and said the president was firmly committed to his position on the wall and did not plan to budge, according to two people familiar with the conversation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the call was private.

So Ms. Akhmedova and her lawyers tried a new approach. Temur, the older of the couple's two sons, is a U.K. resident, which makes his holdings eminently seizable. And for a guy who isn't yet 30, he has plenty to seize. His father showered Temur with unimaginable amounts of money, as Temur's own lawyers put it in a court filing.
It's difficult to discern, however, how many of those viewers are future caucusgoers in Iowa, or voters in New Hampshire, and the tools for targeting or promoting livestreams are somewhat limited.
Remarkably, the city turned down a bid by a private company to buy the gas franchise and instead decided to develop it as a public utility. The city raised money to install gas lines that ran through buildings and from home to home. Street lamps burned around the clock because the gas was so plentiful it was less expensive than turning them off and relighting them daily, a reality that earned Medicine Hat a mention in Ripley's Believe It or Not! (The gas mantles in the lamps have since been replaced by light-emitting diodes.)
The steep drop, however, was the result of extraordinary circumstances and experts warned that the country still faced enormous challenges in getting its planet-warming pollution under control. In the years ahead, United States emissions are widely expected to bounce back once the pandemic recedes and the economy rumbles back to life — unless policymakers take stronger action to clean up the country's power plants, factories, cars and trucks.
A spokesman for the inaugural committee said in a statement that the allegations were baseless. The committee operated in compliance with the law, the statement said, adding that the suit reads more like a partisan press release than a legal filing.
Google bans political ads until the inauguration. Google said it would not allow political ads on its platforms until after Inauguration Day because of last week's violent uprising at the Capitol. In a letter to advertisers on Wednesday, the company said the suspension covered any ads that referred to candidates, the election or its outcome, the upcoming presidential inauguration, the impeachment process, the Capitol riots, or planned protests about any of these subjects. There will not be exceptions for news or merchandise advertisers. The pause will go into effect on Thursday and extend until at least Jan. 21. Google is the biggest seller of advertising on the internet. In addition to displaying advertising on its own services, such as its search engine and YouTube, it runs a powerhouse ad platform and exchange relied on by other websites and publishers. The policy change was reported earlier by Axios. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google's parent company, Alphabet, said at the Reuters Next conference on Wednesday that the company had made significant changes to how it handled political ads and election misinformation around the election, but he acknowledged that more work needed to be done. The internet, as a whole, needs to come to terms with what kind of information can spread, Mr. Pichai said. Definitely, there's more to do on our side. Google has treated last week's riot as a sensitive event, a designation it usually assigns to natural disasters or mass shootings, prohibiting advertising that seeks to take advantage of the tragedy.
Here are some questions and answers about completing the Fafsa:
Shares in Bank of America, for example, have increased 36 percent since the day before the polls opened — more than those of any of its peers. That leaves Bank of America trading just a touch under book value, which suggests it should be able to at least cover its cost of equity, which is generally pegged at 10 percent for such hulking financial institutions.

Take, for example, your cellphone. Most of us hold onto them for only two years, but as we noted in November, producing a common smartphone released the equivalent of 178 pounds of carbon dioxide, about as much running a modern refrigerator for a year. That is one of the biggest reasons that the global carbon footprint of smartphones is projected to increase by 730 percent this decade.

Opinion Debate What should the Biden administration prioritize? Mitt Romney writes that the right answer to human rights violations is an economic and diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics that would still allow American athletes to participate.
No, the election wasn't stolen — there is no evidence of significant electoral fraud. No, Democrats aren't part of a satanic pedophile conspiracy. No, they aren't radical Marxists — even the party's progressive wing would be considered only moderately left of center in any other Western democracy.
In late 2010 and early 2011, the U.S. economy had barely begun to recover from the 2008 financial crisis. Around 9 percent of the labor force was still unemployed; long-term unemployment was especially severe, with more than 6 million Americans having been out of work for 6 months or more. You might have expected the continuing employment crisis to be the focus of most economic policy discussion.
Gambling: Las Vegas is the mecca of sports gambling in America, and some owners worry that putting a team there will lead more players and referees to rub elbows with unsavory characters trying to corrupt them.
The global economy's subdued recovery faces challenges, the World Bank says. London's financial district was deserted on Tuesday as the United Kingdom re-entered a nationwide lockdown. Credit... Andrew Testa for The New York Times The global economy faces a subdued recovery in 2021 as countries race to roll out coronavirus vaccines and businesses around the world try to emerge from pandemic lockdowns that have widened income inequality and piled on debt, the World Bank said on Tuesday. The global economy will expand 4 percent in 2021 after contracting 4.3 percent last year, the World Bank projected in its Global Economic Prospects report. The bank described the nascent recovery as fragile and said that its trajectory would depend on the success of widespread vaccine distribution. While the global economy appears to have entered a subdued recovery, policymakers face formidable challenges — in public health, debt management, budget policies, central banking and structural reforms — as they try to ensure that this still fragile global recovery gains traction and sets a foundation for robust growth, said David Malpass, the World Bank's president. The bank projects that advanced economies will expand 3.3 percent this year after contracting 5.4 percent in 2020.
The investigations into the deaths of Ms. Babbitt and Officer Sicknick will focus on different types of crimes. Ms. Babbitt was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer inside the building as she climbed through a broken window leading to the Speaker's Lobby. The U.S. attorney's office is investigating whether excessive force was used against her. The Capitol Police said Officer Sicknick passed away due to injuries sustained while on duty. At some point in the chaos — with the mob rampaging through the halls of Congress while lawmakers were forced to hide under their desks — Officer Sicknick was struck with a fire extinguisher, according to two law enforcement officials. He was rushed to the hospital and placed on life support, and died later on Thursday evening. Officer Sicknick was only the fourth member of the force to be killed in the line of duty since its founding two centuries ago. Senior Pentagon officials said on Saturday they would likely approve a request for Officer Sicknick, an Air National Guard veteran, to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery with special posthumous honors. The recognition came after Representative Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat and former Pentagon official, said in a Twitter message that she had contacted top military officials, including Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to request the honors. Katie Benner and

The hourly wage increases were set in motion in 2016 by Gov. Jerry Brown, with a law that required the state's mandatory minimum wage to be increased incrementally every year, until it reached $15 an hour in 2022. Gov. Gavin Newsom could have suspended this year's wage increase because of the pandemic, but decided against it. Not allowing this increase to go forward will only make life harder for those Californians who have already borne a disproportionate share of the economic hardship caused by this pandemic, he said in a statement.
Democratic lawmakers in New York have prophesied the legalization of weed for the past two years. Each year, their high hopes have crashed against the messy realities of lawmaking in the state capital, Albany.
Bernie Sanders will control the 'reconciliation' process in a divided Senate.
Again, Republicans were left baffled by a president who has pitched himself as an expert in the art of the deal.
I don't want to present myself as some sort of singular figure. I think part of what's different are the times. I do think that, for example, the 1980 election was different. I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that, you know, Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not.
I'm very fortunate to have a job and be part of this, he said. I was doing little delivery jobs, just to get by with the bills, and was really close to being homeless.
The settlement said that Harbert and its executives did not pay any taxes on hundreds of millions of dollars of performance fees generated by Harbinger and that by only paying taxes in Alabama, which has a lower tax rate than New York, the investment firm and its executives saved themselves money.
The proposed opioid tax would raise an estimated $127 million in the coming fiscal year, while another plan — adding a 14 percent surcharge on profits made by health insurance policies — could raise $140 million, according to administration estimates.
Back in April Niko Alaezi, 24, made a purchase that is still irritating her today.
WASHINGTON — The most significant attempt to loosen rules imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis is underway in Congress as the Senate looks to pass legislation within the next month that would roll back restrictions on swaths of the finance industry.
The move to issue refunds seeks to circumvent a potential political problem for the Trump administration by allowing taxpayers to claim refunds despite the protracted government shutdown, which is already dragging into Day 17.

But the Kochs pay for politicians in order to enrich themselves and to gut regulations affecting the polluting industries that made them billionaires. Adelson got a similar tax windfall for the millions he put into electing Republicans, with the added benefit of controlling the State Department's view of Israel.
The settlement with Mr. Schneiderman's office said Mr. Falcone indirectly benefited from Harbert's decision to have its offshore manager, or Harbert, pay all of its state taxes in Alabama. The filing said Mr. Falcone, as a New York resident, paid lower New York State taxes as a result of a credit for tax these members paid to Alabama.
Time: The Raiders have applied to leave, but the owners can ask them for more clarity on their proposal. That could open the door for the owners to reconsider the bid to stay in Oakland.
Tighter financial regulations, strikingly synchronized global monetary policy and new competition from financial upstarts are hitting trading at banks like Goldman especially hard. On Wednesday, the bank used one word to describe current conditions on Wall Street: challenging. Its clients are placing fewer trade orders than they did when market prices were changing more quickly and more dramatically.
Starting Tuesday, loans will be available from thousands of lenders, including national banks like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo; most regional banks; and financial technology companies like PayPal. Some smaller lenders have already gotten started. Community Development Financial Institutions, Minority Depository Institutions and Certified Development Companies — specially designated lenders that focus on underserved populations, including Black- and minority-owned businesses — were allowed to start taking loan applications this week. And on Friday, lenders with $1 billion or less in assets will be allowed to start submitting applications. The Small Business Administration, which manages the program, has not said how many applications it has already received. Unlike the first round, when the agency approved loans instantaneously, approvals will now take at least a day because of new fraud safeguards the agency has adopted.

Built on spec on vacant land in Hudson's first gated community (dating to the turn of the 20th century), this home is one of several stately houses in the area. It is the last building on its side of a blocklong street, less than five minutes on foot from Warren Street, the city's boutique- and restaurant-rich commercial stretch. An Amtrak train station is less than half a mile northwest, near the Henry Hudson Riverfront Park. Pennsylvania Station in New York City is two and a quarter hours south.
But here's where competitive markets come in. In a perfectly competitive economy, with no monopoly power or other distortions — which is the kind of economy conservatives want us to believe we have — everyone gets paid his or her marginal product. That is, if you get paid $1000 an hour, it's because each extra hour you work adds $1000 worth to the economy's output.
Developing economies are projected to expand 5 percent after shrinking by 2.6 percent last year.
The response: Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, called the defeat catastrophic. The European Union said it was stunned by the defeat but said there was no option to renegotiate. Time is almost up, said the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker.
With the stock market at record highs, two trade deals announced and the possibility that Mr. Trump may be in office for another four years, there is an increasing sense that he will be accepted, if not embraced (although some attendees may roll their eyes behind his back) when he arrives on Tuesday, even as he faces an impeachment trial.

The situation in Northern Ireland is an added wrinkle. Northern Ireland will remain partially in the European Union's single market, an exception that avoids a border with the Republic of Ireland but creates a border in the Irish Sea. Logistics experts say the Trader Support Service, a free government service to help companies complete customs forms to send goods from England, Wales and Scotland to Northern Ireland, has been overwhelmed.

Advisers to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. had already begun vetting candidates to replace him after Mr. Biden takes over next week.
As one of Bill Bradley's original supporters in his primary fight against Richard C. Leone for the Democratic nomination for United States Senator in 1978, I agree with his decision not to run, albeit for reasons that differ substantially from the explanations offered by the Senator and his staff.
So let's carry on with this hypothetical. Say we opened the floodgate of development. What kind of effects could we expect? The economy would grow, and by a lot. According to a recent paper by the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh, from the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, and Enrico Moretti, from the University of California, Berkeley, local land-use regulations reduce the United States' economic output by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, or about 10 percent lower than it could be.
These questions and many more are effectively on the ballot in Georgia today. The state is voting in runoff elections that will choose both of its senators, after no candidate won 50 percent of the vote in November. Republicans need to win only one of the two races to keep Senate control; Democrats need both to retake control.
• Mr. Trump says the U.S. has the stronger negotiating position: China, he said, will capitulate because it's not doing very well now.
Mr. Trump is also said to have discussed in recent weeks the possibility of pardoning himself, an unprecedented and untested use of presidential power, but it is uncertain whether that would ultimately protect him. Mr. Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., also told the crowd on Wednesday that Republicans in Congress should back Mr. Trump's efforts to undo the election result: We're coming for you, he said of lawmakers who refused. And Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, said that to win the election, his supporters would need to engage in trial by combat against Democrats. Federal prosecutors on Thursday filed their first charges stemming from the riot, charging one man with assaulting a police officer and another with illegally possessing a loaded handgun. Both criminal complaints were filed in Federal District Court in Washington. The city's Metropolitan Police Department had announced earlier that its officers had arrested nearly 70 people at the riot on charges that included unlawful entry, gun possession and assault. In a separate statement, the Capitol Police announced the arrests of 14 other people on Thursday. The first federal complaint accused Mark J. Leffingwell of assaulting a Capitol Police officer around 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday in a hallway in the Senate wing of the Capitol building. The officer, Daniel Amendola, said in the complaint that Mr. Leffingwell was part of a crowd that had breached a window.
Over just a few days in January, Dr. Waronker posted a letter on the district's website, accusing the board majority of stymieing his effort to transform the district and of patronage, vendettas, threats and cover-ups. The State Education Department released a scathing report prepared by a retired superintendent, detailing the district's record of dismal results and questionable spending, and effectively criticizing both the board and Dr. Waronker. And, the next night, in a raucous meeting, the board majority voted to put Dr. Waronker on leave and ban him from school property.
By promoting a colossal untruth of his own — that he won a sacred landslide election victory — and sticking to it despite scores of court rulings establishing otherwise, Mr. Trump has outraged his political opponents and left even some of his longtime supporters shaking their heads at his mendacity.
The House Republicans' experiment with continuously nationalized politics didn't work out. Politics operates as two interlocking systems, sort of like your left and right brain hemispheres: One system is local, parochial, individualized, pragmatic, while the other involves big national choices and ideas. Successful politicians and parties operate at both levels. Politics of local interests alone can lead to the kind of logrolling bargains — you support my farm subsidy and I'll support your oil-drilling tax break — that create a functioning Congress but risk losing sight of big national obligations such as addressing climate change. But nationalized politics alone strips away the many little points of common ground that cut across polarizing lines of ideology and help make bargains and compromise possible. When the two systems are both healthy, when politicians are engaged both with big ideas and with their own constituents and their concerns, it brings a kind of fluidity to politics that we've seen in more productive periods, such as the 1980s.
Other Democratic candidates, led by Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have centered their campaigns on stripping economic wealth and power from rich individuals and corporations and redistributing it more evenly. They have accused Mr. Bloomberg of trying to buy his way into contention by spending millions of dollars from his personal fortune — the type of wealth they are targeting — on advertising.
Still, a larger war could happen, especially since wounded national pride is at stake. If so, it will either hand Trump an easy re-election if the war is swift, contained and decisive; or hand him a massive defeat if it's not.
Qatari officials have said that alcohol consumption would be more restricted than in other World Cups. They have suggested that some drinking would be allowed in designated zones, and that the country's courts would deal more gently with visiting fans who consume more alcohol than usual.
It was the first calendar year since 2012 that the deficit topped $1 trillion. Deficits swelled after the 2008 financial crisis, as lawmakers cut taxes and increased spending in an effort to revive growth. The gap had narrowed through 2015 under a budget agreement between President Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress, which reined in federal spending.
What role will President-elect Joe Biden play this session?
A number of Americans had to delay their plans to retire when the economic crisis hit in 2008. Some lost their jobs, some took serious losses to their 401(k) plans and some had to go back to work because of the shortfall in their retirement savings.
Ms. Sandeno says that since they were furloughed, her staff members stopped eating out at the Dirtbean cafe or Rayetta's Lunch Box in Marlinton, a town of 1,000. They are just normal people who don't want to file for unemployment, she says. There aren't a lot of alternatives in the area.

Details: Progress between the U.S. and North Korea hinges on the definition of denuclearization. For the U.S., that means the North giving up its entire arsenal. For North Korea, it also includes a reciprocal pullback of America's ability to threaten the country with nuclear weapons.
Out of all the peril of this moment, I want you to know I see the promise, Mr. Biden said. I'm as optimistic as I've ever been.
It's Personal: The Davis family has a long history, not all of it positive, with leaders in Oakland. And Davis's father had a great affinity for Las Vegas.
Beyond that, the impact of the tax cuts becomes less clear, but they will probably still be helpful. If consumers and small businesses feel richer, as its rival JPMorgan Chase said last week they probably will, a beneficiary should be a company like Citigroup, which makes roughly one-quarter of its revenue from credit cards. Mr. Corbat warned last year that the cost of writing down unrecoverable loans was going to rise a little more than expected, and credit losses on its North American own-brand card business rose 10 percent in the quarter. More cash flow for households may keep that in check — and might actually encourage more borrowing.
The tariffs have been sold to Americans as a means of forcing multinational companies to make their products in the United States, abandoning China, Mexico and other low-cost centers of industry. But the tariffs are threatening jobs that are already here.
At first they filled a barn at his farm in Hertfordshire, England. Then he trucked them to warehouses the size of basketball courts in London and Geneva. Finally, in 2004, after cramming them into four boxcar-size shipping containers, he donated them to Emory University in Atlanta, where they became known collectively as the Raymond Danowski Poetry Library.
But he was clear on one point: Plans by congressional Republicans to repeal the health law now, then take years to create and implement a replacement law are unacceptable to the incoming president.
The loan that went to Amy Jeanchaiyaphum, a photographer in Minnetonka, Minn., illustrates the pitfalls of that approach. Ms. Jeanchaiyaphum, like most sole proprietors, doesn't pay herself a fixed salary. Any money she makes first goes to cover her company's expenses; she lives on the remainder. In 2019, her gross sales added up to a modest five-figure sum, according to her tax return.
Federal employees will eventually get their salaries — for work they weren't allowed to perform
Blended into that equation is a standoff between the International Monetary Fund and European countries over how much more austerity to require of Greece. The I.M.F. wants European creditors to further reduce Greece's mountainous debt, now at 180 percent of economic output, warning that it will spiral out of control otherwise.
This laissez-faire style appeared to work well enough, including throughout the 31-year tenure of Philippe de Montebello, who retired as director in 2008, just before the financial crisis. But the world has changed for the Met since then. Corporate and government donations to cultural institutions have declined; competition from contemporary art institutions like the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art has increased; and the demands to reach new audiences digitally have become urgent.
Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday authorized the deployment of 1,000 National Guard troops and surrounded the state Capitol grounds in Sacramento with a six-foot, covered chain-link fence to prepare for and respond to credible threats.
A strike in Los Angeles would offer a new stage for the national teacher protest movement, which in the last year has driven walkouts against stagnant pay and low education funding in six states. A walkout in staunchly liberal Los Angeles would also signal a major shift in a movement that has spread mostly in conservative or swing states with weaker unions.
Yes, our progress has been uneven. The work of democracy has always been hard. It has been contentious. Sometimes it has been bloody. For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back. But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some.
And a year ago, for example, a representative for the National Psoriasis Foundation did not disclose that her group receives at least 40 percent of its annual revenues from drug companies when she testified before the North Carolina state legislature on an unsuccessful measure supported by the pharmaceutical industry that would have limited insurers' ability to block coverage of certain drugs. Similarly, the hemophilia foundation did not disclose its pharmaceutical ties when it took the industry's side in 2015 in a letter to the Food and Drug Administration over the issue of biosimilars, which are cheaper alternatives to complex biological drugs.
However Republicans feel about their coming bill — and they are far more comfortable criticizing the Affordable Care Act than talking up the virtues of their still-incomplete replacement — the process playing out in the Senate is quite different from the way Democrats went about passing the Affordable Care Act.
An effective, enduring Lost Cause story needs to know clearly what it hates, has to attain widespread control of its own communication and needs institutional rooting, and it must explain almost everything. It converts loss and longstanding grievance into community, and promises of victory on altars of strife.
Vanessa's lip sync was a bit wan in comparison, and she was, sadly, the first bat to be plucked from the renovated cave. She bravely fought back tears as she sashayed away — I hope this isn't the last we see of her.

It will also allow Mr. Biden to nominate and confirm other judges as well, including justices to the Supreme Court, if an opening arises during the next two years.
What You Get $1,300,000 Homes in Connecticut, Iowa and Pennsylvania This week's properties include a 1796 house in Connecticut and contemporaries in Iowa and Pennsylvania.
Those gains had come after the Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, was declared the winner over the Republican incumbent, Kelly Loeffler, in one of two runoff elections for the Senate in Georgia. Jon Ossoff, the other Democratic challenger in Georgia, held a slight lead over David Purdue, though that race remained too close to call.
Since then, life has changed for this bronze-hued crew. Jenni Farley (JWoww), Nicole Polizzi (Snooki) and Deena Cortese all found husbands; Ms. Farley and Ms. Polizzi are each the mother of two young children; and Paul DelVecchio (Pauly D) is the father of a young daughter. Michael Sorrentino (The Situation) got sober, and in January, he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of tax evasion, for which he faces sentencing this spring.
The Netherlands has come under pressure from the European Commission and Dutch citizens disgruntled about special favors for big companies. Officials in Amsterdam have responded by vowing to tighten rules that allow companies to camouflage profits as royalties and protect them from taxes.
Paula Bishop, an accountant and financial aid consultant, has also assembled a spreadsheet listing many colleges' policies. You can find it and a detailed explanation of home equity financial aid formulas on the College Solution website, run by the educator and journalist Lynn O'Shaughnessy.
A rare calm has settled over the stock market. Whether it turns out to be the one before the storm is a compelling question after a year of conditions so placid that investing has begun to look deceptively simple.
The San Bernardino dispute was resolved when the F.B.I. found a private company to bypass the iPhone's encryption. Tensions between the two sides, however, remained, and Apple worked to ensure that neither the government nor private contractors could open its phones.
There were no big surprises; those had mostly come earlier.

And now the deal is done, Mr. Trump said.
People who don't receive a payment can recover it on their 2020 tax return; the payment will become part of their regular refund, the I.R.S. said. (The Recovery Rebate Credit can be found on line 30 of the 2020 Form 1040 or 1040-SR.) Taxpayers can check the status of their stimulus payments with the I.R.S. 's Get My Payment tool. If you don't recognize the account number that received the payment, it may be one of these temporary accounts. The tax preparation companies said they were working to get payments to customers. H&R Block said it was already passing along stimulus payments to customers' bank accounts and via prepaid debit card to certain customers. A spokeswoman for TurboTax said the company was working with the I.R.S. to help taxpayers receive their payments as soon as possible. And Jackson Hewitt suggested on its website that customers consider taking the rebate on their 2020 taxes.
Mr. Tillerson was sharply questioned on his views on Russia, where he has had close business ties. He expressed reservations on climate change and said that he did not view it as the imminent national security threat that some others did.
The utility of lying on a grand scale was first demonstrated nearly a century ago by leaders like Stalin and Hitler, who coined the term big lie in 1925 and rose to power on the lie that Jews were responsible for Germany's defeat in World War I. For the German and Soviet dictators, lying was not merely a habit or a convenient way of sanding down unwanted facts but an essential tool of government.
When it was finally time to cede the ice, he shooed away this latest batch of doubtless future Olympic hopefuls. Now, he informed them, we go drink.
While many of the ideas put forth by transit experts sound great, the rush to automated self-driving trains is not realistic or safe for New York City. Neither is the idea of permanently shutting down service at night. How many of these experts consistently ride the trains? Ignorance is not bliss in this situation.
Mr. Gaviola's experience mirrors that of hundreds of others nationwide as demand for construction labor outstrips supply. Eighty percent of contractors were having trouble finding skilled workers, according to a national survey released last year by the Associated General Contractors of America trade group and the software designer Autodesk.
Like Ms. Warren, candidates often announce their campaigns at the end or the beginning of a quarter, and the choice is strategic: If you announce at the end of a quarter and raise a lot of money very quickly, you can report an impressive total right away and help cement yourself as a serious candidate. If you announce near the beginning of a quarter, you give yourself almost three months to build a respectable total before you have to disclose it.
Taxpayers should always ask for references, inquire how much tax education the preparer gets during the year and ask what the preparer's areas of specialty are, if any, Ms. Hockenberry said.
Over the last 20 years, my wife and I have built several fashion companies, including Lilla P and Leo & Sage, that we design and distribute. We employ about 30 people directly, and dozens more indirectly as freelancers and sales representatives. Entrepreneurs like us should be ecstatic over the pro-business rhetoric coming out of the White House and Congress. But we're not, because they are considering unfair tax-code changes that, if put in place, could hurt businesses like ours — and millions of American consumers.
Successful fund-raising is one of the messages that you want to have available to you as a candidate in Iowa, because it's an indicator of the ability to sustain a campaign as long as is necessary, said Jerry Crawford, who has led several Democrats' Iowa operations.
She added that, President Trump continues to fan rage and violence by contending that the Presidential election was invalid, and said, some persons can be expected to continue their violent protests through the inauguration. Read more
The 2018 results are, oddly enough, what a lot of economists predicted would happen with Mr. Trump's cuts, including ones who generally favor tax cuts. Total federal revenues in 2018 came in roughly where the Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank that typically projects large growth boosts from tax cuts, had forecast — which is to say, well below the budget office's baseline.
Jan. 6, 2021, 6:15 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 6:15 p.m. ET Twitter locks Trump's account after he encouraged his supporters to 'remember this day.' President Trump sent a tweet in which he reiterated the false claim that the election was stolen. Credit... Will Oliver/EPA, via Shutterstock In what could be interpreted as an attempt to stoke the flames of a Capitol mob which has begun to disperse, President Trump sent a tweet at around 6 p.m. in which he reiterated the false claim that the election was stolen and encouraged his supporters to remember this day going forward. These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long, he tweeted. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever! Twitter later took down the tweet, saying that it had violated the company's rules. Mr. Trump also posted a video in which he repeated his baseless claims of widespread election fraud on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. All three social media sites removed the video. Read more
• We're listening to The Daily. Today's episode is about President Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and the ensuing debate over the role of the U.S. military.
The alliance was a sign of just how frustrated American businesses are with the state of the nation's health care system and the rapidly spiraling cost of medical treatment. It also caused further turmoil in an industry reeling from attempts by new players to attack a notoriously inefficient, intractable web of doctors, hospitals, insurers and pharmaceutical companies.
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, suggested that Mr. McConnell was way out to lunch in trying to place responsibility for the shutdown on Ms. Pelosi. Her allies in the House say the speaker is hardly the sort to wilt under Mr. McConnell's attacks.
Ms. Cotton, like millions globally, was experiencing period poverty — a lack of access to pads or tampons, in this case for financial reasons. For some the financial gap is so dire, they may need to miss school or work while menstruating.
In other words, increasing inequality undermines support for a progressive agenda — the agenda most likely to improve the life chances and conditions of the least well off.
The Sanders campaign is the most prolific campaign when it comes to livestreaming, airing nearly all of the candidate's rallies live on YouTube and often providing nightly campaign update broadcasts featuring either Mr. Sanders or his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, on both YouTube and Twitter. The campaign updates on Twitter often attract about 100,000 viewers, evidence of Mr. Sanders's devoted online following, and this weekend his campaign said roughly three million viewers tuned in to one of Mr. Sanders's rallies across all platforms.
But when pictures of the packages, delivered to students at home as lockdowns have shuttered schools across England, circulated on social media this week, they were roundly condemned by parents and anti-hunger activists like the soccer star Marcus Rashford.
Will Congress reduce medical costs for middle-class and poor families — and raise taxes on the rich?
Portions of the surveys offered a pointed political warning to Mr. Trump. In the span of a year of SurveyMonkey polling, the president has lost much of the approval he enjoyed with Americans on economic policy. Nearly as many respondents now say his policies are making the economy worse as say they are making the economy better. A year ago, Mr. Trump held a seven-percentage-point advantage on that question.
So that's what we mean when we say America is exceptional. Not that our nation has been flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change, and make life better for those who follow.
For the past few years, we've had a spate of young families moving in, and their needs or wants may be different from somebody who doesn't have kids. Should we have more toys so the kids can play? Should we have a whole play area? How do we make that happen while staying within the constraints of our budget?
But the United States Tax Court took issue with that account in a recent decision.
Blame for these costs belongs to politically powerful construction companies and labor unions that drive up costs under the lax oversight of public officials who have no incentive to rouse sleeping legislative watchdogs.
The clip went viral and seemed to confirm people's suspicions that for all the talk of world-changing agendas in Davos, not much really happened there. Moreover, his comments echoed a broader line of criticism that the global elite are uninterested in solutions to intractable problems if those solutions threaten their dominance.
Mr. Kushner has little relationship with Mr. Manchin, but he left the senator with the impression that the White House believed public opinion would be on the president's side after the speech, and that Democrats would simply have to relent. That did not go over well.
The distribution rule also applies to workplace retirement accounts like 401(k)'s, but usually only if you have already retired, Ms. Cassidy said. If you are still working at the employer where your retirement plan is based, you probably do not have to begin withdrawing money until after you retire. But check with your employer or plan administrator.
Along the People Mover route, there are a number of parking garages with various rates where you can essentially park and ride with ease.
The question for the justices was a fundamental one: May states be sued in the courts of other states? The Supreme Court said yes in 1979 but came close to overruling that decision in 2016, in an earlier encounter with Wednesday's case, Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt, No. 17-1299.
Yes. President Trump's first legislative priority after his election was to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Republicans in Congress voted on several different bills, but each of them had provisions that would have substantially eroded the current protections for Americans with prior health conditions, by weakening the regulations that make such insurance available, affordable and useful.
When a developer then proposed to build a mixed-income apartment complex, St. Bernard officials announced a moratorium on issuing permits, so the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center went to court, claiming that the county not only breached the agreement but also violated the Fair Housing Act. The housing group showed that a disproportionate share of potential renters would be African-Americans who had been displaced by the hurricane, and contended that there was no reasonable basis for prohibiting the project to proceed.
For many smaller breweries, a constant churn of new beers is as important for attracting new customers as is having established fan favorites. Jersey Girl Brewing in Hackettstown, N.J., had been planning to introduce a beer each month and had begun to gather ingredients and lay out a brewing schedule. Without label approval, the beer already brewed could sit in tanks, go stale in cans, or, in a worst-case scenario, have to be thrown away.
President-elect Donald J. Trump demanded on Tuesday that Congress immediately repeal the Affordable Care Act and pass another health law quickly. His remarks put Republicans in the nearly impossible position of having only weeks to replace a health law that took nearly two years to pass.
Good morning on this radiant Tuesday.
Financial markets were boosted after OPEC, Russia and other oil producers reached a production deal that includes voluntary cuts of 1 million barrels a day by Saudi Arabia. Crude oil futures jumped 5.5 percent.
Yet coverage actually hasn't been negative enough. The story you mostly read runs something like this: The tax cut has caused corporations to bring some money home, but they've used it for stock buybacks rather than to raise wages, and the boost to growth has been modest. That doesn't sound great, but it's still better than the reality: No money has, in fact, been brought home, and the tax cut has probably reduced national income. Indeed, at least 90 percent of Americans will end up poorer thanks to that cut.
In about a year it was time for our beauty contest to hit the runway. The folks at the bank pulled out spreadsheets showing us how they outperformed various indexes, none of which we recognized — and all well below the returns of the Dow or S&P.
And the deal does little to resolve more pernicious structural issues surrounding China's approach, particularly its pattern of subsidizing and supporting crucial industries that compete with American companies, like solar energy and steel. American businesses blame those economic practices for allowing cheap Chinese goods to flood the United States.
The prosecutors also accused Mr. Zuberi of deleting emails with individuals who provided money to him around the time of his $900,000 donation, including a foreign citizen. The foreigner, who is not named in the court filing, transferred approximately $5.8 million to the account Mr. Zuberi used to fund his $900,000 inaugural donation, the prosecutors said.
Even under the chill of winter, people huddle outside the liquor stores, silver beer cans poking from coat pockets. The street, busy with traffic from customers, is littered with empty bottles and scraps of discarded clothing.
The administration has said it will address some of these changes in Phase 2 of the negotiations and is keeping tariffs in place in part to maintain leverage for the next round of talks. Mr. Trump said he would remove all tariffs if the two sides reach agreement on the next phase.
I was at a dinner with five friends the other week at the Grill, that temple of prime rib and larded squab in the former Four Seasons space in Manhattan, when the waiter uttered those dreaded words: We recommend sharing.
Her remarks came the day after the House — with support from 10 Republicans — impeached the president on a single charge of incitement of insurrection, and as Republicans faced the prospect of a trial that could begin as soon as next week. Republicans were racing to gauge the political dynamics of a vote to convict Mr. Trump, which would open the door to disqualifying him from holding office in the future. Most of them kept their powder dry publicly, but were privately struggling to reconcile their own disdain for the leader they supported loyally for years and their fear of a backlash from a political base more devoted to Mr. Trump than any other party figure. Though few Republicans had gone on record in such stinging terms, Ms. Murkowski was not alone in breaking from the president. Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Susan Collins of Maine had spoken out harshly against Mr. Trump, leaving colleagues to speculate that they could vote to convict him and bar him from ever holding office again. Even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, indicated to colleagues that he was undecided about whether to convict Mr. Trump, and privately told advisers he approved of the impeachment drive and believed it could help the party purge Mr. Trump.
Last week, G.E. made a startling announcement that it would take a $6.2 billion charge in the fourth quarter, and set aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by its finance unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies.
Allergan has added ice and a slice to its M&A cocktail. The drug company is paying just under $2.5 billion for Zeltiq Aesthetics and its diet-avoiding, fat-freezing technology. It sounds like a wackier play than the dozen deals Allergan struck last year. But people pay cash for the treatment, making it less speculative than other acquisitions, such as gene therapy.
So taken together, these numbers are fully consistent with the view that the United States labor market — and economy as a whole — are in sound shape, expanding steadily and putting more people to work despite an expansion nearing its nine-year anniversary.
Ms. Brainard pointed out that, adjusted for labor market dropouts and mis-classification issues, the unemployment rate stands at around 10 percent, which is where it was during the worst of the 2007 to 2009 recession. Fed analysis suggests that unemployment for low-wage earners is probably above 20 percent, while for the top quartile of wage earners it is below 5 percent, she added. Richard Clarida, the central bank's vice chairman, has also brushed away speculation that the so-called tapering of asset purchases will come soon. And on Wednesday, he reiterated that the Fed will not raise interest rates until inflation rises to the central bank's 2 percent goal. We do think that the asset purchases now are an important part of this strategy, he said. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, is scheduled to speak on Thursday, and economists at Evercore ISI wrote on Wednesday that they expect him to reinforce the steady-as-she-goes approach to policy with no early consideration of a policy transition in response to better fiscal prospects.
Roger Federer has used his own precision serving to shift the momentum of his once-lopsided rivalry with Nadal. Last year's final in Shanghai, which has one of the quickest surfaces on the ATP Tour, was a case in point. Nadal could not manage to get a single break point on Federer's serve and lost, 6-4, 6-3.
It was not immediately clear whether Mr. LaTurner had been in the same location as Ms. Wild, though Ms. Wild said roughly 300 to 400 people were being held in the room with her. As the violent mob stormed the Capitol, groups of lawmakers were kept together at secure locations, while others reported being stranded for a time in offices and hideaways throughout the building. Videos of the siege showed hundreds of members of the mob, most of them unmasked, clashing with Capitol Police officers and journalists inside the Capitol and on the surrounding grounds. Mr. LaTurner's announcement came after two other Republicans, Representatives Kevin Brady and Kay Granger, both from Texas, had tested positive for the virus earlier in the week. Both Mr. Brady and Ms. Granger were not in the Capitol on Wednesday because they were in quarantine.
The tax law overhaul of late 2019 eliminated the home office deduction for employees from 2018 through 2025. Employees who receive a paycheck or a W-2 exclusively from an employer are not eligible for the deduction, even if they are currently working from home, the I.R.S. said. Read more. How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can't include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.
By decreasing the extent to which people use e-cigarettes, you decrease quitting of conventional cigarettes, said W. Kip Viscusi, a professor of law, economics and management at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the research but has studied tobacco policy extensively.
How Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Will stimulus payments be taxed? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction? Probably not, unless you're self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker.

Some businesses anticipated cross-border problems with Europe, and filled warehouses with stockpiled goods — auto parts and pharmaceuticals, for example — before the end of the Brexit transition period. That has kept cross-border shipments at a fraction of their normal level so far. Over the next few weeks, as those stockpiles run down, business activity will pick up, exacerbating delays.

This two-story, stone-and-stucco house is in the established Elbow Park neighborhood of Calgary, the largest city in Alberta Province, Canada, with a population of 1.4 million. A short drive from downtown, it sits on more than a quarter of an acre, at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac near the scenic Elbow River.
And, indeed, her focus is local: Much of Ms. Williams' produce comes from urban farms, her house gin was created in collaboration with Detroit City Distillery and her tables and bar shelves were made by a local artist. A sense of resourcefulness pervades her cooking, which incorporates so-called ugly foods — ingredients that would have otherwise been discarded for purely aesthetic reasons — and whole-animal butchery. Chef is passionate about no waste, our server informed us. You'll notice at the end of the night that we only have one compost bucket.
This is Mr. Slott's fourth book on the topic. The last two were revisions of his The Retirement Savings Time Bomb, which came out in 2003. This version inserts the word new in the title, the publisher says, to indicate that substantial portions of the previous editions have changed to deal in depth with the federal Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, better known as the SECURE Act of 2019, which made significant changes in the way retirement accounts need to be handled.
Many presidents have won re-election after a midterm drubbing, and Mr. Trump's approval rating isn't particularly far from what he may wind up needing, given the G.O.P.'s current advantage in the Electoral College. But the wall has not helped so far.

Tax cuts just left Citigroup with a big loss, and a bigger opportunity. The $203 billion lender took a $22 billion charge in the last quarter of 2017 as it wrote down deferred tax assets — credits against future tax bills — and took a hit for deemed repatriation of overseas earnings. That left it deep in the red. But its new corporate tax rate of an effective 25 percent will hike earnings in the future. If the tax law had been in effect last year, the 9.6 percent return on tangible common equity Citigroup just reported for the year would have risen above 10 percent — already beating his target for 2018, and suggesting that Mr. Corbat can be more ambitious.
Ms. Warick said that students should not wait for the I.R.S. data tool to return online to file their Fafsas, as it is uncertain how long it will be unavailable. College students who need help should contact their institution's financial aid office, and high school students should seek assistance from their school's college counselors.
Since the midterm election showed the political costs that Trump inflicts on Republicans, this criticism seems to be growing. They have broken with him on foreign policy (in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Syria) and are anxious about the government shutdown. Trump is vulnerable to any erosion in his already weak approval rating, be it from an economic downturn, more Russia revelations or simply the defection of a few key allies. When support for an unpopular leader starts to crack, it can crumble.
And so Hogarth joins the ever-lengthening list of misogynistic dead male artists. This doesn't exactly encourage the study of his art — or having his prints on your wall. The last set of Hogarth's six Marriage A-la-Mode engravings to appear at auction failed to sell last May at Weschler's of Washington D.C. against a low estimate of $1,500, according to Artnet.
It blew me away sometimes when people would come in, trying to leave their place at halftime and drive 20 or 30 miles and try to get back for the fourth quarter because they ran out of beer for the game, he said. You'd really notice it if the Vikings played a later game.
None of these polls account for the government shutdown, but attitudes about it are unlikely to be fluid given the lack of movement on the wall during the Trump presidency. Tying the issue to an unpopular shutdown seems particularly unlikely to help and, historically, voters tend to drift against the policy preferences of the president's party. That's already evident on immigration more generally: Polls show voters more supportive of immigration than ever before.

A Capitol Police officer dies from injuries sustained during the pro-Trump rampage. Capitol Police officers sweep the grounds of the U.S. Capitol building on Thursday. Credit... Samuel Corum/Getty Images A United States Capitol Police officer died Thursday night from injuries sustained when he engaged with a pro-Trump mob that descended on the U.S. Capitol the day before. Officer Brian D. Sicknick died at about 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, the Capitol Police said in a statement. He had been with the agency since 2008. Mr. Sicknick was responding to the riots on Wednesday and was injured while physically engaging with protesters, the agency's statement said, although officials didn't immediately elaborate on the nature of his injuries or how he interacted with the crowd. After sustaining the injuries, Mr. Sicknick returned to his division office, collapsed, and was taken to the hospital. The entire U.S.C.P. department expresses its deepest sympathies to Officer Sicknick's family and friends on their loss, and mourns the loss of a friend and colleague, the statement said. News outlets had prematurely reported on his death earlier in the day while he was apparently still on life support. Homicide investigators from the Metropolitan Police Department are involved in the case. Early Friday morning, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, a Democrat who runs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the budget for the Capitol Police, said in a Twitter post that his heart was breaking over Mr. Sicknick's death.

These distributors are free to favor their primary suppliers over independent craft brewers when it comes to promotion, visibility, shelf space and marketing support. Laws passed in the 1970s to protect small mom and pop wholesalers from the big brewers are now obsolete and have the unintended consequence of creating an unfavorable balance of power — unfavorable to craft brewers and people who enjoy their beers.
The chronic funding shortage for California's large urban school systems is primarily because of the state's property tax law. Voters passed Proposition 13 in 1978, capping property taxes and drastically limiting the amount of money the state could collect for public schools. The law has led to smaller, more affluent communities raising money with local bonds or parcel taxes, something that is virtually impossible in poorer urban districts like Los Angeles.

Unfortunately, far too often, the opposite is true.

One of the first was a brick factory, the largest in Canada at the time, which took advantage of the region's other natural resource: rich deposits of clay along the South Saskatchewan River basin.

Ms. Slotkin would not say whether she agreed with Ms. Pelosi's stance that no negotiation was possible until the government reopened, citing a confidentiality pledge she said members of the group had taken about their discussion. But she said she and her colleagues were walking around with copies of legislation co-written by Representative Will Hurd, Republican of Texas, and Representative Pete Aguilar, Democrat of California, that drew bipartisan support last year. The measure paired border security improvements with legal status for some undocumented immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children, sometimes called Dreamers.

I like my peas with a smoked ham hock and plenty of kale, but, if you've got the time or a pressure cooker, you might try it with a pig trotter, which will give the beans a silky lip-sticking quality that will lead you, eventually, to make a vat of trotter gear to add to all sorts of meals.
You see, Republicans almost universally advocate low taxes on the wealthy, based on the claim that tax cuts at the top will have huge beneficial effects on the economy. This claim rests on research by … well, nobody. There isn't any body of serious work supporting G.O.P. tax ideas, because the evidence is overwhelmingly against those ideas.

It can make America healthier, wealthier, more innovative, more energy secure, more respected — and weaken petro-dictators across the globe.

Investors, many of them from overseas, in search of higher returns after the 2008 recession looked to hard assets like real estate, and bet big on residential projects. Because credit remained tight for most New Yorkers, the most lucrative demographic was the affluent all-cash buyer, and thousands of new units — larger apartments, with better finishes and more amenities — were built to suit the demand.
GLOBAL ROUNDUP France, lagging its European neighbors, toils to speed up vaccinations. Administering a vaccine in Montpellier, France, on Monday. The first wave of inoculations in the country has concentrated on residents of retirement or nursing homes. Credit... Pascal Guyot/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Many countries in Europe and elsewhere have been criticized for rolling out Covid-19 vaccinations too slowly. And then there is France. Only about 7,000 people have been vaccinated in France, the authorities said on Tuesday — a tiny fraction of the number in Germany (more than 316,000) or in Italy (more than 178,000). The French government says it is following the strategy set out by the country's top health authority, focusing the first wave of inoculations almost exclusively on residents of retirement or nursing homes. But critics say the process is bogged down by red tape, preventing those who want a shot from getting one, while doing little to reassure those who are skeptical about the inoculations. One poll this week found that nearly 60 percent of respondents in France did not want a Covid-19 vaccine, up 8 percentage points from last month. President Emmanuel Macron has privately vented to his staff that the pace of inoculations was like a family stroll, according to the Journal du Dimanche. Jean Rottner, a doctor and center-right politician who is the regional president of Grand Est, in eastern France, said on the television channel France 2 this week that getting vaccinated was becoming more complicated than buying a car.

The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.
It contains intriguing concepts but they aren't all universally applicable. For example, even pre-Covid, many Canadian banks offered a skip-payment mortgage option. Borrowers who experience a temporary hardship can forgo one mortgage payment a year. You still owe the interest and principal. It is just rolled into what becomes an extended version of the loan. That's a fine idea. Perhaps it should be standard in the United States.
Economics: Many owners prefer a booming market in Northern California to Las Vegas, a boom-and-bust tourist town that is a much smaller television market: 40th.
Mr. Macron's deputies in parliament have become the front-line proxies for Yellow Vest hatred of the president. Dozens of parliamentarians representing his political movement La Republique en Marche, or Republic on the Move, have been threatened, their houses and offices vandalized, and anti-Semitic and racist insults hurled at them.
Before the pandemic hit, America's emissions had been slowly but steadily declining since 2005, in large part because utilities that generate electricity have been shifting away from coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, in favor of cheaper and cleaner natural gas, wind and solar power. Over the past decade, utilities have retired hundreds of coal-burning power plants despite President Trump's efforts to revive the industry.
Officials said the rules would allow millions of businesses to file their 2018 taxes with certainty over whether they qualify for the break.
writes that the right answer to human rights violations is an economic and diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics that would still allow American athletes to participate. Steven Greenhouse writes that if the president wants to follow through on pro-union campaign promises, there are many pro-labor things Mr. Biden can do even without Congress.
The process of creating all of that fabric has a significant environmental impact, including on the climate. One thing you can do is to buy less clothing; spend the new year shopping in your closet instead.
We have of course no knowledge of the source of the documentation on which the recent press stories are based, said Luís Pais Antunes, a managing partner at PLMJ. In any case, he added, It is impossible that the documentation that is being used for the bulk of the stories is in any way related to PLMJ or was ever at our disposal.
With high taxes and with nearly half of the new jobs being lowly paid part-time or shift work, these debts are likely to grow. More people are now classified as being at risk of poverty or social exclusion (34.8 percent of the population in 2017) than at the beginning of the crisis (27.7 percent).
Over the last 15 years, membership in the United States Curling Association doubled to 20,000. As Kate Caithness, the president of the World Curling Federation, put it to me recently: The U.S., you are our sleeping giant. The sleeping giant has woken up. Afghanistan, Brazil, Guyana, Mexico, Mongolia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have also begun to embrace the sport, whose chief appeal may lie in its ability to revive a singular crushed dream: You see ice dance or skiing and think, I'll never be an Olympic champion, Caithness says. But curling, you can.
Drury, 25, appealed to the Yankees on several fronts: He has displayed decent pop — with 31 home runs and a .767 on-base-plus-slugging percentage in a little over two seasons with the Diamondbacks — and he came cheaply.
Holland Park is more traditionally English looking than some of the surrounding neighborhoods and has some of the area's largest homes. This property is within a 10-minute walk of the park, which has woodlands, a Japanese garden, recreation facilities and an opera house; it is also near the fashionable Kensington High Street shopping district. The Design Museum is a prominent newcomer to the area, having moved into an impressive new home with a distinctive paraboloid roof last November. And Holland Green, a new concierge-style apartment development nearby, is commanding prices as high as £4,000 ($4,820) a square foot.
The new Treasury secretary will have little time to celebrate. He will be under pressure to help finalize the Trump administration's tax plan, accelerate the rollback regulations and raise the government's borrowing limit. The administration has said it will release a comprehensive plan to rewrite the tax code in the coming weeks, and it will have to deal with the debt ceiling next month.
Last year, during an unusually nasty storm, water snaked through the narrow streets of Guraidhoo, a small island in the Maldives, pooling around the floor of the three-room house and chasing away guests.
Regardless of the report's veracity, we already know that Cohen pursued the Moscow project through June 2016 but falsely told lawmakers that he'd wrapped up that work the previous January: Last November he pleaded guilty to lying under oath.

But anti-fraud measures first put in place for last tax season will continue to affect the delivery of tax refunds for people who claim the earned-income tax credit or the additional child tax credit. By law, the I.R.S. can't issue refunds for such filers before mid-February. The agency said that it expected filers who claim those credits to receive refunds no earlier than Feb. 27, if they choose direct deposit and there are no other problems with their returns.
WASHINGTON — Shrugging off the limitations of the partial government shutdown, the Trump administration finalized rules on Friday governing who can claim a new 20 percent tax deduction for business owners.

The president's lawyers will make their first appearance in the Senate impeachment trial on Saturday, but they will be relatively brief, using only a few hours to begin to lay out their case on a day when few people are watching. Then on Monday, Mr. Trump will get his made-for-television presentation. One of his lawyers called tomorrow a trailer, coming attractions.

For transit advocates who aggressively pushed Mr. de Blasio to support the idea, his failure to start the program on time or to publicize it has been frustrating.
Californians who have been impacted by this pandemic will get help to provide for their families and keep a roof over their heads, Mr. Newsom said in a statement. The Legislature, which is scheduled to reconvene next week, normally passes the state budget in June. The proposed emergency spending proposals are highly unusual, according to H.D. Palmer, the spokesman for the state Department of Finance, said, but these are unusual times. Property owners, who have been restricted from evicting tenants for nonpayment of rent, have also called for financial assistance. California and some local governments in the state are expecting to receive some $2.6 billion in federal money to help low-income renters and small-property owners, and the governor proposed expediting use of those funds. He did not say how long he hoped to extend the protection for tenants.

Pence is said to oppose invoking 25th Amendment to strip Trump of his duties. Vice President Mike Pence after a Joint Session of Congress certified the electoral college votes for 2020 Presidential Election on Wednesday. Mr. Pence opposed calls to invoke the 25th Amendment. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Vice President Mike Pence is opposed to a call by Democrats in Congress and some Republicans to invoke the 25th Amendment to strip President Trump of his powers before his term ends, a person close to the vice president said. It is unclear when Mr. Pence will alert Congress of his position. But the decision by Mr. Pence is said to be supported by several Trump cabinet officials. Those officials, a senior Republican said, viewed the effort as likely to add to the current chaos in Washington rather than deter it.
It's a tax that comes right off the bottom line, said EBW's president, Cory Steeby. It totally incentivizes you to move out of the United States and build either in Canada or Mexico. These are active conversations right now.
Larry Fink will also give a talk at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. Following the release of new data showing that 2019 was the second-hottest year in recorded history, the global warming crisis will be one of the summit's central topics. Which could lead to quite the standoff, especially as Mr. Trump — who has openly scorned climate change science — is among the attendees, along with the 17-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg. Also on the speaking docket: Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, which pledged this past Thursday to erase its carbon footprint and invest $1 billion in carbon removal technology.
Even as the vaccines have started becoming available, the virus continues to spread at an alarming pace. More than 21 million coronavirus cases and more than 360,000 virus-related deaths have been reported nationwide. On Wednesday, public health officials across the United States reported at least 3,963 new deaths and 255,730 new cases. That made it the country's worst day of the pandemic so far, in both categories, though reporting lags over the holidays may have affected the totals. Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire reported single-day death records, while Louisiana, Florida and Virginia reported single-day case records. Illinois is now the fifth state to report over a million cases since the start of the pandemic. So far, most vaccines have been given out at hospitals and other health care settings, such as clinics and nursing homes. But pharmacies are increasingly entering the mix. In Louisiana, about 100 pharmacies across the state this week will start to give doses of the Moderna vaccine to people over 70, health care workers, and patients on dialysis, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced on Monday. In Florida, seniors will be able to start making appointments on Thursday to get the Moderna vaccine at 22 Publix Supermarkets pharmacy locations across the state, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced on Tuesday. As of Wednesday morning, nearly 17.3 million doses of vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna had been shipped out across the country. But according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 5.3 million people have received their first shots.
• Bigger changes to China's economy, like subsidies to its commercial giants, remain under negotiation.
There are valid reasons for the market's lack of response, the main one being that by February the market had gotten way ahead of itself, reaching valuations that few people could justify. Stocks rose so rapidly in 2017 and early 2018 — on top of their increases since 2009 — that prices had begun to seem impossibly high.
Last year, The Times reported how money eligible for the tax break — supported by both Democrats and Republicans — was going to luxury projects in affluent neighborhoods, including deals that were underway long before the tax break took effect.
Ms. Trump, who had been rumored to be a contender for the position herself, will not be a candidate, a Trump administration official said. But she will assist the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, in choosing a successor to Jim Yong Kim, the current president of the World Bank who announced last week he would be stepping down.
But even as some economists and politicians become more comfortable with high public debt levels, others warn that they could create vulnerabilities down the road. If interest rates increase, it could cost the government more to keep up with those payments each year — either leaving less for other types of spending or requiring Congress to pile on an ever-growing debt load to keep up.

In 2020 and 2022, these new members will no longer be exciting insurgent challengers but incumbents, probably forced to compromise in ways that some supporters might find disappointing. If the volunteer energy and small-donor support that lifted them to victory in 2018 is missing, their campaigns will look very different. They'll have to turn to corporate PACs again and, much like their predecessors elected in 2006 and 2008, focus their attention on donors rather than their districts, compromising their promises.

Alexandra, Pelosi's documentarian daughter, recounts this anecdote: Her son, Thomas — who was named after Big Tommy and who stood at the speaker's side as she reclaimed her gavel — wanted an Xbox in 2017, so he set up a lemonade stand in Manhattan and raked in $1,000.
A deadly combination of right-wing free-market fundamentalism and left-wing moral relativism led to a withering away of moral norms and shared codes of decent conduct. We ripped the market out of its moral and social context and let it operate purely by its own rules. We made the market its own priest and confessor.

The decision announced Wednesday expands an exemption that was granted to borrowers at Corinthian Colleges and the American Career Institute, two failed for-profit schools that stranded their students with incomplete degrees and credits that were hard to transfer. In those circumstances, the Education Department allows borrowers to have their federal loan debts eliminated through its Closed School Discharge program.
We are friends, we were before her father was elected and it's not going to change after, Ms. Bloomberg wrote in an email in 2018, before her father made his presidential ambitions official.

On Monday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to publish members' oil output numbers for January, the first month of cuts in oil production that producers agreed to late last year. The cuts were aimed at propping up petroleum prices. Analysts expect the report to show that OPEC members are making most of the agreed trims. On Friday, the International Energy Agency, the monitoring group based in Paris, said compliance was about 90 percent. The agreement by OPEC, Russia and other large exporters to restrain output has helped lift prices of Brent crude to about $57 a barrel from around $45 a barrel in late November. Stanley Reed
Cyprus: A British woman who was convicted last month of lying to the authorities was given a four-month suspended sentence on Tuesday. She had accused a dozen Israelis of raping her in a resort town, but later retracted her statement. The woman said she had been pressured by the authorities to change her account.
No matter how persuasive the pro-climate argument, no matter how great a majority of the public can be convinced to support climate change action, that action will not happen so long as government officials depend for their political livelihood on the fossil fuel industry.
Before long, the cumulative shushing sounds of stones over pebbled ice, like that of waves on a beach, suffused the arena. Unlike other pastimes in which players alternate between inactivity and rolling (bowling), tossing (cornhole) or pushing (shuffleboard) roundish projectiles at a target, all four teammates participate in delivering all the team's stones.
The plan was lauded by progressive groups as well as by the nation's leading business lobby, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which was often at odds with the Obama administration over spending and regulations. We applaud the president-elect's focus on vaccinations and on economic sectors and families that continue to suffer as the pandemic rages on, the chamber said in a statement.

According to The Times's blockbuster tax investigation, Fred lavished Donald with three trust funds and $10,000 Christmas checks. When Donald was 8, he was already a millionaire, thanks to his tax-scamming father. Fred Trump was hauled before a congressional panel investigating whether he had looted government money through fraud. (One congressman said the patriarch's chicanery made him nauseous.)
One of the first things we have to unwind is this idea that the gig economy is just about low-wage workers, because it's just broader. Freelancers range from very low-paid workers to very skilled and highly paid workers. They're all workers.
This book is, sad to say, all but unreadable. Vargas Llosa's op-ed voice is not his best voice (it is few people's best voice) and these pieces, read years after they were composed, are essentially dead on the page.
The court, however, remanded the board's joint employer finding for further clarification, along with the issue of back pay for further consideration by the board.
Last month, the Mexican artist Teresa Margolles made a pilgrimage to the scene. Ms. Margolles's work focuses on violent death and its aftermath, which she expresses in tough photographs and installations that often involve material residue from murder sites. She knew the Walmart for having often shopped there: Though based in Madrid, Spain, she has worked for many years in Ciudad Juárez, just across the border from El Paso, and much of her art responds to the borderland's cartel wars, trafficking and gender violence.
The police recently arrested scores of people suspected of smuggling gold to Turkey. The daily turnover averaged 400,000 euros — the equivalent of about 11 kilograms of gold each day. The bust was a dud: It turned out that the dealers did not need permits to export to Turkey. The investigation, however, shed light on one of the less visible, personal costs of the crisis.
Anthony Chen, a sociologist at Northwestern, wrote by email:
The rollout is beginning to accelerate: More first shots were reported given in the third week of the vaccine drive than in the first two combined, and the C.D.C. 's count increased by 470,000 between Tuesday and Wednesday. Still, the number of vaccinations is far fewer than the 20 million people that the Trump administration hoped would get their first shots by the end of 2020. Pharmacies in the program will face the challenge of verifying that the people they give vaccines to are eligible to receive them because of their age, job or medical conditions. Mr. Azar said on Wednesday that verification is a less urgent concern than getting out doses quickly. We need to not be overly prescriptive in that, especially as we see governors who are leaving vaccines sitting in freezers rather than getting it out into people's arms, Mr. Azar said. The perfect cannot be the enemy of the good here. Other vaccines nearing the final stages of development could increase the supply of vaccines and help accelerate their distribution. Johnson & Johnson is on track to file by the end of this month for emergency authorization for its vaccine, said Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to fast-track vaccines. That vaccine only involves a single dose, which will be easier to deliver than all the other leading vaccines, which require two shots.

Hank Paulson is returning to finance, lured by Bono to head a climate-focused fund. Henry Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, in 2019. He will become the executive chairman of new fund run by the investment firm TPG. Credit... Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg, via Getty Images Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Goldman Sachs chief and Treasury secretary during the 2008 financial crisis, is rejoining the finance industry. He will become the executive chairman of TPG Rise Climate, a new fund run by the investment firm TPG. The move brings Mr. Paulson, 74, back to the industry for the first time since he left Goldman to become Treasury secretary in 2006 under President George W. Bush. It may also signal a turning point for the weight and seriousness given to climate-related investments, already a focus for TPG. The firm's co-founder, Jim Coulter, is planning to shift much of his focus to the new climate fund. Mr. Paulson has spent the last 12 years since leaving his post at the Treasury away from the private sector, running his nonprofit institute and working on climate change initiatives. He was recruited to TPG, in part, by Bono, the musician and activist who helped found TPG's $5 billion Rise funds focused on impact investing. He told Mr. Paulson that the investment firm wanted to create an even bigger platform to focus exclusively on combating climate change. I wasn't looking to do this, Mr. Paulson said.
My skin cleared up around the same time that I came into earning a reasonably livable salary. Like the many unmoored people of my generation who, in absence of the markers of stable life denied to us, embraced the deceptively seductive cult of skin care, I began spending madly on serums, exfoliants, humectants and occlusives.
As Dell Technologies publicly confirmed that it was exploring a number of potential transactions — ranging from an initial public offering to a combination with VMware, of which it owns 80 percent — much of the media coverage has focused on why it's doing so.
Trump's two big victories as president have been the tax cut — organized and pushed through to law by Mitch McConnell — and a raft of new conservative federal judges. Listen to the president and you'd think he had the opportunity to name them all because Barack Obama just forgot — or was too lazy — to fill any openings. (He gave me 142!)
Will the United States spend tens of billions of dollars over the next few years to slow climate change?
Raising the minimum wage could lower the suicide rate, according to a study published last week, delivering labor advocates a tantalizing new finding about the broader impacts of wage changes even as some experts said other factors could explain the decrease.
He acknowledged the high price tag but said the nation could not afford to do anything less. The very health of our nation is at stake, Mr. Biden said, speaking from Delaware. We have to act and we have to act now. Here are some of the highlights of Mr. Biden's so-called American Rescue Plan: The rescue proposal would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing, and flows from the idea that the virus and the recovery are intertwined.
But the 920-square-foot corner space, at West 74th Street, is close to being leased to a new tenant, as are two other empty stores nearby, Mr. Evans said, adding that a wine bar is also scheduled to open, in the vacant 322 Columbus.
The fight is not just limited to France. Silicon Valley's tech giants are a target for much of Europe. Last summer, the European Commission unveiled a proposal to significantly revamp how the companies are taxed in the 28-nation European Union.
Businesses and individuals, meanwhile, are struggling to cope in an economy that suffered a devastating shock in 2015, when Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras imposed capital controls and brought Greece to the brink of exiting the euro. Despite a mild recovery, the economy shrank again in the fourth quarter, leaving many Greeks scornful of promises of growth by Mr. Tsipras, whose popularity has slumped.

While he said the question of impeaching Mr. Trump was up to Congress, he assailed the president once again for his conduct in office even as he sought to position himself as focused on the issues of greatest immediate concern to voters: their health and economic security.
JPMorgan's $6.7 billion profit, also reported on Friday, breezed past Wall Street expectations. At an annualized 11 percent, it beat its cost of equity but needed help from a $475 million tax benefit and a $272 million accounting gain on credit adjustments. It also chose to set aside 20 percent of revenue to cover investment-banking compensation, compared with 26 percent a year ago. Factor all that in and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, presided over a 9.3 percent return on equity. It is trading at 1.4 times book value, however, implying more like 13.5 percent.
The upcoming election also sets the stage for a struggle over Virginia's future between those who believe that prosperity lies in wooing more businesses and those like Mr. Carter, who believe it comes from making businesses share more of their wealth. While Virginia is the 12th largest economy in the country by gross domestic product, according to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, it ranks 26th in income equality, according to the American Community Survey.
Markets have mixed feelings. Dow futures were up and Nasdaq futures were down as the prospect of a Democratic sweep became more likely. The thinking, market watchers say, is that the old-economy stocks in the Dow would benefit from a bigger economic stimulus, but tech stocks could be hurt by higher corporate taxes and stricter antitrust scrutiny.

China will still tax 57 percent of imports from the United States in retaliation, according to Mr. Bown, though it's possible some of those levies may be waived in the weeks to come.
New Year's resolutions often mean doing more, like working out more or saving more for retirement. But one common thread we found was that if you want to lower your climate footprint, you can find some success in simply consuming less. And it will save you money, too.
The guys in question were fellow members of the Tampa Bay Curling Club. Skerkowski, its 58-year-old founder, grew up playing the sport in Canada before moving in the early 1990s to Florida, where expanses of ice are as exotic as man-eating reptiles are commonplace. Two and a half decades later, when he heard that a huge skating complex would be opening in nearby Wesley Chapel, Skerkowski started ordering equipment and plotting to reserve three hours of weekly rink time, which the facility priced at $450 per hour. He would persuade a few dozen snowbirds to join him or eat his investment. In fact, when he offered demonstrations early last year to gauge interest, more than a hundred Floridians signed up: big, small, old, young, athletic, arthritic. All they had in common was their raw enthusiasm for the sport, matched by their near-total ignorance of how to play it.
There's a great deal to like about these accounts, which you can open and contribute to only if you are enrolled in a health insurance plan that has a pretty high deductible. They offer a rare triple threat to the tax man: You get a tax break on the money that goes in. You pay no taxes on the money as it grows, potentially over decades. Finally, you pay no taxes when the money comes out, as long as you use it on a long list of health expenditures.
It was, in addition, the worst stretch, to date, for coronavirus deaths in the United States. Records for daily fatalities were set on Wednesday and Thursday and were almost certain to be surpassed again and again. Furthermore, the wounds inflicted since the 2016 election seemed to be only deepening.
But when it comes to imposing reciprocal tariffs, trade analysts said the president's hands were somewhat tied. The relatively low tariffs that the United States charges on many foreign goods were hammered out through decades of bargaining and bartering at the World Trade Organization.
A below-the-radar story in Washington is that Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has just become the most powerful guy in town. With the Senate split 50-50 and Democrats in control, their most conservative member may find himself in the position of playing Solomon on major legislative items.

Bret: The one bright spot of the Trump years is an economy that has defied doomsayers and surpassed expectations with historically low unemployment and excellent stock-market returns. Those aren't small things, most of all to people who live at the margins or outside of the labor market, including people nearing retirement and looking expectantly at their portfolios.
Has it been a good experience?
The market held its gains, even as the rioters — incited by the president of the United States — stormed the Capitol and forced members of Congress to flee for safety.
Congress enacted a wide range of reforms that promised to restrain presidential power. The War Powers Act of 1973 created mechanisms to ensure that Congress authorized the deployment of American troops abroad. The Budget Reform of 1974 centralized the process used by the House and the Senate to make decisions about spending money so as to make the legislative branch more of an equal of the executive. The Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1974 established a system of public finance for presidential elections along with spending and contribution limits.
Thanks to his pal and protector Mitch, Trump has it both ways on issues like gun control and prescription drug prices. He can say he's in favor of change without taking any risk that anything will be presented for his signature into law. Mitch has it all covered — with a lid. The House passed more than 400 bills last year, and about 80 percent of them are sitting around moldering on the Senate runway.
Good advice about student loans can be hard to find: Repayment options can be overwhelming, colleges don't provide great counseling and loan collectors can be bad actors. That's why The New York Times has collected some of the best tips, tools and guides for families and students trying to figure out student debt.

The uncomfortable truth for the bill's supporters is that the tax cuts are substantially contributing to a widening federal budget deficit, which now appears on track to top $1 trillion this year. If growth fades in the coming years — as many economists believe it will — the cuts could exacerbate the deficit even more .

Many filers claiming those credits tend to file early because they depend on their tax refunds to pay off holiday credit-card debt or other bills. Nearly 70 percent of clients filing with the tax preparer Jackson Hewitt Tax Service in January and February of 2017 received at least one of those credits, according to the company.
Mr. Trump is correct about China's economy, which by several measures appears to be hobbled by American tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. But the president's confidence about the domestic economy largely ignores what others see as looming threats, including damage from a protracted federal government shutdown, the waning effects of Mr. Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cut and contagion from China's pain to American companies, farmers and consumers, Friday's data notwithstanding.
It's neoliberalism as an economic system — the deregulation and the disinvestment in support and care, Ms. Orgad said. But it's also neoliberalism as a rationality — how we as individuals internalize this idea that we are responsible for our lives and it's our fault if we fail, because we make choices.
It is wrong to believe that defined contribution plans are miracle solutions. Defined benefit plans now cover under a fifth of private-sector workers, down from 35 percent in the early 1990s. Weaker defined contribution plans like 401(k)'s have displaced them. They're not an adequate substitute because, to achieve the same level of income in retirement, employers and employees must set aside nearly twice as much money for a typical 401(k) as they would in a traditional pension.
The story of an invisible hand controlling assets from a protected distance might seem like an imaginative leap. Battles over estates are often the result of service providers charging a client — especially an elderly one — the most they can or of siblings taking large commissions to manage the financial affairs. Discrepancies can result simply from careless record-keeping.

British lawmakers approved Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal by a wide margin this past week, paving the way for the country to split from the European Union by the Jan. 31 deadline — finally! But don't expect a clean break. Brexit's second phase will require the country to wrangle a trade agreement with the European Union by the end of the year, which could be even trickier than getting Parliament on board. Given how messy this process has been so far, European officials have already offered to push the deadline to 2022, but Mr. Johnson is having none of it. So British businesses are still on alert for a no-deal Brexit at the start of 2021, which could disrupt trade and hurt the country's economy.

Mr. Cuomo also provided little detail about how the state would spend that revenue — a topic that has inspired intense speculation, with proposals ranging from subway repairs to criminal justice rehabilitation to tax relief. In budget documents, the governor's description of possible uses was just as far-flung, including beneficiaries such as small business development, substance abuse treatment and any other identified purpose recommended by a new cannabis office.

Fifteen hundred private jets have flown in here to hear Sir David Attenborough speak about how, you know, we're wrecking the planet, Mr. Bregman said, eliciting nervous chuckles from the crowd.

The regulation includes several changes from a proposal the Treasury Department issued in August. It now allows certain mutual-fund holders to benefit from the deduction if they have holdings in a real estate trust. It also provides far greater detail on the type of service businesses that are excluded from claiming the deduction above a certain income threshold. The law's drafters have said that limitation was meant to prevent certain high-earning individuals, such as lawyers, from reclassifying individual income as pass-through income, in order to reduce their tax bills.

If a corporate executive gets a $100,000 bonus for steering a company through a difficult year, while four $25,000-per-year restaurant workers lose their jobs entirely, the net effect on total compensation is zero — even though in human terms a great deal of pain has been incurred.

We need to do more. In addition to Albany taxing all vehicles and providing strong incentives to vehicles that are transporting more people per square yard, there is complementary policy work to be done by the City of New York. It should increase the cost of on-street parking where personal cars lie immobile 95 percent of the time, obstructing flow. We must allocate more space to modes that provide more throughput of people (bike, bus and high-occupancy-vehicle lanes).
As everyone who watched yesterday's events in Washington now understands, if they did not understand before, the rule of law is not just some lawyer's turn of phrase. It is the very foundation of our democracy. While introducing his nominee for attorney general, Merrick Garland, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said the nation needed to restore the independence and integrity of the Justice Department. Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday introduced his pick for attorney general, Judge Merrick B. Garland, declaring that the longtime federal jurist would serve as an impartial arbiter of justice and not as the president's personal attorney — a pointed rebuke of President Trump's approach. Judge Garland will be the people's lawyer, Mr. Biden declared at an event in Wilmington, Del. You won't work for me, Mr. Biden said of the leaders of his Justice Department. You are not the president or the vice president's lawyer. Your loyalty is not to me. It's to the law, the Constitution, the people of this nation, to guarantee justice. Mr. Biden also introduced three other nominees for top positions at the Justice Department, which experienced a period of increased politicization under Mr. Trump. And he began by angrily denouncing the riot at the Capitol on Wednesday incited by the outgoing president.
NORTH BRUNSWICK, N.J. — All the ingredients for a bustling downtown transit hub here are coming together: new townhouses, restaurants and big-box stores sit just off the busiest rail corridor in the country, as trains whiz by every 10 minutes or so.

quoted Mr. Brock's attorney, Brook Antonio II, as saying on Thursday that there was no direct evidence of him breaking into the Capitol or doing anything violent inside. The top federal prosecutor in Washington said this week that he expected the number of people charged with crimes tied to the Capitol riot to rise into the hundreds. The F.B.I. has received more than 126,000 photographic and video tips and as agents have scoured airline passenger manifests and video of air travelers to and from Washington to find potential suspects. The man who was photographed holding a Confederate battle flag inside the U.S. Capitol during the riot was arrested on Thursday in Delaware, two law enforcement officials said. The man, Kevin Seefried, was wanted by the F.B.I., which had sought help from the public to identify him and had widely circulated a dispatch plastered with images of him. In a bulletin, the agency said that it was looking for assistance to identify individuals who made unlawful entry into the Capitol, including Mr. Seefried. According to court documents, Mr. Seefried and his son, Hunter Seefried, were identified after the F.B.I. received a report from a co-worker of Hunter Seefried that said the man had bragged about being in the Capitol with his father on January 6.Mr. Seefried's son was also charged. A retired firefighter from Chester, Pa., was also arrested on Thursday after he was identified as the man seen in a video throwing a fire extinguisher at police officers during the riot.

Biden drops plan to outline economic priorities amid chaos in Washington. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. set aside plans to deliver a speech on the economy on Wednesday afternoon, instead calling for an end to violent protests in Washington and calling on President Trump to stop what he called an insurrection. Mr. Biden's speech was expected to emphasize several of his economic priorities, including reiterating calls for another round of financial aid to help people, businesses and state and local governments weather ongoing economic pain from the virus. Mr. Biden was also expected to touch on his Build Back Better agenda, including new government spending on clean energy, infrastructure, health care and education. The president-elect is still expected to deliver economic remarks in the coming days, and he will focus in particular on small businesses run by Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native Americans, who need additional resources to reopen and rebuild, a transition spokesman said. The president-elect's ability to push through many of the programs and polices he campaigned on appeared more likely on Wednesday, as Democrats edged closer to gaining two Senate seats after Tuesday's runoff election in Georgia. The Rev. Raphael Warnock was declared the winner of one seat, defeating Republican Kelly Loeffler, and Jon Ossoff, another Democrat, was leading the race against David Perdue.
The embrace of marijuana marks a fast evolution in Mr. Cuomo's thinking: Less than two years ago, he called it a gateway drug.

Connecticut is investigating Amazon's practices in the e-books market. Amazon quickly attracted regulatory attention after it introduced the Kindle e-reader. Credit... Michael Nelson/European Pressphoto Agency Connecticut's top law enforcement official said on Wednesday that he was conducting an antitrust investigation into how Amazon runs its e-books business. William Tong, Connecticut's attorney general, said in a statement that the state has an active and ongoing antitrust investigation into Amazon regarding potentially anticompetitive terms in the distribution agreements the company has for electronic books with some publishers. The investigation is the latest antitrust inquiry into Amazon to be publicly revealed. Officials in California and Washington have scrutinized how the company treats the independent merchants who use its marketplace. The Federal Trade Commission also has its own inquiry into the company, which critics say has grown into a dominant online retailer by crushing smaller competitors. A spokesman for Amazon declined to comment. The inquiry was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. Amazon got its start selling books in the 1990s. It introduced its Kindle e-books reader in 2007. The business quickly attracted regulatory attention. In 2012, the Department of Justice sued Apple, saying it had conspired with major publishers to raise the price of e-books beyond the $9.99 that Amazon charged. Connecticut was among the states that filed their own lawsuit against Apple. Mr. Tong, a Democrat, said in his statement that his office continues to aggressively monitor this market to protect fair competition for consumers, authors and other e-book retailers.

G.O.P. Senator Patrick Toomey says Trump 'committed impeachable offenses.' Senator Patrick Toomey said President Trump's behavior this week does disqualify him from serving. Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said on Saturday that President Trump had committed impeachable offenses, a sign of growing anger over Mr. Trump's role in the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol building. Mr. Toomey's remarks came as Democrats are preparing to bring articles of impeachment to the House floor as early as Monday over Mr. Trump's role in inciting a violent mob attack on the Capitol this week. I do think the president committed impeachable offenses, Mr. Toomey told The Journal Editorial Report on Fox News. In the interview, Mr. Toomey said Mr. Trump's behavior this week does disqualify him from serving. But he expressed doubts about the efficacy of impeachment with only 11 days remaining of the president's term in office, and added that he worried that House Democrats might attempt to politicize the impeachment process. Mr. Toomey, who has said he will not run for re-election when his term expires in 2022, has vocally opposed Republican-led efforts to object to certifying the election results. Only a handful of Republican lawmakers — including Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Senator Lisa Murkowski — have said that they believe Mr. Trump should vacate his term early, though neither of them have yet to endorse impeachment proceedings.

Federal authorities are said to be looking into Bitcoin donations made to people who breached the Capitol last week. Supporters of President Trump were forced off the Capitol grounds after a mob breached the building on Jan. 6. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times Federal authorities are investigating several Bitcoin donations made to right-wing figures ahead of the assault on the Capitol last week, according to a person briefed on the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. A single donor from France appears to have sent around $500,000 in Bitcoin in early December to several figures involved in far right activist circles, according to an investigation published Thursday by the cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis. Authorities are looking into whether the donations were linked to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. The existence of the investigation was first reported by Yahoo News. The single largest donation that Chainalysis found, which was worth around $250,000 at the time, went to a Bitcoin wallet owned by Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist who was at the Capital building on Jan. 6 and who called for violence before the event. Mr. Fuentes has previously mocked journalists on Twitter who asked him about his involvement in the event. Other donations went to the right-wing social media network Gab and the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, Chainalysis said. By Jan. 6, the value of the donations had grown because of the soaring price of Bitcoin.

Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a $1.9 trillion rescue package to combat the economic downturn and the Covid-19 crisis, outlining the type of sweeping aid that Democrats have demanded for months and signaling the shift in the federal government's pandemic response as Mr. Biden prepares to take office next week. The package includes more than $400 billion to combat the pandemic directly, including money to accelerate vaccine deployment and to safely reopen most schools within 100 days. An additional $350 billion would help state and local governments bridge budget shortfalls, while the plan would also include $1,400 direct payments to individuals, more generous unemployment benefits, federally mandated paid leave for workers and large subsidies for child care costs. During this pandemic, millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck, Mr. Biden said in a speech to the nation on Tuesday evening. There is real pain overwhelming the real economy.

It looks like things are finding a balance, he said.
Corporations and trade groups are far more likely than citizen groups to employ hired lobbyists and former government officials, and the average spending of corporations and trade groups on lobbying and campaign contributions routinely exceeds that of citizen groups by several multiples.

If there are any certainties, one will be that this party will eventually come to an end, James Stack, president of InvesTech Research, told me a year ago. And when it ends, it will end badly, and with high volatility.
Pressure on Trump intensifies as resignations and criticism roil waning days of his presidency. Trump supporters on Wednesday left broken windows, doors and furniture in the Capitol, as well as a defaced bust of President Zachary Taylor. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times With less than two weeks before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes the oath of office, it seemed on Thursday that the wheels might finally be coming off the Trump administration. In 24 hours, Congress reconvened in a Capitol breached and battered by a pro-Trump mob, formalized Mr. Biden's victory over the objections of more than 100 Republican lawmakers and found itself on the brink of impeaching President Trump a second time. A growing cohort of legislators, including at least one Republican, expressed support for stripping Mr. Trump of his powers under the 25th Amendment, even as Vice President Mike Pence — who would have to lead that process — was said to oppose the idea. On Capitol Hill, the number of Republicans willing to publicly defend Mr. Trump dwindled. One, Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, said he supported the invocation of the 25th Amendment; another, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, said he would not oppose the move if cabinet members decided to proceed. Several high-ranking administration officials announced that they would resign including two cabinet members, a late and purely symbolic gesture by people who had stood by Mr. Trump even as he promoted baseless claims of election fraud and repeatedly refused to accept his loss.
Mr. Biden and his aides have not yet finished the proposal or settled on its full amount. Forecasters expect further job losses this month, a casualty of the renewed surge of the coronavirus pandemic and state and local officials' impositions of lockdowns and other restrictions on economic activity meant to slow the spread.
Cathy Foy, manager at a TD Canada Trust branch in Gananoque, Ontario, across the St. Lawrence River from New York, noted that some Americans had summer homes in the area and that it was not unusual for them to open accounts to pay bills. We're seeing nothing but business as usual, she said.
Greece's creditors appear willing to provide new loans to pay off debts coming due this year as long as the country commits to achieving a fiscal surplus of 3.5 percent of gross domestic product before interest payments by 2018. The I.M.F., more sensibly, has argued for a surplus of 1.5 percent. It also says that European officials should commit to reducing the Greek government's debt, which is so huge that it equals about 180 percent of the country's annual economic output. That debt relief could come in various forms, including giving the country more time to repay or reducing the amount owed.

Good thing he didn't. When cities bid to host the Super Bowl, they agree to an extensive list of specifications, which include providing goods and services worth millions of dollars to the N.F.L., all at no cost to the league. The Star Tribune of Minneapolis obtained a copy of the 153-page bid book the N.F.L. sent to prospective hosts, and the bid committee told The Star Tribune it had agreed to a majority of the conditions laid out, thought it did not specify what it had rejected.
People don't even realize how deep it goes, Rob Kolb, a founder of Transmitter, said. We're a small business and it could potentially ruin us. You can't pay rent in two places without increasing revenue. and there's no way to increase revenue if you can't make beer.
The cost of student loan debt, repayment and default, when spread over the economy as a whole, is one of the main stumbling blocks toward economic prosperity (if not THE main stumbling block). On a personal level, my friends and I marvel each month at the amounts we are paying; if only we were spending this money on [insert name of slow-growth sector of the economy]!

The effective tax rate — the average annual property tax, as a percentage of the average estimated market value of homes in each area — was about 1.2 percent, around the same as the year before, Attom Data reported. States with the highest effective property tax rates included New Jersey, Illinois, Vermont, Texas and New Hampshire, all of which were above 2 percent.
Clothing? It's deductible only if it's mandatory for your job but unsuitable for everyday wear. If you can wear it in public, in a normal situation, it's not deductible, Mr. Lieberman said. A tuxedo or gown that you could wear to a work event or wedding would not be deductible, but a mechanic's outfit that says Amber's Auto Body Shop in large letters would be.
The immediate result was a 6 percent increase in beer prices and the end of a decades-long decline in real beer prices. Drinkers began paying almost $2 billion a year more for their beer. At least 5,000 Americans lost their jobs, and cost cutting followed, saving the new owners an estimated $2 billion. That money goes to those two conglomerates that have been able to reduce their tax bills and move much of their profits offshore.

The Army activated 1,100 troops of the D.C. National Guard to protect the Capitol. Credit... Spencer Platt/Getty Images President Trump initially rebuffed and resisted requests to mobilize the National Guard to quell violent protests at the Capitol, according to a person with knowledge of the events. In the end, it was Vice President Mike Pence, defense and administration officials said, who approved the order to deploy. It was unclear why Mr. Trump, who is still technically the commander in chief, did not give the order. The mobilization was initiated with the help of Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, among other officials, according to the person with knowledge of the events. Kash Patel, the chief of staff to Chris Miller, the acting defense secretary, responded: The acting secretary and the president have spoken multiple times this week about the request for National Guard personnel in D.C. During these conversations, the president conveyed to the acting secretary that he should take any necessary steps to support civilian law enforcement requests in securing the Capitol and federal buildings. The Army activated 1,100 troops of the D.C. National Guard, an Army official said Wednesday, and Virginia's governor dispatched members of the Virginia Guard along with 200 Virginia State Troopers to quell the violence in the nation's capital.

According to them, a standard American home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. In many places, that's what the prices roughly are. But for a few metropolitan areas like San Francisco and Boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market.
The six-bedroom house, which is operated as a bed-and-breakfast, was originally a tavern and inn, said the owner, Jacques Brouard. The buyer may use it as a private residence or continue to operate it as a B&B under the terms of a city permit, he said.
Society came to be seen as an atomized collection of individual economic units pursuing self-interest. Selfishness was normalized.

Derrick Evans, a West Virginia legislator who stormed the Capitol, has resigned. Credit... Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislature, via Associated Press Derrick Evans, a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, resigned on Saturday after participating in the storming of the United States Capitol. The past few days have certainly been a difficult time for my family, colleagues and myself, so I feel it's best at this point to resign my seat in the House and focus on my personal situation and those I love, Mr. Evans said in a statement. I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians. His resignation, which he submitted to Gov. Jim Justice in a one-sentence letter, is effective immediately. He also faces two federal charges: one for knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and one for violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. Mr. Evans, a Republican who was just elected to the West Virginia House in November, filmed himself entering the Capitol on Wednesday as part of a pro-Trump mob — incited by President Trump himself — intent on stopping Congress from formalizing President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory. Like many other members of the mob, he made no effort to conceal his involvement. We're in! he said in his video. We're in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!
Mass-market restaurants, where entree portions tend to be big enough to feed an N.B.A. starting five, are getting into the sharing craze, too.

How Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Will stimulus payments be taxed? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction?

Just when you thought things couldn't get worse for Boeing, the company turned up yet another bunch of damning internal emails. The latest included messages that mocked regulators and joked about safety flaws in the company's 737 Max jets — two of which later crashed, killing everyone on board and costing the company billions of dollars in lost business and legal fees. This airplane is designed by clowns, who are in turn supervised by monkeys, one employee wrote in 2017. The exchanges certainly won't help Boeing win back customer trust, or get its 737 Max fleet, which has been grounded since last year, back in the air anytime soon.
Concluding a yearlong graft investigation, the police recommended that Mr. Netanyahu face prosecution in two corruption cases: a gifts-for-favors affair known as Case 1000, and a second scandal, called Case 2000, in which Mr. Netanyahu is suspected of back-room dealings with Arnon Mozes, publisher of the popular newspaper Yediot Aharonot, to ensure more favorable coverage.
What is needed in Seattle — as well as San Francisco; Austin, Tex.; New York City; Boulder, Colo.; and other urban areas where the rapid influx of high-paid tech workers has made housing unaffordable for nearly everyone else — isn't a corporate takeover of housing policy but, rather, a per-employee head tax that would fund real investments in affordable housing, which should be a public good.

Several people told me about their memories of the SARS crisis of 2003, which killed hundreds of people in China. They're worried this could erupt into a full-blown epidemic. Of course, others say they're not very concerned and have faith that China can beat this. One common theme is people say they want the Chinese government to speak honestly about the severity of the outbreak — something that didn't happen during SARS.

Libya: The European Union's foreign policy chief, along with the foreign ministers of Britain, Germany, France and Italy, on Tuesday condemned continuing outside interference in the Libyan conflict.

Walmart stopped selling certain classes of ammunition after the massacre, but not all, so Ms. Margolles purchased a box of Winchester 12-gauge shells. Her large-format photograph of the shells is part of her spare but powerful new exhibition, El asesinato cambia el mundo / Assassination changes the world, at James Cohan gallery, in TriBeCa. Bright red with shiny metal ends, they are jumbled on a black surface in a pile that reminded me of a human heart with its valves and sinews. This ability to make visceral the ordinary tools and circumstances of murder is a hallmark of Ms. Margolles's work.
I've been thinking about this question for a while now, thanks mainly to some good-natured prodding from my colleague Gail Collins in our published conversations. The strongest version of the argument is this: Say what you will about Warren's or Sanders's policies, neither candidate poses any serious threat to our constitutional order, just as neither possesses Trump's crippling character flaws or has such contempt for the institutions, traditions and habits of a free and civilized society.
BlackRock, the giant money management corporation that oversees nearly $7 trillion in investments, announced that it will make investment decisions with environmental sustainability as a core goal moving forward. Which is a little rich, considering it's also a major investor in fossil fuel companies like Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil firm. But BlackRock's chief executive, Larry Fink, said that pressuring companies to be greener could still have a major effect on the market, and hopes other money managers will follow suit. He also said that the decision wasn't a political one, but rather a response to investor demand.
A.I.G.'s new target is at least an improvement on recent years. It also explains why a breakup appeals to Mr. Icahn. Mr. Hancock rejects the argument on purely financial grounds. The company's designation as a systemically important financial institution isn't onerous, costing only $150 million extra a year. That could change once regulators complete the rules for insurers.
Apple is gearing up for a legal fight with the Justice Department to defend the privacy of its customers' iPhones — or more specifically, two phones used by the gunman behind a deadly shooting last month at a naval base in Florida. Federal authorities are demanding that Apple unlock the man's phones for the sake of public safety. But the tech giant says it is committed to protecting its users' information, stating that Americans do not have to choose between weakening encryption and solving investigations. The conflict puts Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, in a tricky spot if he wants to stay in Mr. Trump's good graces. Their alliance has kept Apple relatively unscathed by trade tensions with China — so far.

Hamburg, Germany — LAST week a United Nations panel ruled that Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks who has been living in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden, had been arbitrarily detained, and called for his immediate release. Though Mr. Assange says he will remain in the embassy, the ruling was hailed by his legions of supporters, who saw it as a rare instance of justice for a man they believe has been persecuted for exposing government secrets.
Who believes that America can remain a great country and not lead the next great global industry? Not me. A Green New Deal, in other words, is a strategy for American national security, national resilience, natural security and economic leadership in the 21st century. Surely some conservatives can support that.
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts, the spokesman, Richard Azzopardi, said. Unemployment is down across upstate New York, and private sector jobs are up. In a jab at Syracuse officials, he added that the state had the highest standard for contracting with minority and female-owned businesses in the country — much higher than the City of Syracuse, which also has no consistent policy for local hires on city projects.

Andrew M. Cuomo has said roughly five million essential workers across the state, including more than 800,000 education workers and about 200,000 public safety and public transit workers would be eligible for vaccination, along with about 1.3 million people over 75. On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo declined to immediately expand the pool beyond Phase 1A. There isn't supply, he reiterated on Wednesday, adding that only 950,000 doses had been distributed so far, and there were more than 2.1 million health care workers in the highest priority group. Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, on Tuesday urged states not to stick rigidly to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines about whom to vaccinate first. He said that if fewer health care workers agree to be vaccinated states should move quickly to other priority groups. At Mr. de Blasio's news conference on Wednesday, Dr. Dave A. Chokshi, the city's health commissioner, said that each of us knows and has worried about an aging parent or grandparent during this pandemic. We must do everything that we can for them. Mr. de Blasio described a preregistration system that would allow older New Yorkers to reserve a time to get vaccinated, reducing the risk of long lines that could spread the virus, like those that bedeviled inoculation efforts for older people in Florida. He said that seniors would be able to register by phone, a method that many of them prefer.
To the members of Congress who dropped their opposition to the counting of the Electoral College votes in the wake of Wednesday's events: Really?

That was such a bad decision from the court, Mr. Trump asserted, that even his predecessor, when he signed the DACA, with the executive order, made a statement to the effect, this isn't going to work. (President Barack Obama did not sign an executive order to implement the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He announced it as a Department of Homeland Security policy in a speech in 2012. He did not say it would not work, but called it a temporary stopgap.)

Mr. Trump's role in the carnage underpins the articles of impeachment that House Democrats have drawn up, accusing the president of inciting an insurrection. The U.S. attorney in Washington initially refused to rule out investigating Mr. Trump's role in the riot. A day later, one of his deputies reversed his statement during a news conference. Don't expect any charges of that nature, Ken Kohl, a top prosecutor in the office, told reporters on Friday. In their letter to Mr. Wray, House Democratic leaders — including the heads of the Oversight, Judiciary, Homeland Security, Intelligence and Armed Services committees — said that Mr. Trump incited his supporters to travel to Washington and menace members of Congress. They cited a statement that Mr. Trump made on Twitter last month and comments he made at a rally just before protesters walked to the Capitol and ransacked it: We got to get rid of the weak Congress people, the ones that aren't any good, Mr. Trump said, telling his followers to if you don't fight like Hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. Near the end of his speech, he told his supporters, We're going [to] walk down to the Capitol. You'll never take back our country with weakness, he added. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong. The Democrats said that they wanted to know how the F.B.I.

First Nations do not include the Inuit of the far north or the Metis, a people of mixed ancestry.

La Barra is in the Maldonado Department (with a population of around 165,000), which encompasses Punta del Este. Once primarily a fishing village, it has become increasingly popular during the summer season, from December to February, offering restaurants, clubs, shops and art galleries, as well as surfing and other water sports, to beach-seeking tourists.
The E.U. drug regulator approves the Moderna vaccine. The European Medicines Agency has come under criticism for taking too long to authorize vaccines. Credit... Cooper Neill for The New York Times The European Union drug regulator approved the Moderna coronavirus vaccine on Wednesday after moving up a decision that had been scheduled for later in January. The regulator, the European Medicines Agency, approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in late December after coming under criticism for being too slow, as Britain and the United States began rolling out vaccination campaigns before the European Union had even granted the drugs authorization. The bloc, which is home to about 450 million people in 27 countries, has taken the lead in approving and ordering the vaccines on behalf of its members. The Pfizer vaccination was introduced in the final days of 2020 in most European Union countries, a few weeks behind Britain and the United States, but criticism has been growing that the process is taking too long and that there are not enough doses to go around yet. The European Union has said that the availability of shots will pick up, along with production. The European Medicines Agency, which is based in Amsterdam, has also been criticized for not yet having started a review of the University of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine which has recently been approved for use in Britain and in India.
WASHINGTON — Michael D. Cohen, President Trump's former personal lawyer who implicated him in a scheme to pay hush money to two women claiming to have had affairs with him, said on Thursday that he had agreed to testify before a House committee next month and give a full and credible account of his work for Mr. Trump.

The exact timing of Ms. Warren's announcement — Dec. 31 — is significant. It means that in a few weeks, she will have to report her fund-raising totals for the fourth quarter of 2018, which will reveal how much she received on Day 1 in small-donor contributions — a key benchmark for popularity for Democrats in the nominating race.

Mr. Biden's rescue proposal, which would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing, flows from the idea that the virus and the recovery are intertwined and that the economy cannot rebound without mass vaccine deployment.
Medicaid also helped Kansas Democrats win a 2018 election for governor, and on Thursday the state's Democratic governor, Laura Kelly, and its Republican State Senate leader, Jim Denning, announced the details of their compromise to expand the program. The state will implement the expansion, covering up to 150,000 additional Kansans. In return, Republicans will get a pilot program meant to reduce private health insurance premiums and keep people from dropping existing insurance and signing up for Medicaid, paid for an increase in the state cigarette tax by a $1 per pack. The proposal would also allow the state to charge recipients a premium of up to $25 per individual and $100 per family. If and when it becomes law, Kansas will become the 37th state to expand its Medicaid program.

But the law enforcement official said that it was too soon to expect a raft of conspiracy charges. Such cases can be tough to prove in court, and investigators would need to seek additional evidence of coordination, such as financial ties, planning around logistics and travel or messages between any alleged group members. On Thursday, the Justice Department charged two off-duty police officers from Rocky Mount, Va., Jacob Fracker and Thomas Robertson, with unlawful entry and disorderly conduct in connection with the riots. Mr. Robertson said on social media that the media and the left were upset because we actually attacked the government who is the problem and not some random small business, according to the criminal complaint. Keep poking us, Mr. Robertson warned. In a nod to concerns that members of the military might have been involved in or supported the Capitol riots, the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff issued an unusual message to all military personnel this week, reminding them that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. would soon be their commander-in-chief and that they must continue to defend the Constitution. The Defense Department declined on Thursday to directly address whether members of the military were involved in attacking the Capitol. We in the Department of Defense are doing everything we can to eliminate extremism, said Garry Reid, the Pentagon's director for defense intelligence. He said that all members of the military, including members of the National Guard, go through extensive screening for participation in hate groups and militias.

Vice President Mike Pence taking part in a joint session of Congress to certify the 2020 election results on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times A lobbying group for the manufacturing industry — an entity once aligned with the Trump administration — urged Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday to utilize powers within the constitution to remove President Trump from office after Mr. Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. In a lengthy statement, the National Association of Manufacturers termed the violent incursion at the Capitol complex as mob rule that it said was fueled by Mr. Trump. The 14,000-member group, which last year honored Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter, said that Mr. Trump was not fit for office. This is sedition and should be treated as such, the group said. The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy. The association called on Mr. Pence to use a constitutional mechanism that provides the vice president and a majority of the cabinet — the officials who lead executive agencies — with the ability to declare that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.
The administration is also expected to soon roll out its $1.5 trillion infrastructure package, which would include $200 billion in new federal spending, offset by unspecified cuts elsewhere.
However, I believe that the priorities favored by the more progressive candidates make them more electable: accessible and affordable health care, a Manhattan Project to combat climate change, regulations targeting corporate and government corruption, affordable college education and a more progressive tax system designed to decrease income inequality.
Wait, that can't be right. He must mean something else.
What he proposed was: to give the lower house of Parliament more power to pick cabinet ministers, including the prime minister, all of whom are currently proposed by the president and rubber-stamped by the legislature; to bar a president from serving more than two terms over all (it's currently two consecutive terms); and to give some teeth to the currently toothless State Council.

The bill would allow hundreds of smaller banks to avoid certain elements of federal oversight, including stress tests, which measure a bank's ability to withstand a severe economic downturn. Under current law, banks with assets of $50 billion or more are considered systemically important financial institutions and therefore governed by stricter rules. The bill would raise that threshold to institutions with assets of $250 billion or more, leaving fewer than 10 big banks in the United States subject to the stricter oversight.

Mr. Pence has spent the past several days in a delicate dance, seeking at once to convey to the president that he does not have the authority to overturn the results of the election, while also placating the president to avoid a rift that could torpedo any hopes Mr. Pence has of running in 2024 as Mr. Trump's loyal heir.
The broad-brush approach of Why Liberalism Failed is short on specifics. But the author might have chosen, for instance, out of countless examples, David Porter's essay, A Wanton Chase in a Foreign Place: Hogarth and the Gendering of Exoticism in the Eighteenth Century Interior, a recommended text for art history courses at British colleges, such as the Open University. Mr. Porter focuses on the second engraving in the series Marriage A-la-Mode, by the 18th-century British painter and printmaker, William Hogarth. It shows an unhappy husband and wife in a fashionable interior. Hogarth satirizes the wife for her penchant for Oriental porcelain, because, according to Mr. Porter, to grant the validity of Chinese taste would legitimate a regime not only of female aesthetic self-determination, but also of the autonomy of female desire more generally conceived.

What the economy needs is a successful rollout of the vaccines, and reduction in the risks of social and economic activity, said Aaron Sojourner, a labor economist at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management who served in the White House Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama and Trump administrations. That will go a long way toward promoting recovery. It won't go all the way, but it will go a long way.
Competitors like Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have also reported declines in the so-called fixed-income trading business, but none quite as large as Goldman's. Bank of America said Wednesday that revenue from its trading businesses was down 13 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. Citigroup's was down 18 percent, the bank said Tuesday.

Mr. Sanders said in the interview that he wanted an initial, emergency stimulus package to be big. He thinks it must include an additional $1,400 in direct payments for adults and children, on top of the $600 that Congress just passed, along with money for states and cities to fund coronavirus vaccine distribution, testing and contact tracing. He also wants to create an emergency universal health care program, so that anyone can get medical treatment during the pandemic, whether they currently have insurance or not.

Coined by the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, the term Davos Man refers to an economic elite who built unheard-of fortunes on the seemingly high-minded notions of free trade, low taxes and low regulation that they championed. And they were not the only beneficiaries, according to their reasoning. What benefited them would benefit men and women on the lower rungs of economic life around the globe.

People on terrorism watch list are said to have been part of crowd in Washington on the day of Capitol riot. A mob of Trump supporters overtake the Capitol last week. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times Several people on a terrorist watch list were in Washington last week for pro-Trump events that ultimately devolved into the assault on the Capitol, according to a government official briefed on the Justice Department investigation into the riot. Most are suspected white supremacists, according to The Washington Post, which first reported on their status on the list. It was not clear how many people on the watch list were part of the mob that stormed the Capitol. But their presence in Washington last week adds to the urgent questions about security preparations for the events of Jan. 6, ahead of which thousands of supporters of President Trump had vowed to travel to Washington to disrupt, even violently, the congressional certification of the Electoral College results of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s win. The people were listed on the government's main terrorism watch list, the Terrorism Screening Database, one of several databases of people that law enforcement and intelligence officials have deemed to be known or suspected terrorists. The tool has undergone explosive growth in the era following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. As the lists were rapidly growing over a decade ago, the F.B.I.
The bulk of the payments have already been sent out. More than 147 million payments, totaling $142 billion, have been scheduled: 113 million were issued through direct deposit (which presumably include the bounced payments), while 34 million will be delivered through paper checks and debit cards, according to I.R.S. figures provided to the House Ways and Means Committee.
But Scott owes his chart-topping position to the 79,000 copies of JackBoys that his fans were credited with buying. The vast majority were delivered as part of sales bundles by Scott, one of music's most aggressive and successful merchandise strategists.

(One item that apparently did not contribute to its chart position was Scott's edition of Reese's Puffs breakfast cereal.)
How permanent will the costs be?
The six largest banks in the United States will report their fourth-quarter results this week. If they report lower than expected numbers, the news could be read as another canary in the coal mine for a potential economic slowdown. Most banks have booked record returns for almost a year, thanks to tax cuts and a humming economy, but volatile markets at the end of 2018 could have put an end to this streak. Citigroup will release its earnings on Monday, followed by JPMorgan and Wells Fargo on Tuesday and Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America on Wednesday.

Here are some factors to consider:
You can argue that as a practical matter, the rule won't matter much if at all. On one side, paygo is the law, whether Democrats put it in their internal rules or not. On the other side, the law can fairly easily be waived, as happened after the G.O.P.'s huge 2017 tax cut was enacted.
The Government Accountability Office , a nonpartisan federal watchdog agency, signaled that it would look into what role, if any, members of Congress may have played in inciting the mob of Trump supporters who breached metal barricades and shattered windows on Jan. 6, seeking to overturn the results of the election.
Ms. Pelosi has argued that it is Mr. Trump's intransigence — and Mr. McConnell's refusal to allow a vote on House bills that would reopen the government but not fund a border wall, despite the Senate's passage of such a measure last month — that is putting the nation at risk.
Steven Pearlstein, a columnist at the Washington Post, in his 2018 book Can American Capitalism Survive? describes this negative feedback loop succinctly:
Twitter and Simon & Schuster did not violate the First Amendment, but some say there are reasons to question their actions. A protester carries a sign in front of the U.S. Capitol on Saturday. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times When Simon & Schuster canceled its plans this week to publish Senator Josh Hawley's book, he called the action a direct assault on the First Amendment. And when Twitter permanently banned President Trump's account on Friday, his family and his supporters said similar things. We are living Orwell's 1984, Donald Trump Jr. said — on Twitter. Free-speech no longer exists in America. The companies' decisions may have been unwise, scholars who study the First Amendment said, but they were perfectly lawful. That is because the First Amendment prohibits government censorship and does not apply to decisions made by private businesses. It is certainly possible to violate the values embodied in the First Amendment without violating the First Amendment itself. But the basic legal question could hardly be more straightforward, said RonNell Andersen Jones, a law professor at the University of Utah. And, she said, it should not have been lost on Mr. Hawley, who graduated from Yale Law School and served as a law clerk to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. It's become popular — even among those who plainly know better — to label all matters restricting anyone's speech as a 'First Amendment issue,' she said.
About five million potentially eligible people fail to claim the earned-income tax credit annually, according to a report from the Tax Policy Center.

Chris Hughes was raised by Lutheran parents in Hickory, N.C., and they taught him, by example, to tithe. Every year, they gave 10 percent of their income to the church and other local charities, and Mr. Hughes carried that tradition into adulthood.

Mr. Trump acknowledged yesterday that he and one of his executives have used the name John Baron in some of their business dealings. He did not explain. And he was not asked about Mr. Szabo's allegation.
Current law enforcement officials have not gone so far as to acknowledge Mr. Trump's role in encouraging the attack. The acting attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, called the violence at the Capitol an intolerable attack on a fundamental institution of our democracy, and said that law enforcement officials were working to find, arrest and charge rioters. And the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, said that the bureau would pursue those involved in criminal activity during the mayhem. Also on Thursday, the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, Eric S. Dreiband, told his staff that he was leaving the Trump administration effective the following day. While many department leaders left after the election, his abrupt announcement took some people who worked for him by surprise. He did not cite a reason or say whether his departure was tied to Mr. Trump's conduct and the riots, but he quoted Martin Luther King Jr. at length, saying: Let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness. Let us stand with a greater determination. And let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge to make America what it ought to be.
For Russia, trying to influence the incoming Trump administration's policy on Ukraine was of paramount importance. The economic sanctions imposed after Russia annexed Crimea damaged the Russian economy, and various emissaries have tried to convince administration officials to broker a resolution to a long-running guerrilla war between Russia and Ukraine.
The 2017 tax cut has received pretty bad press, and rightly so. Its proponents made big promises about soaring investment and wages, and also assured everyone that it would pay for itself; none of that has happened.
Google applied this policy for a month after the election and prohibited political ads to help prevent the spread of misinformation through advertising. Last week, in the immediate aftermath of the riot, Google initially stopped accepting ads that referred to the event. After the polls closed on Nov. 3, Facebook also placed restrictions on political ads in the United States in an attempt to minimize the spread of election-related misinformation.
Certain financial truisms — like past performance is no guarantee of future results— are repeated so often that they can easily be ignored. But they are truisms for a reason. Past performance really is no guarantee of future results.
Doing this has never been easy. Institutions of higher education are dependent on state and federal funding, including tax exemptions, research funds and scholarship support. Pressures from within also exist, often inspired by students and faculty members seeking to create a consensus of belief that can marginalize disagreement and dissent. Nevertheless, the key to the astonishing success and international superiority of the American university, particularly in science and engineering, has been its resilient commitment to freedom and nondiscrimination, and its respect for truth, no matter how uncomfortable.

The report did show one area of increasing revenue — from Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs. Revenue from levies on imported steel, aluminum and Chinese goods were up $8 billion from the same quarter a year ago, an 83 percent increase. That increase, however, is nowhere close to the levels needed to support Mr. Trump's frequent claims that his tariffs will help pay down the national debt.

Supporters of President Trump outside the door to the House chamber after breaching Capitol security during a riot last week. Credit... Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA, via Shutterstock Federal investigators working to apprehend and charge the hundreds of people connected to last week's assault on the Capitol are focusing on any military and law enforcement personnel who may have been involved in the attack, according to a law enforcement official. Investigators also have yet to find any evidence that any member of Congress helped coordinate the siege, as one prominent leader of a pro-Trump group has claimed, but are scrutinizing those leads. The official cautioned that the investigation is sprawling and that all leads need to be carefully vetted. The F.B.I. and Justice Department have already arrested several suspects who were captured in photographs inside the Capitol, including Kevin Seefried, a man who was photographed holding a Confederate battle flag; Jake Angeli, a well-known QAnon conspiracy theorist who was seen carrying a spear and wearing a fur headdress with horns; and Robert Keith Packer, who was photographed wearing a Camp Auschwitz sweatshirt. Other insurrectionists moved through the chaos inside the building in tight military formation, using hand signals and wearing tactical gear, and investigators are seeking to determine whether they were working together or whether any had ties to law enforcement or the military.

Bret: Trump also has been able to get only a fraction of his agenda through Congress. The wall with Mexico is largely unbuilt. We still take in hundreds of thousands of immigrants every year, including from majority-Muslim countries (though the numbers are declining). Our sanctions on Russia are still in place, and we haven't abandoned NATO. But I still wish Trump had never been elected in the first place.

Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times A group of President Trump's most strident allies in the House is calling on Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, to resign from her leadership post after she voted to impeach Mr. Trump, dramatizing the bitter rifts within the party and setting up a messy internal feud that could define its future. Members of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, including the chairman, Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, as well as Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Matt Gaetz of Florida, are circulating a petition calling on Ms. Cheney to step down from her role as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, arguing that her vote to impeach Mr. Trump had brought the conference into disrepute and produced discord. Ms. Cheney was one of 10 Republicans to break with the party on Wednesday and vote to charge the president with incitement of insurrection for his role in urging on a mob that stormed the Capitol. One of those 10 cannot be our leader, Mr. Gaetz said in an interview on Fox News's Hannity on Wednesday evening. It is untenable, unsustainable, and we need to make a leadership change. Ms. Cheney has brushed aside calls to step down, saying that she was not going anywhere and calling her break with Mr. Trump a vote of conscience.
Don't forget this: Apple makes their product in China, he said. I told Tim Cook, who is a friend of mine and who I like a lot: 'Make your product in the United States. Build those big, beautiful plants that go on for miles, it seems. Build those plants in the United States.'

WASHINGTON — The Democratic presidential candidate Michael R. Bloomberg released a job creation plan on Wednesday that frames America's economic divide primarily in regional terms — and not along the rich-versus-everyone-else class lines favored by his more populist rivals.
Some anxious Americans say they have at least considered the option of opening bank accounts in Canada, figuring that stashing some money outside of the country may provide peace of mind in uncertain times.
The accuracy of this prediction is beyond any serious challenge. It has been corroborated in private telephone conversations, confidential memorandums, public entreaties and published analyses by Wall Street wheeler-dealers, political pundits, friends and colleagues and a nearly unanimous cadre of Democratic Party operatives throughout the nation.

Inauguration security With heightened security underway, officials try to offer assurances that the inauguration will be safe. National Guard troops deployed to the Capitol stood guard on Thursday near where the inauguration will happen next week. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times In a briefing with Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday, federal law enforcement officials sought to assure the public that the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Jan. 20 would be safe after the widely publicized security failures that allowed supporters of President Trump to violently storm the Capitol last week. Christopher Wray, the director of the F.B.I., acknowledged that the bureau was seeing an extensive amount of concerning online chatter surrounding the inauguration — including plans for armed protests both in Washington and at state capitol buildings around the country — and said agents were trying to distinguish real threats from aspirational plotting. Mr. Wray added that the F.B.I. had arrested more than 100 people and identified more than 200 suspects since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, and said, Anyone who plots or attempts violence in the coming week should count on a visit. James Murray, the director of the Secret Service, said he had been asked how Americans could be confident in inauguration security given the violence last Wednesday, which led to several deaths.
U.S. states struggle to roll out coronavirus vaccines. New York abruptly loosened its guidelines, after medical providers were forced to discard doses because of difficulties finding qualified patients. Florida's distribution plans are in disarray as demand far outstrips supply. And federal officials are being criticized for supplying syringes that can't efficiently extract all the liquid from vials.
Last year was a tumultuous one for American farmers and manufacturers as President Trump squabbled with trading partners around the world. American banks, however, had a ball.
Jan. 6, 2021, 11:22 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2021, 11:22 p.m. ET Washington, D.C. mayor issues order extending emergency for 15 days. Supporters of President Donald Trump climb up the side of the Capitol to enter in protest. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington on Wednesday night issued an order extending the city's public emergency for 15 days, warning that extremists who support President Trump might continue to wreak havoc in the nation's capital. The order empowers officials to reduce the hours of operation for businesses, order people off the street if a curfew is issued, and expend funds as needed to protect public safety. The directive, which will expire at 3 p.m. on Jan. 21, extends the emergency through the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Jan. 20. It came hours after Ms. Bowser imposed a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. on Wednesday until 6 a.m. on Thursday. In a statement explaining the extension, Ms. Bowser pointed to the pro-Trump protesters who came to the city for the purpose of engaging in violence and destruction and have engaged in violence and destruction. They have fired chemical irritants, bricks, bottles, and guns, Ms. Bowser wrote. They have breached the security of the Capitol and their destructive and riotous behavior has the potential to spread beyond the Capitol.

BlackRock's big move on climate change
LONDON — At the ports and terminals on Britain's southeastern coast, a new era began on Friday morning without much fuss. Ferries and trains that carry goods to France from Dover and Folkestone were running on time, and drivers snaked their trucks into the port unencumbered by congestion.
The company, led by Jeff Bezos, started the process in typically innovative fashion in September by issuing an unusual and very public request for proposals. Fully 238 localities in the United States, Canada and Mexico submitted bids, lured by the prospect of $5 billion in investment and a promised 50,000 jobs with compensation averaging over $100,000 each.
Mr. Sanders said he had been speaking with Mr. Biden about the scale and timing of stimulus legislation. He said that he did not intend to try to force his long-held priorities, such as Medicare for all, into a relief bill. However, he does intend to test the legal bounds of how reconciliation can be used so that Democrats can pass policies that go beyond traditional budget items and address structural problems in American society.
This three-story stone house was built in 1900 in Westmount, a city of 21,000 people situated on the heavily wooded western slope of Mount Royal, about 10 minutes from downtown Montreal. Most of the homes in the area were built between 1880 and 1920 and have been owned by some of Canada's wealthiest families over the years, said Joseph Montanaro, a broker with Sotheby's International Realty in Quebec, which is listing the property. Westmount is the most expensive neighborhood in Montreal, Mr. Montanaro said.
The Girl Scouts of Greater New York announced this week that they were trying to get out of a 15-year lease in a Manhattan building owned by the Trump Organization. Meridith Maskara, chief executive of the Girl Scouts chapter, said it was a matter of very high priority.
The drug would be available to adults 21 and older and subject to local veto, with counties and large cities able to opt out. Mr. Cuomo estimated that legalization would bring in $300 million each year in tax revenue by the time it was fully implemented. But that would not be until 2023, according to Mr. Cuomo's budget director, Robert Mujica.
The court filing includes a copy of the I.R.S.'s notice of deficiency, dated June 2020, which said that the estate owes an additional $32.4 million in federal taxes from 2016, as well as a $6.4 million accuracy-related penalty. Comerica has requested a trial in St. Paul, Minn., over the dispute.
This is very serious. It could potentially change commonly accepted market practices, said Kenneth Mullen, a partner at the London-based law firm Withers. Due diligence is going to be fundamental. It does seem to mark a shift toward a more regulated industry.

We sure did not take the most direct path to get here, but here we are, said Mr. Schumer, happy with the outcome any way he could get it, a result that put him in reach of fulfilling his ambition of becoming majority leader after four years as the chief of the minority.
And as he leaves office, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are already at work on ethics changes that aim to prevent some of his most egregious behavior from becoming normalized.
I think Kennedy, 20 years earlier, moved the country in a fundamentally different direction. So I think a lot of it just has to do with the times.
Mr. Abdo Benítez belongs to a more conservative wing of the party than the departing president, Horacio Cartes. His election follows transitions of power in Argentina, Brazil and Chile, where conservative or center-right leaders have defeated socialist parties in recent years.
The college funds are investment options in CollegeAmerica, a 529 college-savings plan sponsored by the state of Virginia. (That 529 refers to a provision of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and anyone can invest in the funds, not just Virginians, though the tax benefits may differ for people in other states.) The 2024 fund lost 1.27 percent in the fourth quarter, while the 2027 fund lost 3.26 percent. The 2024 fund has an expense ratio of 0.73 percent, while the 2027 has one of 0.8 percent.

When Mr. Trump told him of the undocumented workers, Mr. Sullivan said he responded: ''I think you are nuts. You are here negotiating a lease in Atlantic City for a casino license and you are telling me you have got illegal employees on the job.''
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada will head down on Monday for his first meeting with President Trump. While the two men are polar opposites politically and in style, the economic importance of the United States to Canada has meant that Mr. Trudeau has studiously refrained from directly criticizing the new president or his policies. Their meeting follows a parade of Canadian cabinet minsters last week to Washington. Mr. Trump's protectionist stance on trade is a particular worry to Canada, which counts on exports to the United States for about a quarter of its gross domestic product. While Chrystia Freeland, Mr. Trudeau's foreign minister, warned the Trump administration not to impose a border tax during her visit to Washington, Canada has said it would welcome reopening the North American Free Trade Agreement to make some changes. The two leaders may also discuss Mr. Trump's decision to conditionally approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline project form Alberta's oil sands, a project blocked by the Obama administration. Ian Austen
His death was announced on Monday by Bandai Namco, the business where he retained the title of honorary adviser. No cause was given, and the company did not say where he died.
And there were many enablers — educated, smart, articulate, often wealthy people who were willing to ignore Mr. Trump's threat to democracy in the name of economic growth, lower taxes, lighter regulations, or simply access and proximity to power.
American colleges and universities, public and private, are properly seen as nonpartisan elements in civil society, committed to research and teaching in a manner that transcends ordinary politics. But to succeed, these institutions must ensure that academic freedom and the highest standards of scholarship prevail. This means respect for the rules of evidence, rigorous skepticism and the honoring of the distinction between truth and falsehood.
More than 47,000 Americans died by suicide in 2017, and with other so-called deaths of despair — drug overdoses and alcoholism — it has grown into a slow-motion public health crisis. The phenomenon is difficult to study, and researchers have struggled to find effective prevention strategies.
That doesn't need much to succeed
Most Americans benefit from good roads, bridges and public transportation. With gridlock and partisan bickering in Washington, increasing funding for the Highway Trust Fund and its Mass Transit Account could be a critical issue on which both the president and Congress can agree.
For all the attacks on the CARES Act that Congress passed in late March, the degree to which it served to support the incomes of Americans, especially those who lost jobs, is extraordinary.
Mr. Beutner has been steadfast in his support for charters, saying they give parents more choices and are an essential option in Los Angeles. But Mr. Beutner has pushed back at the union's claim that he wants to shut down traditional public schools.
We are appalled and condemn these actions in the strongest possible terms and have communicated that to R.A.G.A., said John Demming, a spokesman for Comcast, which donated $200,000 last year, according to Documented. The company would seek assurances that they take steps to ensure that nothing like this would happen again, he said.
That program was flooded with new applicants after the sudden closure of more than 40 campuses operated by Dream Center Education Holdings, which imploded last year. The schools failed after Dream Center improperly withheld millions of dollars in federal aid money that was owed to students and used the cash to cover operating expenses. More than 25,000 students were affected by the closure.
He is a conservative media personality with deep ties to the evangelical community, a critical part of Mr. Trump's base. But Mr. Sekulow does not possess extensive experience in the proceedings that Mr. Trump will face in the Senate.
Bret: Let's assume President Sanders got just one-third of his agenda through Congress. What would that mean? Dramatic cuts in defense spending that would leave us and our allies even more vulnerable to Russian or Chinese aggression. One or two huge new government spending programs that would weigh on fiscal balance sheets for generations. Punitive tax increases on billionaires, who have the means and the savvy to move their assets offshore, and major tax hikes on people who aren't anywhere near as rich, and who can't avoid taxes. Declining incentives for investment; ever-growing incentives for political corruption as a way of gaining favors from the state.

Amazon says it will spend $2 billion to address a shortage of affordable housing. Amazon's Seattle campus. The company is pledging more than $2 billion to affordable housing in three regions where it has or is building a large corporate presence. Credit... Grant Hindsley for The New York Times Amazon said it was pledging more than $2 billion to affordable housing in three regions where it had or was building a large corporate presence, becoming the latest tech giant to make a large push into addressing housing costs in their hometowns. The resources, which will largely be in the form of low-cost loans, look to preserve or create 20,000 housing units in the Seattle, Northern Virginia and Nashville areas, the company said in a release. The company said it would pair the loans with $125 million in grants for government agencies and nonprofit and other organizations working to address racial equity in housing. As housing costs in tech hubs have skyrocketed in recent years, tech companies have put money into developing housing programs aimed at low- and middle-income families. Microsoft has pledged $750 million in the Seattle region since early 2019. In California, Apple, Facebook and Google have committed a combined $4.5 billion to efforts in the past two years. In Seattle, Amazon has worked closely with Mary's Place, an organization that provides shelter for women and families, including building a shelter in one of its new office buildings.
The economic uncertainty that roiled the stock market at the end of 2018 hurt Citigroup's trading business, the bank said on Monday, as a busy week of quarterly earnings reports by the country's largest banks got off to a shaky start.
The current crop of federal banking regulators, picked by President Trump, is now proposing to let banks pump less money into lower-income communities, and even to claim credit for lending that does not benefit those communities. One egregious example: Banks could count loans for improvements to stadiums that happen to sit in poor neighborhoods.
Achieving this outcome won't be easy. It will require honorable people who have served in the Trump administration to share, publicly, what they have seen and what they believe. (At this point, anonymous leaks are not sufficient.) It will require congressional Republicans to acknowledge that they let a con man take over their party and then defended that con man. It will require Democrats and progressive activists to understand that a rushed impeachment may actually help Trump remain in office.
Calling it one of the darkest days in the history of our nation, Mr. Biden forcefully laid blame at the feet of Mr. Trump, pointing to his conduct not just in the aftermath of the November election, but over the past four years. What we witnessed yesterday was not dissent, Mr. Biden said. It was not disorder. It was not protest. It was chaos. They weren't protesters. Don't dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob, insurrectionists, domestic terrorists. It's that basic. It's that simple. And I wish we could say we couldn't see it coming, he continued. But that isn't true. We could see it coming. Mr. Biden also spoke of how the rioters were treated by law enforcement. No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn't have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol, he said. We all know that's true, and it is unacceptable. Totally unacceptable. The position of attorney general had been the most prominent role in Mr. Biden's cabinet that was still unfilled with Inauguration Day approaching. Judge Garland currently serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. President Barack Obama nominated him to the Supreme Court in 2016 after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but Senate Republicans blocked his nomination.
Mr. Verlander, for example, was clearly a more immediately valuable asset to the Astros than the three prospects they traded to get him. He gave up only four runs in his five regular-season starts for the team, then won four straight starts to begin the playoffs. In very simple terms, he brought value to the Astros in a trade, and had the new law been in place last year, the team would have owed taxes on that added value.
The two companies were also far apart in other ways. The robo-adviser charged an annual fee of 0.25 percent of the value of our investment, and we could put down as little as $2,500. The bank demanded annual fees of more than one percent of a portfolio's value, and said it only worked with clients with $5 million or more to invest. (We invested substantially less than this, and they worked with us anyway).
If we don't prepare now, higher education is likely to endure another big shock whenever the next recession comes.

The farmland's yield decline is a permanent loss of the economy's productive capacity — society is that much poorer, for the indefinite future. It's worse than what happens in a typical economic downturn. Usually when factories sit idle during a recession, there is a reasonable expectation that they will start cranking again once the economy returns to health.
Where Mr. Corbat can steer Citigroup directly, he is doing so. Expenses fell to 58 percent of revenue, compared with 59 percent a year ago. Investment banking was more mixed: Revenue from fixed-income trading, where Citigroup is heavily exposed to flaccid rate and currency movements, plunged by almost one-fifth. Yet the bank is collecting more advisory fees. Its share of the overall pot rose a little to 4.8 percent in 2017, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
The loft, which is in a 2006 complex with 12 apartments and an elevator, has views that are magical, said Arzu Ergül, the listing agent for the property at Engel & Völkers München. It's right in the city center, but you hear nothing. It's very quiet and idyllic on the terraces.
• A big one is how seriously China will hold itself accountable, Ana Swanson of the NYT writes. Critics say Beijing's promises appear both broad and vague and overlap with other changes it has been pursuing anyway.
It was a terrible loss for Seattle's housing advocates, who were hoping for a systemic response to doubling rents, inhumanely fast evictions (Washington State has a three-day notice period) and a rise in the number of families living in their cars. And they were not reassured when, a few months after killing the head tax, Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, announced that he would pay a minimum wage of $15 per hour to all of its United States workers , a boost to low-wage warehouse and cafeteria workers. But in Seattle, where the minimum wage is now $16 for big employers, low wages cannot buy decent housing. The average rent in Seattle was nearly $2,000 in 2017, and nearly half of all renters spent more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing. For many workers, $15 or even $20 an hour, at 40 or 50 hours a week, means couch-surfing.
The time bomb in his title refers to the taxes and potential penalties you may have to pay if you withdraw your retirement savings injudiciously, or in some cases — such as failing to take the required minimum distribution from your I.R.A. — don't withdraw them at all. Not taking your R.M.D. means you'll be hit with a penalty of 50 percent of what you were supposed to withdraw. (As Mr. Slott points out, the government waived the R.M.D. requirement for 2020 because of the pandemic.)
There is tentative evidence in the Fox data that the wall is particularly unpopular in the relatively white and rural West, but somewhat more popular, at least with respect to the president's approval rating, in the Northeast and inland South. This would follow a familiar pattern in American politics: It mirrors the president's support in the presidential primary and tracks with longstanding measures of racial resentment.

He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. I think they felt like, you know, with all the excesses of the 60s and the 70s, and government had grown and grown, but there wasn't much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating. I think people just tapped into -- he tapped into what people were already feeling, which was, we want clarity, we want optimism, we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing.
In recent years, six states have mandated that menstrual products be provided in schools, and 13 states have mandated that they be provided in prisons and jails. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to provide every woman incarcerated in a federal prison with menstrual products free of charge. And in March, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act included provisions allowing menstrual products to be purchased with money from health savings and flexible spending accounts.

Candidates like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have sought to dominate the political center lane.

But what, exactly, was that value? Was it the size of his contract? Mr. Verlander earned $28 million last year, while the players traded for him drew minor league salaries. Was it the additional wins he brought to the team? Statisticians estimate Mr. Verlander gave the Astros nearly two more wins last season, a value that, depending on the statistician, could reach $20 million. Or was it some calculation of the total future value Mr. Verlander will bring to the team, minus the total future value it gave up in the prospects it traded away — and possibly adjusted for the amount the team will have to pay Mr. Verlander?
Visa and the financial technology start-up Plaid abandoned their $5.3 billion merger on Tuesday, citing a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit. The agreement between Visa and Plaid, a service that allows companies and apps to securely share customer data, was challenged in November by Justice Department officials who said the credit card giant was trying to eliminate a nascent threat to its online payments business. The leaders of Visa and Plaid said they disagreed with the Justice Department's stance but decided not to fight the lawsuit.
It appears, however, that some retirement savers may be behind the curve. Fidelity Investments said that as of late December, 43 percent of the company's investors who were eligible to take their first distribution from their I.R.A.s in 2016 had not yet taken the full amount. And 40 percent of those investors had not taken any of the mandated distribution.
I'll illustrate it this way. If we were to bring to the floor the $2,000 direct payment, I think that we could very well get 10 Republicans to vote for that. I would like to do as many of these things as we can through regular order. But we can't allow this health crisis to turn into even more of a housing crisis and then turn in to a financial-slash-banking crisis, which it will if we don't address it in a much bigger way than [Senator Mitch] McConnell was willing to.
Over the decades, various remedies to address discrimination have been met with legal challenges. Supreme Court rulings have established that race-based policies are constitutional only if they achieve a compelling governmental interest and are narrowly tailored to do so. The court has most notably allowed race to be used as a factor in college admissions to achieve student diversity. But the court in recent decades has also sided against one of the original rationales for affirmative action policies — to undo past discrimination and its lingering effect.
In large part because of those delays, some tax preparation chains are offering no-fee, zero-interest advances of refunds. This year, for instance, Jackson Hewitt and H&R Block are promoting advances of up to $3,200 (in Jackson Hewitt's case) or $3,000 (H&R Block), depending on the size of the expected refund. The loan is repaid when the refund is received.

(She has not conceded.) And with nearly all of the votes counted, Jon Ossoff, the Democratic challenger to the Republican incumbent, David Perdue, is ahead by more than 16,000 votes. (The margin is still within the limits of allowing for a recount and many media outlets have not yet called the race.)
