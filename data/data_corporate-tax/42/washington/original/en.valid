Clinton Nominates Reno at Justice By Ruth Marcus\n\nWashington Post Staff Writer\n\nFriday, February 12, 1993; Page A01 President Clinton yesterday named veteran Miami prosecutor Janet Reno to be his attorney general, selecting a woman he described as a front-line crime fighter of unquestioned integrity to fill the vacancy that has plagued the first three weeks of his administration. Announcing his nomination in a Rose Garden ceremony, Clinton said his selection had been guided somewhat, but not entirely by the desire to name the first female attorney general. Clinton said the position was not set aside for a woman and that he seriously considered at least four men for the job. But he said that he thought it would be a good and an interesting thing to do to name a woman to the position and said that if he had it to do over again, I would have called Janet Reno on November the 5th. In December, Clinton nominated corporate lawyer Zoe E. Baird, who was forced to withdraw because she had violated immigration and tax laws in hiring illegal immigrants. He was poised to name federal judge Kimba M. Wood before she withdrew last week after the disclosure that she had also employed an illegal immigrant to care for her child. Reno, who is not married and has no children, said, I've never hired an illegal alien and I think I've paid all my Social Security taxes, adding with a smile, Certainly in the vetting process in the last week, we've covered everything. An administration official said Clinton decided yesterday morning to name Reno, after interviewing her Tuesday. The Florida native, 54, turned aside a question about how she felt about being appointed to a position that was seen as having been reserved for a woman, saying simply, I'm just delighted to be here and I'm going to try my level best. She said her efforts would include restoring civil rights enforcement as one of the top priorities of the department, seeking to protect America's children from abuse and violence and establishing diversion programs to give nonviolent offenders a new start while incarcerating dangerous and career criminals. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said he welcomed the nomination and would schedule a hearing as expeditiously as possible. But committee sources said they did not expect a hearing before next month. Reno, who once swore I would never be a prosecutor because I thought they were more interested in securing convictions than in seeking justice, has been the elected chief prosecutor in Dade County since 1978. She supervises a 900-person office that handles more than 120,000 cases annually. Reno's start in the job was marred by riots that broke out after the 1980 acquittal of four police officers in the beating death of black insurance agent Arthur McDuffie. She has also been criticized for losing several high-profile public corruption cases and for failing to bring charges in other local scandals. But after her appointment to the position, she waged five successful campaigns for the job – a fact noted admiringly by Clinton yesterday -- and worked to cement good relations with the black and Hispanic communities in Miami. She pushed for a special court to handle drug cases, cracked down on parents who fail to pay child support and presided over the expansion of the county prosecutor's office into one of the largest in the country. Noting that Reno's phone number is listed – unusual for a prosecutor -- Clinton said, She has lived the kind of life in real contact with the toughest problems of this country that I think will serve her very well as the nation's chief law enforcement officer. Before becoming state attorney, Reno was a partner in a prestigious Miami firm that, she noted in a 1984 book on women lawyers, had first refused to hire her after she graduated from Harvard Law School in 1963 because she was a woman. Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Reno offered forthright answers that contrasted with Baird's reticence when Clinton nominated her to the position Dec. 24. She said she was personally opposed to the death penalty but probably asked for it as much as any prosecutor in the country and will advocate for it as the law of the land in particular situations. She described herself as pro-choice on abortion rights and – asked if she considers herself a feminist – said, My mother always told me to do my best, to think my best and to do right, and to consider myself a person. Women's rights groups expressed delight with the selection of a woman who Women's Legal Defense Fund President Judith L. Lichtman described as a stellar attorney with an extraordinary track record. The lesson of the agonizing nomination process, said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center, is that there are superb women as well as men who can serve the country with distinction and having someone like Janet Reno in charge of the Justice Department is a wonderful step forward. But the American Family Association of Florida, a conservative Christian group, said it would oppose Reno's nomination because of what it called her deplorable record on prosecuting pornography cases. Since Reno took office, said organization President David Caton, Dade County has become stomping grounds for pornographers. In turning to Reno, Clinton departed from the practice of most presidents who choose either close advisers or nationally known figures. Clinton said he settled on Reno – whose extensive criminal law background also distinguishes her – because he wanted someone with management as well as legal experience, and who had dealt with a wide range of real-world problems. He said he had known of Reno for some time because his brother-in-law Hugh Rodham is a public defender in the drug court that Reno established. But he said he did not pursue her as a possible candidate because of her lack of federal experience. But the more I dug into it and the more I talked to people about it and the more I realized that you couldn't be the state's attorney in Dade County for 15 years without having enormous exposure to a wide range of issues that the Justice Department deals with . . . , he said.

Her most lasting legacy may be a sweeping directive governing how schools handle allegations of sexual assault and harassment. Those rules, which give more due-process rights to the accused, will be difficult to unwind, though President-elect Joe Biden has said he will try.\n\nAD\n\nShe also used executive authority to roll back Obama-era guidance on affirmative action and to require college campuses to recognize free-speech rights.\n\nAD\n\nOther DeVos priorities required legislative action, and she was able to move almost none of them through Congress.\n\nIf you want to make lasting changes in public policy, you need to enact laws, said Terry Hartle, senior vice president for government relations with the American Council on Education, which represents colleges and universities. If you're going to live by executive-branch action, you die by executive action. That's the world we live in.\n\n\n\nDeVos was a stalwart ally to Trump, even as White House aides whispered that the president did not think much of her. She rarely said anything that could be read as criticism of Trump until Thursday, when she resigned with 13 days remaining, to protest his role in igniting a mob that breached the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAD\n\nThere is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me, she wrote in her resignation letter to Trump.\n\nAD\n\nHer last day was Friday. It has been a privilege to serve America's students alongside you, she wrote in a brief goodbye note to the Education Department staff Friday morning.\n\nHer final chapter was a consequential one, as the coronavirus pandemic shut down U.S. schools. DeVos joined Trump in pushing schools to reopen for in-person learning, with mixed success. Some experts agreed with her, fearing remote learning is leaving many children behind. Critics noted that the federal government failed to provide schools with clear guidance or funding that would have made it easier to open doors.\n\nAD\n\nBefore and during the pandemic, DeVos trained her focus on what conservatives call school choice policies, which allocate taxpayer money to families who choose alternatives to traditional public schools. For DeVos, that includes private schools, religious schools, parent-organized pods, home schooling and charter schools of all sorts.\n\nAD\n\nShe branded it education freedom and suggested federal dollars to support traditional schools had been wasted. When the pandemic hit, DeVos saw the failure of some schools to open doors as evidence that parents needed taxpayer-supported alternatives.\n\nIn an interview last month with Frederick Hess, director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, she was asked what her most significant accomplishment was. Hands down, it's changing the national conversation around what K-12 education can and should be, she replied.\n\nAD\n\nHer work was welcomed by conservatives who argue that power over education belongs with parents, not systems.\n\nNot beholden to the education establishment and teachers unions, Betsy was clear from the beginning that she was the secretary of education, not just traditional public education, said Kay C. James, president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that DeVos and her husband have supported through their family foundation.\n\nAD\n\nHer supporters note that several states have expanded school choice programs and say DeVos's advocacy made a difference in the public debate. But the issue went almost nowhere in Washington.\n\nShe'll be remembered as an unapologetic voice for expanded school choice, and I think after racking up no legislative victories over the past four years, it's hard to see a lot of concrete impact of that, Hess said in an interview.\n\nAD\n\nHer signature proposal would have created a type of federal school voucher program, in which donations to state scholarship programs would be reimbursed in the form of federal tax credits. It garnered GOP support in Congress but was opposed by Democrats, who control the House, and some Republicans.\n\nDeVos has said she regrets not pushing the issue harder earlier in Trump's term, when Republicans controlled the House and the Senate. Her best chance was probably in a sweeping tax bill, signed in 2017, but the White House did not include school choice proposals even in its blueprint for the bill.\n\nShe also tried to funnel additional dollars from a pandemic relief bill to private schools. That effort was blocked by a federal judge, and even some Republicans called it misguided.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDeVos advocates for a light touch from the federal government when it comes to education, and she shrunk the size of the Education Department workforce by 11 percent, as of June, declining to fill positions. She seemed more comfortable leaning down to talk with children on school visits than interacting with official Washington.\n\nThe White House proposed annual budgets slashing the Education Department's funding, and DeVos defended them on Capitol Hill, although Congress — even when controlled by Republicans — rejected the cuts.\n\nThe result was an annual drubbing of DeVos by congressional committees in service of proposed cuts that were never going to happen anyway. That was never more painful than in 2019, when DeVos absorbed three days of hits over a proposal to cut funding for the Special Olympics that the White House had insisted upon, only to watch as Trump dramatically announced that he was restoring the funding.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHer tenure also will be known for rolling back Obama-era civil rights protections, including those aimed at protecting transgender students and eliminating racial disparities in school discipline rates. Under DeVos, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights jettisoned most systemic investigations, focusing instead on clearing a significant backlog of cases.\n\nCritics said she failed to protect students' civil rights. Speed is not the measure of whether justice is served, said Liz King, senior director of the education equity program at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Secretary DeVos's primary legacy is an agenda of discrimination and exclusion.\n\nIn higher education, her most consequential work involved regulating how colleges and other schools investigate sexual harassment and assault under the federal civil rights law known as Title IX. Earlier in her term, DeVos rescinded less formal guidance issued by the Obama administration. The new regulation, published last year, carries the force of law.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt creates a clear but controversial road map to navigating these highly charged investigations, including mandating a judicial-like process in which the accused has the right to a live hearing and to cross-examine accusers. Supporters say it provided much-needed due-process protections. Opponents argued it would allow assailants and schools to escape responsibility and discourage victims from coming forward.\n\nUnraveling it would require legislation or another complex rulemaking process.\n\nThis is an extraordinarily big, complicated task, said Hartle, of the American Council on Education, which opposed the rule. He expects the Biden administration to roll it back but said that will not be quick or easy, partly because the regulation is complex and has many elements. You can't do this by fiat. You have to go through a regulatory process.\n\nAD\n\nDeVos quickly proved herself an ally of for-profit colleges by withdrawing, delaying or announcing plans to revamp more than a half-dozen Obama-era measures that affected the industry, all within her first year. The secretary tapped former for-profit college executives to marshal higher-education policies that critics say gave predatory schools a pass.\n\nDeVos hired for her team a group of former for-profit college executives, and they worked to dismantle all the protections, block debt relief for ripped-off students, and ensure that federal dollars kept flowing to the worst colleges, said David Halperin, an attorney who has been critical of the for-profit industry.\n\nDeVos was also a fierce critic of the Obama administration's consumer regulations, accusing her predecessor of putting taxpayers at risk with policies that made it too easy for college students to shirk their financial responsibilities. She once complained that all one had to do was raise his or her hands to be entitled to so-called free money.\n\nIn her first year in office, she delayed an Obama-era regulation that granted loan forgiveness to borrowers who had been defrauded by their colleges, known as borrower defense to repayment. Her move was challenged in court and in Congress but took effect in July. It limits the time borrowers have to apply for relief and requires they prove financial harm.\n\nHer legacy is clearly one of disdain for the public good in higher education, students' rights and lawful proceedings of government, said Toby Merrill, director at the Project on Predatory Student Lending, a legal-aid group.\n\nDeVos was also sued by former Corinthian Colleges students, angry that their debts had not been fully forgiven. DeVos refused to change course and was held in contempt by a federal judge for violating an order to stop collecting loan payments.\n\nIt took nearly four years for DeVos to dismantle Obama-era consumer protection rules. The Biden administration could restore many of those policies in much less time, but some will be easier than others to revive.\n\nRestoring the 2016 borrower defense rule would require negotiated rulemaking at the Education Department, a process that could take months, if not longer. The same is true for restoring the gainful-employment regulation, which penalizes career-training programs for producing too many graduates with more debt than they can repay.\n\nIn the meantime, the Biden administration could clear out the backlog of borrower defense claims using a more generous methodology for approval and loan forgiveness.
The reversal came as the Trump administration tries to rapidly get stimulus payments out to Americans in the face of the quickest economic decline in modern history.\n\nAD\n\nSocial Security recipients who are not typically required to file a tax return need to take no action, and will receive their payment directly to their bank account, said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.\n\nAD\n\nThe $2.2 trillion aid legislation, passed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, directed the Treasury to look at Americans' 2019 or 2018 tax returns to determine if they are eligible for a payment. But the law also said Treasury should look at Social Security data for seniors and the disabled.\n\nCriticism poured in after the IRS posted a notice on its website on Monday instructing Social Security recipients who do not normally send in a return to file a simple tax return, which would be available soon.\n\nAD\n\nMore than 15 million Americans on Social Security do not file an annual tax return because their income is so low, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nForty-one Democratic senators sent the White House a letter Wednesday asking why the Trump administration is placing this significant burden on senior citizens and the disabled. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri called it ridiculous.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the last recession, when the U.S. government sent most Americans a stimulus check and required a filed tax return to get it, 3.5 million Social Security recipients were left out because they never sent a return, according to a 2008 Treasury Department analysis.\n\nAD\n\nThere were concerns that even more people won't file during the pandemic. But the Trump administration ultimately reversed course.\n\nSpeaking at the coronavirus task force briefing on March 17, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced plans to send checks to struggling businesses. (The Washington Post)\n\nMnuchin said direct deposits should begin by April 17, followed by checks in the mail. About 60 percent of tax filers gave the IRS direct-deposit information in recent years, said Nicole Kaeding of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. The IRS said there would soon be a web-based portal for people to update their direct-deposit information.\n\nBeyond the tax-filing hurdle, millions of other Americans are realizing that they don't qualify for a coronavirus relief check.\n\nMost high school seniors and college students won't get any money. The bill gives nothing to families for their children older than 16, a shock to many households already reeling from canceled graduations, and college students readjusting to life at home with so many universities shut down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany immigrant families are also learning that they are ineligible. In order for anyone in the family to receive a payment, each person in the household — including children — is supposed to have a valid Social Security number.\n\nNick Guerrero of Mesa, Ariz., has learned that he's one of those who won't be getting any money because he's 18, another blow to his senior year of high school that is quickly unraveling.\n\nOn Sunday night, Guerrero was video chatting with a dozen friends and they laughed at the thought of having to hold a virtual prom and getting their high school diplomas via email. It still seemed unreal. On Monday, they woke up to the news that school was canceled for the rest of the year in Arizona.\n\nAD\n\nIt was like a shot to the heart, Guerrero said.\n\nSome of his friends have lost their after-school jobs. He planned to get one soon to help save for college, but that is no longer possible. He has been applying for college scholarships, but some applications require him to use a fax machine or send a hard copy of his paperwork, and he no longer has access to the school printer.\n\nAD\n\nMoney is tight and his family had to borrow from a relative to pay for his Advanced Placement tests this spring. His parents — an education professor and a golf coach — expect to receive the government relief payment in April, which should help, but they won't get $500 for him.\n\nAD\n\nGuerrero trades text messages on a chain with about 25 friends — classmates he hasn't seen since spring break started on March 6. Each day brings more harsh news about people they know getting sick and families hurting for money. His mom's phone pings frequently with SOS messages from college students who can't pay their rent.
Emancipation Day usually is celebrated April 16, the date in 1862 when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act, which freed about 3,100 slaves living in the District.\n\nAD\n\nBut this year, April 16 falls on a Sunday, so the District will celebrate the holiday the following day. D.C. holidays are treated as federal holidays for tax-filing purposes, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nAD\n\nThat pushes the official tax-filing deadline to the next business day, April 18. And, everyone — residents of Florida, California and everywhere in between — will receive an extension, not just D.C. residents.\n\nWhen April 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, a return is considered timely filed if it is filed on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, IRS spokesman Ubon Mendie said in an email last year. The term 'legal holiday' includes a legal holiday observed in the District of Columbia.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, the country had a three-day reprieve on filing taxes because April 16 fell on a Saturday, so the District celebrated the holiday on April 15, a Friday. That moved the tax filing deadline to Monday, April 18.\n\nThe country had a similar reprieve in 2007 because of Emancipation Day.\n\nD.C. government shuts down for Emancipation Day, although the federal government and most businesses in the city remain open. In 2000, then-D.C. Council member Vincent B. Orange Sr. (D-Ward 5) prepared legislation — which the council passed unanimously and then-Mayor Anthony A. Williams (D) signed — declaring April 16 D.C. Emancipation Day, a legal private holiday. The day was officially observed for the first time as a public holiday, one that closed the city government, in 2005.\n\nThe holiday is marked by a parade in which city leaders and schoolchildren march along Pennsylvania Avenue. This year, the rest of the country also might learn about the District holiday.
MAYOR MURIEL E. BOWSER (D) took painstaking care in pointing out to the D.C. Council her grave concerns with legislation establishing an extravagant paid family leave program for people who work in the District. One of the largest tax increases in recent city history, she wrote the council, would be imposed to establish one of the largest government agencies, which would mostly benefit non-D.C. residents, while people who live in the city but work outside it or for the federal government would get nothing. Pretty convincing arguments to veto the bill — but instead Ms. Bowser took the easy way out, at least for her, and decided to let the bill become law without her signature.\n\nIn trying to have her cake and eat it, Ms. Bowser proved to be just as feckless as the council in setting up the city for enormous fiscal risk. In truth, she may have been even more irresponsible, since some council members seemed to sincerely (but naively) think they were doing the right thing. Instead of being worried about the politics if her veto were not sustained, Ms. Bowser should have stood up for the principles articulated in her letter.\n\nWe — like Ms. Bowser — have never questioned the desirability of giving families the time off they need to care for newborns or tend to ailing parents. But the District's plan that is set to be enacted into law, barring interference from Congress, is expensive and ill-designed and, in the opinion of the city's chief financial officer, presents multiple risk factors. Not only do most of the benefits go to Maryland and Virginia residents, many of whom already get employer-provided leave, but also it is unclear if a government that still struggles to provide some basic city services is capable of pulling off a program unprecedented in its complexity.\n\nWhat is most maddening is that better alternatives exist, including some being developed by the business community that would target resources to the workers most in need without a vast new bureaucracy. They also have the advantage of being able to be implemented far sooner than the 2020 start envisioned under the council's bill.\n\nSo manifest are the problems that it appears Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) may be having a bit of buyer's remorse. After the mayor announced she would not veto the bill, he signaled a willingness to revisit and perhaps refine parts of it. Had he been hoping a mayoral veto would get him off the hook for ramming such a bad bill through the council? Did it suddenly dawn on him the challenges the city faces in coming up with $40 million to $80 million to design a first-of-its-kind technology infrastructure; hiring 113 new government workers with the expertise to implement and administer the program; and finding a place to house both?\n\nIt is not too late for the council to undo its mistake and start to act responsibly. We urge it to do so.
The same year, Gregg Berhalter, coach of the middling U.S. men's squad, received $304,113 in base salary and a substantial bonus — except he had been on the job for only a month.\n\nThose figures came to light this week in the U.S. Soccer Federation's latest tax form. They illustrate a significant, if narrowing, pay gap between the head coaches of senior national teams with differing levels of success.\n\nAD\n\nThey also come as the U.S. women's players prepare for an unrelated court case this spring involving a gender discrimination suit against the nonprofit governing body.\n\nAD\n\nTax records show Berhalter, a former MLS coach, received a $200,000 signing bonus upon accepting the offer in fall 2018, plus $104,113 in salary and moving expenses after starting the job in December.\n\nHis 2019 annual salary was not specified, but based on the latter figure, he was to make between $1 million and $1.2 million.\n\nA USSF spokesman said the organization did not want to comment on the salary differences. The latest 990 tax form is for the fiscal year from April 2018 through March 2019, but the USSF said salaries are for the entirety of 2018.\n\nBruce Arena collected $1.275 million ($900,000 base salary) for 9½ months of work in 2017 before stepping down after the U.S. men's team failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. He received a $300,000 settlement.\n\nAD\n\nBetween Arena's departure and Berhalter's appointment, interim coach Dave Sarachan made about $240,000 from January through November 2018, tax records show.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. men have not advanced past the World Cup's round of 16 since 2002, though the number of fully invested programs in the men's game dwarfs the women's game and the pathway to a World Cup berth is much more difficult for the American men.\n\nEllis, who stepped aside last year after 5½ years of service and consecutive World Cup titles, had a base salary of $291,029 in 2017 and close to $390,000 the next year.\n\nIn the run-up to the World Cup, she received another raise, which did not fall within the time-frame of the latest tax records. Estimates placed her base salary at $500,000. She did not receive a bonus for success in the World Cup qualifying tournament but did earn considerable bonuses for winning the World Cup.\n\nAD\n\nThose figures, as well as new coach Vlatko Andonovski's salary, will appear on next year's tax records.\n\nAD\n\nEngland's Phil Neville is believed to be the second-highest-paid women's coach in recent years with a base salary of at least $350,000.\n\nThe highest-paid U.S. coach in 2018, though, was someone long out of a job: Jurgen Klinsmann, the men's boss who was fired in fall 2016. Because he had a long-term contract, the federation had to make payments of $3.35 million in 2017 and $1.475 million in 2018, totaling more than $4.8 million, tax records show.\n\nThe 2018 records also show full-time players on the women's team received about $170,000 in base salary (for playing for both the U.S. squad and a National Women's Soccer League team) and up to $146,000 in bonuses, tied to appearances, performance incentives and qualifying for the World Cup.\n\nAD\n\nThe rewards for winning the World Cup are dictated by the collective bargaining agreement between the players and federation. Those figures have not been disclosed but reportedly top out at $110,000 apiece.\n\nFIFA, the sport's global governing body, paid $30 million in bonuses at the Women's World Cup last year, including $4 million to the winner.\n\nAD\n\nThat was twice as much as in 2015 but still a fraction of what the men received in 2018: $400 million overall, led by champion France with $38 million.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has pledged to double the women's prize money for the 2023 tournament.\n\nRevenue generated by the men's and women's competitions is complicated because FIFA bundles such things as TV rights and sponsorship deals.\n\nAD\n\nGlobal viewership of the 2018 men's tournament (64 matches) was three times higher than the 2019 women's competition (52 games), though for the first time, the Women's World Cup surpassed 1 billion viewers over four weeks.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by the U.S. women's players against the federation concerns broader issues; the players say there is inequitable compensation and support compared with the men's program.\n\nAD\n\nThe teams, however, have separate collective bargaining agreements, and the men do not receive base salaries. Most of the men's earnings come from contracts with professional clubs around the world.\n\nMediation between the women's players and USSF broke down in August.\n\nAD\n\nLast week, the union representing the men's national team players spoke out in support of the women, saying the USSF has been working very hard to sell a false narrative to the public and even to members of Congress. They have been using this false narrative as a weapon against current and former members of the women's team.\n\nIn response, the USSF said, Our goal is to determine fair and equitable compensation for our USMNT and USWNT, while also being mindful of how and where we invest our overall financial resources so that we can continue to focus on investing in the development of our players, coaches and referees at all levels.\n\nAD\n\nThe 2018 tax form also shows chief executive Dan Flynn was the USSF's highest active employee that year at almost $900,000 in base salary and bonuses. Jay Berhalter, the chief commercial and strategy officer, was close to $800,000.\n\nAD\n\nFlynn retired last year, and Berhalter, older brother of the men's coach, is leaving this month.\n\nOthers were on a pay scale higher than Ellis's in 2018.\n\nTab Ramos, the former under-20 men's coach and youth technical director, made $460,000 overall. He is now coaching MLS's Houston Dynamo.\n\nEarnie Stewart received $291,667 of base salary in six months as the men's general manager; he had been hired midway through the year. Stewart, a former national team player, is now the USSF's sporting director, overseeing the men's and women's programs.\n\nThe salaries of men's general manager Brian McBride and women's GM Kate Markgraf were not listed on the latest tax form because they were hired in the past six months.
The company said Tuesday it plans to dismiss between 5,000 and 5,500 people and sell or close about 10 manufacturing facilities in what chief executive Thomas Falk described in a Tuesday call with analysts as difficult but necessary actions to make the Kimberly-Clark an even stronger company going forward.\n\nAD\n\nExecutives declined to say which factories the company would be closing, citing the need to consult with unions, work councils and other stakeholders. They said some of the savings would be used to expand production at other facilities.\n\nAD\n\nChief Financial Officer Maria Henry said the company's gains from the tax overhaul would help offset the cost of the restructuring plan. The company had an effective tax rate of 28.6 percent in 2017, and the rate would drop to between 23 and 26 percent in 2018 as a result of congressional action, boosting year-over-year earnings growth by 6 percentage points, she told analysts during a conference call to discuss recent financial results.\n\nWe also anticipate ongoing annual cash flow benefits from tax reform, Henry said. That provides us flexibility to continue to allocate significant capital to shareholders while we also fund increased capital spending and our restructuring program over the next few years.\n\nAD\n\nAlong with many of its peers in the retail industry Kimberly-Clark has been buffeted for years by falling commodity prices. The company's revenue rose by 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period a year earlier, but the numbers are down significantly from 2014. Profits rose by 21 percent, or $1.75 a share for the quarter.\n\nAD\n\nExecutives cited declining fertility rates in the United States and South Korea as factors that have contributed to a decline in diaper sales, long considered one of Kimberly-Clark's bedrock lines of business. Competition is also heating up. Amazon.com, for instance, launched its own private label brand of diapers late last year. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nExecutives have tried to fill the gap through a cost-cutting program it calls FORCE, or Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere, which is meant to make its factories and distribution lines more efficient. Executives told analysts the company has saved about $450 million in the past year as part of that program, as part of a planned $1.5 billion cost-reduction over the next four years.\n\nAD\n\nPart of that has come from eliminating certain full-time service positions while hiring elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nWe are moving to a global business services platform for our more transactional and standard work, Henry said Tuesday. And when you do that, when you think about it, we are removing a role that is in country, so we are paying the full severance on that position that we are taking out, and we are hiring that role in a different location in our shared services center.\n\nThe company has seen some initial success expanding to new markets, with sales in its personal care segment up by wide margins in Latin America, China and Eastern Europe.
The Episcopal Dioceses of Washington and Virginia said churches including Washington National Cathedral would close for two weeks. The Walter E. Washington Convention Center canceled upcoming events, as did the promoter of concerts at the Anthem, the 9:30 Club, the Lincoln Theater and U Street Music Hall.\n\nOrganizers said parts of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival would be shelved, the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon had its city permit pulled, and the St. Patrick's Day parade scheduled for Sunday was postponed indefinitely.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread, phrases like quarantine, isolation and social distancing are making news. Here are the key differences of each. (The Washington Post)\n\nMore colleges and schools announced plans to close for deep cleaning or move to online classes.\n\nBowser announced six new coronavirus cases, including two not linked to any known source of infection, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the District, Maryland and Virginia to at least 34. Officials in Alexandria, Va., announced the first case there late Wednesday.\n\nBowser said the District has leased an undisclosed location that can be used to quarantine up to 50 people.\n\nI want to continue to remind everyone to be vigilant, Bowser said at a news conference. Our duty now as citizens is to try to contain the spread of germs and this virus in our communities.\n\nBefore the emergency declaration, the owner of the Washington Wizards and the Washington Capitals said their games would go on as scheduled at Capital One Arena in the District's Chinatown neighborhood.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLater, the National Basketball Association announced that it would suspend its season indefinitely after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the virus.\n\nCity health officials earlier Wednesday had recommended canceling all non-essential mass gatherings of 1,000 people or more through the end of the month.\n\nHealth officials also expanded a self-quarantine recommendation for people who have visited Christ Church Georgetown, which is now linked to three confirmed coronavirus cases.\n\nRev. Timothy Cole, 59, the church rector, was diagnosed with the virus after attending an Episcopal leaders conference in Louisville. Organizers of the conference said Wednesday that two other conference attendees have also tested positive.\n\nAD\n\nIn recent days, Christ Church organist Tom Smith and a church member from Loudoun County also were diagnosed with the virus.\n\nAD\n\nAfter Cole's diagnosis, city officials urged people who had been at the church on Feb. 24 or between Feb. 28 and March 3 — days when Cole was there — to quarantine at home and monitor themselves for symptoms.\n\nBut the city has since extended the recommendation to include people at the church March 4 through March 6, to account for the days Smith was there. Smith played at a funeral on March 6, and those who attended that service are also being alerted, the church said in an email to members. City officials want people to stay isolated until two weeks have passed since their last time at the church.\n\nAuthorities say anyone who develops symptoms, such as a fever, cough or shortness of breath, and believes they have been exposed to the virus, should consult their health-care provider about whether to be tested.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHealth-care experts say that those who are sick should stay home and that everyone should wash their hands thoroughly and regularly, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Those with compromised immune systems are also advised to take precautions.\n\nThe six new coronavirus cases in the District include a 59-year-old man and a 39-year-old man who traveled abroad; a 58-year-old woman who attended a conference where other participants tested positive; and a 59-year-old woman who came in contact with another person who previously tested positive in the District. Officials said they have not identified a probable source of exposure for the other two people, a man in his early 20s and a 69-year-old woman.\n\nSuch cases — when there is no obvious likely origin — are the most concerning to health officials and are a primary reason for considering widespread closures and disruptions, officials say. The goal is to limit the spread of the virus by patients who have not yet been diagnosed and quarantined.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe have person-to-person transmission occurring in the District of Columbia, as well as at least two individuals whose reasons for covid-19 have yet to be identified, D.C. Health Director LaQuandra S. Nesbitt said at the news conference where Bowser announced the state of emergency.\n\nAlexandria officials said a resident who tested positive for the coronavirus had been in contact with a District resident with the virus who was associated with Christ Church and had spent time at the Immanuel Chapel of the Virginia Theological Seminary, according to a news release. The age and gender of the person was not immediately available.\n\nEarlier in the day, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) on Wednesday reported on another new coronavirus case in his state: a male teenager in the Chickahominy Health District, in the area of Hanover County.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe teen, who does not attend school, visited a country where there is ongoing transmission of the virus, said Caitlin Hodge, a spokeswoman for the health district. He returned from his trip on March 4, started having symptoms on March 8 and was tested.\n\nNortham said steps were being taken in several agencies — including schools, transportation and health — to make sure the commonwealth is prepared to deal with the virus. He has not yet declared a state of emergency but said he is prepared to do so.\n\nThe state's public lab has testing supplies for 300 to 400 patients, and it anticipates receiving additional tests soon to increase that capacity to 600. Until testing capacity increases, health department officials will give priority to people who have had contact with others with confirmed cases, who have traveled to impacted areas and who live in nursing homes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDaniel Carey, Virginia's secretary of health and human resources, said that given the limited number of tests available, it makes sense for doctors to first test patients for flu, pneumonia or bacterial infections to rule out those conditions.\n\nIn Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) announced four new cases: a woman in her 70s who tested positive in Anne Arundel County after having close contact with someone else who had the virus; a Montgomery County man in his 20s who recently traveled to Spain; a Baltimore County man in his 60s who was at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference in the District; and a Prince George's County man in his 60s, who is currently hospitalized. That man's travel is being investigated.\n\nThe governor told residents to brace for social-distancing measures and warned of significant disruption to your daily lives for a period of time. He urged local governments to consider canceling large events, ordered nursing homes to bar nonessential visits, curtailed walk-in visits to the Motor Vehicle Administration and instructed local schools and preschools to be prepared with contingency plans for potential long-term closures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nState businesses will have an automatic extension on state tax filings, until June 1, Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot said.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service deadline of April 15 for income and corporate taxes remains unchanged.\n\nEvents D.C., the District's tourism arm, said Wednesday that officials have learned of two other AIPAC attendees — from Ohio and Toronto — in addition to three cases announced earlier.\n\nOfficials say there was a low risk of exposure for people who attended the conference, because the patients did not show symptoms during the conference, said Gregory A. O'Dell, president and chief executive of Events D.C.\n\nIndoor venues managed by Events D.C. — including the convention center, the D.C. Armory, and the R.I.S.E. Demonstration Center — will undergo a deep cleaning in coming days, he said, out of an abundance of caution.\n\n\n\nHe said the suspension of operations at the convention center and other facilities will affect three Capital City Go-Go basketball games, a circus and the finish line and expo associated with the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon.\n\nThe decision to shut down immediately affected Satellite 2020, an annual technology convention that has been held in the District for 39 years. The convention started Monday, was scheduled to end Thursday, and was expected to draw more than 15,000 attendees from more than 100 countries, organizers said.\n\nPete Schramm, a sales engineer based in Maryland, said the mood at the convention was subdued Wednesday over concerns about the coronavirus.\n\nNobody wants to touch you and people are keeping their distance, he said while having a cigarette outside the convention center. People are very reserved, they're quiet and they seem to have a lot on their minds.\n\nRestaurateurs such as Jamie Leeds, the chef-owner of Hank's Oyster Bar, were bracing for a significant drop in customers, especially in neighborhoods anchored by large event spaces.\n\nThe Anthem is a huge driver of business for us, said Leeds, referring to the huge new concert venue in Southwest Washington that has canceled all events until April 1.\n\nBut Leeds, who has three other locations in the D.C. area, said the restaurant is also a neighborhood destination with many regulars.\n\nLeeds said she supports the Anthem's decision to cancel events. It's important to follow the guidance of the city and what's best for people's safety, she said.
How can you expect people to make educated decisions about the right thing to do when they have absolutely no idea what the cost is? Levine said. It's crazy.\n\nSo Levine set out to build a tool that would provide some quick and reliable answers. On Wednesday, Yale University and 15 other schools announced that they would use a version of his calculator now known as MyinTuition. (Get it?) That brought the total involved in his nonprofit initiative to 31, including Wellesley, which in 2013 became the first to use Levine's calculator.\n\nLevine is quick to point out that his calculators are meant to complement, not replace, the net price calculators that colleges have been required to post online since 2011. But the net price calculators are often cumbersome. Levine and other experts say many users, facing a slew of complicated questions about tax returns, assets and home equity, fail to take advantage of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLevine's tool aims to give families a fast and effective answer to the question of whether they could afford a given school at a time when listed prices — counting tuition, fees, housing, meals and other expenses — for private colleges can top $70,000 a year.\n\nIt asks users a series of easy-to-follow questions about citizenship status, living situation, family income, home value, mortgage balance, cash on hand, retirement plans and other investments. It also asks whether any siblings are in college. Then, using the college's aid policies, the calculator produces an instant estimate of what the student and family might expect to pay out of pocket and what might be provided as grants, loans and work-study. The whole exercise is meant to take about three minutes.\n\nTake a family of four with income of $70,000 a year, cash of $5,000, non-retirement investments of $25,000, and home equity of $25,000. If the sibling is not in college, the estimated expected family contribution for Wellesley would be $5,000 to $15,500 a year. If the sibling is in college, the family's contribution range for the women's college would be $3,000 to $9,300 a year. In addition, the calculator tells this prospective student that she would be expected to borrow $1,800 a year and earn $2,100 through a work-study program. The rest of the college's $68,000 annual expense would be covered by grants and scholarships.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe calculator cautions consumers that a detailed analysis of family finances could produce a considerably different result. It points them to the net price calculator to get more information. Levine said financial circumstances can be especially tricky for students from divorced families. But he noted that retirement savings are not included in the formula. The calculator only asks about retirement savings to ensure that families don't include that sort of funding when they seek aid estimates.\n\nMisperceptions about price matter hugely, Levine said. This whole issue is about social mobility, he said. Here you have opportunities where kids are qualified to go to high-level institutions, and don't because they don't understand the price. That's a huge failure.\n\nMark Dunn, associate director of admissions at Yale, said the university hopes the MyinTuition calculator will fill an information gap about college expenses. Like many other highly selective schools, Yale promises prospective students that it will meet their financial need. But Dunn acknowledged that many remain skeptical. Our sense is that until you can actually see what a need-based financial aid award would mean for your family, it's hard to honestly believe what colleges say, Dunn said. He said Yale plans to promote the MyinTuition calculator prominently as it begins outreach in coming weeks to high school juniors who would enter in 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther schools now using the calculator are Amherst, Babson, Boston, Bowdoin, Carleton, Colby, Colorado, Dartmouth, Davidson, Grinnell, Hamilton, Middlebury, Mount Holyoke, Pomona, St. Olaf, Skidmore, Smith, Vassar and Williams colleges; Brown, Columbia, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Rice, Wesleyan and Washington and Lee universities; and the universities of Rochester and Virginia. U-Va., the only public institution on the list, adopted the calculator in 2015.
The transit agency can legally ask for up to a 3 percent yearly increase from the state of Maryland and cities and counties of Virginia that, along with D.C., provide Metro with the bulk of its annual operating budget. Metro has asked for the increase each year since the cap was passed two years ago, but this year, transit officials say they are cognizant of the financial constraints the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked on tax revenue that regional governments depend on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt would certainly help, said Tom Hucker (D), a Montgomery County Council member who chairs the Transportation and Environment Committee.\n\nUntil late last month, Metro officials were staring down a looming deficit of nearly $671 million starting in March because of ridership losses. The transit agency had proposed severe service cuts that included no weekend rail service until Congress came through with a $900 billion stimulus in late December that included $14 billion for transit.\n\nOf that, Metro will receive about $610 million, which should keep buses and trains running at their current levels for about a year.\n\nThe federal bailout was a needed injection for households and several industries, but it didn't directly provide financial help to local governments served by the Metro system.\n\nAD\n\nThe annual subsidies that Metro gets from regional and state governments make up more than half of the system's annual operating budget. Revenue from fares, parking, advertisements and other services make up the rest.\n\nAD\n\nThe subsidy increase is capped by Virginia and Maryland at 3 percent. Both states passed a law in 2018 limiting subsidy growth as part of a condition of permanently dedicating and significantly increasing money for long-term capital projects. The District did not adopt the limit, and the cap applies only to Metro's operating costs.\n\nMetro has annually asked for as much as it can because officials say expenses have risen at least 8 percent annually in recent years, outpacing mostly flat fare revenue growth. The transit system felt so stretched that it had lobbied the states to increase or alter the cap before the pandemic struck.\n\nAD\n\nBy not asking for a subsidy increase, Metro could save the jurisdictions tens of millions of dollars, according to Wiedefeld's latest $1.89 billion operating budget proposal for the 2022 fiscal year, which starts on July 1. An exact figure wasn't available Monday.\n\nAD\n\nMetro's proposed budget includes $1.15 billion in subsidies, less than the $1.25 billion Metro had counted on receiving at the beginning of the current fiscal year. That amount was later revised down in November to $1.11 billion.\n\nEven as Metro has been running buses and trains at a reduced level because of lower demand, costs for cleaning, disinfecting and personal protective equipment have risen. Metro officials said they hope to make up the money they wouldn't receive in subsidies through cost-cutting starting in January 2022, the second half of the fiscal year.\n\nAD\n\nWiedefeld proposed that Metro would seek to work with unions to defer raises and enact service cuts in the last six months, leaving the agency with a $171.4 million deficit. Officials previously have said they might seek more federal assistance at that time to bridge the gap unless ridership rebounds.\n\nAD\n\nMetro officials said none of the local or state governments asked Metro for a break in their subsidy payments. The agency said it wanted to be cost-conscious toward its funding partners.\n\nWhile Metro did not receive a specific request, [Wiedefeld] is aware that our funding jurisdictions did not receive additional revenue in the recent Covid Relief package and face enormous financial pressures, Metro spokesman Ian Jannetta said in a statement.\n\nFairfax County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jeff C. McKay (D-At Large) said an increase in Metro's subsidy request would be tough to swallow this year, particularly when Congress didn't include local governments in its bailout.\n\nAD\n\nAn increase in the local subsidy at this time would be another expense on Fairfax County residents, he said in a statement.\n\nThe Metro Board ultimately will decide if the transit system can lower its subsidy request. Members will discuss during a Thursday meeting.\n\nAD\n\nBoard members said the lack of an additional subsidy could increase the amount of money the agency requests from federal government next year if ridership doesn't significantly turn around.\n\nBut Metro Board Chairman Paul C. Smedberg said the agency needs to consider the financial health of cities and counties across the Washington region as it moves forward with its own needs.\n\nHaving talked to a lot of them and hearing about their situations and comments that were coming up again, it's just one of the options we wanted on the table, said Smedberg, who represents Virginia cities and counties on the board.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the state of Maryland has the direct responsibility of providing Metro with its annual subsidy, local officials in counties and cities Metro serves can provide responses to state transportation officials.\n\nAD\n\nPrince George's County Council member Todd M. Turner (D-District 4), who also is a member of the Washington Suburban Transit Commission, said a lower subsidy request should be welcomed by state legislators.
Forget about keeping up with the Joneses. This time of year you want your house to be as crummy as possible. Why? Because it's property tax assessment time, which means it's also assessment appeal time. And if you can successfully argue that your house isn't worth as much as the government says it is, you can save a bundle of money on your property taxes.\n\nJosh and Alicia Green embraced the concept of trashing their own house, writing a description for their appeal that was the polar opposite of a real estate agent's gushing ad. We reminded them we lived on a busy road, Western Avenue, Josh Green said. We also told the city about costly repairs we needed, like a new roof. In addition, the Greens noticed that the District listed their house as having three bedrooms. But we alerted them that the previous owner had knocked out a wall and made it two bedrooms, thus lowering the value more, Green said.\n\n[How to figure out the value of your home]\n\nAccording to the National Taxpayers Union, less than 5 percent of homeowners do what the Greens did, even though the union estimates that between 30 and 60 percent of properties in the United States are over-assessed. The vast majority of assessors are not malicious or careless; they are simply making judgment calls about how to utilize limited resources in tackling a big job, said Pete Sepp, the union's president. Homeowners shouldn't take it personally, but they shouldn't assume the government is right, either. Sepp says that when well-prepared homeowners take the time to appeal, most win at least a partial victory. Here's how to improve your chances of being one of the winners:\n\n●Meet the deadline. Tax assessments in the District, Maryland and Virginia are mailed out January through March. (In some parts of the country, they arrive in the last quarter of the year.) Once you receive your assessment, you typically have just 30 to 120 days to file your appeal. Check the rules for your jurisdiction and make sure your paperwork is postmarked by the deadline.\n\n●Understand assessment ratios. Some jurisdictions tax your house based on 100 percent of its value, but others assign a lower assessment ratio, such as 60 percent. This means a house with a market value of $100,000 would have an assessed value of $60,000. If you see a number that's lower than your home's true value, check the assessment ratio before assuming you don't have a case. You can find that ratio on your actual tax assessment notice or on the assessor's office website.\n\n●Look for errors on your property work sheet. Contact your tax assessor's office and request the internal notes and data the assessor used when setting a value for your property. Different jurisdictions call this paperwork different things, including property work sheet and property card. What you're requesting are the internal notes and data the assessor used when setting a value for your property. Study these documents, checking for lot size, house age and dimensions, number of bedrooms and baths, most recent purchase price, and anything else that could affect your home's value. If you find mistakes that make your property seem more valuable than it is, that is strong ammunition. This is the tactic the Greens used when they pointed out that their house had two bedrooms, not three.\n\n●See if the comparables are really comparable. The government's internal notes will also include comparable properties the assessor used to help determine the value of your house. Look for reasons the properties the assessor chose are not appropriate. Are they bigger? Newer? Newly remodeled? Do they have watertight roofs, while your house needs a new one, as the Greens' did? Next, identify three to six alternative comparables that are more favorable to you. You can find them free using such websites as Redfin, Trulia and Zillow. Or you can consult a real estate agent or appraiser.\n\n[Grocery shopping in person or online: Which is best?]\n\n●Escalate as needed. Some property tax disputes can be settled through informal discussions with the assessor's office. For example, Fairfax County, Va., encourages homeowners to call. More commonly, you will be asked to fill out forms and the entire process will be done on paper. If your initial appeal fails, most jurisdictions offer an in-person hearing as the next step. Tip: Attend somebody else's hearing first to get a feel for the process.\n\n●Hire help if you must. If you don't have time to follow the steps above, you can hire help. Some real estate lawyers take property tax appeals on a contingency basis, which means you don't pay unless you win. If you prevail, a typical fee is one-third to one-half of the first year's savings.\n\nThe Greens ended up appealing their property tax assessment several years in a row and won every single time. Fighting our tax assessment was less time-consuming than filling out my kids' summer camp forms, Alicia Green said. And for the time invested, you get money back instead of forking it over. The Greens estimate that they spent about five hours and saved at least $5,000 in property taxes over the seven years they lived in that house. We made a strong, truthful argument, and it was effective, Green said.\n\nSepp says the Greens got it right by sticking to nuts-and-bolts information about their property, rather than complaining that their assessment was unfair. A homeowner who marshals proper evidence, sticks to facts rather than make political statements and follows procedure is more likely to meet with success because they've made their own luck, Sepp said. You wouldn't go into traffic court to challenge a parking ticket by arguing the mayor is corrupt. Rather, you'd provide evidence you were parked there properly during nonpaying hours.\n\nAnother benefit of appealing your assessment: When you successfully lower your property tax rate, it resets from that lower rate for years to come. By the way, it did not affect the value of our house when we sold, Alicia Green said. I imagine people would wonder that. It's a common misconception, but think of it this way: Lower property taxes are a benefit for potential buyers as well.\n\nElisabeth Leamy is a 13-time Emmy winner and 25-year consumer advocate for programs such as Good Morning America and The Dr. Oz Show.

But some provisions present potential business pitfalls. The bill would generally provide less financial support to lower-income people who currently sign up for insurance through the exchanges. That could create big problems for insurers if it deters people — especially healthy people — from buying coverage, as insurers depend on a mix of healthy and sick people to keep their plans profitable and premiums affordable.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd the bill wouldn't affect all health insurances companies equally. Many large insurers have pulled back from offering plans on the laws exchanges, leaving them less exposed to future risks.\n\nMario Molina, the chief executive of Molina Healthcare, a small insurer that is a big player in both the Medicaid market and the exchanges, said that the bill does not inspire confidence.\n\nThe present bill, in the current form, doesn't do much to reassure this is a long-term, viable insurance product, Molina said. I'm actually more concerned about Medicaid and what this is going to do to our safety net.\n\nThe bill would preserve much of the status quo until 2020, when the Affordable Care Act's financial assistance to consumers would be replaced by age-based tax credits.\n\nAD\n\nHow the tax credit plays out will be critical, said Elizabeth Carpenter, a senior vice president at Avalere Health. The change in the tax credit amount may cause some individuals — especially at the lower end of the income scale — to have to pay more for premiums and make coverage unaffordable. From an insurance company's perspective, who continues to buy insurance is critical.\n\nAD\n\nHere's more of what companies wanted, and what they got:\n\n1) Elimination of taxes\n\nInsurers wanted the health insurance tax repealed. Drug companies wanted the prescription drug tax repealed. Medical device makers wanted to kill an excise tax. Big employers wanted to abolish the Cadillac tax, a 40 percent excise tax on high-cost employer health plans. With the exception of the Cadillac tax — which was previously delayed to 2020 and now will be been delayed to 2025 — they all got what they wanted.\n\nAD\n\nAn analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that, over a decade, repealing the health insurer tax would cost $145 billion; repealing the prescription drug tax would cost $25 billion; repealing the medical device tax would cost $20 billion; delaying the Cadillac tax would cost $49 billion.\n\nStill, companies are pushing for the Cadillac tax to be scrapped entirely, instead of the current delay.\n\nAD\n\nThe delay is better than current law, said James Gelfand, senior vice president of health policy at the ERISA Industry Committee, a lobbying group that represents large companies. Now is the chance, and this is the bill that must completely eradicate the Cadillac tax.\n\n2) A replacement for the individual mandate that will encourage healthy people to sign up for insurance\n\nHealth insurers need both healthy and sick people to sign up for insurance to have a balanced risk pool. This was a major problem in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, where too many healthy people were willing to pay a fine rather than sign up for insurance.\n\nAD\n\nInstead of a mandate and a fine if people don't sign up for insurance, the bill would create a continuous coverage requirement that would penalize people who have a gap in their coverage. Anyone who lets their insurance coverage lapse could experience a 30 percent premium hike the next time they sign up.\n\nAD\n\nOne possibility is that people will be incentivized to avoid any gaps in coverage, to avoid that 30 percent premium surcharge. But here's another scenario: A young, healthy person lacks coverage. She goes to sign up, but she faces a penalty that would make her plan more expensive. Why not just wait until she really needs insurance, since she'll be paying the penalty either way? In contrast, sick people who need insurance are more likely to pay the penalty.\n\nMolina argued the requirement could result in confusion and more gaming of the system — he questioned how it would even work logistically, with insurance companies researching whether people had been continuously covered or issuing some certificate that people had coverage ending at a certain date. And, he said, the premium hikes still wouldn't cover the cost of people who are really waiting until they are sick to sign up — on average, he said those members cost about twice as much as a normal member, not 30 percent more.\n\n3) Help providing affordable coverage\n\nThe bill would replace the premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies in the Affordable Care Act with a flat tax credit, based on age. Currently, only people who make between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty limit are eligible for tax credits that defray their premiums. The size of the credits are pegged to people's incomes and the cost of a benchmark plan in the marketplace where they're buying insurance. That helps account for the fact that the average premium can vary widely depending where a person is buying insurance.\n\nThe new tax credit would gradually peter out for people who make more than $75,000 a year or $150,000 for a couple, but it ignores the fact that care costs more in different geographical regions or that someone who makes $20,000 a year might be more strained in trying to buy an insurance plan with the same amount of financial help as someone who makes $74,000. The graph below shows how a flat tax credit would do little to defray the monthly cost of insurance in markets where health insurance is more expensive.\n\n4) Continued support for subsidies that help people pay for insurance in the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces\n\nThe insurance industry has been clear that it wants a stable transition, meaning that subsidies that help people pay for their insurance premiums shouldn't be abruptly yanked out from underneath them. The bill keeps in place those tax credits and cost-sharing reductions that help lower the out-of-pocket costs for people based on their income — until 2020.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMolina, however, said that since the money hasn't been appropriated yet, he fears that Congress could stop funding the cost-sharing reductions as early as May.\n\nWith the possible lost of the cost-sharing reductions, I think insurers will probably raise their prices as much, if not more than they did this year, Molina said. I wouldn't be surprised if we see rate increases and more plans dropping out.\n\n5) More flexibility in the ability to design health coverage benefits\n\nInsurers requested fewer rules, regulations and red tape. The draft bill takes steps toward easing insurers' ability to design health coverage, but leaves in place the 10 categories of essential health benefits that must be covered.\n\nAD\n\nInsurers currently charge more to people based on their age, but current rules limit the spread to three times the costs of the youngest group of insured people. The bill would allow them to charge five times as much to older people. It also does away with a requirement that plans offer products with a specific value — a provision that created bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans that were progressively more expensive.\n\nIn general, plans would like flexibility to design a product to meet the needs of their consumers in a particular market, and certainly getting rid of those tiers is one way to increase flexibility for plans, Carpenter said.
But everything changed after Geary connected with InReturn Strategies, a start-up intent on making hiring more inclusive by bridging the gaps between employers and job candidates with disabilities. Its founder, Jim Atwater, helped Geary prepare for interviews, showing him how his perspective and experiences could be an asset to potential employers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, Geary works at Cerner, a global health-care technology company, where his decades of experience navigating the medical system inform his work as a data analyst. He said he's happier than he has ever been.\n\nFor me, it means that I can start building the life that I want, Geary said, rather than having to go along with what other people had planned for me.\n\nAbout 61 million Americans have some kind of disability, which the Americans With Disabilities Act defines as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. But even as inclusion becomes a marketing buzzword and major brands such as Nike roll out disability-friendly products, unemployment among groups with disabilities is more than double that of the general population. Less than 20 percent of people with disabilities held a job in 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has been like this for decades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAtwater said he created InReturn Strategies to tackle what's known as the disability employment gap. As one of roughly 400 deaf entrepreneurs in the United States, he knows how workers with disabilities can be overlooked and undervalued by employers. He says members of this demographic are often the last to be hired and the first to be let go, and they are often relegated to jobs below their skill level.\n\nThere's lots of people talking about inclusion and making tons of money from consulting, but very few people are doing anything about it, Atwater said. We are the mechanism to turn intent into action.\n\nResearch shows that hiring disabled workers benefits firms' bottom lines. A 2018 report from Accenture, which analyzed the disability protocols and financial performance of 140 companies, found that firms with the best practices saw 28 percent higher revenue, double the net income and 30 percent higher profit margins, on average, over a four-year period.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf the number of people with disabilities in the labor force grew just 1 percent, the nation's gross domestic product could expand by as much as $25 billion, the Accenture report found.\n\nCompanies looking to hire workers with disabilities usually follow traditional hiring channels, which often include processes that can be exclusionary. Meanwhile, access providers — organizations offering services to people with disabilities — don't tend to have many connections in the private sector.\n\nWe're building bridges where there aren't any, said Scott Brouillette, InReturn's chief executive. How are you going to hire someone you don't understand and have no relationships with?\n\nNathan Beck, who has spent 20 years helping people with disabilities access jobs in Hamilton County, Ohio, said it can be hard to get companies to care.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLots of times, people with disabilities don't want to disclose that they're disabled, because they're scared they won't be interviewed, Beck said. The way Jim and InReturn are approaching businesses is about trying to integrate people with disabilities into the business strategy, as opposed to the opposite. It's a whole new approach.\n\nInReturn's platform connects private-sector companies with more than 4,500 access providers across the country. InReturn then helps companies tailor their practices to better work with candidates with disabilities.\n\nAs director of human resources at Lead Bank, a Kansas City, Kan., bank, Angela Blackburn has striven to a build a workforce that reflects the community. But like many hiring managers, she has struggled with how to wade into a different talent pool.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI feel like when people feel like they're not knowledgeable in that area, they shy away from it, Blackburn said. Not because they aren't interested in including the population, but because they don't know what to do. And that's where InReturn comes into play.\n\nWorking-age people with disabilities in the United States have nearly $500 billion a year in disposable income, according to a 2018 report from the American Institutes for Research, making the group one of the largest market segments in the country. But, on average, they make 63 cents on the dollar compared with their non-disabled counterparts.\n\nMatteo Lieb, who works on employment policy and programs at the National Down Syndrome Society, said employers often treat hiring people with disabilities as an act of philanthropy. It should be about snagging the best talent, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe really work with employers to have them realize that this is not just something they're doing out of the kindness of their hearts, he said. This is something good they're doing for themselves.\n\nIn a testimonial, the parents of a young man with autism described his difficulties landing a job before InReturn. Although he holds a master's degree in business administration and passed his certified public accountant exam on the first try, the interview process presented major hurdles.\n\nThose with high functioning autism lack pragmatic language skills, skills we use in daily interaction with others, the family wrote in the testimonial. Employers need to be aware of these challenges and find a way to bridge the gap.\n\nAD\n\nInReturn helped communicate those challenges to potential employers, giving them the context they needed to make their screening processes more inclusive. Within two weeks, the man was hired as a tax associate at a wealth management firm.\n\nAD\n\nOur son was at ease, gained confidence and gained success, the testimonial reads. It is our hopes that all companies will get on board and make inclusiveness a priority. There is great talent just waiting to be tapped into.\n\nSome companies are beginning to understand the untapped value of workers with disabilities. Microsoft has a dedicated website for job-seekers with disabilities to learn about the company's hiring practices and accommodations. Procter & Gamble, Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, Ford and other giants have neurodiversity hiring initiatives to seek employees with neurological differences, such as autism, dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n\nAD\n\nBut the challenge goes beyond changing the way companies see workers with disabilities; it's also about helping these workers access all the opportunities available to them, said Chris Lee, who is working with InReturn to set up a pilot program with the Kansas State School for the Blind.\n\nAD\n\nFor a lot of people with disabilities, their self-awareness of what their future can look like is very low, Lee said. A lot of it is about introducing them to businesses or career paths they never knew existed.\n\nIn a case study, InReturn brought a group of young people with Down syndrome to an Apple store in Kansas City, Kan. When the store manager asked about their job aspirations, they uniformly said they imagined working in a grocery store or restaurant.\n\nThat's all they've ever seen someone like them do, Atwater said. The visibility to what their opportunities can be is just nonexistent.\n\nIn the fall, InReturn was appointed to the CEO Commission for Disability Employment, a group of companies and other organizations working to help people with disabilities achieve and maintain equal access to meaningful employment. Its message of dignified, profitable inclusion is one it hopes can be shared with all companies, regardless of size or field.
Egypt's decision was probably fueled by memories of the so-called Arab Spring, when Tunisia's massive anti-government protests spread to similar protests in 10 other countries in the Middle East and North Africa in 2010. In Egypt, the protesters forced the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak after almost 30 years in power.\n\nShould Egypt's government and other governments worry about France's yellow vest protests triggering similar protests in their countries?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOur forthcoming research on the diffusion of democracy protests suggests they should not. Protests about domestic issues, we find, do not generally spread from one country to its neighbors. But here's what can spread: the symbols and approaches that highly visible protests use. Let us explain.\n\nHere's how we did our research\n\nWe collected daily data from newspapers, NGO reports and so forth on the specific dates in which a democracy protest began and ended in every country around the world between 1989 and 2011. We then examined whether a protest beginning in one country made it more likely that a similar protest would begin in a neighboring country (i.e., one within 30 to 500 miles of its borders) within the next 30, 45, 90, 120 or 360 days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe found no evidence these protests spread. When a protest occurred in one country in this period, it did not significantly increase the likelihood of similar protests taking place in neighboring countries. This was true not just of democracy protests, whose primary demand is open and competitive elections, but also for other forms of anti-government protests, such as the yellow vest protests.\n\nWhy are protests unlikely to spread?\n\nDemocracy protests do not tend to spread, we argue, because they are about domestic issues that are generally unrelated to what is happening in other countries. Democracy protests tend to arise when elections, economic crises and other events within the country focus the public's existing anger about political, social or economic grievances, prompting collective action.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn general, protests in neighboring countries do not provoke new discontent in other countries [remind citizens of their own discontent]; nor do they bring people together on behalf of existing [that] discontent. In fact, most democracy protests are small, short-lived, repressed and unsuccessful — and are thus poor models for protests in other countries.\n\nLike democracy protests, the French yellow vest protests are not good models for protests in Egypt and other countries where fuel prices are high. That is because France is a Western democracy where freedom of speech is not only protected but also extolled. It is also known for its protest culture; its citizens and voters could reasonably expect their government to make concessions, as indeed happened.\n\nEgypt, in contrast, is an authoritarian state known for being increasingly repressive toward dissenters. Last year, an Egyptian court sentenced 75 people to death for protesting the 2013 coup d'etat that brought the current president, Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, to power.\n\nSo why do protests appear to trigger demonstrations in other countries?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNeighboring countries tend to be similar in many ways. The domestic forces that set off protests in one country may well exist in its neighbors as well. What's more, it is much easier for academics and the news media to take note of protests that happen soon after one other than it is to track all the protests that were not followed by similar events in neighboring countries.\n\nBetween 1989 and 2011, 24 democracy protests began in countries within 45 days of a similar protest in countries within 30 miles of them. But 258 protests — more than 10 times as many — began even though there had not been a similar protest in a neighboring country within the previous 45 days. For instance, in May 2018, Brazilian truck drivers staged massive — and eventually successful — protests against increased fuel prices. Yet we have not seen similar protests in other Latin American countries.\n\nEven if protests do not spread, their symbols and strategies might\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough democracy protests and anti-government protests do not spread to other countries in general, their symbols, strategies and tactics can. By wearing yellow vests, activists outside France have been able to make their protests appear to be part of a larger movement, attracting more international and domestic media attention. The Egyptian government's decision to ban yellow vests may not be absurd after all.\n\nBut many of these protesters have made demands, including anti-Muslim demands in Germany, that are very different from those seen in France. These non-French protests were often triggered by events within their own countries and sometimes even began before their French counterparts. In Bulgaria, the so-called yellow vest protests against fuel prices began a week before those in France; protesters only began wearing yellow vests after they had become iconic in France. In Iraq, protests against unemployment, corruption and poor public services had been going on for months before Iraqi protesters began sporting yellow vests last December.\n\nIf we are witnessing a yellow vest wave, it is not a wave of unified protests; rather, it is a spread of the symbols.\n\nDawn Brancati is visiting scholar at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies, Columbia University.

I'll get Congress, Trump replied. I've been getting politicians to pass whatever I wanted all my life. Nobody has more experience — you know, it's sort of interesting, nobody has more experience dealing with politicians. I've been dealing with them all my life.\n\nAD\n\nHow? As a developer.\n\nWhether it's big New York City zoning deals — which, by the way, are probably tougher than most of the things I'll be dealing with foreign countries, he continued. I mean, I built a city on the West Side of Manhattan. You talk about getting zoning. Getting zoned for Trump Tower: 68 stories on 57th and 5th. Let me tell you, I've been dealing with politicians all my life. They're fine. They're wonderful. They're all talk, they're no action. They're selling this country down the tubes, and they're easy to deal with. Believe me.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1980, the New York Times explained how Trump finessed the zoning board for the development of Trump Tower. After quoting a business partner of Trump's, who said that Trump knows how to get things done in New York, the paper explained: In part, that is a matter of politics. The only donor who gave more money than Trump to the campaign of the incumbent governor, it reported, was the governor's brother. While a deputy mayor also said that Trump could be very convincing when selling a project, a city council member told the Times that Trump runs with the same clique that continues to manipulate things behind the scenes in this city, including links to a Democratic Party machine in Brooklyn connected through his father.\n\nAD\n\nThe Times also reported that the final negotiated height of Trump Tower was 56 stories, not 68.\n\nWhy re-litigate 40-year-old news articles and four-year-old news conferences? Because it's worth remembering that Trump at no time was prepared to manage the process of passing legislation through the House and the Senate. The current government shutdown, approaching three weeks in length, stemmed from dual failures on Trump's part: Most recently in an inability to cajole members of Congress to see his side on funding for a wall on the border with Mexico and, earlier, a failure to passing a funding mechanism for that wall during the two years when Republicans controlled the House and the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nTrump will note (and has noted) that the existence of the filibuster makes passing legislation trickier than bare majorities might make it seem. And that's fair — but it also means that Trump at no point was able to use those zoning-board skills to persuade even eight Democrats to join his view of an issue. At one point, a deal seemed to be in the works with the Democratic minority, trading wall money for the protection of immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nAD\n\nTrump rejected that deal, and here we are.\n\nAt times over his first two years in office, Trump was unable to even navigate issues popular with the Republican base and that didn't require a 60-vote margin. He deferred to congressional leaders on the outlines of an overhaul to the Affordable Care Act, later disparaging a House-passed bill before it got to the Senate. When a reform effort came to the Senate under reconciliation rules that required only 50 votes, Trump could not persuade those easy-to-deal-with politicians to pass it, despite his party's majority.\n\nAD\n\nThat Trump's team didn't advance the overhaul legislation is the least surprising part of this. At the same news conference in Iowa, he proudly proclaimed that he was reticent to put together position papers — both because voters don't really care about them (fair enough) and because they would tie his hands in negotiations. Part of it, too, was obviously that the specifics of drafting legislation never appealed to him. So he has continually left the details up to his colleagues on the Hill, then has had to advocate for things that he himself didn't develop. Pun intended.\n\nAD\n\nThere are a lot of reasons that the current fight with Congress is unwinnable for the president. He chose to make a stand on his most politically divisive proposal precisely because it is so divisive and, therefore, so important to the most vocal part of his base. But it also gives his opponents even less incentive to side with him than they might otherwise have. He has been ineffective at making his case, in part because the case he's making is the same one he has made over the entire course of his political career. He is left flailing, with no obvious way out but to fold.\n\nThat, too, is part of the Trump business legacy. Over his multiple decades in the real estate industry, he has walked away from bad or failing projects, such as his casinos in Atlantic City.\n\nAD\n\nOr that city Trump built on the West Side of Manhattan.\n\nAD\n\nIt was not the evidence of his savvy that Trump presented in Iowa. Intending the development to feature the tallest building in the world, he had hoped to lure NBC to it. That never materialized, thanks in part to tax concessions that NBC received to stay in Rockefeller Center — concessions that Trump had sought to aid his development project.\n\nThe Times noted at the time that Trump had suffered only defeats in advancing the project, writing that Trump does not so much avoid failure as know how to land on his feet and change course so deftly that no one catches on.
THE DISTRICT\n\nMan wounded in SE shooting\n\nA man was shot and critically wounded Wednesday morning when at least one gunman opened fire on a vehicle on Wheeler Road in Southeast Washington, D.C. police said.\n\nThe shooting comes six days after four other people were shot and wounded in separate shootings in two hours on Feb. 23, along a six-block stretch of the same street.\n\nActing D.C. police chief Peter Newsham said there certainly is some kind of dispute going on in the area, but he would not be more specific.\n\n— Peter Hermann\n\nMARYLAND\n\nPaid sick-leave bill advances\n\nMaryland's House of Delegates on Wednesday gave preliminary approval to a bill that would require businesses with 15 or more workers to provide paid sick leave.\n\nThe measure, which the House passed in 2016, faces an additional vote in that chamber before being taken up in the Senate, where it failed last year. The legislation is sponsored by Del. Luke H. Clippinger (D-Baltimore). It would ensure a minimum of one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours of work, up to seven full days per year.\n\n— Josh Hicks\n\nVIRGINIA\n\nDemocrats line up to\n\nrun for county board\n\nFour Democrats have lined up to run for the Arlington County Board a week after longtime board member Jay Fisette announced that he would not seek reelection.\n\nThe party will hold a caucus May 11 and May 13 to select a nominee for the November general election. The candidates are Erik Gutshall, a business owner; Peter Fallon, a tax accountant; Kim Klingler, an emergency medical technician; and Vivek Patil, a biotech professional.\n\nIndependent Audrey Clement is also running.\n\n— Patricia Sullivan\n\nMan, 20, is arrested\n\nafter alleged assault\n\nA Virginia man was arrested Wednesday after allegedly sexually assaulting a woman on Tuesday in Annandale, police said.\n\nOn Tuesday, officers responded to the 7900 block of John Adams Court after a 27-year-old woman said she was sexually assaulted at knifepoint while moving out of her apartment, Fairfax County Police said in a statement. The suspect fled after a neighbor heard the woman screaming.\n\nPolice said Burhan N. Ahmed, 20, of Annandale will be charged with aggravated sexual battery, among other offenses.
A class-action complaint filed in the Hamilton County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas on behalf of Matthew Adam and all others similarly situated, alleges that Walmart used a fraudulent, unlawful, deceptive and unfair course of conduct to market and sell its four Trouble Brewing beers as craft beers, and because of this, Members of the public were fraudulently induced to purchase Defendant's Craft Beer at inflated prices.\n\nRagan Dickens, Walmart's national director of media relations, said in an email statement, We hold our suppliers to high standards and are committed to providing our customers the quality products they expect. While we have not yet been served with the complaint, we take this matter seriously and intend to defend ourselves against the allegations. Adam's attorney did not respond to email or phone messages seeking comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 12-page complaint, published online by Consumerist, reiterates most of the facts laid out in a story I wrote last month, down to quotes from a senior buyer for Walmart's adult beverage team: The four Trouble Brewing beers were created for Walmart by WX Brands, a company that develops exclusive brands of wine, beer and spirits for retailers around the world. Though the cans say the contents were brewed by Trouble Brewing in Rochester, N.Y., no American brewery with the name Trouble Brewing actually exists. They're actually produced at Genesee Brewing, makers of Genesee and Genesee Cream Ale, on a contract basis. Genesee is owned by North American Breweries, a subsidiary of Costa Rica-based Florida Ice and Farm, which includes breweries among its holdings.\n\nThese statements and omissions were material to the transaction at hand, the complaint says, as Plaintiff would not have purchased [the Trouble Brewing beer] otherwise.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeyond the issue of where the beer is made, the lawsuit is partly based on the fact that it's not craft beer, a claim that Trouble Brewing never makes outright on its label, though Teresa Budd, a senior buyer for Walmart, told me, We were intentional about designing a package that conveyed a look and feel you'd expect of craft beer. The Brewers Association, a national trade group for small brewers, defines craft brewery as being small (under 6 million barrels produced per year); independent (less than 25 percent owned or controlled by a non-craft brewer) and traditional (making traditional beers, not flavored malt beverages, alcoholic sodas or other products). Further, Julia Herz, the Brewers Association's craft beer program director, told me last month that we do not classify contract companies as brewers because they don't have a brewers' notice from the Tax and Trade Bureau.\n\nThis is not the first lawsuit filed by a consumer who alleges being misled into thinking that a product made by a large company is in fact produced by an artisan brewery or distillery, and it certainly won't be the last. The problem is that the track record of these lawsuits isn't very good. Last June, for example, a federal judge dismissed a case brought by a California beer lover who claimed that Blue Moon, which is owned by Coors, was marketing itself as a craft beer produced by the Blue Moon Brewing Company. The judge found that a reasonable consumer was not likely to be deceived by Blue Moon's packaging or website.\n\nIn 2015, a federal judge dismissed several lawsuits against Tito's Handmade Vodka from consumers who complained that the vodka was not, in fact, handmade as the label asserted; Maker's Mark had similar suits dismissed the same year.\n\nAD\n\nAD
When a property isn't selling, owners often asks whether they should consider renting it out. While we are generally big fans of owning investment property, most sellers in this situation fail to think through all of the factors that should be considered in making this important decision.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn many cases, it may be better for the homeowner simply to lower the sale price.\n\nBut it may make sense for homeowners to pull the house off the market and rent it out if they are moving away for a relatively short term but will return to the area; or if they have a long-term time horizon for holding the property as a rental, have built a financial model that takes into account all the costs of being a landlord and are comfortable being a landlord.\n\nIf you're thinking of going down this road, the first thing you should do is to identify and acknowledge your emotional reasons for selling. What we typically hear is that homeowners didn't get the sale price they wanted so they consider renting out the property for a while as a placeholder so they can wait for the market to bounce back. This logic often has less to do with the actual costs/benefits of renting, but rather the emotional burden of selling at a perceived loss.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSecond, you should look at the actual numbers. Many homeowners do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to see whether renting out the home would cover the direct carrying costs of owning it. The costs they typically consider are their mortgage payment, taxes and insurance. However, the problem is that this quick calculation almost always underestimates the true costs of being a landlord.\n\nHere are a few of the common expenses/costs overlooked by sellers:\n\nVacancy : Sellers need to account for the time it takes to lease their property and any gap between tenants. Landlords typically assume 5 percent vacancy a year, which diminishes gross rental income by the same amount.\n\nProperty management : Homeowners often overlook property management costs (roughly 8 to 10 percent of gross rents) in our area. Even if homeowners plan to manage properties themselves, they should account for the value of their own time and effort.\n\nLeasing fees : It takes work to find a tenant. Management companies typically charge one month's rent to find a tenant.\n\nOngoing maintenance and capital reserves : Sellers should remember to budget for ongoing maintenance (leaky toilets, appliance repairs, etc.) and larger capital expenses (roof repairs, HVAC repairs, etc.). Ten percent of gross rents is a good rule of thumb.\n\nOpportunity costs: The opportunity cost is defined as what the homeowner could earn on the equity in his home if it were invested elsewhere. Sometimes, the opportunity cost can be substantial. For example, homeowners with $100,000 in equity in their home (after paying off all debt, taxes, fees, etc.), should factor in an additional cost of $3,000 to $5,000 per year, depending on what the expected return on capital might be.\n\nThird, a would-be seller should consider the soft costs of renting as well. For example, renting can put tremendous wear and tear on a property (both from acts and omissions from a tenant). Tenants typically do not take as good care of the property as does a homeowner. A lot of damage can happen to a home in a short time frame, especially for a single-family detached house.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen the owner is done renting and ready to sell, it can be costly to get the property in the same condition as it was before the tenant moved in. The moment a house becomes an investment property, the resale market typically discounts the value of it as compared to an owner-occupied home.\n\nFinally, if there is significant appreciation in the property, an owner may lose out on a valuable tax break. The U.S. tax code allows homeowners who have lived in a home at least two of the previous five years to exclude up to $250,000 of capital gains ($500,000 for a married couple) from their taxes. Homeowners who rent out their home for more than three years therefore will lose out on this valuable exemption. (Consult an accountant on this.)\n\nOnce homeowners factor in all of these costs, the rental option often turns from a roughly break-even scenario to one that generates a deficit each month. This puts additional pressure on the capital appreciation required to make the rental option a sound choice. In other words, the capital appreciation has to more than compensate for the monthly deficit. In a flat or down market, the rental option can be financially devastating.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the end, owners who do their homework and conduct a thorough analysis of their options will make a better decision.
Bond prices also fell, sending yields higher, and oil prices plunged to an 18-year low amid continued uncertainty over the duration of the coronavirus shutdown.\n\nAD\n\nEven the prospect of roughly $1 trillion in emergency federal aid, including $1,000 checks for taxpayers and an airline industry bailout, was not enough to halt the retreat. Dire predictions about the global pandemic's spread and its likely economic toll discouraged traders.\n\nAD\n\nAfter growing without interruption since mid-2009, the U.S. economy will likely shrink in the second quarter at an annual rate of 14 percent — a staggering decline that exceeds the worst of the global financial crisis, according to economists at JPMorgan Chase. A sudden stop that began in China, where the virus originated, is now rippling through the U.S., Europe and vulnerable emerging markets, likely shrinking global output for the entire year.\n\nOn March 18, the stock market took another hit amid coronavirus fears as the Dow fell 1,300 points, nearly erasing the gains made under President Trump. (Reuters)\n\nTomorrow's Labor Department report of initial jobless claims is expected to show evidence of the first layoffs triggered by the pandemic. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expects claims to reach 250,000 this week, up from 211,000 last week and to top 1 million next week.\n\nAD\n\nThe thing that has me the most concerned is the speed and severity of what's playing out here, said Gibson Smith, a prominent bond fund manager with Denver-based Smith Capital Investors. There's just a lot of stress in the system.\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, markets for U.S. government and corporate debt strained to handle a flood of sell orders. Investors sold 10-year Treasury securities to raise cash, sending prices down and yields up to 1.2 percent. The 10-year yield has more than doubled since March 9, when stocks and bonds began plunging in tandem. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.\n\nTreasurys have been whipsawed during the coronavirus pandemic as investors seeking a safe haven initially drove bond prices up and yields down, said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer of Penn Mutual Asset Management. In the past week, as institutional investors sought to raise cash by selling treasuries, prices sagged while yields jumped.\n\nAD\n\nSome analysts said concern over Washington's unprecedented spending plans, which will balloon the already swollen federal budget deficit and debt, were behind the latest moves.\n\nAD\n\nGlobal fixed income markets this morning have lost confidence in the ability of the governments of the world to finance the fiscal stimulus they are proposing, Carl Weinberg, chief international economist for High-Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients. Traders, investors and speculators have looked at the size and cost of the fiscal stimulus proposed by the United States and other governments — especially Italy — and decided to sell sovereign debt of all kinds.\n\nInvestors said corporate debt markets also are not yet operating smoothly. Companies have taken advantage of record-low interest rates in recent years to load up on debt. That strategy worked well so long as short-term borrowings could be periodically refinanced.\n\nAD\n\nNow, some cash-strapped companies that are not earning enough to make their loan payments may struggle to roll over their debt, said Anne Van Praagh, head of global credit strategy for Moody's Investors Service.\n\nAD\n\nLike most investors, Moody's anticipates a wave of credit downgrades and corporate debt defaults. Energy companies hit by the abrupt oil price decline and businesses that are most exposed to the evaporation of consumer spending — such as airlines, hotels, cruises, and automakers — face the greatest risk.\n\nWe're going to go into a period of severe and extensive credit shock across many regions, sectors and asset classes, she said. This is unprecedented.\n\nAD\n\nAmid unpredictable day-to-day changes in market conditions, former Fed Chairs Janet L. Yellen and Ben Bernanke called for the central bank to begin purchasing high-quality corporate debt as part of its economic rescue efforts — something it has never before done.\n\nThe Fed's intervention could help restart that part of the corporate debt market, which is under significant stress, the pair wrote in The Financial Times.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow's plunge from its all-time high of 29,551 on Feb. 12 has eliminated one of the president's favorite campaign arguments. As stocks soared since the 2016 election, Trump repeatedly took credit at campaign rallies and in White House remarks. He drew attention to the market setting all-time highs and boasted about the effect on voters' investment accounts.\n\nAD\n\nAs late as Feb. 24, the president took to Twitter to talk up stock prices, tweeting: Stock market starting to look very good to me.\n\nThe Dow has lost more than 8,000 points since then.\n\nShares of Boeing, once the showcase of the bull market, closed just below $102, less than one-quarter of its March 2019 peak. Trump has pledged federal aid for the wheezing aerospace giant.\n\nIf 2008 was the Great Financial Crisis, this is the Great Virus Crisis, said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. It's all at once a health crisis, financial crisis and economic crisis. We need to fix the health part of it before we have it solved, but we can take financial and fiscal steps to blunt its effects. We are starting to do that now.\n\nAll three major U.S. stock indexes are in a correction, having declined beyond 20 percent from their highs.\n\nThe Dow marked its eighth straight day of 1,000-point swings, which was considered unthinkable until recently. Stocks are moving on every news conference, financial proposal, headline and medical utterance. The blue chips closed up more than 1,000 points Tuesday off news of a $1 trillion stimulus proposal from the White House.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut that gain was wiped out on Wednesday, as investors sold stocks despite extreme government intervention aimed at cushioning the economy against a coronavirus-fueled recession. The Federal Reserve began the week by slashing interest rates to near zero and reviving a financial crisis-era quantitative easing program, and on Tuesday the central bank announced plans for a special fund to keep credit flowing during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe longer the economy is in a deep freeze, the strain is only going to increase, said Heppenstall. There's just so much uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus. It makes it hard for anyone to plan.\n\nEuropean markets also tanked Wednesday as governments introduced sweeping, blank-check stimulus moves to prop up their economies, with the benchmark Stoxx 600 index closing down more than 4 percent as oil and gas stocks plunged. Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom have hurled hundreds of billions in rescue package funding at the virus. French President Emmanuel Macron went so far as to promise that no French company will be allowed to fail because of the coronavirus impact, saying the government would provide assistance through loans or delayed tax payments and even nationalize industries to keep them afloat.\n\nYields on Italian debt rose to 2.3 percent, roughly twice what they were less than one week ago.
Torres could not recall the name of the person who modified the list or the exact date of the incident. But she said she continued in her job at the club and was later working in the kitchen when Trump visited the club under Secret Service protection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTorres's account, first reported by the New York Times, suggests that the presence of undocumented workers at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., was known by at least some managers. Last month, several women went public to say that they worked at the club without legal immigration status.\n\nTrump Organization officials and White House officials declined to comment.\n\nThe presence of undocumented workers at one of the president's signature golf clubs stands in sharp juxtaposition to his staunch rhetoric against illegal immigration. Since launching his White House bid, Trump has vowed to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out undocumented migrants, accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the country. His demand for more than $5 billion to build the wall has led to the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump touted his company's hiring practices. In the fall of 2016, when he opened a new Trump hotel in Washington, he told the assembled audience: We didn't have one illegal immigrant on the job. Everybody knows it.\n\nAnibal Romero, a Newark-based immigration attorney, said he now represents five immigrants who say they had worked at Trump's Bedminster club without legal status in recent years. Investigators with the FBI and the New Jersey attorney general's office have collected employment documents on his clients in recent months, he said, an indication that the agencies may be scrutinizing the hiring practices of the president's club.\n\nMeanwhile, Torres's experience and that of another worker suggest that the Secret Service may not have had a full picture of who was in proximity to Trump and his guests when they visited the Bedminster club.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVictorina Morales, 45, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who said she worked as a housekeeper in a different part of the club cleaning Trump's villa, said Secret Service agents gave her a pin to wear every time Trump visited.\n\nI had to wear the pin to get into the golf club, Morales said in an interview Thursday.\n\nHer supervisor asked her to sign her name to receive a pin, but Morales said she explained that she did not know how to write, so she didn't sign. I told them I couldn't write, so they let me go at that, she said.\n\nMorales said she recalls one pin having an American flag and another with a design that she did not recall.\n\nSecret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said a Secret Service pin bearing the U.S. flag is a novelty item and is not used by the Secret Service as a means of identification, verification or access control. She declined to discuss what kind of pins agents may have provided Morales.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOfficial pins indicating someone has permission to enter secure areas have other designs; they are provided to venue staffers by the Secret Service only after a background check, according to former officials.\n\nIt is unclear whether Morales received such a screening. She said she did not recall being asked to submit her information in advance but said she assumed her supervisor provided it.\n\nIf that person got a pin without being screened, that's a serious violation of the protocol, according to a person familiar with the Secret Service screening process who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nMilhoan said the agency does not comment on our protective operations, including the administration of our name-check program. She declined to say whether officials ever screened Morales or Torres for a Trump visit to the Bedminster club.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe revelations about undocumented workers at Bedminster surfaced publicly in the Times last month, when Morales and Sandra Diaz, a 46-year-old Costa Rican native, said they were hired by the New Jersey club despite their lack of legal immigration status.\n\nMorales said Thursday that she told a Bedminster supervisor when she applied for the housekeeping job in 2013 that she did not have proper immigration papers to work legally in the United States. She recalled being told: It's no problem here. You don't need papers.\n\nThey knew I didn't have good papers, said Morales, who worked at the club until last month. Romero, her attorney, provided The Washington Post with payroll and tax documents from recent years that list her employment at the Bedminster golf course.\n\nAD\n\nTrump Organization officials have repeatedly declined to address the specific allegations by the workers. Last month, spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a statement: We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices. If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately.\n\nAD\n\nA person close to the organization said that an internal investigation of claims made by former workers at Bedminster produced no credible information to support a range of allegations they made, including that managers were aware of employees without legal status.\n\nTorres said she began working at the club in early 2015 doing housekeeping and then moved to the kitchen staff, first as a dishwasher and later in food preparation, earning $14.50 per hour. She said she got the job with a fake Social Security number.\n\nAD\n\nMorales said she worked with Torres in housekeeping and said she recalled her transferring to the kitchen staff.\n\nTrump visited Bedminster at least a half-dozen times during the 2016 campaign, according to news coverage of his travel. Around the time he became the Republican nominee, Torres said, security got tighter at the golf club, particularly when he was visiting.\n\nAD\n\nFor presidential candidates under Secret Service protection, the agency seeks to check the backgrounds and criminal records of anyone who will be in proximity to the candidate at events. Agents from a local field office who are preparing for a candidate visit require the management of the venue hosting the visit — whether it is a hotel, a convention center or a golf club — to provide, several days before, the names of all employees who will prepare food, entertain or wait on the candidate.\n\nAD\n\nThe Secret Service's protective intelligence division then runs those names through a national FBI database to determine whether anyone is wanted for a bench warrant or has any history of arrests or convictions for drugs or violent crimes.\n\nAt one point, Secret Service agents arrived at the Bedminster club and kitchen supervisors asked all kitchen staffers to put their names, ages and Social Security numbers on a list, Torres said. She said she could not recall exactly when that occurred.\n\nAD\n\nTorres said she and other undocumented employees gave their information but then grew concerned that it would be used to discover their immigration status.\n\nShe said she grabbed a golf cart and drove to an administrative office, where she asked a human resources employee to remove her name from the list. When asked why, she recalled, she said: Because I'm undocumented. I don't have papers.\n\nTorres said the human resources official agreed to take her and several other undocumented Hispanics off the list.\n\nShe took a pen and crossed it out, she said. She crossed out our names.\n\nTorres said she was later working at the club on occasions when Trump visited. At times, Secret Service agents who accompanied him were Hispanic, Torres said, and the kitchen staffers would chat with them in Spanish.\n\nTorres said she left her job in Bedminster in 2017 because she felt uncomfortable as a woman in a mostly male kitchen. She said she was also stressed out by the intensity of working during Trump visits, when she would arrive at 8 a.m. but often not leave until late at night. She also said she did not like Trump's comments about immigrants.\n\nHer experience with Trump personally, she added, was not unpleasant. At one point, she recalled, he shook her hand and told her she was doing a good job, before giving her a $50 tip.
Regular readers of The Fact Checker know we often warn about campaign attacks highlighting certain votes or comments that are so old they often lack context. Overall, Sanders offers a misleading portrayal. So here's a guide to these statements.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1983, Biden pushed to raise the Social Security retirement age.\n\nSanders cites a newspaper clip from Jan. 11, 1983, that says, Biden suggested a gradual increase in the retirement age would help improve the Social Security system. This was not a controversial position at the time. Two months after these comments, large bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate agreed to the Social Security amendments of 1983, which included raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing payroll taxes to improve the solvency of the program.\n\nThe broad outlines of the plan was recommended by the National Commission on Social Security Reform and is believed to have strengthened the long-term health of Social Security. Sanders, in 1999, praised the 1983 law an example of bipartisan cooperation.\n\nAD\n\nWe should remember that in 1982, Social Security was within a few months — a few months — of not being able to pay out all benefits owed to Americans, Sanders said. And then people came together and said of course we want to save Social Security. They worked together, and they did.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1984, Joe Biden first pushed to freeze funding for Social Security — which would end up cutting Social Security benefits.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, bipartisan alarm grew over soaring federal budget deficits under President Ronald Reagan. Biden, along with two Republican senators and another Democrat (Max Baucus of Montana), proposed a simple solution — a one-year freeze on all spending, including defense spending and social programs such as Social Security.\n\nAD\n\nBiden pitched it as the last best chance to keep deficits from undermining the economic recovery and dropping the country into another recession. He also said it would avoid having to make other significant changes in Medicare and significant changes in Social Security generally.\n\nThe plan was rejected 33 to 65, though more Democrats than Republicans voted for it.\n\nAD\n\nWhatever one may make of the proposal, it was not aimed at Social Security specifically but was part of an effort to reduce the budget deficit. The Washington Post reported the dramatic simplicity of the plan was its fatal flaw as conservatives rebelled at the deep cuts it would have made in Reagan's military buildup, liberals balked at the constraints it would have put on major domestic benefit programs such as Social Security and many moderates shuddered at both results.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1995, I was on the House floor fighting the GOP's efforts to cut Social Security. Five days later, Joe Biden gave a speech in the Senate bragging about his work with the GOP to try to freeze funding for Social Security.\n\nFast forward 10 years to another budget fight. Republicans had taken control of the House and Senate and were pressing for passage of a balanced-budget amendment. Biden did make a floor speech on Jan. 31, 1995, which referenced his 1984 effort to freeze all spending.\n\nAD\n\nWhen I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.\n\nAD\n\nAgain, Sanders frames this as an effort only about Social Security, but it was much broader — aimed at every part of government, including defense.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Joe Biden was criticized by seniors' groups for supporting balanced budget amendments that would cut Social Security.\n\nSanders here cites a newspaper clip that says an array of liberal-leaning groups — not just senior groups — were angry at Biden for supporting an amendment to the constitution mandating a balanced budget. The fear was that such an amendment would force reductions in domestic spending.\n\nAD\n\nBiden was one of 10 Democrats in the Senate who supported the amendment; 35 Democrats were opposed. But the amendment failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority for passage.\n\nAD\n\nThe amendment itself does not mention Social Security. Biden tried to pass an amendment exempting Social Security, but he did not get the necessary votes. Social Security at the time was running huge surpluses, helping to mask the full extent of the budget deficit.\n\nFor the next 20 years or so, revenues from the Social Security Trust Fund will make it look like we have balanced the budget when in fact we have not, and after that the huge outlays from the trust fund will force drastic reductions in the rest of federal spending, or drastic reductions in Social Security, Biden said in his floor speech.\n\nIn 1996, Joe Biden floated the idea of reducing Social Security benefits through an early version of chained CPI.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere, Sanders cites a newspaper clip of Biden in a debate with a Republican challenger. The solvency of Social Security was considered an urgent issue at the time, given the pending retirement of the baby boom generation, and Republicans promoted ideas such as allowing Americans to divert Social Security moneys into private investment accounts. Biden's challenger supported that idea. In the debate, Biden countered that there were less dramatic ways to find savings in Social Security such as reducing the interest rate to calculate cost of living benefits or boosting the retirement age by a year.\n\nA Chained CPI — Chained Consumer Price Index — is a different way of calculating increases in the cost of living. It assumes people adjust buying patterns when prices changes, and it results in a slightly lower rate of inflation. So benefits for programs such as Social Security grow at a slower rate — what Sanders calls a cut.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Sanders saying in 1996 that the aging population made it clear that we will have to make incremental adjustments in Social Security taxes and benefits — as Congress has done in the past. The Sanders campaign has insisted adjustments did not mean reductions in benefits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2007, NBC reported that as president, Joe Biden's Social Security plans 'would include discussing options such as upping the retirement age.'\n\nSanders here cites a news story (actually by the Associated Press but on the NBC News website) from when Biden was running for president, titled Biden unveils plan to protect retirement savings. The article is mostly about his plan to bolster retirement savings but adds:\n\nTo protect Social Security, Biden said he would bring both parties to the table to keep the plan paying out. That would include discussing options such as upping the retirement age and raising the cap on income subject to the Social Security tax past the $97,500 it was in 2007. 'It ain't broke — it doesn't need privatization,' he said of Social Security. 'There's other ways to help savings.'\n\nAgain, you can see Biden's comments mostly are intended to rebut Republican hopes for private Social Security accounts. Raising the cap on the amount of income subject to Social Security tax — currently $137,700 — was a common proposal by Democrats at that time.\n\nIn 2007, Joe Biden appeared on Meet the Press to say that Social Security and Medicare cuts should be 'on the table.'\n\nAD\n\nBiden was challenged by host Tim Russert on the growing budget deficit, and he indicated a willingness to bargain if a lasting deal could be reached.\n\nRussert: Senator, we have a deficit. We have Social Security and Medicare looming. The number of people on Social Security and Medicare is now 40 million people. It's going to be 80 million in 15 years. Would you consider looking at those programs, age of eligibility … Biden: Absolutely. Russert: …cost of living, put it all on the table.\n\nBiden went on to cite the bipartisan agreement leading to the 1983 Social Security amendments: That's the kind of leadership that is needed. Social Security's not the hard one to solve. Medicare, that is the gorilla in the room, and you've got to put all of it on the table.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, when the soaring federal deficit again was a major issue, President Barack Obama and then House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) discussed a grand bargain that would have raised the retirement age and changed the formula for calculating Social Security benefits, in addition to reductions to Medicare and Medicaid, in exchange for higher taxes on the wealthy. No deal was ever reached.\n\nThough it's not in the Twitter thread, we are going to add one more example, sent to The Fact Checker by Sanders research director Tyson Brody, since it might appear in some future attack.\n\n1995: Biden offers to cut $89 billion from Medicare.\n\nDuring a Senate floor speech over the GOP plan for a balanced budget calling for reducing Medicare spending by $270 billion over seven years, Biden said, You guys want a balanced budget in 7 years, and you want CBO [Congressional Budget Office] numbers. I want a balanced budget, too, but I do not want to cut as much Medicare as you do. I do not want to cut as much as you do, and I do not want to give as big a tax break as you want.''\n\nBiden went on to say: So we can make a deal, make a deal. We will split the difference between the CBO figure of 2.4 and the OMB [Office of Management and Budget] figure of 2.6. Take 2.5 — that is $250 billion. And make another agreement. Agree I will go for a bigger cut in Medicare. I say we only need to do $89 billion. That is all we need — not $270 billion. I will split the difference with you on that.\n\nThis was not an unusual position for a Democrat at the time. A few months later, President Bill Clinton unveiled a budget plan that would have cut Medicare by $124 billion over seven years, a much bigger reduction than suggested by Biden.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSanders framed this as 40 years of working with Republicans to cut Social Security. But these statements came during periods when a growing budget deficit was a major concern in official Washington. Biden, like many mainstream politicians, thought action needed to be taken.\n\nIn some cases, Biden offered proposals intended to counter more extreme options offered by Republicans. At other times, Biden indicated a willingness to bargain with Republicans, though any deal resulting in spending reductions in entitlement programs was forever elusive. After 1983, the benefit cuts never happened.\n\nIn one case — 1983 — Sanders attacks Biden for supporting a deal that Sanders himself had praised. That's rich.\n\nAlso missing from this picture are the many votes Biden took to increase certain Social Security benefits or block GOP plans; the Biden campaign provides a list of nearly 50 votes from Biden's long Senate career.\n\nMeanwhile, both parties now appear to have abandoned any pretense about caring about budget deficits. Biden's campaign platform calls for raising Social Security payroll taxes on wealthier Americans and boosting benefits for people who have been receiving Social Security payments for at least 20 years.\n\nBiden certainly could be challenged on why he took these positions at the time, but the snippets cited by Sanders are missing important context.\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter
The economic challenges posed by the virus are unique in that they are already hitting supply and demand. The former refers to the inability of workers to go to work, because of quarantines either at their jobs or their kids' schools, along with disruptions to the global flow of goods to retailers and factories. The latter refers to reduced spending at restaurants, movie theaters, stores, etc. Consider, for example, the many trips, vacations and conferences already being canceled. Add to that the chance that millions of workers without paid leave could lose paychecks, and you begin to get a sense of the sudden shock to commerce.\n\nThe combined effect of decreased demand and disrupted supply can lead to a serious recession. While we can hope the effects of the epidemic will be short-lived and the economy will quickly bounce back, we cannot take this for granted. Therefore, policymakers must move quickly to prepare effective economic countermeasures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong our most prominent concerns are the millions of employees who may be told not to come to work but who lack paid leave. While more than 70 percent of private-sector workers have some degree of paid sick leave, for workers in the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale, that share falls to 47 percent. Based on their low, often nonexistent, savings, such workers have little to fall back on if they're not getting paid.\n\nThere are various ways to quickly provide the support these households need.\n\nUnemployment insurance is often the first line of defense in a downturn, and we should be sure that state systems are ready to respond quickly. Two important considerations: Some big state trust funds (New York, California and Texas) are running low, and state agencies need to know that employees who are available for work but locked out because of a quarantine are eligible for unemployment insurance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne fast way to administer help is for the government to send checks to low- and middle-income households, a measure that was last used in 2008, when the George W. Bush administration sent out about $100 billion in 2008 to about 70 million households, which got an average check of about $1,100 in today's dollars. Research found these checks to be particularly useful to low-income households.\n\nThis intervention must be structured to reach low-income households without federal income-tax liabilities. (To be clear, these households do pay other federal taxes, most notably payroll taxes.) This is a huge limitation of the federal tax cuts under consideration by the Trump administration.\n\nSomething we really don't want is for sick workers who don't have paid leave to go to work, a known problem well before the coronavirus. Providing a generous tax break to employers (e.g. $800 per worker) to grant at least seven sick days a year to workers not covered would be a substantial incentive. In the same vein, we may also want to encourage employers to allow telecommuting, where possible. A modest credit for allowing telecommuting (e.g. $400) could increase the use of this option. An advantage of both these credits is that any changes are likely to be permanent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt various times in the recent past, we've quickly put more money into workers' paychecks by temporarily lowering their FICA (payroll) tax. This, too, requires legislation, a key part of which is to ensure that the Social Security Trust Fund is repaid through general revenue, as occurred the last time we tapped this source of quick relief.\n\nAll of the above are countercyclical fiscal measures: government spending to offset the shock. Monetary policy is also germane in this context, and the Federal Reserve has already signaled a willingness to cut the benchmark interest rate it controls to cheapen credit. There is, however, a good chance that rate cuts will be of limited help. First, credit is already cheap. But more important, if people are afraid of getting sick in public places, they won't take trips or go out to eat no matter how low interest rates fall. Nor will rate cuts reopen workplaces, factories and schools that are closed because of the virus.\n\nTurning to other ways in which the virus threatens family incomes, we need to be sure that people don't avoid testing and treatment because of insurance and surprise billing concerns. The Affordable Care Act covers government-recommended vaccines, but that option is many months away. The broader public interest makes this a critical moment for the government to pick up the tab for coronavirus-related treatment. Congress should act quickly to require that insurers cover testing and treatment for the coronavirus in the same way they are required to cover various forms of preventive care at no charge to patients.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe can also improve on the process of developing a vaccine. As Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar testified recently, we don't know whether a vaccine will be affordable because the holder of the patent will be able to charge whatever it wants.\n\nThis is unacceptable. It's fine and necessary for the government to provide resources to private companies to speed up development and testing of the vaccine, but there need to be two conditions. First, all the findings have to be made public as quickly as is practical. We want researchers worldwide to be able to benefit from any new findings to get to an effective vaccine as quickly as possible. The model here is the Bermuda Principles for the Human Genome Project, where results were posted nightly.\n\nSecond, any patents resulting from this work will be in the public domain. This means a successful vaccine will be available as a cheap generic from day one. The companies don't need to be compensated for their research because they've already been paid.

AD\n\nAD\n\nThe first doctorate in education was awarded in 1921 by Harvard. The first doctor of philosophy degree in the field of education was awarded in 1893 by Teachers College of Columbia, and has since been offered by hundreds of universities. As with any degree that stresses a research background, most schools required a dissertation and qualifying exams.\n\nBottom line: A holder of an EdD degree is as entitled to the title doctor as a veterinarian, and certainly as much as a lawyer and much more than a chiropractor.\n\nDavid E. Silber, Bethesda\n\nThe writer holds a doctoral degree.\n\nThe Dec. 29 Style article How op-eds sparked outrage all year long raised some interesting questions. Should the goal of an op-ed be inducing outrage? Are only national op-eds of importance? What happens to our democracy if we rely only on a few media sources — no matter how good — for news and commentary?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe article put a lot of emphasis on op-eds that caused controversy over the past year, rather than op-eds that advanced public policy debates and helped to develop an informed consensus. The real story is that op-eds, when done right, make us think and help us understand — they build consensus on policy concerns and contribute to a public debate.\n\nAnd it's not just about the elite 'legacy' publications defined as two newspapers in New York and one in D.C. Having spent more than 30 years offering thought-provoking op-eds to newspapers around the country, I can attest that there are thousands of outlets with thriving op-ed pages that are trusted and needed. They help readers understand what's going on in the nation, in their state capitals and in their local communities, whether it's redistricting, budget priorities or environmental concerns.\n\nWhen much of the action is grass-roots and outside the Beltway, we need the ideas and analysis that commentary pieces in the regional and local newspapers provide to help us better understand what's going on around the nation and in local communities and to find solutions. Politicians, even when they're in Washington, rely on their local papers to keep on top of their constituents' concerns. Providing a platform for reasoned exchanges of ideas at the national, regional and local levels helps build consensus on policy concerns — and bring us together.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe op-ed pages, as incubators of ideas, are an irreplaceable forum in our democracy that we need now more than ever.\n\nDenice Zeck, Washington\n\nThe writer is executive director of American Forum.\n\n●\n\nAn edifice to an edifying educator\n\nI am a great fan of Catherine Rampell's columns and loved her Dec. 25 op-ed celebrating her sixth-grade teacher, Priceless lessons from my sixth-grade English teacher. Like Rampell, I am the beneficiary of many excellent teachers who changed my life enormously. I am also the husband and father of teachers. I particularly enjoyed Rampell's phrase about her teacher instructing her about the masonry of language. Lovely piece.\n\nAD\n\nMarc Chafetz, Washington\n\nRepaying a teacher for such gifts is impossible, recalled Catherine Rampell in her Dec. 25 op-ed, Priceless lessons from my sixth-grade English teacher. She used her space to reflect on the influence of Mr. Greco, an educator she credited with any success [she's] had as a writer.\n\nAD\n\nAs a former middle school English teacher, I often wonder about my students and the memories we carved out together. I wonder about the youngster whose profound and self-conscious stuttering made his ability to participate an impossibility for fear of exposure. I remember how writing poetry liberated him by providing the perfect platform for sharing his debilitating struggle with his classmates and providing them with a lesson in humanity and sensitivity.\n\nAD\n\nRampell's words serve as a reminder that, though an educator such as Jill Biden, a woman with a doctorate, and Greco, a man with a passion for teaching, may not be able to minister to a heart attack victim on a flight from New York to Los Angeles, they provide the resources for those who can and do. No one makes it through life without teachers, many of whom save just as many if not more lives than the doctor on the plane. Thanks for reminding us.\n\nCarole Tauber, Rockville\n\nAD\n\n●\n\nSo funny we forgot to laugh\n\nI love Dave Barry, he's funny, and God knows we all need a laugh at the end of a year like 2020.

Who is she? What was she doing there? Had she been there all night, perhaps a sentinel of some kind?\n\nAD\n\nSteve Horwitz, Odenton\n\n●\n\nGeorgism isn't socialism\n\nIn his Dec. 31 Style article, Throwaway lines in the literary life? Not really., Michael Dirda described Progress and Poverty as Henry George's masterpiece of socialist thought. To the contrary, George rejected socialism, and his masterful analysis of economic problems, a bestseller in the 1880s and still applicable today, includes an analysis of why governmental direction and interference were not the answer to continued poverty and unemployment amid material progress.\n\nAD\n\nNeither a socialist nor a lackey of the robber barons, George favored liberty and free enterprise, but he opposed fortunes built upon special privilege, and, in particular, he advocated a single tax on the value of land and the abolition of other taxes. This would enable people to keep what they earned but not enjoy riches from the possession of land that they had done nothing to create.\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps Dirda has forgotten what he learned in the correspondence course in fundamental economics he took when he was 14. Such a lover of literature as he might wish to try reading Progress and Poverty as an adult; it is a literary masterpiece of elegant prose and lucid reasoning.\n\nNicholas D. Rosen, Philadelphia\n\nThe writer is president of the Center for the Study of Economics.\n\n●\n\nThe long and short of 'shrift'\n\nThe Dec. 30 editorial A bad stimulus idea said of the recently passed coronavirus relief bill, In short, the measure short-shrifted the neediest and showered billions on people who suffered little or no lasting hardship from the pandemic. I take no issue with the argument, but the writers probably meant the bill shortchanged the neediest, as in gave too little money to.\n\nShrift, from the verb to shrive, is confession of one's sins to a priest and presumably forgiveness. This was a rite so important to some Christian believers that it was sometimes done by a priest on the battlefield, with less than proper time or ceremony, for a dying soldier to expiate his sins before meeting his maker. This was known as short shrift, an expression that has come to mean to make a rush job of something. Victims of various plagues in history also got short shrift, without priests to hear their final confessions, and, sadly, many of the more than 350,000 Americans who have died of the coronavirus were also deprived of the comfort of last rites or family in their last hours because of the dangerous contagion of this disease.\n\nS.R. Hankinson, Stoddard, N.H.\n\n●\n\nA failure to see — and show\n\nWe all know that a picture is worth a thousand words. So why neglect to include a photograph of the late Susan Moore, whose video alleged racist treatment as she was dying of the coronavirus with the Dec. 27 op-ed by Aletha Maybank, Camara Phyllis Jones, Uché Blackstock and Joia Crear Perry, Say her name: Dr. Susan Moore. Online, the piece included a photograph that featured a White woman as its primary subject.\n\nThe lack of a photograph with the op-ed ironically underscored the very problem that the piece complained about: the failure to see Black women, to hear Black women and to listen to Black women, particularly when they are suffering.\n\nStacy Beck, Washington\n\n●\n\nCalming fears of a nuclear Pearl Harbor\n\nThe Dec. 27 obituary for George Blake, British spy divulged secrets to Soviets, did a good job capturing the remarkable life of one of the Cold War's most dangerous spies. However, the article mistakenly reported that the famed Berlin tunnel — the 1950s CIA and MI6 operation tapping Red Army communications in East Berlin that was betrayed by Blake — produced no worthwhile intelligence and that the Soviets used the phone lines for . . . disinformation. In fact, the consensus now among intelligence historians is that the information captured by the tunnel was valuable and that the KGB likely did not plant false information on the tapped lines. The sheer volume of intercepted phone calls and teletype messages — some 90,000 over 11 months — speaks to the improbability of a disinformation campaign.\n\nAs Blake told me when I interviewed him in 2015 for my book about the Berlin tunnel, slipping disinformation into an enormous stream of genuine communications would have been very easily spotted. Blake was one of only a handful of American and British intelligence officers who knew about the tunnel, and he would almost certainly have been exposed as a spy had the communications been doctored. Despite learning of the tunnel before it was even dug, the KGB opted to protect Blake and not warn Red Army commanders.\n\nRather than an intelligence fiasco, the tunnel provided the West with a wealth of information about Soviet military capabilities and intentions. At a time before U-2 planes and spy satellites were operating and there was high anxiety about a Soviet surprise attack, the tunnel intelligence calmed President Dwight D. Eisenhower's fears of a nuclear Pearl Harbor.\n\nSteve Vogel, Barnesville\n\nThe writer is a former Post reporter and the author of Betrayal in Berlin.\n\n●\n\nA flagrant foul\n\nAgain and again, The Post's coverage of women's sports is disproportionately — and discriminatingly — less than that of men's sports.\n\nOn Jan. 1, the University of Maryland's men's basketball team received 50 inches of column space — starting on the section front — and a photograph, even though the team lost an unmemorable game (84-73, against Michigan) that it was expected to lose.\n\nIn contrast, the women's basketball team received 12 inches of column space — starting on Page 5 — without a photograph, even though it won an outstanding game (96-82, against Penn State) in which Ashley Owusu scored a career-high 34 points. The highest-scoring men's player netted 19 points.\n\nThis follows a pattern of demeaning women's sports — yes, throughout the industry, but The Post should take the lead in reversing that pattern.\n\nConstance L. Belfiore, University Park\n\n●\n\nThe topography of memory\n\nI began my 50-year full- and part-time career with the U.S. Geological Survey in 1965, spending the first few years as a member of the compilation staff for the National Atlas of the United States, and I am proud to be listed on the atlas's acknowledgments page. So I greatly enjoyed the Dec. 27 Outlook essay by Ted Widmer, 765 maps that drew us together, even after a half-century has passed. I do not believe that I ever thought of the book as singing a love song to America; however, with hindsight, it may be an apt description.\n\nI emailed the article to friends and colleagues and would have liked to notify those who worked on it with me, but to do so after 50 years would necessitate there being email in heaven, as I am one of the few survivors. Actually, I would prefer there not be Internet in the great beyond, as I want peace and tranquility when I pass on. Thanks for this review, which brought a smile to this aged cartographer at the end of a troubled 2020.\n\nJohn Wittmann, Lanham\n\n●\n\nTear down this misconception\n\nGillian Brockell's Jan. 4 Retropolis article Controversial Lincoln statue is removed in Boston, but remains in D.C. misrepresented Frederick Douglass's comments on the Emancipation Memorial. According to Brockell, Douglass suggested that the statue depicting Abraham Lincoln and an African American freedman be replaced or added to. In fact, Douglass never suggested that the statue be removed or replaced.\n\nHistorians Jonathan White and Scott Sandage, who recently rediscovered a letter discussing the memorial written by Douglass, accurately characterized Douglass's real proposal, which was not to remove the memorial . . . nor to replace it but to supplement it with other works of art that would tell a more complete story.\n\nBret Boyce, Washington\n\n●\n\nShining in the darkness\n\nNow that we have closed the door on 2020, I thank The Post for being a bright spot in a terrible year. From Eli Saslow's heartbreaking Voices From the Pandemic to Michelle Singletary's eye-opening series on systemic racism to Robin Givhan's insightful commentary, it was outstanding journalism across the board. I also appreciated the addition of Kate Cohen's voice to the op-ed page.\n\nAlthough reading the news made me want to cry more often than not this year, The Post did an excellent job presenting the stories that needed to be shared.\n\nJane Rooney, Oakton
According to records on the committee's website, the last time the appropriations panel was without someone from the Old Dominion was 1915, when Woodrow Wilson was president and a quart of milk cost 9 cents.\n\nVirginia appropriators from the more recent past used their clout to arrange funding for Metro, bridge and highway improvements, defense projects, anti-gang initiatives, and even the Iraq Study Group.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the retirements of senior members such as Republicans Bob Goodlatte and Frank Wolf and Democrat Jim Moran and the state's shifting demographics made room for new faces in the delegation.\n\nThat's the trade-off, said Steve Stombres, who was chief of staff to Eric Cantor during Cantor's tenure as House majority leader and is now a consultant.\n\nWith turnover comes fresh energy and new perspective and people who are very connected with their constituents and that's the positive side, he said, but the down side is you lose seniority and the ability of members to look out for the needs of the commonwealth.\n\nAside from Appropriations, Virginia's established members in the Democratic majority will move up the ranks on high-profile committees.\n\nAD\n\n●Rep. Robert C. Bobby Scott, the longest-serving member of the delegation from either party, is chairman of the Education Committee.\n\nAD\n\n●Rep. Gerald E. Connolly expects to be named chairman of a subcommittee within the Oversight Committee, which will interview President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, next month.\n\n●Rep. Don Beyer will be seated on the Ways and Means Committee, ending Virginia's more than 20-year drought. The panel sets tax policy and will play a role in any infrastructure bill that materializes.\n\n●Rep. Donald A. McEachin, who is interested in environmental justice, will sit on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nCommittee assignments for the five freshmen have not yet been determined.\n\nAD\n\nOf the Democrats, Rep. Jennifer Wexton of Loudoun County has said she would like to serve on the Transportation or Science committees. Her predecessor, Republican Barbara Comstock, served on both.\n\nRep. Elaine Luria, a former naval commander, is shooting for Armed Services or Veterans' Affairs committees, and Rep. Abigail Spanberger tried for the Agriculture or Intelligence committees.\n\nAD\n\nRepublican freshman Rep. Ben Cline wants Transportation or Agriculture while Rep. Denver Riggleman said his top pick is Financial Services.\n\nThe horse-trading and cajoling to land a committee assignment starts right after the election, aides said.\n\nMembers write letters and try to persuade leadership and members of a steering and policy committee and people close to them using political considerations, relationships, historical precedent, district geography and whatever else they can think of.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2017, with the GOP in charge of the House, Scott W. Taylor, a former Navy SEAL elected from Virginia Beach, did the near-impossible, winning a seat on the Appropriations Committee as a Republican freshman after a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, personal letters and a two-page flier extolling his virtues.\n\nAD\n\nHe argued that his district, with proximity to eight major military installations, including the largest naval base in the world, relied heavily on federal appropriations.\n\nTaylor got his wish, but lost to Luria in November.\n\nThis year, Democrats considered Virginia part of the Mid-Atlantic region with the District, Delaware, New Jersey and Maryland, which meant Wexton had to compete with more seasoned members from states with more Democratic members.\n\nAD\n\nIn the end, the three-term Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) was nominated for the Appropriations slot.\n\nDo you think somebody from New Jersey is going to represent the interests of Virginia? said Wolf, a former congressman who represented northern Virginia for more than three decades and sat on Appropriations for most of that time.\n\nHe used the committee to fund the Baker-Hamilton Commission to study the war in Iraq and secure money to combat the transnational gang MS-13, among other priorities.\n\nAD\n\nOne of advantages of Appropriations is I can pick up the paper in the morning, go in and do something about it, he said. As a subcommittee chairman, he said, you can get the cabinet secretary on the phone and say, 'We got to move on this.' \n\nAD\n\nDespite their different party affiliations, Wolf worked closely with Moran, who also served on Appropriations during the course of his 23 years representing Northern Virginia in Congress.\n\nMoran, who left Congress in 2014, ticked off a partial list of projects funded through now-banned earmarks through Appropriations: the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, the Springfield traffic interchange, planning for rapid transit connecting Arlington and Alexandria, Four Mile Run, and extension of Metro to Dulles.\n\nBut losing the seat on the committee doesn't spell disaster.
But this time, the prop revolvers were loaded with live bullets, and half the audience thought the drama was real. Hawley's decision to challenge the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory transformed the process into a farce, in which Cruz and other Republican senators promised to outdo one another's displays of loyalty to President Trump — until a mob of Trump supporters invaded the Capitol. Their gambit was too jaundiced even for Mitch McConnell (whose biographer dubbed him The Cynic); the majority leader exhorted senators to respect the people's choice and not rely on others to do the right thing.\n\nMcConnell was right. The two main protagonists knew they were playacting. Hawley and Cruz graduated from top universities and law schools and clerkships. They know what the Constitution says and how elections work. Even before Wednesday, they understood that their maneuvers wouldn't actually overturn the 2020 results, so there would be no real consequences. (As a senior Republican said of the president's election fraud fantasies in November, What is the downside for humoring him?) Supposedly, the institutions of American democracy would hold, and they'd get to put on a show to further their presidential ambitions by encouraging a popular delusion on the right.\n\nThe problem is that these institutions — even the Constitution — are shaped by what politicians like Hawley and Cruz say and do, and whether people believe them. If everyone thinks the rules work one way, then they do. But if people's beliefs change, the rules change, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocracy is built upon the notion that politicians who lose elections will admit defeat and move on. By challenging this idea — however insincerely — Hawley and Cruz are helping unravel the core political bargains of American politics. Senators with presidential ambitions cannot treat fundamental beliefs about democracy as something they can put on and take off like a costume, returning to real life when the curtain drops. If they act as though they don't hold a core democratic belief, they may convince the audience to stop believing, too. Wednesday's invasion of Capitol Hill shows what happens when people are told that the election has been stolen from them and that there is a chance to take it back.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Republican senators have paid the price for a cynical bargain. Many of them are institutionalists who at first denounced Trump during the 2016 primary race, but endorsed him after he won the nomination and swore he'd grow into the presidency. Asked to justify his fealty, McConnell has pointed to the federal judges and three Supreme Court justices Republicans seated under Trump, as well as tax cuts. But Senate Republicans continued to defend Trump even as he repeatedly sabotaged his own party. There was the pointless 2018-2019 shutdown over Trump's border wall (the longest shutdown in history) and the president's recent threat to veto the coronavirus spending bill, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, just before the Georgia runoff elections that would decide which party controlled the Senate. There was the Ukraine scandal, which forced the Senate to spend time debating Trump's use of foreign policy for personal gain, even if the GOP did use its majority to acquit him at his impeachment trial. And there was Trump's tight embrace of Saudi Arabia after its leader had Jamal Khashoggi killed, a policy that so outraged Republican senators that they rebuked him for it.\n\nIt's not just American politicians whose artificial dramas can have unexpected consequences. Take British Prime Minister David Cameron. He wanted Britain to remain part of the European Union but worried that the electoral threat from the UK Independence Party might rip open a long-standing divide in his Conservative Party over E.U. membership.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCameron thought he'd found a solution: to promise a referendum that would allow the people to vote on leaving Europe. He figured it was only a pretend promise, and domestic and international institutions would save him from having to deliver. And even if the referendum went ahead, British voters would never choose the costly path of unwinding the country's deep ties to the E.U. Everyone who really counted knew that would be stupid, even if they sometimes pretended otherwise. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for instance, began his career making up stories about how the E.U. wanted to do ridiculous things like ban prawn cocktail crisps (a disgusting but popular British delicacy) but also happily described himself as a fan of the E.U.\n\nOf course, the other actors in Cameron's drama didn't stick to his script. Britons voted for Brexit by a narrow majority, transforming the United Kingdom into a fundamentally different country and threatening the union of its four nations.\n\nHawley, Cruz and Trump, too, are pursuing short-term political gain at the risk of long-term chaos. Their political theater leaves something — a big something — to chance. They justify their actions as a response to the demands of their constituents. But those actions set precedents and change beliefs about what politicians can and cannot legitimately do when they don't like election results. What will happen when other politicians decide they can make up the rules as they go along? Already, the Republican majority in Pennsylvania's Senate removed the lieutenant governor from presiding on Tuesday, because they didn't want to seat a Democratic senator who had won his election. While they justified this as a response to a unique set of circumstances, they too are setting precedents that others will follow.\n\nAs commentators have said, Republicans deserve the blame for what is happening to America's institutions. They may suffer some of the fallout, too. If Republicans stop recognizing results that they don't like, there is nothing to prevent Democrats from doing the same, tit-for-tat. Seven Republicans in the House of Representatives have warned that efforts to overturn the 2020 vote might erode the advantage that the electoral college gives to their party. GOP candidates need the college, since they have won the popular vote only once in the past 32 years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps the authors of Wednesday's revolt already regret their role in goading the mob. Now that the Democrats have taken the Senate, they are likely to press for federal election reform, a proposition that's anathema to the right. As political scientist Sam Rosenfeld describes it, some Republicans understand that they benefit more in the long term from legal anti-democratic institutions than from dubiously legal anti-democratic actions, which are more set-piece theatrical statements than carefully planned strategies.\n\nThe challenge for people who want to protect democracy is twofold. First, they need to prevent repeat performances of this most recent theater. Drama is an inevitable part of democratic politics. Politicians will always seek to highlight some problem they care about in ways that grab the public's attention. Naked ambition of the sort Hawley and Cruz displayed is also an essential part of politics and can be productive when it is yoked to real political needs. It becomes a problem when ambition leads politicians to blur the boundaries between dramatic fiction and essential political facts, undermining the shared beliefs that hold democracy together.\n\nWidespread delusion can have bitter consequences, as we saw Wednesday, when amateur dramatics led a misinformed audience to storm the stage. Cameron's mistakes meant that the country he led dropped out of Europe and is at greater risk of breaking apart. Cruz and Hawley's not only helped provoke a mob but could also make American democracy unworkable, as everyone starts challenging every result they don't like. Politicians can't rely on political institutions to save the country from the consequences of their playacting, because the institutions aren't outside the politicians, and the politicians aren't outside the institutions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, the republic's guardians should recognize that the fight to secure democracy isn't over just because the mob has been evicted from the Capitol. The processes that allow democracy to work (vote counting, redistricting, early voting, identification procedures and voter registration) seem very boring to the public in the years between major elections. But we can go back to enjoying the political performances — and shrugging when the players ham it up — only if everyone knows it's a play, and the machinery behind the curtain is strong.
AD\n\nCan we talk about the children's book? Harris said, picking up a copy of Superheroes Are Everywhere, which she published alongside her memoir this week. Mama didn't raise no fool.\n\nAD\n\nBut seriously: Barring some wild, unexpected development, Harris is expected to enter the 2020 presidential primary, with most speculation putting her in the race by the end of January. If and when she does, it would fulfill a promise that many politicians and operatives saw in Harris years ago.\n\nUnlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who had to be drafted into her 2012 run for Senate, and unlike John Delaney, who jump-started a presidential campaign with no speculation or buzz, Harris has been seen as a potential president for most of her time in public life. As early as 2010, when she was a slight underdog in the race for California attorney general, Harris was described as a female Obama.\n\nAD\n\nHarris is not the only candidate expected to announce soon after years of White House speculation. Julián Castro is likely to make it official Saturday, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is heading back to South Carolina this month. Both have been talked up as potential presidents since they were moving up the ladder in municipal politics at the start of this century.\n\nAD\n\nEach of those candidates comes with different strengths and weaknesses; each, like Harris, has been looked at as the future leader of a new Democratic coalition, as opposed to a candidate such as Joe Biden, who allies say could win back voters the party has lost. One way to read Harris's memoir, The Truths We Hold, is as a pitch to a Democratic base that has shifted since she wrote her first book, on her criminal justice record and agenda.\n\nHarris's book and its accompanying tour present a politician who was counted out in every election until 2016, when she won her Senate race in a rout. There is no setback that she doesn't overcome, from a failed attempt to pass the bar (she passed it the second time) to an apparent defeat in her 2010 attorney general run (late-counted ballots gave her the win). Like Barack Obama, and like a younger cohort of first-generation American politicians, she describes a family of smart strivers who struggled so that she could succeed — and learn valuable lessons.\n\nAD\n\nI have too many memories of my brilliant mother being treated as though she were dumb because of her accent, Harris writes of her India-born mother, Shyamala, who died of cancer in 2009. Memories of her being followed around a department store with suspicion, because surely a brown-skinned woman like her couldn't afford the dress or blouse she had chosen.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2003, Harris defeated an incumbent to become San Francisco district attorney. She spent seven years in that role, making her first national headlines for refusing to pursue the death penalty. In 2004, that led to a clash with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who spoke at the funeral of a police officer and called it the special circumstance called for by the death penalty law — adding that had she known of Harris's position, she never would have endorsed her.\n\nBut while this was a defining political moment for Harris, Feinstein appears in The Truths We Hold only once, in a fond memory Harris has of driving across the bridge from my home in Oakland to celebrate when Feinstein and Barbara Boxer became California's first female senators. The debates over the death penalty, which nearly cost her the 2010 race, come up only when Harris recalls how one strategist (never named) said a woman who is a minority who is anti-death penalty who is DA of wacky San Francisco could not win statewide office.\n\nAD\n\nTo be fair, Harris has written a book (Smart on Crime) about her criminal justice record and agenda. The part of that she focuses the most on in The Truths We Hold is her Back on Track program, an innovation of the San Francisco's DA office that allowed first-time nonviolent drug offenders to get job training in lieu of jail time. The book's focus when addressing her six years as attorney general is a showdown with banks over what would become a $25 billion foreclosure settlement. The story of her phone call to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, is destined to be retold in Iowa and New Hampshire: I took off my earrings (the Oakland in me) and picked up the receiver.\n\nAD\n\nBut fully half of The Truths We Hold covers Harris's time in the Senate, just two years in which Democrats won one epochal battle over health care (at GWU, Harris thanked the late, great John McCain), and sloughed through many more defeats. Harris stands foursquare behind Christine Blasey Ford and the protesters who filled the Senate during the hearings on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh: Their voices, like Dr. Ford's, will have lasting reach.\n\nShe reprints transcripts of hearings at which she grilled John Kelly, initially a nominee to run the Department of Homeland Security, positioning the Trump administration's immigration policy as its defining debacle. She pitches ideas such as mental-health career training similar to Teach for America or the Peace Corps, and calls for the DEA to go after pharmaceutical manufacturers while the war on drugs is wound down.\n\nAD\n\nThe effect of all that is to present Harris as a perfect fit for the Democrats of 2020, one who was early and right about much of what the party's base cares about, and who was in the mix opposing Trump on everything that mattered. The book and the tour, which has been dominated by friendly, encouraging interviews, offer less clarity about how Harris can navigate two incredibly different electoral constituencies.\n\nAD\n\nHarris started her political career as a newsmaking opponent of capital punishment and is now accused by the left, pejoratively, of being a cop. That was never an issue in her California races; it will be an issue for plenty of Democratic voters in 2019. A senator whose smart-on-crime brand enabled her rise out of Bay Area politics is angling for the nomination to challenge President Trump, a politician who comes alive when attacking her community's support for undocumented immigrants, gun control and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nHer party's left, which has accused her of being cautious and resisting criminal justice reform ever since she moved out of the DA's office, does not get much detail about why she picked some fights and avoided others. The president's party, which is itching to run a 2010-style campaign against Harris as an embodiment of sanctuary cities and #MeToo politics, comes away with more material.\n\nAD\n\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) apologized on Jan. 10 to women who alleged they were sexually harassed or mistreated by male members of his 2016 campaign staff. (Reuters)\n\nBernie Agonistes. For two weeks, as he considers whether to run for president again, Bernie Sanders has gotten questions about female former staffers who say they were harassed during his 2016 campaign. Sanders, who put out a statement reflecting previous stories about the staff issues, went further today. In between the rollout of a prescription drug bill and an appearance with furloughed federal workers, Sanders walked up to Senate microphones and delivered a three-minute response to the news of a $30,000 settlement between his former Iowa campaign manager and two staffers.\n\nAD\n\nWhen we talk about ending sexism, and ending all forms of discrimination, those beliefs cannot just be words, Sanders said. They must be based in day-to-day reality and the work that we do. And that was clearly not the case in the 2016 campaign. The allegations that I have heard speak to unacceptable behavior that must not be tolerated in any campaign or in any workplace.\n\nSanders, who said he hadn't known about the settlement, had previously said he was unaware of the other harassment allegations. Today's statement was informed by the response Sanders gave at the end of a recent CNN interview, in which he reiterated that he condemned harassment and added that he was a little bit busy running around the country and never heard of the allegations at the time.\n\nAD\n\nSanders, who resents what he sees as the tabloid approach of much political coverage, was pilloried for the busy quote; the senator, who tends to ignore shouted questions in the halls of the Senate, decided to handle the new story on its own, with a mea culpa, no spin and a small aside about how he had instituted strong anti-harassment policies during his 2018 Senate campaign.\n\nAD\n\nThere is no good time to handle problems like these, but this is a particularly important month for Sanders. On Saturday, hundreds of house parties will be organized by supporters who want him to run for president again. By the end of January, at least three co-sponsors of Sanders's major legislation — Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker — are expected to be running. Sanders's supporters, in general, have praised his commitment to running a more diverse and sensitive campaign, if he runs again.\n\nHe should run, and he should make sure he has a diverse campaign staff that has one of the strongest harassment policies of any campaign, said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who has repeatedly encouraged Sanders to seek the White House. He should run because every 50 years or so, someone has the opportunity to fundamentally reimagine the possibilities of our political conversation.\n\nAD\n\nBut the way this unfolded revealed that Bernieworld, which consists of everything from the senator's staff to outside groups such as Our Revolution, is not being careful enough to protect the senator from controversy. The fuse of the harassment story was lit when Arturo Carmona, a former Sanders staffer and congressional candidate, posted photos of his trip to the Sanders Institute Gathering in Vermont last month. Masha Mendieta, who in 2017 had torpedoed Carmona's own campaign by alleging that he'd sexually harassed female staffers, posted an essay on Medium asking how Carmona could have possibly remained in the senator's orbit.\n\nAD\n\nMany of you asked me what Bernie had to say, assuming him or someone from his team obviously would have reached out to me after the story broke, Mendieta wrote. No, he did not and they did not. It was crickets.\n\nWHAT I'M WATCHING\n\nWho wants to be a billionaire? Tom Steyer is not running for president, focusing his time and money — at least $40 million of it — on the ongoing effort to impeach the president.\n\nSteyer, who got wealthy (and remains wealthy) running a hedge fund, was not the only billionaire looking at a 2020 run. But the Democratic Party, which has elected some independently wealthy candidates to governor's mansions (Illinois's J.B. Pritzker) and Congress (California's Gil Cisneros) very recently, is increasingly cold to the idea of a wealthy candidate barreling into 2020 and spending his own money to elbow aside any challengers.\n\nAfter her first stop in Iowa last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said every Democratic candidate ought to link arms and say, 'We're going to do this with grass-roots funding.'  To Warren, that also meant that independently wealthy candidates should not write their own campaign checks.\n\nWe ought to be building a movement, and the way we do that is with lots of involvement from lots of people, Warren said. Not having billionaires buy these campaigns, whether we're talking about super PACs, or self-funding.\n\nRep. John Delaney (Md.), the first Democrat to enter the presidential race, has an estimated net worth over $200 million, and spent millions to win a seat in Congress in 2012. But he has run his campaign so far with mixture of personal funds and donations.\n\nI have a budget for the campaign we're going to run between Iowa and New Hampshire, and my personal funds will make up for any shortfalls, Delaney said in an interview as he headed to weekend events in Michigan and Iowa. It may end up being about 50-50. Raising money creates a connection to the campaign; what gets you out of bed is the fact that people have invested in you.\n\nOther candidates have been bolder about dipping into their own finances. Former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg has hinted that he could spend up to $100 million on a campaign, similar to the spending in his mayoral elections. Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, is worth an estimated $2.7 billion and has not ruled out spending his own money; Richard Vague, an obscure businessman who recently visited with South Carolina Democrats, has not commented on the topic.\n\nMany Democrats bristle at the idea of wealthy candidates buying their way into politics, at any level. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who defeated wealthy Total Wine founder David Trone to win his seat in Congress, said he found voters receptive to the idea that candidates should earn their way into politics.\n\nWhat I used to say when I was running, my very first line at all the debates, was: Public office is something you earn, not something you buy, Raskin said.\n\nTrone went on to win the 2018 election to replace Delaney in another Maryland district; he and all House Democrats will vote soon on the For the People Act, a package of campaign finance and ethics changes that would, among other things, create a robust public campaign finance system. Republicans have said they'd block the legislation in the Senate.\n\nI think this bill will change the dialogue in 2020, said Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.). We'll see candidates, much more quickly after declaring, release their tax returns. I think they'll take a lot more questions about this on the campaign trail, and I think a lot more voters will be asking, 'What's your position on this?' \n\nTURNOUT WATCH\n\nIn the last edition of The Trailer, you learned that the special election to replace Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.), a former state senator from Virginia, could say something about how votes were moving in the suburbs. On Tuesday night, Democrat Jennifer Boysko won Wexton's old 33rd Senate District by the biggest landslide since it was created — a 39.7-point landslide over moderate Republican Joe May.\n\nIt'd be easy to overdetermine a meaning from this. Just 21,142 ballots were cast, not counting write-in votes, which meant turnout dipped slightly from the 2014 election that first put Wexton in the Senate. But until Tuesday, the record Democratic margin in the district was Wexton's 13.4-point win in 2015, a mediocre year for her party in the state. The collapse of Virginia's Republican Party has sped up since then.\n\nThe good news for Republicans is that few parts of the country are as inhospitable to a Trump-era GOP during a shutdown as Northern Virginia. The bad news for them: It's hard to take the party seriously when it says Sen. Mark Warner will face a serious challenge in 2020.\n\nAD WATCH\n\nDefending Democracy, a group of Republicans working to recruit a challenger to the president, is going on the air in New Hampshire to urge the GOP against altering rules that would stop that effort.\n\n2020\n\nJay Inslee. The governor of Washington will make his first visit to New Hampshire since suggesting that he might seek the presidency, making climate change speeches at Saint Anselm College and Dartmouth on Jan. 22.\n\nElizabeth Warren. She will be the keynote speaker at the Feb. 22 McIntyre-Shaheen dinner in New Hampshire.\n\nBeto O'Rourke. He is still talking about a road trip where he will personally get Americans' views on their country's politics; he also published an Instagram story of himself at the dentist.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand. Per the AP, she is considering basing a presidential campaign in Upstate New York, where her political career began.\n\nTulsi Gabbard. The House member got on the wrong side of Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Mazie Hirono from her state of Hawaii for agreeing with a conservative attack on them — that they engaged in religious bigotry by questioning a judicial nominee about membership in the Catholic organization Knights of Columbus.\n\nRichard Ojeda. He said he's resigning from the West Virginia state Senate to focus on a presidential run. Ojeda's resignation will allow Democrat-turned-Republican Gov. Jim Justice to appoint a replacement, though the seat will be on the ballot again in 2020.\n\nREADING LIST\n\nWhile the Trump reelection campaign is on air and online with ads, multiple Democratic candidates are buying digital spots, blasting out fundraising letters and Periscoping some takes about the shutdown that are building their lists and brands.\n\nJoe Biden is the Hillary Clinton of 2020, by Matthew Yglesias\n\nThe takes on why the former vice president would be a disastrous candidate are coming fast and furious, especially from writers who saw Clinton as a strong candidate in the early stages of last cycle.\n\nMission not quite accomplished, by Brendan James\n\n\n\nThe Oscar buzz for Vice is waxing and waning, but this explains why there's an audience for it — frustration with the rehabilitation of the Bush administration's reputation.\n\nCOUNTDOWN
This is a non-judicial foreclosure, says Anu Kmt, the attorney for the 72-year-old restaurant and its owner. Since the foreclosure did not go through the courts, Hutchins had to file a complaint to seek to halt the proceedings and prove the lender had no right to declare a default on the mortgage.\n\nMost small businesses don't have the legal muscle to fight back. This isn't free. You have to go to court to oppose it. It's very costly, Kmt says. This is like a legal hit and run. They ran us off the road, and we have to chase the ambulance back down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court spells out the allegations against ATS One Holdings Corp., its affiliated companies and Ari Jay Cohen and Peter Aytug, the principals behind the companies. Hutchins alleges that, starting in summer 2015, ATS began returning the restaurant's monthly mortgage checks as undeliverable, even after Hutchins and his attorney inquired about the lender's apparent (and unannounced) change of address. The lender allegedly didn't provide Florida Avenue Grill with a new mailing address.\n\nInstead, in January of last year, ATS used the alleged nonpayment of the mortgages as a pretext for declaring a default and very aggressively threatening . . .foreclosure, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHutchins alleges that he offered to give ATS a check for $23,555.30, the total amount of the apparently missing monthly payments, but ATS refused the money and threatened legal measures in an attempt to get Plaintiffs to agree to pay off the mortgages early. At that point, according to the complaint, Hutchins started sending a certified check each month to a new ATS address.\n\nAll those uncashed checks were enclosed in a Dec. 12 letter sent to Hutchins' attorney, according to the complaint. The letter informed Hutchins that his partial payments had been rejected, the lawsuit alleges, and that ATS was initiating a foreclosure proceeding against the restaurant at 1100 Florida Ave. NW. The trustee's auction of the property is scheduled for Jan. 18 unless a D.C. Superior Court judge agrees to the temporary restraining order on Thursday.\n\nIn an interview, Hutchins says that ATS claims he still owes $139,000, plus about $39,000 in fees, on two 2011 notes totaling $250,000. The Florida Avenue Grill property was valued in 2016 at $727,280, according to the D.C. Office of Tax and Revenue. This year, the property's value is expected to rise to $789,830.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's a money grab, Kmt says about ATS's motivations.\n\nAlan S. Macdonald, attorney representing ATS and its owners for the case, declined to comment on the lawsuit, which he had just received.\n\nThis whole incident has impacted the grill in the sense that it has been embroiled in a firestorm of controversy, says Hutchins. The fact is, if I hadn't filed the lawsuit, most people would just kind of think the grill doesn't pay its mortgage and look askance at me. . . I paid them every month, and that's not good enough.\n\nAccording to Hutchins's lawsuit, ATS (and its predecessor, Northern Funding) are real-estate lending subsidiaries of Northern Leasing Systems Inc., a company that the New York attorney general sued last year, alleging it engages fraudulent and deceptive practices that trap small business owners across the country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe New York lawsuit involves allegations of leasing of credit card equipment with terms that are onerous and totally one-sided in favor of Northern Leasing, according to a press release from New York attorney general Eric T. Schneiderman. When a small business tries to cancel the contract or stop paying, Northern Leasing will send threatening letters and commence collection actions in New York Civil Court, the release alleges. The attorney general's office claims Northern Leasing and its related companies filed more than 30,000 collection actions between 2010 and 2015 and obtained more than 19,000 default judgments, often because the businesses weren't aware of the action.\n\nThe attorney general's lawsuit is still pending. Defense attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case because, among other arguments, they say the statute of limitations has passed on the allegedly fraudulent actions. More than that, the lawsuit has no merit, says Arnold N. Bressler, a senior partner with the New York-based Moses & Singer, the outside counsel that represents Northern Leasing. We feel, as a matter of law, that the case should be dismissed, Bressler says.\n\nHutchins alleges in the lawsuit that in 2011 he agreed to a $200,000 deficiency note and a $50,000 promissory note, even though Hutchins in an interview says ATS never loaned him a single dollar of those funds. The restaurant owner alleges he was forced to agree to the notes or ATS would foreclose on Florida Avenue Grill and several units of the Lacey, the neighboring condominium project that Hutchins developed with loans from ATS.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey did the same foreclosure move again and basically made me agree to this mortgage, Hutchins says. No money was advanced for this mortgage. . . I didn't have the legal muscle at the time to fight them properly, so I had to assent to the mortgage or else they were going to foreclose on the grill. This is the kind of typical bullying tactics that they've used on me in the past.
Montgomery County residents socked with a hefty property tax hike last year would get a reprieve from further increases this year under the operating budget proposed Tuesday by County Executive Isiah Leggett (D).\n\nThe $5.4 billion spending plan for fiscal 2018, which begins July 1, holds the line on taxes while increasing spending on schools, affordable housing, libraries and code inspections in apartment buildings.\n\nLast year, Leggett's budget included an 8.7 percent boost in the average residential tax bill — the largest since 2008 — citing the needs of the fast-growing school system and revenue losses triggered when the Supreme Court ruled that Maryland's income-tax system was unconstitutional. He later trimmed the proposed increase to about 6 percent, but the County Council, which has the final say on budget matters, added new spending and ultimately approved a boost of nearly 9 percent.\n\nThe boost in taxes added to a brewing anti-incumbent sentiment among county voters, who approved a term-limits ballot measure in November.\n\nLeggett, whose third and final term ends in 2018, said last year's big increase should rule out any hikes over the next two years.\n\nMy view is that such a significant tax increase in one year means we should not ask the taxpayers to again pay at a greater rate to fund the FY 18 and FY 19 budgets, he said Tuesday in his budget transmittal letter to Council President Roger Berliner (D-Potomac-Bethesda).\n\nThe proposed budget holds property taxes essentially flat. The median bill for a $400,000 home would increase by about $20, from $4,106 to $4,126, due entirely to increased property values. With home assessments growing, Leggett's budget reduces the property tax rate by 2.5 cents per $100 of assessed value, from $1.025 to $1.00.\n\nThe proposed 2018 budget includes a moderate amount of new spending compared with last year's plan. Leggett urged restraint in light of economic challenges and uncertainties at the federal and state levels.\n\nPresident Trump's budget, which will be released Thursday, is expected to include historic shrinkage in the federal workforce that could hit hard in Montgomery, where more than 45,000 federal workers reside.\n\nThe county will also feel the continuing effects of the Supreme Court's decision in the Wynne case. The court ruled that a state law denying residents a full credit for taxes paid on income earned outside Maryland constituted illegal double taxation and ordered refunds issued to residents who had filed claims.\n\nThe ruling means that the county will receive about $30 million less in state income tax revenue each year. It must also pay $27 million a year in refunds between 2019 and 2023.\n\nThe uncertainties we are facing at the federal and state levels are a necessary backdrop to your consideration of the FY 18 Operating Budget, Leggett said in his letter to Berliner.\n\nMontgomery Public Schools continue to claim about half of county spending. The 159,000-student system would receive $2.3 billion under Leggett's proposal, about $25 million over state-mandated funding levels. That is significantly less than last year's increase, which was nearly $90 million more than the state minimum. Montgomery College would receive $2 million over state requirements, bringing its annual operating budget to $309 million.\n\nLeggett's plan increases spending on affordable housing by $53 million and expands county library hours. It also provides an additional $1.6 million to fund improvements in landlord-tenant relations, required by new legislation. The money would also underwrite a more robust code-inspection program.\n\nThe budget includes an additional $4 million for the new publicly funded campaign-finance system that will debut in 2018. Leggett said in an interview Monday that he views the legislation creating the system as poorly drafted and included the money grudgingly.He said his main concern is that there is uncertainty over how much the system, which had already been slated for $6 million in funding, will actually cost.\n\nThe council will review Leggett's proposal and pass a final budget in May.
The Iowa caucuses remain 13 months away, but a pent-up demand for change in the White House is tangible among Democrats eager for the 2020 campaign to start in earnest. The throngs of voters bombarding events in Iowa are testament to something fearful for Republicans: The huge tide of Democratic voters who powered the party's 2018 gains have not lost interest as attention turns to the 2020 presidential race.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI've never been to a rally, but I wanted to for a long time, said Dan Elliott, as he waited in the ornate Orpheum Theatre lobby in Sioux City for Warren to speak Saturday morning. I'm surprised by the energy here. The lines are longer than people expected.\n\nIowans cited a slew of reasons for their eagerness to begin the lengthy nomination process to settle on a leader to go up against President Trump. There were the tax cuts that one voter called a waste of time and money; the trade war with China depressing demand for exports and hurting farmers; the hostility toward immigrants, a labor pool heavily used on Iowa farms; the rolling back of environmental regulations that impact Iowa's rivers; a foreign policy approach changing the country's status in the world; and the general chaos and lack of civility in the White House.\n\nIt is never too soon to try to get rid of Donald Trump, said Shannon Kennedy, a 48-year-old Iowan who stood in line to take a selfie in front of a barn-door-size American flag at the Orpheum Theatre. There is an urgency to get things back on track. Our country is a laughingstock right now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's not just Warren drawing interest in what amounts to the widest-open caucus competition since 2004.\n\nBooker was greeted by enthusiastic crowds when he made his first trip to Iowa in early October for the Democratic Party gala. His visit included standing-room-only turnout at an event advertised as a discussion on agricultural issues and hosted in the Boone County Democratic offices.\n\nAs Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) gave a speech in Ankeny during her pre-election Iowa tour, she was greeted by a shout: Run for president! When she spoke in Iowa City and Des Moines, she filled rooms holding about 500 people.\n\nThey're paying attention because they don't think this guy can be reelected, said Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), who has already visited all 99 counties in his presidential bid. And the takeaway I hear from a lot of Democrats is that 2016 wasn't a good primary. It was about people going into their camps early. This year, it's the opposite; Democrats are focused on how we beat this guy in 2020, and they come into the primary process with an open mind.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHelping to channel some of this Democratic enthusiasm are organizations like Siouxland Progressive Women, one of thousands of groups that have cropped up on the left since the 2016 election.\n\nWe're so ready, said Susan Leonard, 64, a co-founder of the group. Her 200-member organization campaigned for J.D. Scholten, the Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). Now they're turning to 2020.\n\nWe've got invitations out to several presidential candidates already, Leonard said. It's a big group, and we want to hear their ideas.\n\nThere are plenty of candidates and potential candidates coming to Iowa to meet with Democratic activists. A day after Warren departs Sunday, Julián Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary and San Antonio mayor, is planning stops in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City. Delaney, who was the first Democrat in the race, will open campaign offices here when he returns to Iowa for events Friday and Saturday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTom Steyer, the billionaire who has been campaigning to impeach Trump as he ponders his own presidential bid, is returning soon for an event about education reform. He said in an interview that Trump's actions in the past few weeks had added to what was already highly charged enthusiasm. He specified the government shutdown and the departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\nWe added 5,000 people to our list this morning; we added 10,000 people to our list yesterday, Steyer said. Just look at the turnout on November 6: It broke records, and we think the people on our list turned out something between 75 and 80 percent. And subsequent to that, they literally can't get [an agreement] to keep the government open, and the most respected member of his Cabinet resigned!\n\nProgress Iowa drew about 150 people to its 2014 meeting that featured Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Last month's attendance doubled even though the roster included lesser-known potential candidates such as Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.), Sen. Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe've seen massive jumps, said Matt Sinovic, the group's executive director. Online donations are also up, he said.\n\nThis jolt of Iowa energy for Democrats began in early 2017, as Trump took office and Republicans assumed control of both houses of the legislature and retained the governor's mansion here, he said.\n\nNow that we have the chance to take on President Trump directly, now that he's on the ballot, you're going to see that continue to grow, Sinovic said.\n\nRepublicans have noticed the enthusiasm.\n\nThe Democrats are in a constant hissy about President Trump. It is sustained year around, said David Kochel, a GOP strategist who oversaw Iowa campaigns for Mitt Romney in 2012 and Jeb Bush in 2016. He predicted that Democrats will see a big caucus turn out in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nThey've been hungry for this presidential campaign to start in a real way, Kochel said. That's what you'll see with attendance and turnout early this year. They are champing at the bit to get started.\n\nAD\n\nFor Warren, a Friday night event in Council Bluffs meant for 300 people drew an extra 200. I'm sorry that there's not enough room to get inside, but I'm glad you're all here, she said. She would repeat that apology Saturday when several dozen couldn't squeeze into a panel discussion at a Storm Lake community center.\n\nThe crowds coming out are eager to engage. In Sioux City, when Warren told the audience there that she couldn't do anything about Trump's insults, Glenda Verhoeven, a 63-year-old farmer, shouted, Yes, you can!\n\nAD\n\nVerhoeven, who did not caucus for any Democrat in 2016, said that she considered the senator a strong challenger to Trump because the president seemed obsessed with her.\n\nAny time he starts calling people names, they're the people who bother him, Verhoeven said. She already knows the enemy, and he knows her.\n\nVerhoeven, whose farm and investments have been hurt by the administration's trade war, said Trump's actions make her more interested in the election.
Regarding the March 11 Real Estate article Surprise! Your credit score may soon jump up by 10 points.:\n\nBy ceasing the collection and reporting of substantial amounts of civil judgment and tax lien information, the three major national credit bureaus will be providing a significantly less valuable product at lower cost (and risk) to themselves while keeping the price of their product unchanged. And this was achieved under the cover of a legal settlement with 31 state attorneys general.\n\nLocal jurisdictions will be rewarded for shoddy record-keeping by enabling more of their highly problematic borrowers and renters to enter the general lending and rental pools — borrowers and renters who are 5½ times more likely to default than those without tax lien or civil judgment problems. In response, lenders will have to increase mortgage interest rates they charge to all borrowers and landlords will have to increase rental rates they charge to renters to offset the increased risk they have been required to bear.\n\nThe losers in all this are the ordinary, non-problem borrowers and renters. Can this be what the voters sought when they elected their attorneys general?\n\nVictor Cholewicki, Washington
The standoff — which has heavily affected national parks and other operations and threatens to halt payments as varied as food stamps and tax refunds — has made Trump's unrealized border wall the linchpin of his presidency as he seeks to make good on a signature campaign promise.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere's what you missed at President Trump's Jan. 4 news conference on the 14th day of the partial government shutdown. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\n\nAdministration officials have acknowledged that they were not prepared for the potential consequences of an extended shutdown and Trump's decision to demand wall funding. Democrats, meanwhile, are standing firm on offering no taxpayer money for the project, which Trump had long asserted would be funded by Mexico.\n\nPence was deputized by Trump to oversee Saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), according to two Trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. That meant few specifics were actually discussed Saturday, as Democratic staffers repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.\n\nBut the administration — represented by Pence, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner — refused, according to multiple officials.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot much headway made today, Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!\n\nBefore the meeting began Saturday morning, Trump took a combative tone in several Twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in Republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.\n\nGreat support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border, Trump tweeted. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!\n\nAD\n\nA number of Republicans, including Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is up for reelection in 2020, have said in recent days that the government should be reopened and that a shutdown is not the right answer, worrying GOP leaders about the depth of support for Trump's position.\n\nAD\n\nTrump spent much of Saturday on the phone with allies, talking through his positioning on the shutdown and hearing their reviews of his Friday news conference in the Rose Garden, according to a person close to him. Two people regularly on his call list — Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) — have encouraged Trump to hold fast and refuse to agree to reopen the government unless wall funding is secured, the person said.\n\nI've never seen the president as resolved on any issue as he is on this, Meadows said Saturday. But he is open to new ideas about how to end the impasse.\n\nAD\n\nTrump told reporters Friday that he wants to reopen government but is prepared to maintain the shutdown for weeks or even years. He also told congressional leaders at the White House on Friday that he preferred the term strike over shutdown, people briefed on the meeting said.\n\nIn conversations with top aides on Friday and Saturday, House Democratic leaders said Trump and GOP leaders seem eager to be seen as making progress even if the talks remained stalled, allowing Republican lawmakers back home over the weekend to reassure nervous constituents, according to two Democratic officials briefed on those discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAD\n\nThere is the reality of what the White House is doing, which is very little, and the image they're trying to send, which is, 'Look at us, we're busy, and the vice president is rolling up his sleeves,'  one Democratic official said. They're worried about defections.\n\nAD\n\nDuring Saturday's meeting, Democratic staffers asked the White House to lay out in formal detail the administration's funding request for the border — including its specific security requests, what the money would be used for, and what in the Homeland Security budget the administration would cut to make the numbers work, people familiar with the meeting said.\n\nDemocrats emphasized that it's important for us to have an updated budget request from the White House because they have been all over the map, said another official briefed on the discussion. The White House plans to provide those figures before the group meets again Sunday afternoon.\n\nAD\n\nSome centrist Republicans on Saturday urged Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government, reflecting growing unease in their ranks about the prolonged shutdown and the political cost the GOP might pay.\n\nAD\n\nWith Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it's going to have to be a compromise solution, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a moderate and former FBI agent who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, said in an interview. It's our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government, and we need to have these battles on immigration and other issues on their own turf, separately.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement Saturday that the House will begin passing separate bills to reopen the government in the coming week, starting with the funding bill that covers the Treasury Department so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.\n\nAD\n\nThe senseless uncertainty and chaos of the Trump Shutdown must end, now, Pelosi said.\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney said in an interview to air Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press that Trump would take a concrete wall off the table in negotiations with Democratic leaders if that would help end the shutdown.\n\nIf he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction, Mulvaney said.\n\nBut Trump is annoyed by news reports about the negotiations that make it seem that he is backing away from his demands and wants to avoid stories about new numbers for wall funding being discussed, Trump aides said. The president instead encouraged Pence and senior aides to focus on the $5.6 billion for border security that was the focal point of legislation passed last month by House Republicans, the aides said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump exasperated members of both parties with his comments Friday, but Trump spent that evening boasting to friends that he was in a strong negotiating position because he was able to capture attention and make a flurry of points that he feels his core voters appreciate, White House officials said.\n\nOn Saturday evening, Trump tweeted that he would travel to Camp David on Sunday for meetings on Border Security and many other topics with aides attending a White House staff retreat. He then followed up with a tweet of his Game of Thrones-style poster saying, The Wall is Coming.\n\nMulvaney is spearheading the Camp David gathering as a way of connecting with his new deputies and colleagues, according to officials.\n\nThe president is asking advisers about further ways to battle for wall funding in the coming days, whether it is meeting with family members of people killed by undocumented immigrants, huddling with sheriffs or visiting the border, the officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAs Saturday's meeting unfolded, Trump was eyeing his own options for trying to force the Democrats' hand, including declaring a national emergency to begin wall construction without congressional approval, a possible course he mentioned at his Friday news conference.\n\nAccording to two confidants of Trump's, who have spoken to him in recent days but were not authorized to speak publicly, Trump is looking at how such a move would play out and has told his aides that such a drastic turn could rattle the Democrats and compel them to offer him wall funding. The legality of such a move is unclear, however, and Trump would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges in the courts.\n\nStill, there are signs within the White House that more-comprehensive deals are at least being discussed, more likely for after the shutdown concludes and the government reopens.\n\nKushner, the president's son-in-law, continues to tell his allies that he thinks there could eventually be a deal for border wall funding in exchange for immigration protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, according to two people who were briefed on those discussions. Another person familiar with the discussions emphasized, however, that Kushner was not pushing for a deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, at this time.\n\nChatter about an agreement involving protections for young immigrant beneficiaries of the DACA program have risen a bit in recent days, although the administration has rejected previous wall-for-DACA deals and Democratic leadership is in no mood for one now.
All of which is to say that the Federal Reserve is in a fairly awkward spot right now. How is that? Well, all of the backward-looking economic data says that we're nowhere near a recession — not when we've added an average of 254,000 jobs a month in the past three months, compared with the 100,000 or so we'd need to keep the unemployment rate from going up — while most of the forward-looking financial indicators say that one might not be that far away. In other words, for every bit of good news about today, such as the continued growth in manufacturing employment, there's a bit of bad news about the outlook for tomorrow, such as the big drop in manufacturing production. Which is why the Fed is justified in thinking that it'll need to raise rates a few times this year to keep inflation in check at the same time that markets are, maybe not equally justified, but still on firm ground in thinking that it's more likely that the Fed will end up cutting them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo what should the Fed do then? Well, in this case, the easy answer is the correct one. It should wait. That's because we don't know how much of today's growth will go away tomorrow once the stimulative effect of Trump's tax cuts fades away. Or how much of the slowdown in the rest of the world will put a speed limit on our own economy. Or whether higher wages will continue to suck more people into the workforce, as they did last month, or are instead a sign that companies are starting to run out of workers.\n\nThe good news, then, is that — as Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome H. Powell took pains to emphasize on Friday —this is exactly what they intend to do. If things do indeed get bumpy over the next few months, the Fed is perfectly willing to put its rate-hiking plans on hold, and even stop its bond holdings from shrinking any further. Which are real possibilities. See, while it's easy to make fun of the stock market for, as the old saying goes, predicting nine out of the last five recessions, it's important to understand that part of the reason it has so many false positives is that it often prompts policymakers to act before things get worse. So both we and the Fed should take it seriously, especially when the much less erratic bond market is telling the same story. Indeed, the fact that long-term interest rates are very close to being lower than short-term interest rates is its way of saying that it thinks the Fed is going to have start cutting rates soon — which it would do only to fight a recession.\n\nAnd that brings us to the most important point of all: What makes a warning a warning is that it happens before things get bad. So yes, the economy is in very good shape right now, but so was it in 2006, the last time long-term rate fell below short-term ones. That didn't keep the economic storm clouds away 12 to 18 months later — that's usually how long it takes for a recession to hit after the yield curve inverts like that — and it won't this time either if we aren't careful.\n\nIt doesn't have to be that way, though. There's nothing inevitable about recessions. Australia hasn't had one since 1991, and we don't have to have one in 2020, as markets seem to think we will, if we make the right choices.
House Democrats have named lowering drug one of their priorities, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) promising last week to lower health costs and prescription drug prices. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the newly minted GOP chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has vowed to crack down on the shenanigans played by major drugmakers to limit lower-priced alternative medicines.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are signals the industry's influence is waning, after it recently failed in its bid to reverse steeper payments for drugs in Medicare's so-called doughnut hole, the coverage gap for seniors. And overlaying all of this are surprisingly aggressive efforts by the Trump administration to lower prescription drug costs in the Medicare program, some of which were outlined in its drug pricing blueprint.\n\nI'm very optimistic that the long overdue effort to rein in the price gouging from PhRMA is underway, Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) who is seen as a leader on the issue, told me on Friday.\n\nMembers are eyeing at least two bills with bipartisan support: The Creates Act, which would prevent branded drugmakers from guarding their medications so other companies can't develop alternatives; and legislation to prohibit pay-for-delay deals in which drugmakers pay producers of generic medicines to delay introduction of cheaper versions of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese measures attempt to introduce more competition among drugmakers by leveling the playing field — an approach some in theTrump administration (including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb) favor even as they remain suspicious of approaches that smack of government price-fixing. As for Democrats, they'd like the government to play a much more robust role in the prescription drug pricing business, but many feel they shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\nI think it would be a shame … to waste an opportunity if President Trump is willing to work on this issue — or have his people work on this issue — to actually get something done, said former congressman Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California who served as chairman and then ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nEnding pay-for-delay tactics is a priority for Grassley, who has teamed up with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) on their Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act. The legislation, which would prohibit the deals for generics, would inject a healthy dose of Midwestern, common-sense medicine into Big Pharma, Grassley said in a November floor speech.\n\nGrassley has also signed on to the Creates Act, whose House and Senate versions are supported by a broad range of lawmakers — so broad, in fact, that they included both Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who nearly beat Cruz in the November midterms. The measure would allow generic companies to sue branded companies for failing to provide them with samples needed to create generic versions of their products (we explained the Creates Act more in this Health 202).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf course, the partial government shutdown now in its third week is consuming all the oxygen in the room right now. But advocates say they're still betting lawmakers will come together on an issue that troubles 80 percent of Americans.\n\nI am way more optimistic than we've ever been before, said Ellen Albritton, a senior policy analyst at Families USA. I think a lot of things are aligning in a way that they haven't aligned before.\n\nThe industry isn't appearing to back down, either. More than three dozen drugmakers began the new year by hiking their product prices an average of 6.3 percent, the Wall Street Journal's Jared S. Hopkins has reported, although he noted many of the hikes were relatively modest amid pressure on the issue.\n\nAD\n\nTrump tweeted this over the weekend, following the report:\n\nThe Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing launched a new website yesterday to help convince lawmakers to take on high drug prices. Members of Congress ran and won on the promise to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable and lower drug prices. Our goal with this new website is to provide lawmakers with the information they need to turn their campaign promises into substantive action, said Lauren Blair, CSRxP communications director.\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration has several drug pricing efforts in the works, mostly centered on tweaking the way the government pays for drugs in the Medicare program. But it's been bold enough to have won some respect — if begrudging — from some of the most liberal Democrats in Congress, including Welch.\n\nAD\n\nThere are promising signs out of the Trump administration, Welch said. I think there is a significant potential Trump is going to step up on prescription drug pricing.\n\nYet politics remain in play. House Democrats certainly aren't ignoring the 2020 election, which could of course hand them the White House and open the door wider for pushing priorities Republicans don't favor.\n\nConsequently, there's talk in the caucus of passing legislation allowing the federal government to directly negotiate lower prices with drugmakers in the Medicare Part D program — a pie-in-the-sky dream for liberals that is strongly opposed by conservatives. It would be mostly a messaging tactic for Democrats, as it would almost certainly die in the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, Democrats point to the huge support among their own members for the idea. Several Democrats have offered bills requiring Medicare price negotiations, but the most popular — offered by Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) — has 104 co-sponsors. Welch said he holds out hope Trump would sign such a measure (assuming Democrats could somehow get it through the Senate), given the support he expressed on the campaign trail.\n\nA spokesman for House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) also pointed to Medicare price negotiations, as well as the more likely efforts to lift barriers to generic drugs. He is hopeful that Democrats can work with the president in a bipartisan way, spokesman C.J. Young said.\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nAHH: This year, there will be more female CEOs than men named Michael giving corporate presentations at the year's biggest biotech conference, Stat News reports. Last year, the website had noted there were more Michaels presenting than women at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.\n\nThe tables have turned: At next week's confab, there will be 33 female CEOs presenting corporate updates, compared to 19 men named Michael, Rebecca Robbins writes. And yet women will still be massively outnumbered on one of biotech's biggest stages: Men represent 90 percent of the 553 executives who will give corporate presentations at JPM. That's down from 94 percent last year.\n\nOOF: Insurers have pocketed more than $9 billion in taxpayer funds by overestimating their annual costs for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, the Wall Street Journal's Joseph Walker and Christopher Weaver report. Mysterious Medicare payment rules, and the resulting payment discrepancies, are examples of how the secrecy of the $3.5 trillion U.S. health-care system promotes and obscures higher spending, the pair write in this investigation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere's how the system works: Insurers like CVS Health Corp., UnitedHealth Group and Humana submit estimates of how much providing Medicare's prescription drug benefit will cost them, and Medicare in turn uses that estimate to make payments to the insurers.\n\nAfter the year ends, Medicare compares the plans' bids to the actual spending. If the insurer overestimated its costs, it pockets a chunk of the extra money it received from Medicare—sometimes all of it—and this can often translate into more profit for the insurer, in addition to the profit built into the approved bid, Joseph and Christopher write. If the extra money is greater than 5% of the insurer's original bid, it has to pay some of it back to Medicare....A detailed analysis of the confidential industry data obtained by the Journal shows that 69% of Part D members from 2009 to 2013 were in plans that overestimated costs by at least 5% over that time.\n\nOUCH: The Food and Drug Administration says e-cigarette start-up Juul and Altria, the country's largest cigarette maker, are going back on their pledges to combat youth vaping, an issue that's become a critical focus for commissioner Gottlieb.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGottlieb plans to write letters to the companies to criticize them for publicly pledging to remove nicotine flavor pods from store shelves, while secretly negotiating a financial partnership that seems to do the opposite, the New York Times's Sheila Kaplan reports. The commissioner also wants the companies leaders to come to the agency to explain their plans.\n\nDespite making promises to help address youth vaping, Sheila writes the FDA is worried the December agreement Altria made to purchase 35 percent of Juul will expand the reach of the very pod-based products it said it would stop selling until the youth vaping problem was addressed.\n\nTRUMP TEMPERATURE\n\nThe partial government shutdown is dragging into its third week, and while no progress seems to have been made in negotiations, Trump administration officials have begun taking new steps to contain the fallout, our Post colleagues Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin, Damian Paletta and Nick Miroff report. Meanwhile, various federal agencies and health programs have been impacted by the stalemate:\n\nAD\n\n— For 38 million low-income Americans, the shutdown could mean severe food stamp reductions if it stretches on. The SNAP program is rare among federal initiatives because it requires annual funding from Congress, even though its existence is automatically renewed, our Post colleagues Damian Paletta and Erica Werner report. Congress has not allocated funding for SNAP beyond January, and the program's emergency reserves would not cover even two-thirds of February's payments, according to past disbursements. A disruption of the program impacts not only the families who receive food stamps but the retailers where that money is spent, our colleagues add. An Agriculture Department spokesman said the administration is looking at options amid the halt.\n\n— For the FDA, the shutdown means the agency hasn't been able to accept some new applications for drugs or medical devices. Those applications that require user fee payments could not be accepted because it can't accept new FY2019 user fees without an appropriations bill for FY2019, Commissioner Gottlieb explained in series of tweets last week. But the agency can accept new regulatory submissions that don't require a fee. Stat's Ike Swetlitz and Erin Mershon also reported last month the shutdown would not stop the agency from recalling harmful food and drugs but would slow the process for drug approvals as well as some administrative actions.\n\n— In Indian Country, the shutdown has meant critical funding hasn't arrived to keep health clinics running. Generations ago, tribes negotiated treaties with the United States government guaranteeing funds for services like health care and education in exchange for huge swaths of territory, the New York Times's Mitch Smith and Julie Turkewitz write. But that means a government shutdown can largely sideline a tribe's basic functions.\n\n— Not all agencies have halted work. While many federal scientists across the country have been affected by stalled funding and the inability to continue research, the New York Times's Alan Blinder points out the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health were entirely or mostly funded through other legislation.\n\nHEALTH ON THE HILL\n\n—One day after retaking the majority in the House, Democratic lawmakers took an initial step toward intervening in a case in which U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional.\n\nAs part of a rules package for the new Congress, the party voted to granted itself the authority to intervene in the lawsuit, and scheduled a vote for this week designed to force GOP lawmakers into a political corner: agree to defend a law many members have spent years reviling or appear to oppose popular ACA protections for millions of Americans with preexisting medical conditions that many have pledged to uphold, our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports.\n\nThe move came hours after California Attorney General Xavier Becerra led a coalition of 17 Democratic state AGs in filing an appeal to challenge the district court's ruling.\n\nIt's a move that could bring the health-care law all the way to the Supreme Court for a third time, Amy writes.\n\nThis shouldn't be a debate; the ACA has been the law for nearly a decade and is the backbone of our health-care system, Becerra said during a call with reporters last week. This case impacts nearly every American — workers covered by employers, families, women, children, young adults, and seniors — so we will lead the ACA's defense as long and far as it takes.\n\nColorado Attorney General-elect Phil Weiser called the decision mind boggling and said it goes against the role of government to protect people. I just can't begin to express the magnitude of what a threat that is to the rule of law.\n\n— For the first time, House Democrats are planning to hold hearings on Medicare for all, a step that comes as Pelosi has backed the process, as our Post colleague Dave Weigel reports.\n\nWorking toward a version of universal health care has been a Democratic goal for decades. But it seemed to pick up some momentum after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pushed for Medicare for all during his presidential campaign in 2016. The next year, House Democrats cosponsored H.R. 676, a Medicare for all bill.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the House sponsor of the legislation, called it a huge step forward to have Pelosi's support. We have to push on the inside while continuing to build support for this on the outside.\n\nWith Democrats locked out of power in the Senate and the White House, Jayapal said supporters of universal health care were proceeding 'one step at a time' and that getting the first real hearings on the bill — for years, it has been aspirational, and not even subject to a Congressional Budget Office score — would force a larger discussion, Dave writes.\n\n— House lawmakers are planning to introduce a bipartisan gun-control measure on Tuesday, an effort led by Pelosi, Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chairman Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), and Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.).\n\nThe proposal will call for universal background checks for firearm purchases and transfers, our colleague Karoun Demirjian reports.\n\nHouse Democrats promised to tackle the issue of gun control with their new majority. The new Democrat-controlled House will almost certainly be able to muster the votes to pass a gun-control measure that expands background checks, Karoun writes. The measure may even pull along some Republican support. … But it remains unclear whether such legislation could clear procedural hurdles in the Senate, which remains under Republican control. The closest that the Senate has come to passing gun-control legislation expanding background checks was in 2013, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, when 56 senators rallied behind a measure — four votes shy of what they needed to clear procedural hurdles.\n\nAGENCY ALERT\n\n— Politico's Dan Diamond spoke with Chris Meekins, who left HHS last week after helping oversee migrant family reunifications. Meekins called the family separation policy headed by the Department of Homeland Security an ill-fated policy that was devised by Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller. I think that it's unconscionable to do it in this way, Meekins said. Listen to the podcast here.\n\n— In the final snapshot released by CMS, the agency revealed enrollment on the federal health care exchange this season fell nearly 4 percent overall from last year's sign-up period. A total of 8.4 million people signed up or were automatically enrolled in health plans for 2019 on Healthcare.gov, compared with 8.7 million who were signed up during last year's open enrollment.\n\nThe final numbers don't include sign-up rates for states that have their own insurance exchange and many of those states have sign-up periods that extend into mid-January. CMS said it would release additional data, including information from those state-based exchanges, in March.\n\n— Mary Mayhew, the Trump administration's Medicaid director, resigned from her post last week after less than three months on the job. Mayhew, who was tapped in October to be the director of the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, will now run Florida's health-care agency, the Miami Herald's Elizabeth Koh reports. Before her stint in the Trump administration, Mayhew served for seven years as the health and human services commissioner under Maine's former Republican governor Paul LePage.\n\nMayhew, long a critic of expansion under the ACA, was praised by CMS administrator Seema Verma in a Friday statement. I am excited for Mary as she transitions to serve Governor-elect DeSantis and the people of Florida, Verma said. I appreciate her efforts at CMS and I look forward to continuing to work with her as she uses her many talents to help the state of Florida create a healthcare system that serves the needs of its citizens.\n\n— James Carroll was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy after leading the office in an acting capacity since February. The White House had gone without a permanent drug czar since nearly the beginning of the Trump administration.\n\n— ICYMI: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services finalized in late December its overhaul of Medicare's so-called Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) program — and the agency followed through on stricter rules that could expose these health savings cooperatives to losses sooner. The Health 202 detailed the proposed new rules here.\n\n— Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie, who has been the subject of multiple reports about his previous affiliation with Confederate groups, failed to disclose that affiliation to the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee during his confirmation process, CNN's Andrew Kaczynski reports.\n\nOur Post colleagues Lisa Rein and Paul Sonne have reported Wilkie built his career working alongside polarizing figures and was once a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a group that defends Confederate symbols. CNN's Andrew, Nathan McDermott and Chris Massie also reported Wilkie has given a speech to the group. Wilkie was required to disclose in a sworn statement submitted to the Senate committee his public statements, published materials and memberships he held in organizations over the past decade, Andrew writes. Wilkie, however, did not disclose any of his ties to Confederate groups.\n\nSTATE SCAN\n\n— In Maine, new Gov. Janet Mills issued an executive order to move forward with expanding Medicaid in the state, fulfilling a campaign promise to make doing so her first priority, the Associated Press's Marina Villenueve reports.\n\nThe Democrat called for expedited approval of benefits to 70,000 additional low-income residents in the state and called for the state's health agency to work with lawmakers to find a way to fund the expanded program. The plan still needs to be approved by federal regulators.\n\n— In California, the soon-to-be-sworn-in Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom is expected to introduce an ambitious leave policy that would give families six months of paid leave after a child is born, which would be the longest in the country.\n\nNewsom is set to propose the policy and include it in his budget after his swearing in on Monday, the New York Times's Claire Cain Miller and Jim Tankersley report. But what's missing in the Democrat's policy is a plan to fund it. It's the same challenge that has stymied the policy at the federal level, Claire and Jim write. Around 80 percent of Americans consistently say they support paid parental leave, and some Republican lawmakers have joined Democrats in embracing the idea. Yet federal lawmakers have declined to pass tax increases or corporate mandates to make it a reality.\n\nNewsom's plan comes as other state's are looking to move forward with state-based plans instead of waiting for the federal government. Massachusetts, Washington and New Jersey have new or recently expanded policies on the books, and Jim and Claire report Oregon, Colorado and Connecticut are poised to follow. Still, Newsom's proposal for California would be the most generous.\n\n— And here are a few more good reads from The Post and beyond:\n\nMEDICAL MISSIVES\n\nINDUSTRY RX\n\nREPRODUCTIVE WARS\n\nDAYBOOK\n\nToday\n\nThe 37th annual J.P.

House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford), left, confers with Del. S. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk) during the 2017 session of the Virginia House of Delegates. (Bob Brown/AP)\n\nSpeaker William J. Howell, a pragmatic Republican who has presided over Virginia's fractious House of Delegates for 15 sessions and spent the last four as a thorn in Gov. Terry McAuliffe's side, will not seek reelection in November.\n\nHowell, 73, announced his decision Monday in emotional remarks in the ornate House chamber, with his wife of 50 years, Cessie, and other family members looking on.\n\nI have really enjoyed serving in this esteemed body, Howell said. It has truly been the greatest professional honor of my life.\n\nEven before it was officially announced, Howell's plan to retire at the end of his term in January set off a competition between two delegates to replace him at the helm of the overwhelmingly GOP-majority chamber.\n\nHouse Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox (Colonial Heights) and Del. Terry G. Kilgore (Scott) worked quietly over the past week to line up support for their rival bids to replace Howell (Stafford), according to two Republicans familiar with their efforts. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal caucus matters.\n\nKilgore has since withdrawn. I just didn't think it was the right time for me, he said. Cox declined to comment, saying that this is the speaker's day.\n\nThe House GOP caucus is expected to name Cox its speaker-designee in a close-door meeting Wednesday.\n\nHouse members on both sides of the aisle praised Howell on the floor not only for his political leadership but also for a quick wit that could defuse tense situations and for a sense of personal friendship.\n\nI think after I called my parents, you're the first person I called after I adopted my kid, that's how much I think of you, said Del. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax), his voice breaking. You are proof, Mr. Speaker, that nice guys can finish first.\n\nHouse Minority Leader David Toscano (D-Charlottesville) praised Howell for standing up to his own party on an off-year redistricting scheme in 2013. Senate Republicans had tacked an entirely redrawn state Senate map onto a bill calling for minor technical adjustments to House districts. Howell ruled it out of order, a move that infuriated some Republicans.\n\n[From the archives: Spike of Virginia redistricting plans shows House speaker's pragmatic streak]\n\nYou are truly a historic figure in this chamber and in this Capitol, said Toscano, adding that the speaker is akin to a judge. The good judges are the ones who let you try your case. . . . You let us try our cases, and we thank you for that.\n\nHowell's relationship with McAuliffe (D) has been strained, despite their shared history as dealmakers and McAuliffe's efforts to woo the speaker over craft beer in the Executive Mansion.\n\nHowell has used his position — among the most powerful in state government — to help thwart many of the governor's biggest goals, including the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the appointment of a state Supreme Court justice and the blanket restoration of voting rights to more than 200,000 felons.\n\nWith a lawsuit filed last year to block the restoration of felons' voting rights, Howell became the first speaker in the history of the commonwealth to successfully challenge a governor's executive order in court.\n\n[Va. high court invalidates McAuliffe's order restoring felon voting rights]\n\nOn behalf of the people of Virginia, I want to thank Speaker Bill Howell for his outstanding service to Virginia, McAuliffe said in a statement. I have tremendous respect for the Speaker and the professional and dignified way he led the House throughout his tenure. I wish him the very best in his retirement.\n\nHowell is Virginia's second-longest-serving speaker, behind Democrat Edgar Blackburn Moore, who held the post from 1950 to 1968.\n\nDeemed the accidental speaker because he assumed the role in January 2003 after S. Vance Wilkins resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal, Howell instituted a number of reforms, including bringing some strictness and objectivity to rules governing what can be ruled in and out of order.\n\nA member of the House since 1988, Howell was one of four delegates to start a prayer group that still meets at 7 a.m. every Wednesday during the session. He has been a conservative on social issues such as abortion.\n\nBut he also sought to keep a lid on some hot-button bills after they consumed the 2012 legislative session. Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William), one of the chamber's most vocal conservatives, often complained that Howell had some of his bills quietly killed off in committees to avoid controversy. An example of that this year was Marshall's ill-fated measure to require transgender people to use the public bathroom that corresponds with the sex on their birth certificates.\n\n[Va. lawmaker presses fellow Republicans on transgender 'bathroom bill']\n\nHowell has primarily focused on promoting business-friendly policies. And he has been willing to cut deals to get things done — sometimes to the chagrin of more ideologically driven Republicans.\n\nAmong those deals were some involving McAuliffe's predecessors. Howell spoke out against Democrat Mark R. Warner's $1.6 billion tax hike but quietly instructed a few Republicans to skip a committee vote so that the bill would go the House floor. Despite his distaste for Democrat Tim Kaine's smoking ban, he struck a deal there as well. He signed on to the transportation plan of Republican Robert F. McDonnell, even after the legislation was amended into the largest tax hike in Virginia history.\n\nIt's really Bill Howell's greatest legacy, said Del. Mark Sickles (D-Fairfax), referring to the transportation funding measure. We'd still have smoking in restaurants for that matter.\n\nA wills and trusts lawyer who practices in a log cabin on the Rappahannock River, Howell assumed the speakership at a time when his party enjoyed a slim majority in the 100-seat chamber. Their numbers swelled as high as 68 during his tenure, which also saw the adoption of a 2011 redistricting map favorable to Republicans. Two lawsuits — one before the U.S. Supreme Court, the other before a state circuit court — challenged the constitutionality of the maps.\n\nPresiding over that growing majority became tricky with the rise of more conservative, tea-party-affiliated members, who looked askance at Howell's pragmatic streak.\n\nIn 2014, some conservative Republicans said they feared that Howell was secretly on board with McAuliffe's plan to expand Medicaid as they pushed for a budget amendment that they thought was needed to tie the governor's hands. The speaker had called the amendment unnecessary but eventually got on board. McAuliffe later acknowledged that the amendment blocked a loophole that he had intended to use to expand Medicaid unilaterally.
The report lays out objections to the Republican plan, including an argument that cutting trillions in taxes for rich Americans, as Republicans have proposed, would increase inequality in the United States. (A separate analysis last year, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, found that 99.6 percent of the savings under Ryan's plan would accrue to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe authors of the Oxfam report also dispute the claim of GOP proponents that their approach would limit multinational corporations' ability to conceal their profits from federal tax authorities. Yet the report's discussion of the plan's international repercussions points to a major issue that has often been ignored in the political debate over the GOP plan, which has mostly concentrated on how the proposal would affect Americans.\n\nSome experts say the plan would penalize foreign economies that sell products to the United States. Under the GOP plan for a border adjustment, U.S. firms would no longer be allowed to exempt the cost of their imports from taxation. On paper, this provision amounts to a new tax on imports, which would negatively affect workers around the world whose livelihoods depend on U.S. consumption.\n\nOn the other hand, many economists argue the plan would increase the price of the dollar in global exchange markets, in which case goods produced in foreign countries and sold in foreign currencies would become cheaper, making up for the tax.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf so, however, the border adjustment would put the squeeze on poor countries where corporations and governments have borrowed money in dollars rather than unreliable local currency. Those borrowers have to make payments on their loans in dollars, and those payments would be harder to make if dollars become more expensive in terms of their own currencies.\n\nGiven that a lot of developing countries hold debt denominated in the U.S. dollar, that would essentially increase their debt burden, said Robbie Silverman, a senior adviser at Oxfam. To make good on their debts, he added, foreign governments would have to spend more buying up dollars, leaving less money infrastructure, public health, education and other investments that can help poor countries prosper.\n\nForeign households, governments and businesses — excluding banks — owe a total of $10.5 trillion in loans denominated in dollars, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Of that total, emerging-market economies owe about $3.6 trillion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose figures dwarf the totals for other major global currencies. Debt denominated in euros totals just $2.8 trillion outside the euro area, and loans in yen amount to just $440 billion outside of Japan.\n\nA few countries are especially vulnerable. Among large developing countries, Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia all have outstanding debts in dollars equivalent to roughly a quarter of their gross domestic product, according to a report from Fitch, the ratings agency. Mexico and Russia are also at risk, with dollar-denominated debts worth about one sixth of GDP.\n\nThe pinch might be the sharpest in smaller countries where people rely on dollars for day-to-day banking and saving. For instance, Jamaica's government has issued debts in U.S. dollars worth nearly two-thirds of the island's GDP.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Azerbaijan, about 80 percent of deposits are in dollars, according to Fitch. If the dollar becomes more expensive, it could be more difficult for Azerbaijani banks to pay out those deposits.\n\nSome economists are skeptical that the dollar would become substantially more expensive under a border adjustment. Yet as William Cline of the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington noted, if the dollar does not increase, then foreign companies would be stuck paying the new tax on their sales to U.S. customers.
