{"original": "In a recent post, leading federalism scholar Rick Hills argues that foot voting in a federal system can't work effectively without major help from ballot box voting.

{"original": "Unless there is a feedback mechanism inducing local officials to care about attracting migrants, we argue that interjurisdictional migration will be nothing more than a trip from the frying pan to fire. Foot-voters would either over-crowd the good jurisdictions or not bother moving at all, because they would have no guarantee that well-governed destinations would stay well-governed. This does not mean that foot-voting is pointless: It just means that migration should be regarded as a complement to ballot-voting, not a substitute. Ilya's argument for foot-voting, in other words, becomes much more powerful if one recognizes that foot-voting actually improves local ballot-voters' incentives to cast an intelligent vote. One such incentive is the prospect of foot-voters' buying their houses. Our criticism is offered, therefore, more as a friendly amendment than a refutation to Ilya's outstanding book.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I greatly appreciate Rick's praise of my book, and I certainly agree that we cannot dispense with ballot box voting entirely. Well-informed ballot box voting can make a federal system function much better than it would otherwise.

But effective foot voting is not as dependent on ballot box voting as Rick suggests.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I. The Danger of Killing the Goose that Attracted the Golden Egg.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It is indeed true that foot voting does not provide guarantees against the reversal of the policies that attracted the foot voters in the first place. What a state or local government gives today it could potentially take away tomorrow. Government officials with poor incentives might end up killing the goose that attracted the golden egg of foot-voting migrants in the first place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the risk is not as great as Rick suggests. Even if the governments in question are just selecting policies at random and do not care about their effect on foot voters, there is still a great deal of inertia in government, especially when it comes to changing long-established policy. Interest groups, bureaucracies, and others who have become habituated to the status quo will not easily accept change. If a policy has been in place for a long time, that is some evidence that it is unlikely to be radically altered in the short to medium term future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Moreover, at least in a system where subnational governmments must raise a large proportion of their own funding, they do in fact have strong incentives to adopt policies that attract foot voting taxpayers and businesses. Otherwise, they risk losing valuable tax revenue that can be spent on projects they value, or on efforts to help keep them in power. Additional tax revenue is valuable to officials even if voters remain poorly informed and do not directly reward them for it. If nothing else, it can be useful in enriching the officials themselves and their political allies. Thus, competition can incentivize local and regional governments to cater to the needs of foot voters, even in the absence of electoral pressure to do so.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As Rick indicates, crowding might at some point limit the ability of foot voters to enter attractive jurisdictions. However, such effects need not be a major problem in a system where there are hundreds or even thousands of jurisdictions competing with each other. While some may become crowded, others will not. Moreover, crowding is not a fixed fact of nature, but often the effect of policy. It can be mitigated by changing such policies as excessively restrictive zoning, which artificially limits the amount of housing available to potential migrants.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The danger of artificially inflating land prices through zoning makes me skeptical of Rick's and Qiao Shitong's proposal to incentivize good policy by rewarding local officials for increasing the relative value of the land within their jurisdiction. As Rick himself has emphasized in other work, high prices often reflect exclusionary zoning rather than good policies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Like some other scholars, Rick worries that foot voting may become pointless if the benefits of good government become capitalized into the value of land: housing in well-governed jurisdictions becomes more expensive to the point that there is no benefit to moving there from poorly governed ones. In my book Democracy and Political Ignorance, I explain why this concern is overstated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Capitalization does not happen nearly as quickly as critics fear. If it did, we would not have had a long history of migration from poorly governed areas to relatively better ones. If capitalization were all that it is sometimes cracked up to be, we would never have had the recent migration of northerners to the Sun Belt or the Great Migration of African-Americans out of the Jim Crow South. The relative advantages of these destination areas should have immediately been reflected in higher prices that would deter migrants in the first place. In addition, as noted above, capitalization effects can be diminished by adopting policies that make housing more available and thereby reduce the costs of migration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Finally, in a world where instantaneous capitalization does occur, we might indeed see little or no migration driven by foot voting. But the mere possibility of it is still likely to incentivize local governments to adopt better policies As I put it in my book:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If local governments get a substantial proportion of their revenue from property taxes—as most in the United States do—they would have incentives to adopt policies that increase the value of land within their jurisdiction so that they could generate more revenue without raising tax rates. In such a scenario, the possibility of in-migration would serve to bid up prices, even if (by assumption) the changes in price occur so quickly that migrants are deterred from ever actually coming. Indeed, the faster the increases in price happen, the faster local governments will be able to reap the benefits of better policies in the form of higher property tax revenue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I certainly do not contend that foot voting can solve all our problems, or that ballot box voting has no useful role. To the contrary, I have argued that foot voting cannot effectively address such issues as overexploitation of immobile assets by subnational governments, most notably property rights in land. For that reason, a system of decentralized foot voting needs to be supplemented with constitutional protections for property rights, for other immobile assets, and for people with unusually high moving costs. Also, I recognize that there are some problems so large that they cannot realistically be dealt with at the regional or local level, and therefore must be addressed by national or even international ballot box voting.", "augmented": []}

Only matters that are reasonably related to taxing and spending are supposed to make it into such bills. Among Biden's agenda items, those could arguably include raising some tax rates, lowering the eligibility for Medicare and expanding Obamacare. Reconciliation could also empower Democrats --provided they stay completely united -- to enact additional stimulus relief opposed by Republicans as well as portions of Biden's climate and immigration priorities. The Congressional Review Act also will enable Democrats to pass measures canceling regulations issued recently by the Trump administration with simple majorities.

{"original": "It may not matter what the value of the home was before you moved in or what the value of the home is now. The real issue for us is whether your sibling expects to receive cash or property from your mom's estate once she dies and the assets are distributed. If your sibling has no expectations and you and your sibling get along quite well, whatever you do (stay in the home or sell it and some split the proceeds) may not matter.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "From a federal income tax perspective, if your parents' estate consists of only the home and some accounts with small amounts, your parents wouldn't have an estate tax issue to deal with. Current federal estate tax rules allow individuals to pass up to $5,450,000 to their heirs without paying estate taxes, and we're assuming you fall below that level.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Your parents seem to have owned the home as their primary residence. If they were both living when they sold it, they wouldn't pay any federal income tax on the sale, since they would be allowed to exclude up to $500,000 in gains (profits) from the sale of the home. (The home sale exclusion allows an individual who uses his or her home as a primary residence for two of the past five years to exclude from federal income tax up to $250,000 in gains, and married couples can exclude up to $500,000 in gains, provided they meet all of the other rules.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Here's how this might have played out: Your parents likely purchased the home years ago. If we assume they purchased it for $75,000 several decades ago and you put on a $100,000 addition, there would be almost no profit to be had from the sale of the home today. (The $100,000 plus the $75,000 along with closing costs would leave little, if any, profit.) If your mom puts you on the title to the home today, she would essentially give you half of the home's value. That shouldn't have any tax implications for you, since you put in $100,000 or about half of the home's value, but you would want to discuss it with your tax preparer or accountant to be sure.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Generally, giving a home is a bit more convoluted than inheriting a home. Inheriting it is usually a better alternative, as there is usually a financial benefit to inheriting a home over being gifted a home (or portion thereof).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One benefit to co-owning the home with your mom, in your specific situation, is that at the time of her death, if you own the home as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, you would automatically become the owner of the home. You wouldn't need to go to probate court and have title of the home transferred to your name. Having said this, it would be good to know that your sibling is on board with all that you are doing and doesn't feel left out or that you have taken advantage of either him or her or your mom.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We generally recommend that parents put their home in a living trust or make sure their will covers how they want their assets to be handled after they die. But in some situations, it could be easier for the family to simply put the home in another family member's name and leave it at that — even if that causes a tax issue down the line.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This may be your situation, but you'll have to see what your parents' total estate holdings are, determine any real estate tax problems a sale may create (including possibly increasing property taxes) and make sure that you maintain harmony in the family. Because if you do this without consulting your sibling, who feels as if you left him or her out of the planning or the ultimate financial bequest, you'll have even bigger issues to deal with.", "augmented": []}

Analysis of the House-passed bill that would provide the $2,000 checks shows that nearly one-third of the aid would go to taxpayers making more than $100,000 a year, and nearly 9 percent would go to people making between $200,000 and $500,000.

I sort of just let them do what they do. I will say that having been in the business for, I guess, this is my eighth or ninth year doing this, I feel like you can kind of — you can kind of see it coming.

And that's in part because of something that I'm not all that comfortable with but I've talked about publicly before, which is that we made an editorial decision and it's subject to change every day, but we're sort of working on a baseline assumption with this administration that you can't take what they say to the bank. That you can't even take what they say about themselves and their own behavior as a factual indication of what they're doing. So that makes it really hard to reach out to the White House for a comment, let alone for guests. I mean, I enjoyed my interviews that I did with Kellyanne Conway, but I found that when we went back to them, they didn't stand up factually. And she wasn't saying stuff that was a reliable indicator of something, anything that was going on with the administration or even necessarily her boss's views.

That top White House surrogates were saying stuff on TV and under direct questioning that proved out not to be true. That everything from their ethics agreements to their explanations of what was going to happen next in terms of particular executive orders and legislation just wasn't factual. And it was a shock to learn that about this new administration. And now we know. And I feel like a lot of the things that have — a lot of what it takes to sort of live responsibly in the era of this administration, is to come up with what you do after the initial shock. So much of the coverage about a president and his financial ties, for example, was about what a terrible thing and what a consequential thing it would be if a president hypothetically ever decided not to release his tax returns.

{"original": "ERIK WEMPLE BLOG: Last month you commented on air that big breaking news stories happened on Friday nights. Why is it always Friday night? The Trump administration, I think, has overturned the journalistic rhythm of work and the understanding what sort of commitments that this job requires. It previously required, I think, a very substantial commitment. Now it requires a humongous commitment. Has Trump upended your own life? Is this straining you?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "MADDOW: I totally think you're right that the unpredictable rhythm of the news cycle since the election is — I mean it's a real thing. We sort of joked about it at the start of the new administration … at our news meetings, we joke about the fact that, like, when you have a normal government, they do normal government things and they happen at normal government times. But with these guys, you never know what's going to happen. I've since sort of figured out that I think that's happening for two reasons. One is that the Trump administration is weird. They have an unusual approach to what they're doing. They've got unusual staffing. They've got unqualified family members doing really high-end jobs. Like there's weird stuff. So that makes for an unpredictable rhythm of itself.", "augmented": []}

A good administration that's, you know, popular and in peacetime and has a good agenda and a good message will be able to shape the news cycle the way they want to. Carefully. And by deliberate means. And these guys don't. They can't. Certainly they can make news. And they can do stuff that gets coverage, but it's the Fourth Estate that is driving most of the important news about the Trump administration. News about them has been much more important than news by them, in part because so many of their policy initiatives have been a bust. Or they haven't even tried. And so when you're the subject of the news cycle, rather than the author of the news cycle, that means you don't get to control when it happens. And I think that partly explains why the rhythm is a little weird, too. So it's been exciting. It's nice to get out of predictable — out of any sort of predictable rhythm. I won't say that it hasn't been disruptive.

I mean if you're vetting somebody to be national security adviser, maybe one of the things you do is Google them. Just to see what their news mentions were that week. I mean, it strains credulity to the point of breaking that they had no idea. And that Mike Pence running the transition had no idea.

Or as the president said in his address to Congress, they will repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better health care.

The popularity of the ACA has been rising, and members of Congress are being overwhelmed with calls, letters, emails and attendees at their town halls demanding that they not yank coverage and security away from tens of millions of Americans.

They could say, This may not be popular, at least in the short run, but we think it's the right thing to do, so we're going to do it anyway. There are some obstacles (particularly the filibuster in the Senate), but they have control of the entire government, and they could make it happen if they were determined enough.", "augmented": []}

Dean Heller (R-Nev.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) also have concerns about repealing the Medicaid expansion. Three of them voting no would be enough to sink a bill in the Senate. But conservative senators, who demand that the Medicaid expansion be repealed, also have enough votes to sink a bill. Sens.

{"original": "Other experts disagree. Leonard Kiefer, deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac, notes that today's level of cash extractions is nowhere near what it was for much of the past decade.

Freddie Mac won't purchase cash-out mortgages with less than 20 percent equity stakes. In its low-down-payment loan programs, cash-out refis are banned.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "But one segment of the market didn't fare as well. Nonqualified mortgage lending came to a standstill in March. Non-QM loans, as they are known, are a small but significant segment of the mortgage market. These tend to be high-value home loans that are not backed by the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In 2014, in response to the housing crisis, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau put in place the qualified mortgage or QM rule. Basically, if a loan met certain standards, it would receive the government backing of FHA, Fannie or Freddie. If it did not, it would be considered a non-QM loan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Even though non-QM loans are considered riskier than QM loans, they should not be confused with the subprime loans that were at the center of the housing crisis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "After cratering in March, underwriting of non-QM loans has picked up. To learn more about what happened to the non-QM market this year and where it is headed in 2021, I spoke with Tom Hutchens, an executive vice president production at Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions in Atlanta. He is a non-QM lender who has experienced firsthand the substantial growth of this market. Our conversation has been lightly edited.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: What happened to the non-QM market when the pandemic first hit?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: There were two factors. The first was investors that invest in the non-QM market do that through the bond market, through securitizations. In March 2020, there was a worldwide flight to cash, regardless of non-QM, commercial, whatever bond bondholders owned, they were cashing them all in. I think people forget; we didn't know if we could get food, we didn't know if we could get toilet paper again. It was just crazy times. The bond market froze, and the bond market is what the non-QM market is built around.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That was the primary reason. The secondary reason is that with non-QM loans the performance is not guaranteed by the government, which is what makes them non-QM. We, meaning really the entire market, we were not able to really determine somebody's ability to repay because government was shutting businesses down, shutting industries down. We don't have a government guarantee. So if we give a loan to a borrower on Monday and the government shuts their business down on Tuesday, that's not good for us. There were so many question marks around so many things that the industry had to put a pause on it, let the dust settle and then let's reevaluate. And really we were back offering non-QM loans 30, 40 days later [at the end of April, first of May].", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: You came back in less than two months. But did everything come back?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: I would say we're 90 percent back. There are still some products that we need to wait and see where the economy goes, where the coronavirus goes and all that, but yeah we're pretty close to where we were pre-covid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: I suppose before we go any further we should explain what a non-QM loan is and who is a typical non-QM borrower.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: Non-QM is really nonagency — FHA, Fannie, Freddie. If you don't fit into one of those boxes, then the loans become a non-QM and funded by private investors. Certainly the self-employed borrower is the No. 1 non-QM borrower. They do not have credit issues but Fannie and Freddie, the agencies, they have one way of looking at income and that's it. And if you own a business, your tax returns in many cases don't reflect your ability to pay a mortgage. That's what we're looking at. Are they going to pay us back? We are able [to make these loans] because we are privately funded through private capital. We're able to look at different ways of determining someone's ability to repay.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's the biggest market but it's other [borrowers]. Maybe it's some people who have had some credit blemishes. You also have to remember that agencies use computers to approve or not approve a loan. They can't work in an area of gray. It's black or white.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: Jumbo loans are non-QM loans too, right? (Jumbo loans are mortgages above the limits set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In 2021, the limit is $548,250 for most markets and $822,375 in high-cost markets.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: Our average loan amount post-covid is over $500,000. Anyone who is above the agency loan limits is not going to qualify for an agency loan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: Many readers may equate non-QM loans with the risky loans of the housing crisis. How are they different?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: There are some really key difference-maker issues now. First and foremost, every single loan that was given in 2006 in the nonagency world was 100 percent financing so there was no money down. Today, our average down payment on every non-QM loan is over 20 percent. There's a lot of other things, but that's the biggest one. When someone comes to the closing table and writes a big check of their hard-earned money, they're going to work really hard to pay their mortgage and not lose their home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There's also things like technology. We can confirm and verify things now that we couldn't in 2006. We can find out a lot more about a borrower now that we maybe weren't able to tell before. The mortgage business has a lot of technologies, fraud guards and things like that that just weren't available.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: Nevertheless, we're in the middle of a pandemic right now. Are you concerned about your loans? Like you said, you have no government backing on these loans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: I think there's always got to be a little bit of concern, just about our entire economy and in the virus. Right now, I'd say the loans that were originated today, we're looking at people and how they performed during the pandemic. So think about that. And let's just say that, a majority of our loans are self-employed borrowers. We get to see their income stream during a pandemic. That was one of the things we always heard: Well, non-QM has never been stress tested. Well guess what? That's no longer the case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: Many lenders are at capacity because of low rates. A refinance is much easier to process than a tricky non-QM loan. Are lenders doing non-QM loans or are they too much work right now?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: Our industry has learned over the years that building your business on a refi market is shallow. It's going to crumble at some point. The good originators never take their eye off the purchase market and non-QM is a purchase market product. I would say you're not going to get [non-QM loans] from the biggest of big lenders. But the mortgage brokers and the independent mortgage bankers, they participate in non-QM every single day. So I think the only thing that you would be ruled out of is maybe the online lenders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: But will a non-QM borrower have to wait longer to get their loan? For example, if someone is borrowing $400,000 to buy a house and another person is borrowing $600,000 for a house, the borrower asking for the lower amount will get it quicker, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: Actually, the opposite is true. Because the agency lenders are so backed up with the refinances, they are struggling to get purchase transactions done on time. Our average turn-time for non-QM loans from start to finish is under 25 business days.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: Where is the non-QM market headed in 2021?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: We've always considered the non-QM market to be about 10 percent of the overall origination business. Now 2020 was a little odd because of the influx of refinances but in a normalized market that's where we're working toward. We're not near that. We have so much growth opportunity. Certainly, you can't underestimate the overarching economic factors and the pandemic factors. But in general, we feel like we're back on track and the industry is back on track to make non-QM that 10 percent of the market that it will be at some point. We expect 2021 to be a huge year in the non-QM space.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "John Quiggin and I have a forthcoming article in International Studies Quarterly that tackles this question, asking why politicians were influenced by a key group of economists early in the Great Recession but not in the later part. Our argument is that the key factors didn't have much to do with the quality of the advice. Instead, what was crucial was the perceived degree of unanimity among economists. When the profession of economics appears to be speaking with one voice, politicians are more likely to listen, sometimes even when they don't want to. When the profession appears to be split, politicians are much better able to pick and choose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Unfortunately for economists, this offers incentives to politicians who don't much like what economists are saying to elevate and promote dissident economists to create the appearance of intellectual division.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The recent argument began with a disagreement between Unlearning Economics, a blog that is critical of mainstream economics, and Simon Wren-Lewis, a left-leaning macroeconomist, over whether mainstream economics was partly responsible for the turn toward economic austerity during the Great Recession. Unlearning Economics said that it was. Wren-Lewis then retorted that the actual villains were politicians, with help from City economists [i.e., economists working for private firms in the city of London], [who] started scare mongering about the deficit. This led Brad DeLong, a Berkeley economist who was prominent in debate during the recession to argue that it wasn't just politicians and the private sector, but also prominent academic economists who had made the case for austerity. In DeLong's description: The fact is that the 'mainstream economists, and most mainstream economists' who were heard in the public sphere were not against austerity, but rather split, with, if anything, louder and larger voices on the pro-austerity side.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Wren-Lewis responded to DeLong by saying that the real problem was that politicians and a good part of the media choose the economists they publicise, suggesting that politicians had cherry-picked a small faction of economists and exaggerated their influence.

{"original": "And this is what they were fighting about", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There are three questions underlying this dispute.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "First: Should economists be able to reach a consensus over questions like austerity?

{"original": "Second: When, if ever, is economics going to be politically influential enough to shape policy outcomes? Here, Drum gives the most succinct answer, arguing that economists' arguments are window dressing that politicians use to prettify the choices they would have made anyway. Both DeLong and Wren-Lewis, in different ways, would like to see a particular school of economics have more influence, while Smith calls for economists to be more humble in public.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Third: Were academic economists partly to blame for austerity politics after the Great Recession? Here, both Drum and Wren-Lewis suggest they were not — Drum because their opinions don't matter, and Wren-Lewis because outsiders warped the debate. DeLong and Smith both think that inevitable fissures and disagreements within the profession were partly to blame.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This is what happened during the Great Recession", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In our article, Quiggin and I suggest that these three questions are linked in different ways than most economists and outside observers think. Rather than looking at absolutes (economists do or do not have political influence, economists do or do not have fundamental disagreements, debates about economic ideas are driven by economists themselves or by politicians and their lackeys), we try to look at variation. If we want to know when economists have influence over policy debates, we might start by looking at whether economists have more influence when they apparently agree among themselves than when they apparently disagree. We might also look at the extent to which politicians are or are not able to influence economic debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "From this perspective, it turns out that the Great Recession had two major phases. In the first phase, economists — including previous skeptics such as Martin Feldstein — advocated more spending to boost the economy, rather than adopting austerity policies. This apparent degree of consensus within a profession that usually has a hard time agreeing on anything helped sway politicians. In the words of one important policy observer, What political leaders got from the economists was that people traditionally opposed to fiscal stimulus and fiscal deficits . . . suddenly had a different view. That impressed the politicians.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Contrary to Drum's argument, the apparent consensus among economists had real consequences for politics. German politicians, who didn't want stimulus, found themselves in an extremely awkward position when their own Council of Economic Experts suddenly did an about-face and started arguing for more spending to boost the economy. Skeptics, such as economists in the European Central Bank and elsewhere, felt it was best either to keep silent or to try to foist their own pet projects onto the stimulus bandwagon, as John Taylor did with tax cuts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "However, it is hard to maintain an apparent consensus among economists when prominent politicians chafe at it. Hence, the second phase of the Great Recession saw renewed fissures among economists (over when one should ease off government spending) and efforts to widen these fissures by governments and other institutions that disliked the policy implications of economists' advice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Thus, the European Union's finance ministers invited Alberto Alesina, a prominent advocate of austerity, to make a highly publicized presentation to them, and the European Central Bank started promoting the work of economists who seemed pro-austerity.

{"original": "The economics profession is not separate from politics", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What this suggests, as we argue, is that the best way to understand the role of economics in policymaking is to turn not to economic theory but to sociology.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Economic sociologists such as Marion Fourcade have argued that the profession of academic economics is deeply bound up with the political systems that it lives within and shapes. Prominent academic economists, far more than other social scientists, are likely to go back and forth between universities and roles in the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, International Monetary Fund and World Bank. This means that economics has far more political clout than other social sciences, but it also has reshaped the profession, turning external policy influence into an important form of internal disciplinary prestige.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This provides enormous advantages for economics — yet it also opens up important weaknesses.

Both were significantly higher than most projections at the start of the winter.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Hendriks, a 31-year-old who has been arguably baseball's top closer the past two seasons, was ninth on ESPN's list of the top free agents on the market, ranked by projected contract value, while McCann was 14th.

The elimination of SALT (state and local tax) deductions might encourage a few more homeowners to sell in a higher-cost state and move to a lower-cost state, but only if they can get a comparable job.

And eliminating deductions might push down housing prices, which have become overheated in some markets.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "What might hurt home buyers next year? All of the same things, and more. Eliminating or just limiting the mortgage interest and property tax deductions will hurt middle-income and upper-middle-income home buyers. Rising interest rates mean homes are even more expensive. Limited inventory means home buyers are chasing fewer homes, so prices may rise.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "1. Understand how much you can spend. Rising interest rates coupled with falling deductions means you need to get preapproved for your mortgage (as opposed to prequalified) so that you'll be able to act quickly when you find the right house. Remember that there's a difference between what lenders tell you is affordable and what will feel affordable to you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. Learn how much your home will cost. Yes, there are the costs of the mortgage, real estate property taxes and insurance. And then there's the cost of heating and cooling your future home. Maintenance is typically underestimated by home buyers, especially first-time home buyers, so be sure to set aside enough in your budget for small things (like blacktopping your driveway every year or two) and big things (like re-roofing or tuckpointing).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. Think about how easy (or hard) it will be to sell before you buy. Whatever attracts you to a home will be the thing you lean on when it comes time to sell. (And we won't always have a seller's market in this country. In 2009 through 2012, it was really difficult to sell a home.) But just because you can overlook a major flaw (a highway in your front or back yard, or a municipal waste facility across the street, or some other reason the location is undesirable) doesn't mean future buyers will — unless the price reflects that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4. Understand the art of negotiation. The past few years have been all about sellers, and 2018 is looking to start in the same direction. That means you have to be prepared to pay more and get less. But there are still deals to be found. You just have to look harder. You also have to understand what you want and what you're willing to give. Real estate doesn't have to be a zero sum game. Just because you win doesn't mean everyone else has to lose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The best real estate deals allow everyone to shake hands and walk away from the table feeling like a winner. And in what looks to be another year of uncertainty, disappointment and just plain incivility, spreading a little extra goodwill during the negotiations and at the closing table seems like a very good idea indeed. We promise it will pay off in spades.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Monday, May 17, 1982; Page C01 he newsroom looks properly chaotic: Clacking typewriters, loosened ties, rolled-up shirt sleeves, ringing phones, crumbled McDonald's bags, familiar faces from The Washington Star. The Metro editor pecks out his budget of today's stories: Two men killed in Victorian town house, Virginia senator wreaks havoc, it's pollen time again. A reporter comes in, leaps in the air and clicks his heels in celebration. Yesterday was the first day of deadline at The Washington Times, the newspaper owned by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's controversial Unification Church. The old Washington Daily News was always hectic and crowded, says George Clifford, who'll cover Capitol Hill for The Times. That's the way this is. Good to be home again. The place, the old Parsons Paper Co. on New York Avenue NE near the National Arboretum, has all the jumbled joy of news junkies getting together and doing the astonishing: Starting, not folding, a paper. Washington, like other big cities, has been losing papers. The Times-Herald, the Daily News and, 10 months ago, The Washington Star. At a time when urban papers are sputtering and dying nationwide, The Times is a curiosity. As publisher and editor James Whelan says: Launching a newspaper. It's the goddamndest thing. The Washington Times is not just any newspaper. Commonly referred to as the Moonie paper since its plans were announced, it is supported by the religious movement that Moon founded in Korea 28 years ago.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Preaching The Divine Principle, Moon sees himself as the new Messiah and Korea as God's chosen country. Since the church emerged in the United States in the early 1970s, questions have been raised about its finances, its suspected ties to the Korean CIA and its alleged brainwashing of young recruits. It is now an international business empire that encompasses entertainment, fishing, food retailing, publishing and, for a time, the Diplomat National Bank here. Robert Boettcher, the staff director of a 1978 House subcommittee investigation into Korean-American relations, says the church aims at creating a global theocracy that Moon would control. Moon already has one newspaper in the United States, the News World in New York City. According to the House subcommittee report, it served as a propaganda instrument of the Moon organization. A casual reader would not detect its UC Unification Church affilation on most days. On issues affecting Moon and the UC, however, the resources of the paper were mobilized along with other components of the Moon organization to attack and discredit critics and investigators. When Moon was indicted in a tax evasion case, one banner headline asked, Why Rev. Moon, Mr. President? Although one-third of the 125 reporters and editors are Unification Church members, everyone connected with The Washington Times adamantly says it won't be a church mouthpiece. Both Whelan and Smith Hempstone, the executive editor, have written guarantees of editorial control in their contracts that they insisted on. Reporters are equally wary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If it doesn't work out, and I can't be indepedent, I'll walk, says Clark Mollenhoff, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who'll cover the White House for the paper this summer. The paper's editors say its only purpose is to provide a conservative alternative to The Post. I don't know anyone in the New Right who hasn't felt this sense of desperation and frustration over the absense of a voice in Washington, says Whelan. But the real Washington story at The Times is its staff members--the ones who aren't church members. Many are familiar bylines from the Star. Some were bored writing books, others joined because of pleadings from already hired colleagues whom they trusted. Many badly needed a job; for them, their decision was proof that you can't eat your principles. Almost all had serious reservations. You'd have to be a brick not to go though some sort of moral convulsions, says Doug Lamborne, The Times sports editor and former Washington Star copy editor. I lost five pounds the first week. We all had these twitchy sort of feelings: 'Is what we're doing right?' But the names have rolled in: Jeremiah O'Leary, the former White House correspondent for The Star who became the spokesman for national security adviser William P. Clark, will cover the White House for The Times. Anne Crutcher, a former Star editorial writer, is editorial page editor at The Times. Dana Adams Schmidt, a former reporter for The New York Times and the Christian Science Monitor, will cover the State Department.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "By now, the justifications are well-formed. Hempstone, a former Star associate editor, has been quoted as saying, I've worked for a lot of publishers who thought they were God. Richard Levine, a general assignment reporter who published his own newspaper in New Hampshire until he ran out of money, reasons: We all work for sons-of-bitches. What's different? For Jack Mann, a sportswriter for The Star, it was money. I hadn't had a job for 10 months, he says. (His wife, Judy, is a columnist at The Post.) Take our salaries and cut that in half--when you've got a mortgage and kids in school. It was tough. For Mark Kram, a former Sports Illustrated writer who was fired from the magazine five years ago, it was a chance to breathe some fresh air. Frankly, I've been in a dungeon for so long writing books, he says. Nobody knows if you're alive or dead. I wanted to peek my head out and see what's going on. For Phil Evans, an assistant managing editor and former managing editor at The Star, it was a chance to get his blood flowing. The anticipation of being able to work at home at your typewriter and sit in your garden is very appealing, he says. But it becomes very boring. Newspapers are inherently exciting, and so far, no one has said, 'We don't do it that way.' In the last few years, hundreds of my colleagues and friends have been thrown out of work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's just incredibly challenging and exciting to be starting a newspaper instead of closing one. For Betty Beale, the longtime syndicated society columnist who lost her crucial outlet in Washington when The Star folded, it was a surprise. She says she didn't know The Times had bought the column from her syndicate until she saw a prototype edition. So how does she feel about her column appearing in the paper? Well, she says. There is a very long pause. Finally: I think it's fortunate that there's going to be another paper. I think it's fortunate that James Whelan has a contract to be in total control of what goes in it. And I think he's brought in a good staff. But her feelings about being in the paper? Another long pause. You put me on the spot, she says, finally. It's implied in what I said, don't you think? Clifford, the Capitol Hill correspondent, says of the Moon connection: It's a heavy load. The Quest for an Editor", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If we can manipulate seven nations at least, Moon was quoted as saying in a speech reported by the House subcommitee investigators, then we can get hold of the whole world: the United States, England, France, Germany, Soviet Russia, and maybe Korea and Japan. Moon, the 62-year-old father of 13 who is said to live on a sprawling New York estate, is now on trial for federal tax evasion. Jo Ann Harris, the prosecutor, said in her summation to the court in New York last week that Moon is guilty of greed, arrogance and power. The jury begins its third day of deliberations this morning. News World Communications Inc., the newspaper unit of the church empire, will fund The Times. The president of News World is Bo Hi Pak, who has a personal parking space in The Times lot and who was a central figure in the Korean influence-buying investigation here in the mid-1970s. In 1978, he said in congressional testimony that he received cash payments from the South Korean CIA, but said he was only a conduit for funds to reimburse others for anticommunist activities. Pak recruited Whelan, and as Whelan says Pak's associates told him during one of their meetings: If we wind up with someone we don't have trust in, we're going to have to hold the paper tightly. And if we hold the paper tightly, we won't succeed. If the newspaper is legitimate, does that legitimize the church? Who the hell are you to stand in judgment?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Whelan asks during an interview in his office. The only way you could successfully ask that question is by impuning to them some sort of evil and sinister quality. No, they're not zombies. No, they're not programmed. They're not freaks, for Chrissake. Paul Herman, a church member sent down from the News World to help out with advertising sales, sees it this way: I think I'm mainstream. I think The Divine Principle is the deepest truth. Whelan, 48, was the key to attracting the veteran journalists. He is the highly respected, politically conservative editor who worked for Richard Mellon Scaife, the owner of the Sacramento Union. Whelan was first approached by associates of Pak just before last Christmas. Soon after, he met with Pak. I liked him instantly, Whalen says. He's a very decent guy, I have discovered. We hit it off. For the next several weeks, Whalen says, there were missions sent to Sacramento to try to persuade him to take the job. By then, I was consulting people all over the country. Should I do this? Do I dare do this? Soon Scaife heard news of the offer and gave Whalen what Whalen characterizes as an unrelated raise and a bonus. Whalen turned Pak down once and for all, then left for a family trip down the California coast during the George Washington Birthday weekend. I had been going through a terrible soul-searching, he says. On the first night's stop, in a hotel in Santa Maria, he had a mild heart attack.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The offer from Pak, he says now, had everything to do with it, I think. It was a tough goddamned decision for me. I believed very strongly in the need for the paper. But I didn't want to do it. But on the night of his heart attack, unbeknownst to me, Col. Pak had fretted over my decision. He gathered up a couple of aides, jumped on an airplane, flew to Sacramento, holed up in a hotel and called my house every hour on the hour. Whalen wasn't home convalescing from the hospital in Santa Maria until a few days later. Pak and his aides came to see him, and talked for almost six hours with Whalen and his wife. And in the deep and dark of evening, Whalen recalls, I agreed to do it. It was 2:15 a.m. You know what I have now? he says. I have what I suppose is just normal anxiety--'is it going to work?'

{"original": "The Washington Times planned to print 100,000 copies of this morning's edition, which is being sold from bright orange sidewalk boxes, stores and newsstands inside the Beltway. The daily circulation of The Post is 761,000. The Times bought its offices on New York Avenue for $1.6 million, and ordered a new Goss Urbanite offset press and a computerized typesetting system. It runs a reporters' shuttle bus between the paper's offices and Metro Center; it is nearly impossible to get a cab that far from downtown. The Times is accepting no advertising--most newspapers' bread and butter--for the initial months of publication, saying it needs accurate circulation figures on which to base its rates. It is paying its editorial employes well for a newspaper of its size, although apparently not as well as rumored. The reporters' pay scale starts at $250 a week and goes to around $26,000 a year; some salaries, however, are a bit higher. Whelan says he's making 12.5 percent more than what he was getting at The Sacramento Union in salary and bonuses. He gets a company Cadillac, compared with the Buick Riviera he was given at The Union. Whelan won't say what the Unification Church will be spending on the paper this year, but John Morton, the newspaper analyst with the Lynch, Jones & Ryan brokerage firm, estimated that Times start-up costs and 1982 expenditures could run as high as $12 million. After that, there is the prospect of losing money; when the Star folded, it was losing $20 million annually.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It would be easy to lose a couple million a year on even a small newspaper if you don't have any advertising support, says Morton. And I suspect that's going to be the case. Rightly or not, the Unification Church is not well thought of by most of the population. It's going to be perceived as a publication of the church even if it produces, and I suspect it will, a respectable, neutral editorial product. But Whelan says the church is committed to supporting the newspaper forever, if need be. These ventures have never worked anywhere else, and there's no reason to think it'll work here, says Morton. But that's not the point. The point is that they want to publish a newspaper, and if the pockets of the church are deep enough and full enough, they can do it for as long as they want. No Welcome Mat", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Times, which has been publishing in-house prototypes since March, hasn't exactly had a warm welcome in Washington. Washington Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee said that it's financed by the Moonies and it's run by someone who has been involved with the South Korean CIA. But let's see what kind of a paper they turn out. The Corcoran Gallery says that its approval of The Times as a corporate sponsor--allowing the paper to hold its inaugural reception at the gallery tonight--has infuriated its executive committee. The administrative assistant to House Speaker Tip O'Neill, Chris Matthews, has told staff members not to bother with Times reporters. The Rev. Moon can buy a newspaper, but I can't buy the idea he's a newspaperman, says Matthews. We work hard enough responding to legitimate press inquiries. And at a party at socialite True Davis' home, a Times reporter who is a church member was asked to leave. At another party, a reporter encountered Larry King, Washington personality and author of The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. An attractive young lady came up and tried to interview me, King says. And I said, 'Are you a Moonie?' 'And she said, 'Yes, I am.' And I said, 'I don't talk to Moonies.' But Josette Sheeran, the 27-year-old editor of the newspaper's magazine and feature section who was a White House correspondent for the News World, says that the only reaction that I got was one of curiosity.", "augmented": []}

I joined the church full well knowing it is something not yet understood by society. So far, reporters and editors say that the church members and other staffers get along well. The thing about them, is number one, they're not as cynical as most newspeople, says Tom Breen, the metro editor who was the former night city editor at The Star. And number two, they're committed. It's nice to have someone who'll work 12 hours. Breen also says the staff can joke about church members' attempts to convert the others. It's at the point now where the guy on the metro desk can look at me and say: 'Now, I've got you.' What Matters", "augmented": []}

They were upgrades, not obvious needs. Washington had Clint Robinson as its backup first baseman before Lind arrived.

Last season, Washington paid a 20 percent tax, which amounted to less than $1 million.", "augmented": []}

The Marlins are reportedly asking for Robles, a center fielder who was recently ranked as the No. 5 prospect in baseball. That has seemingly produced a stalemate between the parties.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If the Nationals can't land Realmuto, they could turn to Alex Avila, a free agent, at catcher. Avila posted an .834 on-base-plus-slugging percentage in 112 games with the Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs last season, and has said he wouldn't mind a backup role. He turns 31 on Monday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As for the bullpen, the Nationals are not very high on Greg Holland, the top reliever remaining on the market, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.

{"original": "Maybe the answer is bringing back Matt Albers. The two sides had discussions during the Winter Meetings before the Nationals agreed on a deal with Kintzler. The decision seemed to end the possibility of the 35-year-old Albers returning to Washington, where he posted a 1.62 ERA in 63 appearances last season. Albers wanted a two-year deal. But perhaps the market's stagnation softens Albers's demands and opens the possibility of a reunion.", "augmented": []}

The Canadian court decision in Mike Montanan's favor thus violates the public policy of Montana and is void and unenforceable, because it's based on a law, legal code, or system that would not grant the parties affected by the ruling or decision the fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges granted under the Montana constitution (the right to trial by civil jury).

Maybe this is relevant to deciding whether Wanda can refuse to testify against Harry, or can file a joint tax return with Harry, or inherits property when Harry dies. To figure out whether the marriage is valid, Montana courts would likely need to figure out if Wanda's earlier Elbonian divorce was valid (since, if it was invalid, Wanda's marriage with Harry is bigamous). And that can only be determined using Elbonian law.", "augmented": []}

That was life on the ground in Elbonia for her.", "augmented": []}

She would have to somehow redivorce Xavier under Montana law, though he's still back in Elbonia, and then remarry Harry.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Does that make sense? To be sure, in some circumstances, it might be proper for courts to ignore the effect of foreign divorces that are based on procedures that U.S. law views as improper. For instance, American courts might reject application of foreign law that they see as unfair when it affects the rights of people who were U.S. residents at the time of the divorce.

{"original": "Be flexible. Pizza is adaptable, and if you have stray veggies in the fridge, chances are they will taste good on a pizza.

{"original": "Swallowing this argument requires overlooking that the Constitution provides the American people with the ability to remove as well as to elect their chief executive, specifically through impeachment. And in the event of Trump's ejection, the presidency would go to his 2016 Republican running mate, Vice President Pence, not to his Democratic opponent in that race, Hillary Clinton — let alone to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, third in the presidential line of succession.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump's departure would also mean that at least 20 Republican senators voted for removal, which at this point seems about as likely as a meteor hitting the Capitol. And even after removal, Citizen Trump could still run for president this year unless the Senate took a separate vote barring him from holding future office.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But suppose an alternative-universe scenario in which Trump somehow was forced out of political life. Even in that universe, the 2016 election stands. Three years of Trump's occupation of the Oval Office are proof. For their votes, the Americans who put him there have two Supreme Court justices, the appointments of nearly 200 other conservative judges at all levels of the federal judiciary, a multibillion-dollar tax bill, a massive boost in military spending, the rollback of nearly 100 environmental regulations, and cuts to a number of health and social welfare programs. Those votes would not be torn up, as Cipollone asserted at the trial on Thursday. Those people and policies would not be dislodged. And that is because very little about our politics would change. The Republican Party is likely to remain a Trumpian party for the foreseeable future, whether Trump leads it or not, marked by the same uneasy combination of policy initiatives that mainly benefit the GOP's donor class, plus Trump-style unilateralism, demonization of political enemies and the continuous ceding of congressional power to the executive branch. The polarization that divides American society would only worsen with Trump's involuntary ouster — perhaps even prolonging Trumpism.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A President Pence might want to return to some of the core Republican beliefs Trump jettisoned, such as free trade, small government and balanced budgets. But even before Trump entered the political scene, the Republicans were becoming the party of the white working class, for whom traditional GOP policies held little appeal. Such voters would push back hard against any leader of their party who may wish to tout the benefits of globalization, privatize or significantly cut entitlements like Social Security and Medicare that greatly benefit the white working class, or provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants along the lines of the amnesty Ronald Reagan offered through 1986's immigration reform.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The reality is that it will be a long time, if ever, before we see a return to a Reaganite Republican Party, so long as the party retains its base among the non-college-educated whites who now make up 6 out of 10 Republican voters. Trump rebranded the party around their economic, cultural and racial resentments. This intensified the devotion of such voters to their maximum leader but accelerated the departure of the college-educated suburban voters who once reliably voted Republican. It will be exceptionally difficult for post-Trump GOP leaders to change that dynamic, even if they understand the perils of alienating the rest of society outside of the party's shrinking demographic base.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's true that a President Pence probably would behave in a more conventionally presidential manner than Trump. He most likely would abandon Trump's habit of savaging his enemies via Twitter and would restore a measure of order to the chaotic disunity that currently prevails in the executive branch. He would be less inclined to openly flout the constitutional and democratic norms that presidents of both parties used to uphold, and more inclined to utter the occasional bromide about the need for national unity.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Much of Trump's strength as a candidate in 2016 lay in his ability to talk about the problems that lopsidedly afflict those left-behind regions — problems that other candidates from both parties found it convenient to ignore. These include economic inequality, manufacturing decline, family breakdown, crumbling infrastructure, the underemployment of prime working-age men, and the opioid epidemic and deaths of despair that drove down American life expectancy for three years (though it rose slightly in 2018).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "However, few of these problems have been seriously addressed under Trump, and most have grown worse. It's doubtful that Clinton, who was very much the candidate of the status quo and would constantly have been at swords' points with a Republican-controlled Congress, would have had any more success in dealing with them if she had won. To be sure, the United States under a Clinton presidency would not have withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement or the Iran nuclear deal, nor would the Trumpian executive orders, tax cuts or judicial appointments have happened. But nearly all the structural drivers of polarization would have remained firmly in place. In this deep systemic sense, at least, it made little difference which party won the 2016 presidential election.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A successful effort to deal with these fundamental problems — and other existential issues such as climate change, the global refugee and migration crisis, and threats to democracy around the world — would require far-reaching bipartisan cooperation and compromise. But that has become anathema to leading factions in both parties, including Trump's most rabid supporters in the House Freedom Caucus and Bernie Sanders's partisans, who think that as president he could implement his socialist revolution with the repeated strokes of a pen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As Ezra Klein points out in his sharp new book on polarization, Republican intransigence has less to do with Trump than with the ideological, demographic and geographic sorting that both parties have undergone over the past half-century. This sorting has made the Republicans more homogenous, with little need to appeal to moderates as well as conservatives. And the increasing concentration of Americans in the largest and most Democratic states means that geographically advantaged Republicans can win elections at all levels despite rarely winning the popular vote, and have little incentive to cooperate with Democrats when they are out of power.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If America's democratic system is headed toward a legitimacy crisis, it won't be because the impeachment and removal of Trump would tear up the votes of three years ago.

Rather, it is to suggest that if we, as a society, decide that we find the current distribution of income unacceptable — if it offends our moral intuitions that a single financier earns as much in a year as 15,000 elementary school teachers — then it violates no great moral or economic principle to alter that distribution.", "augmented": []}

Our new congressional representation probably would be similarly representative. Senators from D.C. would represent progressive values, such as pushing for a living wage and worker protections, including paid sick leave.

{"original": "Here are answers to seven key questions about the state — and the troubles — of the Trump Organization.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "QUESTION 1: Didn't Trump give up his businesses when he took office?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump handed over day-to-day control of his businesses to his sons, Don Jr. and Eric, along with a longtime Trump Organization executive named Allen Weisselberg. But Trump did not give up ownership of his businesses: They are still his, and he can withdraw money from them at any time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "By retaining his ownership, Trump tied the Trump Organization's commercial fortunes to his political fortunes. It has also exposed the company to unprecedented legal scrutiny from investigators, competitors and legislators who are now exploring whether the Trump Organization is being patronized by those seeking to influence the government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "QUESTION 2: Has Trump's presidency benefited or hurt his business?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We know that in some foreign countries and in liberal areas of the United States, Trump's political rise has coincided with a drop in business and a retreat of his brand.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "His hotels in Chicago and New York saw business decline after he got into politics, according to documents shared with Trump's investors. So did Doral, Trump's mega-resort in Miami, where company documents show net operating income fell 69 percent between 2015 and 2017. They are severely underperforming, said a representative hired by the Trump Organization to seek a property-tax reduction from Miami-Dade County. She blamed the negative connotation of the Trump name.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In addition, Trump's name has come down from hotels in Panama, Toronto, Rio de Janeiro and New York's SoHo neighborhood and from four (soon to be six) residential buildings in New York since Election Day 2016.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Trump Organization says there is no problem with its brand. It blamed hurricanes and the Zika virus for the decline at Doral, and worries about gun violence for the decline in Chicago. It blamed political enemies and the media for the company's decision to shelve two planned new hotel chains that were to include an upscale boutique brand called Scion and a line of lower-cost hotels called American Idea.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We live in a climate where everything will be used against us, whether by the fake news or by Democrats who are only interested in Presidential harassment and wasting everyone's time, Eric Trump said in a statement in February, when he announced the cancellation of those plans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And there is little doubt that the company is paying more in legal fees than previously, though the amount has not been released.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the Trump presidency has also brought in new customers who want to show support for his administration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Republican candidates, for instance, have flocked to Trump's properties. They spent at least $4.5 million on meals, ballrooms and steak dinners during the 2018 election cycle, campaign finance records show. Foreign governments have paid Trump hotels for ballroom rentals and overnight stays. And in Palm Beach, pro-Trump groups have held events at Mar-a-Lago to make sure their dollars go to the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What does it all add up to? Crain's New York Business estimated that the Trump Organization's annual revenue, which stood at about $700 million in 2016, fell between $45 million and $90 million in 2017.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "QUESTION 3: Are foreign countries spending money at Trump properties?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ANSWER: Yes. But we don't know how much in total.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In Washington, the embassies of Azerbaijan, the Philippines, Bahrain and Kuwait have all held parties at the Trump International Hotel since Trump was elected in 2016, according to embassy staff and news reports. At the same hotel, lobbyists working for the Saudi government reserved more than 500 rooms at Trump's hotel in the four months after he was elected, The Washington Post previously reported, paying more than $270,000.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And in Chicago, the Romanian Consulate rented a ballroom at the Trump hotel to hold its national day celebration in 2018.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Those are just the events we know about, thanks to media reports and federal filings. The Trump Organization has said little on the subject.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It announced that it reaped about $191,538 in foreign profits in 2018 and donated the same amount to the U.S. Treasury. That was up slightly from the $151,000 in profit from foreign-government customers that the company reported from 2017. But, in both years, the company gave no details about who those foreign customers were or how much in total they paid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "QUESTION 4: What have we learned now about how Trump ran his businesses before he ran for president?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For one thing, we've learned that in the nine years before he began his presidential run, Trump made a significant and unusual switch in the way he paid for real estate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Before, he had largely purchased properties by borrowing money with mortgages. Trump even called himself the King of Debt. But in 2006, he began buying without loans, paying out of a vast source of ready cash, a tactic not commonly used in the real estate industry.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In all, Trump paid more than $400 million for 14 properties over nine years without using loans. His son Eric Trump said that the company produced enough cash flow to make such purchases and that his father had wanted to avoid piling up debt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "From the New York Times, we learned that Trump's father, Queens real estate developer Fred Trump, used what the Times called suspect tax schemes to funnel $413 million to his son. The Times said that for much of his life, Donald Trump's career had been bankrolled by his father, whose money helped his son out of financial jams. The Times also reported that Trump had claimed more than $1 billion in losses on his tax returns between 1985 and 1994 — more losses than nearly any other American in that period. Those revelations run counter to much of what Trump has said about his career, particularly his assertion that he succeeded on his own, with very little help from his father.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And from Michael Cohen — the longtime Trump fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges in 2018 — we learned that Trump's efforts to build a Trump Tower Moscow had lasted far longer than he and Trump had acknowledged. Even while Trump was running for president in 2016 and praising Russian President Vladimir Putin along the way, Cohen said, he was asking the Kremlin for help in making the deal happen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "QUESTION 5: What legal issues does the Trump Organization face?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ANSWER: Trump's business and its executives are facing an unprecedented level of legal scrutiny from state and federal authorities — and it is likely to increase this year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Federal prosecutors in New York have examined the role of unnamed Trump Organization executives in what they said was a scheme by Cohen to pay women hush money before the 2016 election, according to court papers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump's company has been sued by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, who are seeking details on the company's transactions with foreign governments. Those attorneys general say such payments violate the Constitution's emoluments clause, which bars presidents from taking payments from foreign countries.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In the House, Democrats said they plan to use their new majority to investigate Trump's foreign customers, his sources of funding for real estate deals and his lease on the federal building that houses Trump International Hotel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "QUESTION 6: That's a lot of gloom. What does the Trump Organization have to be optimistic about?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ANSWER: In Scotland and in Ireland, Trump's company has proposed expanding the footprint of three golf courses by adding hundreds of private homes next to them. Those plans, if approved by local land-use regulators, could bring a major payoff if Trump could then sell lots or finished homes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In California, too, Trump sought permission to sell 23 home lots near his oceanside golf course.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And in Dubai, Indonesia and Uruguay, the Trump Organization is planning to open licensed properties — golf courses, hotels and a building whose owners will pay to use the Trump name. Those projects all were agreed to before Trump won the presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "QUESTION 7: Is Trump donating his presidential salary, as he promised?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Washington Post sent a detailed questionnaire to every Democratic campaign asking whether they support various climate change policies. We organized candidates with similar stances into groups using a combination of those answers, legislative records, action taken in an executive role and other public comments, such as policy discussion on campaign websites, social media posts, interviews, town halls and other news reports. See something that we missed? Let us know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This page will update as we learn more about the candidates' plans. We also will note if candidates change their position on an issue. At initial publication, this page included major candidates who had announced a run for president. If a candidate dropped out after a question was published here, their stance is included under the Show former candidates option. If they dropped out before a question was first published, the Post did not reach out to get their stance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This post-apocalyptic vision of chaos and national humiliation was the direct and intended consequence of a president's incitement. It was made possible by quislings such as Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who turned a ceremony of continuity into a rallying cry for hatred and treason. In the aftermath, Republican legislators who still don't support President Trump's immediate removal from office by constitutional means are guilty of continuing complicity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Capitol Police were unable to stop a breach of the Capitol. Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig and a former Senate Sergeant at Arms describe the events. (The Washington Post)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All this leaves President-elect Joe Biden in a difficult position. Prudence would advise two weeks of patience and then an upbeat attempt to turn the national page. Justice would dictate arresting, trying and imprisoning President Trump for sedition at the soonest possible moment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As of now, I am in the justice camp. The only way to restore boundaries of law and decency is to enforce them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The coming weeks will see a gradually arriving reckoning. Political leaders who sought access and influence over the past four years through a political alliance with insurrectionists and domestic terrorists are responsible for unleashing insurrectionists and domestic terrorists. This is true of some Federalist Society conservatives, who cared only about judicial appointments. It is true of some economic conservatives, focused only on tax and regulatory policy. And it is true, above all, of Trump evangelicals, who sought to recover lost social influence through the cynical embrace of corrupt power.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I come back to this group repeatedly, not only because I share an evangelical background and resent those who dishonor it, but because the overwhelming support of evangelicals is the single largest reason that Trump possesses power in the first place. It was their malignant approach to politics that forced our country into its current nightmare. As white nationalists, conspiracy theorists, misogynists, anarchists, criminals and terrorists took hold of the Republican Party, many evangelicals blessed it under the banner Jesus Saves.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Jesus had something to say about political deals with the devil: Get behind me, Satan! My point is less theological: The political and religious costs of a tight evangelical alliance with violent bigots and crackpots were easily foreseen. I and many others foresaw and foresaw until our fingers ached at the keyboard. Yet Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell Jr., Robert Jeffress and the others either shut their eyes or shared in Trumpian hatreds. There has never been anyone, said Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, who has defended us and who has fought for us, who we have loved more than Donald J. Trump. No one!", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We didn't vote for him to be our pastor or our husband, explained Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America. We voted for him to be our bodyguard. But what if the bodyguard you hired turns out to be a brutish, bigoted, narcissistic, authoritarian thug who wants to burn down any democratic institution he can't control? Perhaps the moral character of political bodyguards actually matters. Perhaps evangelicals should not be hiring bodyguards in the first place, but rather supporting moral leaders who seek the common good.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The damage is now done. And it is not my purpose to pick through the ruins of destroyed reputations. It is tempting to call unforgivable the equation of Christian truth with malice, cruelty, deception, bigotry and sedition. But that statement is itself contradicted by Christian truth, which places no one beyond forgiveness and affirms that everyone needs grace in different ways. There is a perfectly good set of Christian tools to deal with situations such as these: remorse, repentance, forgiveness, reformation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The collapse of one disastrous form of Christian social engagement should be an opportunity for the emergence of a more faithful one. And here there are plenty of potent, hopeful Christian principles lying around unused by most evangelicals: A consistent and comprehensive concern for the weak and vulnerable in our society, including the poor, immigrants and refugees. A passion for racial reconciliation and criminal justice reform, rooted in the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity. A deep commitment to public and global health, reflecting the priorities of Christ's healing ministry. An embrace of political civility as a civilizing norm. A commitment to the liberty of other people's religions, not just our own. An insistence on public honesty and a belief in the transforming power of unarmed truth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What would America be like if these had been the priorities of evangelical Christians over the past four years — or over the past four decades? It would mean something very different, in that world, to raise the banner Jesus Saves.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Scott J. Cameron, Interior's principal deputy assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, instructed other assistant secretaries and bureau and office heads to submit most grants and cooperative agreements for approval by one of his aides. Those include any award of at least $50,000 to a non-profit organization that can legally engage in advocacy or to an institution of higher education.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The EPA directive also targeted federal grants to universities and nonprofit groups. Although Cameron did not identify the total amount of funding affected by the new policy, and the department declined to comment on the matter, Interior officials said it involves hundreds of millions of dollars.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "An attachment to the directive listed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's Top Ten Priorities by which each award would be scrutinized. The list begins with Creating a conservation stewardship legacy second only to Teddy Roosevelt and includes Utilizing our natural resources.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift said in an email Tuesday that the department had been reviewing grants and cooperative agreements totaling at least $100,000 since April and that the new guidance continued the responsible stewardship of tax dollars.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Although Interior secretaries under Democratic and Republican presidents have directed federal dollars to support their priorities, the new approval process appears to be without precedent within the department.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "David J. Hayes, who served as Interior's deputy secretary under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, said in an email Monday that laws passed by Congress govern these programs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Subjugating Congress' priorities to 10 of the Secretary's own priorities is arrogant, impractical and, in some cases, likely illegal, said Hayes, executive director of the New York University School of Law's State Energy and Environmental Impact Center.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Our senior leadership team never set up a process like this — that is, a process that identifies broad categories of contracts, at modest financial levels, that must be kicked upstairs to headquarters for political sign-off, Hayes added. To the contrary, we recognized that government contract processes are complex, and that political interference would sully the integrity of contracting processes that applicants have a right to expect are governed with fairness, impartiality, and integrity as their guide.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Cameron's memo warns, in a sentence that is bolded as well as italicized, that employees who defy the directive will be subject to even stricter oversight as a result.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement that he would need to review the new system, but I'm immediately skeptical given the administration's track record.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This grant approval process looks like a backdoor way to stop funds going to legitimate scientific and environmental projects, he said. Using the federal grant process to punish scientists doing important work because they disagree with that philosophy is unacceptable, and there's good reason to think that's what's really happening here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Interior has ordered the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to halt two studies that conflict with the administration's goal of expanding domestic fossil fuel production.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Officials said they had questions about the studies' expense to taxpayers. One, stopped in August, was looking at whether residents near surface coal mining sites in Appalachia face higher health risks than other Americans. The second, suspended last month, was aimed at updating and enhancing the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement's oil and gas inspection program.", "augmented": []}

Powell released a rare statement Friday saying the Fed will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. That was followed by the Bank of Japan promising to strive to stabilize markets and offer sufficient liquidity. The Bank of England said it was working with our international partners to ensure all necessary steps are taken.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Money for U.S. health care: Congress and the White House are working on an emergency funding package of $7.5 billion. Some health-care experts have called for double that amount. Much of the funding would go toward vaccine development, medical equipment and protective gear, and state and local governments on the front lines of the epidemic.

{"original": "Swonk expects the Fed to ease up on lending standards for a while, which would help banks be more generous to companies and individuals under strain this spring from coronavirus-related problems. If the situation grows rapidly, one has to wonder what the appetite for bailouts is, Swonk said.

Shaub told Chaffetz: In recent weeks, I have spoken publicly about my concerns about the President Elect's current plan to not divest—as well as to applaud some of his nominees' ethics agreements, such as Rex Tillerson's. My remarks were intended to educate the public about the shortcomings of the President Elect's current plan and made in the hopes of persuading him to make adjustments that will resolve his conflicts of interest. I believe these remarks to be in line with OGE's mission. He continued: As these communications make clear, the public wants to understand conflicts of interest in government and the role that OGE plays in preventing conflicts from hindering effective governance. Holding our meeting in public is in accordance with OGE's educational function and will further ensure transparency in how we approach ethical governance.

Chaffetz wants to speak to the head of OGE during the President-elect's ethics vetting and does not want the public to know what he says.

What's wrong with doing oversight in the sunlight? I support a public hearing, where everybody can talk about the main issue here: Trump's impending constitutional violations and other conflicts, said former White House ethics counsel Norman Eisen. Indeed, 2 out of 3 Utahns want him to probe those conflicts.

He offered a list of his progressive successes — on voting rights, minimum wages, net neutrality, transportation, etc. — and made the case that green technology makes climate change a jobs message as well. He might consider stressing his entire record as evidence of his ability to successfully govern, which includes climate change policies, and his role in challenging Trump's vile immigration policies. Almost as an afterthought, he notes that renewable-energy legislation helped launched a multibillion-dollar wind industry and helped his state lead in GDP growth and wages.

{"original": "Executives are grappling with a generational shift in consumer tastes as year-over-year sales of the sedan plummet in favor of SUVs and crossovers.

{"original": "Few companies have been as exposed to Trump's mercurial attitudes as GM and Ford Motor. Trump was quick to dole out praise and claim credit early in his administration when the firms announced big investments that would create U.S. jobs.

{"original": "Yet just as car companies have begun putting their plans in motion, Trump's own policies and proposals risk creating additional head winds, analysts said. Targeting the electric-car incentives could put U.S. automakers at a disadvantage when many foreign firms, such as Toyota, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, are moving ambitiously to electrify their portfolio of vehicles. Meanwhile, by hiking the price of steel and aluminum, Trump's tariffs are expected to make buying a car more expensive in the United States — which, along with rising interest rates, could suppress U.S. vehicle demand in 2019. Trump's trade barriers cost GM and Ford up to $1 billion each last year, the companies have said.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The important thing to understand here is that, in the depths of the Great Recession, Beijing unleashed a stimulus the likes of which the world hadn't seen since World War II. It amounted to some 19 percent of its gross domestic product, according to Columbia University historian Adam Tooze. By point of comparison, President Barack Obama's stimulus was only about 5 or 6 percent of U.S. GDP. Aside from its size, what made China's stimulus unique was the way it was administered. The central government didn't borrow a lot of money itself to use on infrastructure, but rather pushed local governments and state-owned companies to do so. The result was a web of debt that's been even harder to clean up than it might have been because of all the money that unregulated lenders — so-called shadow banks — were frantically handing out above and beyond what Beijing had been hoping for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The challenge then has been for Beijing to stop even more debt from turning this boom into a bust without stopping the boom in the first place. In other words, to navigate the economy between the Scylla of a bubble and the Charybdis of a severe slowdown.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Not that this is new. It's what the Chinese Communist Party has had to do ever since it substituted ever-increasing prosperity for Marxist-Leninist ideology as the basis of its legitimacy. And the good news, insofar as both Beijing and the world economy are concerned, is that it's become exceedingly efficient at it. As Bloomberg News's Noah Smith points out, China has actually managed to avoid a recession for 25 years now, in large part because of the government's novel use of credit policy — directing banks when and how much to lend — to smooth out the usual ups and downs of the business cycle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What is new, though, is that this isn't working quite as well as before. Why is that? Well, as the International Monetary Fund reports, China simply seems to have reached a point of diminishing returns with this kind of credit stimulus. So much new debt is either going to pay back old debt or into economically questionable projects that it takes a lot more of it than it used to just to achieve the same amount of growth. Three times as much, in fact. Whereas it had only taken six-and-a-half trillion yuan of new credit to make China's economy grow by five trillion yuan a year back in 2008, that had risen to 20 trillion yuan of new credit by 2016. Which is why Beijing has had to resort to even more old-fashioned stimulus like tax cuts and infrastructure spending — in particular, it recently announced a new wave of subway construction around Shanghai and Hangzhou — to try to keep growth above the 6 percent that the Party thinks it needs to keep people from protesting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The global economy needs it, too. Apple, for one, has already revised its revenue projections down because of soft sales in the Middle Kingdom. And Wall Street thinks the rest of the Fortune 500 won't be far behind. Although even that doesn't give you a true sense of how much the world has come to depend on Chinese growth. To get a better idea of that, it helps to look at a chart the Financial Times put together of crude steel production. Consider this: Between 1978, when it began its market reforms, and 2000, China's share of world steel production increased from 4.4 percent to 15.1 percent. This was, as far as economic development goes, a fairly typical success story that saw China's production nearly match North America's. What's happened since then, though, has no precedent in economic history. China's steel production didn't plateau like everyone else's, but kept growing even faster and faster, to the point that it now makes up 49.2 percent of the world total.", "augmented": []}

The real estate taxes on a home are generally based on the size of the lot, the size of the home, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, whether a home has a finished basement and attic, and whether the home has an attached or detached garage. All of these elements are factored into the value of the home for real estate tax purposes.", "augmented": []}

At this point, you'd want to request copies of the permits before moving forward with the purchase of the home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You might also ask your agent. One of the best reasons to work with an agent who has deep experience in and knowledge of the local housing market is that they are usually quite familiar with all of the homes — and have often seen them turnover more than once in their careers.

{"original": "Democracy requires a level playing field", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In our work on hybrid or what we call competitive authoritarian regimes, we show how democracy can be fundamentally compromised even without obvious civil liberties violations or electoral fraud. Leaders can create an uneven playing field by using administrative powers to strengthen their party and systematically deny the opposition access to crucial resources, media or state institutions. These autocrats submit to meaningful multiparty elections — but engage in serious democratic abuse.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In any democracy, elected officials have advantages over their challengers, including an easier time attracting media coverage and business support, because the government can deliver resources and policy benefits. But an uneven playing field means leaders use those advantages in ways that profoundly impair the opposition's ability to compete. Let's look at how that works.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "First, leaders may systematically prevent opposition parties from gaining financial resources. Former Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma, for example, regularly ordered tax authorities in the 1990s and 2000s to audit businesses that financed the opposition. Governing parties may also create a biased news media. In Malaysia, all major private newspapers and private television stations were controlled by individuals or firms linked to the governing party.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Governing parties may also manipulate the rules to disadvantage the opposition.

Since then, the party has increasingly denied opposition access to resources necessary to compete for power.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "First, Fidesz infiltrated much of the state bureaucracy. By 2012, Fidesz loyalists were already entrenched in every corner of the state, as Miklós Bánkuti, Gábor Halmai and Kim Lane Scheppele documented — including in the constitutional court, budget council, electoral commission, national judicial office, state audit office, public prosecutor's office and national bank. That brings significant advantages. For example, in the 2014 elections, the electoral commission rejected a wide range of complaints on inconsistent and formalistic grounds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Finally, Fidesz has changed the electoral rules in ways that make it easier for the party to dominate. That includes significant gerrymandering — splitting off constituencies with a leftist majority to dilute the opposition vote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Fidesz's opposition is weak for many reasons having nothing to do with Orban's abuse of power — including scandals and economic problems from the 2000s, when opposition leaders last held power.

For example, after forcing a leading independent university out of Hungary, the government argued that this was the result of a perfectly reasonable requirement under Hungary's legislation.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Starting a side hustle. You may have started driving for Uber, delivering food for Postmates or taking on other freelance work as a way of bringing in extra cash. But the move can trigger a tax bill, tax experts say. For starters, you are probably not having taxes withheld from the paychecks you earn as an independent contractor, says Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant and tax expert with TurboTax. That means you could be hit with a tax bill at the end of the year, she says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Some freelancers who still have a traditional 9-to-5 job may be able to avoid that tax hit by having more taxes withheld from their paychecks by their main employer, Greene-Lewis says. For other people, the surprise tax bill may be a hint that they may need to start making estimated tax payments every quarter to avoid falling behind on taxes, she adds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another thing to keep in mind is that freelance earnings of $400 or more are subject to self-employment taxes, meaning that you must pay both the employer and employee share of Social Security and Medicare taxes. That adds up to a total tax rate of 15.3 percent, says Cari Weston, a director with the American Institute of CPAs. However, self-employed workers can also deduct the employer portion of those payroll taxes, which account for half of the tax rate, or 7.65 percent, Weston says. They may also be able to write off some other business-related costs associated with their side gigs, such as advertising, marketing and software, that can help lower their tax bill, Greene-Lewis says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Saying I do. Once the vows are exchanged and the honeymoon is over, married couples filing their first joint tax return could come across what's known as the marriage penalty — or a higher tax bill than they would have owed if they each filed separately. This typically happens when the two spouses earn similar incomes. Getting married can land them in a higher tax bracket and therefore result in a bigger tax bill, Weston says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For example, a couple with each spouse earning $100,000 a year would pay nearly $800 more in income taxes after getting married than if each person had filed separately as a single person, according to a calculator from the Tax Policy Center. Depending on how much each spouse is withholding from his or her paycheck, the difference could result in a tax bill. (However, some couples may end up with a lower tax bill, or what's known as a marriage bonus. If one person is not working or earns significantly less than the other spouse, it could put them into a lower tax bracket.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Filing for divorce. If you got divorced, then you probably won't qualify for some of the tax deductions you claimed as a married person. For example, divorced couples with children will find that only one parent can claim child-related tax breaks, such as the adoption credit, the earned-income tax credit and education credits, says Dave Du Val, chief customer advocacy officer at TaxAudit.com. For some people, becoming single could also mean landing in a higher tax bracket, Greene-Lewis says, especially if their spouse earned significantly less money — and brought them into a lower tax bracket.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Tapping into your retirement account. If you withdrew money from, say a 401(k) or an individual retirement account, then you might owe Uncle Sam.

{"original": "Financial firms will usually automatically withhold 20 percent before paying out such early-retirement distributions, but it may not be enough to cover all of the taxes and penalties owed, Du Val says. For some people, the withdrawal may push them into a higher tax bracket, which could increase their overall tax bill, Greene-Lewis says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Selling your home. You may owe Uncle Sam if you sell a home for much more than what you bought it for. If you're single and made a profit of more than $250,000 on your home, or if you're married and had gains greater than $500,000, then you may owe taxes on the sale. Also, any gains from the sale of a vacation home or rental property generally needs to be reported as capital gains, which would make it subject to a 20 percent tax if the home has been owned for longer than a year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Losing your job. Some people may not realize that income received from unemployment benefits is taxable, Greene-Lewis says. While recipients are given the option of having taxes withheld from their unemployment checks, some people may overlook that or decline if they are in a tight financial situation, she says. However, taxes on those benefits will be due when they file their tax returns and could eat into any tax refund they are expecting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Receiving an inheritance. If someone dies and leaves you an asset that they would have owed taxes on, that asset is now taxable to you, Du Val says. For example, say you inherit a relative's retirement savings. If the person would have owed taxes on the savings, you would owe income taxes on that inheritance, he says. Many common forms of inheritance, however, including life-insurance payouts and cash transfers, do not trigger tax bills for the recipient, because there was no tax bill owed by the person who died, Du Val says. Some very large inheritances that are greater than $5.49 million per individual may be subject to the estate tax of up to 40 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "People inheriting property could also face tax bills depending on what they do with it. Take the example of a person who inherits a house and sells it right away. He may not owe any taxes if the sale price is the same as the inherited price, Weston says. But someone who inherits a house and sells it years later at a higher price would owe taxes on the difference, he says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Winning a vacation, car or other prize. You probably already know to expect a huge tax bill if you strike it rich by winning the lottery. But winning noncash prizes such as a car, or a vacation, can also trigger a tax bill, Weston says. Winners will typically owe income taxes on the cash value of that prize and should report it on their tax returns. Some game shows will make that reporting easy by sending participants a 1099 form, Weston says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But some people may also face tax bills after coming across less obvious prizes, such as fans who catch a home-run ball at an important baseball game.

Or it could pass bills making clear Congress intended for the rest of the ACA to stand with or without the mandate to buy coverage (this was another big question in the 2012 case). Those actions would take the legs out of the lawsuit, which contends Obamacare can't exist without the individual mandate.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Specifically, the Wizards would like to find a guard, allowing them to upgrade their backup point guard spot behind all-star John Wall. Because they shipped out their first-round pick to acquire Bogdanovic and McCullough (more on that in a minute), the Wizards will likely be looking to dangle a combination of Trey Burke — who is on an expiring contract — and a second-round pick to find an upgrade, presumably on an expiring contract. That's why names like Sacramento's Darren Collison and New York's Brandon Jennings could make sense, among others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The return of Mahinmi, along with the recent uptick in Smith's performance, means the Wizards have no reason to look for a big man, and the combination of Oubre and Bogdanovic on the wings gives them a strong four-man wing rotation behind starters Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Bogdanovic, in particular, should fit extremely well as a second-unit scorer in Washington. A solid three-point shooter who averaged 14.2 points and shot 35.7 percent from three-point range in Brooklyn playing 27 minutes a game as a starter, Bogdanovic should benefit greatly from time he'll spend on the court with Wall — easily the best point guard he's ever played with, and one of the best players in the league at setting others up for three-point shots.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "While Porter (46.7 percent) and Beal (40.2 percent) have been excellent from behind the arc, no one else on the team has proven to be much of a consistent threat from deep. Bogdanovic, who has attempted five triples a game this season with Brooklyn, will give Washington another option there and should allow Coach Scott Brooks to ease back on the minutes for both Beal and Porter down the stretch.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "From Washington's standpoint, however, this deal is equally important for its financial situation moving forward. Moving off Nicholson's contract for the next three seasons while taking on McCullough's $1.4 million salary for next season means the Wizards are sitting at $91.9 million committed to 10 players next year (plus the stretched salary of Martell Webster that remains on their books).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If the cap rises to the current projection of around $102 million for next season, that would allow the Wizards to match any contract offer for Porter in free agency and still remain under the luxury tax line, while retaining the rights to Bogdanovic as a restricted free agent will allow Washington to potentially bring him back, as well, if the price is right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Meanwhile, McCullough should be viewed as the wild card in the deal. The 29th pick in the 2015 NBA Draft out of Syracuse, McCullough has only played in 38 games as a pro — including 14 for a grand total of 72 minutes this season. He's a long, athletic forward, listed at 6-foot-10 and with long arms and the ability to shoot from the perimeter, leaving open the possibility he could become the kind of player every team is looking for that can stretch the floor offensively and protect the rim defensively.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But he's also played very little for the worst team in the league, so the expectation shouldn't be for him to come in a claim a rotation spot for a playoff team. If he can turn into a rotation player down the road, though, it would help ease Washington's payroll burden by giving them a cheap contributor moving forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In the short term, though, adding Bogdanovic — and shedding Nicholson's salary — is what matters here. Between him and Mahinmi, the Wizards have essentially added two new players to their second unit over the past few weeks. If they can add another guard between now and the deadline, Washington can enter the stretch run with the strongest team its had since the Gilbert Arenas-Caron Butler-Antawn Jamison teams of the mid-2000s and the best chance of making a deep and impactful playoff run since the great Bullets teams of the 1970s.", "augmented": []}

If you have $300,000 in cash at the same time of that refinance and you put it into an investment that's paying you just 4 percent interest per year, then after 15 years, you will have made $240,283 in earned interest.

{"original": "In board documents to be released Monday, Metro expresses concern that customers have been slow to return to the system after the year-long SafeTrack maintenance program. Furthermore, the agency says, research shows that when a customer experiences a trip that takes 30 minutes or more than planned, they are significantly more likely to leave Metro entirely, or at a minimum, severely reduce how frequently they ride.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said the program is an expression of the confidence the agency has in its ability to meet performance targets and provide reliable rush-hour service, while adding a measure of accountability for officials.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In the agency's most recent ­Vital Signs report, statistics showed that 88 percent of rail customers' trips were on time by last fall. The improved reliability comes after Metro retired its oldest and least reliable rail cars last year, and trimmed its operating hours while reducing service to expand overnight maintenance time and address budget concerns. While the changes help reduce wear and tear on the system, the agency also is running fewer trains, making performance targets easier to meet.", "augmented": []}

But I think for the customer, they really need to feel that and understand that we're committed to it, and we're holding ourselves accountable, and we're willing to put something on the line to reinforce that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Wiedefeld said the proposal, which the Metro board must approve, is a type of built-in security for riders who depend on the system for their daily commute.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "These are very big, complex systems and things do happen every day, but from a customer perspective what we're saying is in effect that we will get you to where you should be within 15 minutes of the schedule, he said. We're trying to show you that we can be that predictable in our service.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Jack Evans, chairman of the Metro board, was enthusiastic about the proposal, hailing it as an accomplishment for an agency whose reputation officials have worked to repair since the January 2015 L'Enfant Plaza smoke calamity that killed 61-year-old Carol Glover and sickened scores of others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Essentially what we're saying is, 'If a ride takes you 15 minutes longer than it should have, you get your money back.' That's extraordinary — Metro's never done anything like that before, Evans said. I think this is a reflection of the progress we've made in the last two years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But riders who complain of persistent slowdowns, offloads and unexpected track disruptions may be surprised by the proportion of trips that would be refund-eligible under the program. In a four-month span from July through October, 285,296 Metro trips saw delays of 15 minutes or more, accounting for about 0.5 percent of trips overall during that period, according to the agency. Furthermore, customers must be using registered ­SmarTrip cards to receive a refund credit, cutting the pool of refund-eligible customers in half.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If we're still making progress and we can come forward and say that we're at 90 percent of our trains on time now, then maybe 10 minutes would make sense instead of 15, Evans said. Right now, 15's a good benchmark.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Despite the limited scale of the program, this past Wednesday's hectic evening commute serves as an illustration of how it could benefit scores of aggrieved riders. During the afternoon commute, a cracked rail resulted in single-tracking on the Blue and Orange lines, and truncated service on the Silver Line. Platforms were jammed with customers who endured extended waits, and some turned to alternatives such as Uber and Lyft.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said 3.48 percent of trips during the Wednesday afternoon peak period were delayed 15 or more minutes, which would have made 7,405 trips eligible for refunds if the Rush-Hour Promise were in effect.

{"original": "Here's how it would work: Customers traveling between two stations would be assessed a MyTripTime duration estimate. Those who fall 15 or more minutes outside the estimated trip window would get the full fare, between $2.25 and $6, credited to their SmarTrip cards. Unlike rail customers who would receive refunds automatically, bus riders would have to fill out an online form to request the $2 fare.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If the program is approved, Wiedefeld's staff will be authorized to develop terms and conditions — including measures to ensure people don't abuse the system.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Metro said refund-eligible ­cases include medical emergencies, police investigations, arcing incidents, smoke and fire, and other unplanned disruptions such as emergency track work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But major capital projects, such as the upcoming crossover replacement that will close the Yellow Line's Huntington and Eisenhower Avenue stations in May, wouldn't be eligible for refunds.

{"original": "And traffic congestion, the common cause of bus slowdowns, is not a refund-eligible factor: Rather, the program accommodates for late dispatches and mechanical breakdowns.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's the second time in recent years that Metro has turned its attention to fares amid customer concerns about service. In July 2016, the agency implemented a 15-minute grace period allowing riders to enter and exit the same station without being charged as a way to remove penalties for those who might glance up at the wait times and change their minds. From July 2016 through June 2017, Stessel said, the agency issued about 625,000 grace-period credits, totaling about $1.13 million.", "augmented": []}

In late February 2017, after spending most of the offseason lukewarm on catcher Matt Wieters, they suddenly signed him, too.

The Nationals have checked on the asking price for nearly every late-inning type this winter, securing one in Kintzler, though they could use another. They have three proven relievers and are already over the CBT threshold for a second consecutive year, which could reduce their incentive to engage in a bidding war with other contenders for Holland's services.

As we stood together and prayed over the flag-draped coffin bearing Officer Owens's remains, and as we tried to comfort his grieving family, I could see the impact on the president. I wondered if it was then that he felt the weight of the office — and the consequences of his words and actions — on his shoulders. One of those recent actions was to block refugees from coming to our country, and I saw firsthand the devastating consequence of that ignorant decision.

Where and when in your life do you need and want to be in contact? says Eric Litman, who runs the Wireless Outpost Web site http://www.wirelessoutpost.com and a series of mailing lists for wireless users. Who am I going to contact? Do I spend a lot of time in one area? In short, how often will you be away from your regular home and work phones, and how often will you call other people at those times?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If the answers are not often – say, if you have a short commute – you should probably stick to carrying enough change around for pay phones or simply (gasp!) not being reachable at times. After all, getting a wireless phone doesn't just mean getting yet another new toy to haul around, it also means yet another monthly bill you can forget to put in the mail. If you do want a wireless phone, the next step is to pick a system to subscribe to. Consumers in the D.C. area have seven choices: AT&T Digital PCS, Bell Atlantic Mobile's digital and analog services, Cellular One's digital and analog services, Sprint PCS and Sprint Spectrum. (An eighth option, Nextel http://www.nextel.com, is a digital service marketed toward businessfolk, with monthly price plans that start at $40, higher than the other seven services profiled here.) We profile these seven options in the charts that appear below, listing rates, coverage areas, estimates of monthly costs under various calling patterns and our reviewers' impressions. Of those seven wireless choices, all but two – the Bell Atlantic and Cellular One analog systems – offer all-digital or primarily digital connections. All of them work in basically the same way: A network of antennas, each from 75 to 250 feet high and no more than a few miles apart from a counterpart, transmits phone signals. When you move from one antenna's cell to the next, the wireless network observes that and seamlessly hands you off to the next antenna.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All of them also share the two basic advantages of wireless service over landline phones: an enormous local-calling-rate area that stretches from West Virginia to the Atlantic Ocean and no extra charges for things like caller ID and call waiting. But while the analog systems basically reproduce the patterns of the human voice as radio waves, the digital systems encode sound as a series of ones and zeroes, in much the same way a compact disc stores music. (You'll also hear the abbreviation PCS, short for Personal Communications Service, used to describe digital services; it simply refers to a subset of digital cellular that uses a different frequency – 1900 MHz – than the 800 MHz transmissions of traditional cellular service. There's no significant difference between it and non-PCS digital cellular.) The five digital wireless systems, all relative newcomers to the D.C. area, are the ones you're most likely to hear about, thanks to digital's unchallenged status as the hot buzzword in wireless advertising. But put that hype on hold; not all of digital's alleged advantages show up in everyday use. Consider: Sound quality. People like to claim digital is the way to go if you want to fool people into thinking you're calling from a landline phone. Not so. We found that, even under good conditions, digital systems often gave a telltale wispy tone to voices. Under bad conditions, the digital systems sounded more like lousy RealAudio downloads, with frequent, brief drop-outs and a harsh, metallic tone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My experience with digital is that when it's great, it's great; when it's bad, it's terrible, said Mark Lowenstein, an analyst with the Yankee Group, a Boston-based market research firm. Once a digital signal gets weak, you really fall off a cliff. Another thing to keep in mind before obsessing about voice quality is that, unless you plan to use a wireless phone in a soundproof room, any minor sound glitches will be drowned out by the noises around you – traffic, pedestrians and whatnot. Security. Analog phones have traditionally been vulnerable to cloning – theft of service by people who pick off a cell phone's number and subscriber data over the air – while digital phones lack this weakness. But many cellular providers have improved their own security with various authentication mechanisms, drastically reducing the incidence of cloning, according to Herschel Shosteck, president of a wireless-industry market research firm in Wheaton. Privacy. Newt Gingrich found this out the hard way: Anybody with a radio scanner can eavesdrop on analog cellular conversations. But tune that scanner to a digital phone's transmission, and all you'll hear is the stream of ones and zeroes that makes up a digital signal. This is a real improvement. But consider this: Do you have a problem using an equally vulnerable analog cordless phone at home? Many people don't. Extra features. Digital phones can receive text messages, act as pagers and even receive news updates or weather forecasts, things that are difficult, if not impossible, to do with analog phones.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But many of these functions also cost extra. Battery life. This is the one area where digital does wipe out analog, thanks to the ability of a digital phone's network to put it in a sleep mode and then wake it up for an incoming call. Where an analog phone may need to be recharged nightly, a digital phone can go for up to several days on a single charge. The other big issue in choosing between analog and digital is pricing. For light use, analog is often cheaper, but once you get into moderate-to-heavy use, digital becomes more cost-effective. Finally, analog phones work virtually everywhere, while digital phones often go dead once you wander too far beyond the Beltway or off the local Interstates. That's why almost all digital services today come with an analog backup network (for which you need to buy a dual-mode or dual-band phone that works on both networks). If you're on a hybrid system, watch out for hard handoffs, in which the digital signal conks out before an analog signal can kick in. Here's our recommendation: If you just want a phone to keep around for safety and security purposes – in case your car breaks down, to call 911 in an emergency or to phone ahead to say you're running late for your own wedding – get an analog service. The phone will probably cost next to nothing and work essentially everywhere.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But if you plan to use a wireless phone for two or more hours a month, it's hard to beat digital, if for no other reason than that the phone will spend less time chained to the nearest electrical outlet. But prepare to be unimpressed by the voice quality and realize that you'll probably have to rely on a digital service's analog backup for some time to come, especially if you head out into the countryside. Building a wireless network is an expensive, time-consuming task; each antenna that goes up requires approval by multiple government bodies, from county zoning boards to the Federal Aviation Administration. And – this one applies to both digital and analog systems—even when you think you should be able to get a signal, if too many people are already using the system, you'll be kept off the air. Fortunately, picking a handset is easier than choosing a wireless provider, as long as you focus on the basics, starting with battery life and size. With a digital phone, you'll want to be able to carry it around for at least three or so days between charges; you can also buy extra-life batteries, but they add bulk and weight to the phone. Smaller phones are easier to take everywhere, but can be more difficult to hold. Ease of use comes next.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The best innovation we've seen in this department is the jog dial feature on some Sony and Qualcomm phones, which lets you spin a little thumbwheel to cycle through functions and stored numbers, then press it in to select an option or a number – something that takes much more time if you have to hit a menu button, then toggle up, down and ok buttons. The Wireless Dimension Web site http://www.wirelessdimension.com offers more advice on phone shopping. Finally, if you're going to subscribe to a digital/analog hybrid system, get a phone that works both ways unless you're sure you'll never leave the system's digital service area.

Sure, he's been savvy enough not to commit to single-payer health care and to point out that abolishing ICE is akin to rearranging the chairs on the Titanic (since the job has to be done by some entity). However, those who try to paint him as out of step with the party should look back at the 2018 midterms, when moderates won all around the country.

He's dishonest, that's why the president called him 'lying Ted,' and that's why the nickname stuck, it's true, he said about Cruz at one point.

In other words, tax cuts are easy because everyone is a winner, but tax reform is hard because there are losers. Still, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan thinks it's worth it since tax reform would let them cut rates lower and for longer than they otherwise could.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That second part is the most important. Republicans, you see, are only allowed to pass a tax cut with a simple Senate majority—which is all they're going to have—as long as it doesn't add to the deficit after 10 years. That's why the Bush tax cuts came included with an expiration date. So, as New York's Jonathan Chait explains in detail, if Republicans don't want their new tax cuts to come with a similar self-destruct, they'll have to come up with a way to pay for them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Or, more accurately, appear to do so according to our budget rules. Although when we're talking about a $3 trillion tax cut like the one Republicans have proposed, 99.6 percent of which would go to the top 1 percent of households, even the most aggressive gimmicks wouldn't cover all the costs. Only about 50 percent of them. Here's how. When Republicans say that their tax plan wouldn't lose any revenue, the question is compared to what. And the answer, at least the one they want, is a world without any Obamacare taxes. Think about it like this. If you got rid of Obamacare's $1.2 trillion worth of taxes before you did tax reform, that'd be $1.2 trillion less you'd need to come up with for your plan to be revenue neutral. And voilà, your $3 trillion tax cut would only look like a $1.8 trillion tax cut. (Ain't Washington grand: one tax cut would make another look more affordable). Add in Republicans' favorite assumption that tax cuts would in part pay for themselves—and you're about halfway to home to paying for your tax cuts without actually paying for anything.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There's a hitch, though. Even after seven years, Republicans are still struggling to come up with the replace part of repeal and replace. Their healthcare plans would probably only make the things people don't like about Obamacare—high deductibles and narrow networks—worse without covering as many people. So instead, to paraphrase the President, they've said that they have something vague and terrific that's also terrific and vague coming any minute now. Even Godot didn't make people wait this long. But the point is that, unlike a few months ago, Republicans aren't willing to rush ahead with repealing Obamacare and the taxes that pay for it unless they have a real replacement on tap. They'd rather tell everyone how great their imaginary plan is than have everyone tell them how much they hate their actual one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Not that it matters as far as tax reform is concerned. That's because Republicans aren't any closer to coming to terms on the rest of their plan either. The centerpiece of that is supposed to be what's known as a border-adjustment tax. Put simply, it would start taxing imported goods but not exported ones as part of a greater overhaul of the corporate tax system to tax domestic consumption rather than global profits. Now, economic theory tell us that this should send the dollar up enough that importers wouldn't be any worse off than they are now. But CEOs aren't willing to gamble their stock prices (or their bonuses, for that matter) on economic theory, no matter how well-grounded it might be. So every company that depends on imported goods, which is to say every retailer from Walmart on down, is lobbying hard against this tax—a tax, mind you, that Republicans are counting on to raise a trillion dollars over 10 years. Indeed, there are already enough Republican senators against it that the border-adjustment tax might not even be dead-on-arrival. It might be so dead that it never arrives. It's border adjustment tax or bust.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So it might just be bust. That's what happens when you can't agree on your real or fake pay-fors.

He spoke without a note in front of him and gave one of the most stirring speeches I've heard, Axelrod told the South Bend Tribune. He has that gift. Axelrod has given Buttigieg the same advice he gave Obama after his famous Democratic National Convention keynote speech in 2004: The biggest mistake politicians make is missing their moment by hesitating.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When Buttigieg decided to undertake the DNC race in 2017 — gambling that if he couldn't knock off Keith Ellison and Tom Perez, the favorites of the Sanders and Clinton camps, he could at least give his future a rocket-boost and once again win by losing — he debated circles around the two front-runners, and charmed cable-news viewers and grizzled party elders with his unexpected eloquence and fresh vision for the party, which included a bundle of bright ideas for digital strategies. Right before the vote, headed for a third-place finish, he bowed out and returned to South Bend with enough new backers to form a super PAC that would give him an excuse to travel the country in 2018 and lay the groundwork for 2020.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He might very well have won the DNC race if you could have had a secret ballot, says Howard Dean, who endorsed Buttigieg for his old job. But it's such an insider race. … That was hard to overcome. Dean, who has spoken with Buttigieg about his own experience vaulting from obscurity to the top of the 2004 Democratic primaries, sees a lot of Obama­esque qualities in the mayor. He has a magnetism about him, he says. And I think he projects this idea of, 'Let's get past all this partisan crap and do something for the country for a change.' I think his age is an advantage. I really think the American people would like to see our generation step aside and see a new generation take leadership.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "According to Buttigieg's husband, Chasten Buttigieg, there's another Obama parallel that most people wouldn't guess from Pete's genial retail politicking and smooth style on the stump: He's definitely an introvert. And he's still coming out of some of his shells. That's something he's learned in part from Chasten, who does improv comedy on the side and maintains a busy Twitter feed that can be flat-out hilarious. When we go out, we'll go to events and then I'd want to keep going out to a bar for a beer, Chasten says. And he'll be wanting to go home and curl up with a book.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "While Buttigieg frames his sexual orientation as part of his next-generation appeal, he finds it uncomfortable to talk about why it took him so long — until he was 33, and back from Afghanistan — to accept the plain fact that I'm gay. When he spoke to Axelrod for his podcast, The Axe Files, in March 2017, his silver tongue abandoned him as he tried to explain. If willpower alone could make somebody straight, you know … I would've —. He didn't complete the thought but acknowledged that his struggle had something to do with his political aspirations and his desire to serve in the military while don't ask, don't tell was still in effect.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But once he finally abandoned the struggle, Buttigieg was characteristically all in. He came out in the South Bend Tribune during his mayoral reelection campaign, soon after then-Gov. Mike Pence signed his infamously anti-gay Religious Freedom Restoration Act. And in short order he met Chasten online and quickly fell in love. When the two wed in June 2018, they timed it for Pride Week. The ceremony was live-streamed on YouTube — and afterward, the couple joined revelers at a Pride block party, with a New York Times reporter in tow.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Still, Buttigieg doesn't much care for being identified primarily as the first gay anything. Millennials are supposed to be obsessed with identity politics, but Buttigieg thinks that Democrats make a serious mistake when they slice-and-dice their message to appeal to particular identities. Along the way, the party fell into this pattern of thinking we should have a message for each constituency, he says. But the reality is that people care about issues that aren't 'their' issues, quote unquote. Elderly residents care about education. Suburban women care about racial justice. Young people care about social programs for the elderly.", "augmented": []}

Sometimes you can watch people as you go up to the podium and they're like, 'What's the deal with this guy?' And then it's, 'Okay, he's up there, he can talk.' If it's going right, I love to watch the faces then: Partly I like to study them to see what's working and not, what to cut out next time or maybe expand.

It's very important for people in communities like mine to know there's a formula for moving forward that isn't resentment, that isn't nostalgia, he says, recounting his first campaign for mayor. We didn't go around saying we're going to make South Bend great again. The folks laugh heartily at the implicit dig at Trump. I didn't go around thumping my chest saying I alone can fix it.

But they don't seem to know that you're not free if you can't change jobs because you'll lose your health care. And that you're not free if you can't sue a credit-card company that's ripping you off.

Buttigieg plays it off laughingly, saying he's so much more impressed with her now, since in our legislature back home, four bills for a Democrat would be quite a feat, and hands over the mic to the candidate, who smiles a bit warily, looking like she knows she's been upstaged.", "augmented": []}

When it comes to filling the position of ambassador to the United Nations, Romney should vote against Heather Nauert, who lacks diplomatic experience.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Romney hits the mark by decrying Trump's departure from our enduring commitment to principled conduct in foreign relations, and to the rights of all people to freedom and equal justice. He explains, The world needs American leadership, and it is in America's interest to provide it. A world led by authoritarian regimes is a world — and an America — with less prosperity, less freedom, less peace. That should mean voting for tough sanctions on Saudi Arabia and ending arms sales that facilitate the Saudis' gruesome war in Yemen. Romney must also press for Trump to stick by commitments to finish off the Islamic State and protect the Kurds in Syria. If he wants stable relationships with the nations of Asia that strengthen our mutual security and prosperity, he should be pressing Trump to reconsider his withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and stop slobbering over Kim Jong Un, who has shown no sign that he actually will denuclearize.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Romney criticizes Trump and other Republicans for wrecking our fiscal foundation. That should mean nixing ridiculous spending boondoggles like the wall on the southern border and reexamining the Trump tax cuts that spewed more red ink. Of course, it means reopening the government as soon as possible (What's the excuse for voting against the clean continuing resolution the Senate previously passed) and ending Trump's trade wars by reclaiming Congress's tariff power.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Finally, Romney is eloquent on the need for Trump to demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity, and elevate the national discourse with comity and mutual respect and to defend our vital institutions despite their inevitable failings: a free press, the rule of law, strong churches, and responsible corporations and unions. That means ending corruption by voting to end Trump's receipt of foreign emoluments, passing legislation and extracting promises from the attorney general nominee to prevent improper political meddling by the White House in criminal investigations, pressing for resignation or impeachment if Trump has obstructed justice and/or captured the presidency by defrauding voters about payments to ex-paramours and business dealings with Russia through the 2016 presidential campaign.", "augmented": []}

Biden's administration should be able to significantly roll back the massive tax cuts that President Donald Trump and his allies engineered and, in so doing, help address the searing economic injustices that have accompanied rampant wealth and income inequality in the U.S.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Biden has also advocated expanding access to Medicaid and affordable health care, beefing up unemployment insurance and creating a national jobs corps. He wants to offer more federal support to entrepreneurs, promote clean energy, rebuild the nation's infrastructure and enhance the economic relief measures that were initiated with the CARES Act last spring and extended modestly since then.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All of this is being considered amid a pandemic that has exposed Trump's White House as inept and dangerously disengaged, tested the wherewithal of state and local leadership, and strained the resolve of average Americans. But Covid-19 also affords Biden an opportunity to demonstrate how the federal government can promote economic progress and healing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "An effective Covid-19 relief package can't be an exotic Band-Aid. It needs to do more than support the economy for weeks or months. It should help lay the foundations for profitable and productive companies and a more prosperous workforce. This will require considerable investment in high-quality education, infrastructure and public health, and a more expansive safety net for vulnerable Americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If Biden is serious about creating a national jobs corps, then the federal government should hire every unemployed American at a living wage of, say, $58,000 a year. This would cost roughly $1.1 trillion annually — far more than either political party has offered — but it's an amount that the government could absorb and manage. It also would greatly reduce the inefficiencies, squabbles and fraud surrounding the various unemployment and income-assistance programs that have been doled out over the past several months.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Biden should also reposition the Department of Homeland Security to help address government weaknesses that Covid-19 has exposed. Biden could empower DHS to coordinate the initiatives of several federal agencies — including the departments of Treasury, Transportation, Health and Human Services, Labor and Education — to bolster preparedness in public health, workplace safety, infrastructure and other key areas. DHS could also coordinate federal investments to create a national network of public hospitals and medical clinics, enhance public transportation, and provide digital access in low-income urban and rural areas.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Investment in infrastructure, in particular, would be a huge boon to the U.S. economy. It's no secret that the country's roads, bridges and public transportation are crumbling, so that's an obvious place to start. But stopping there would be a mistake. Infrastructure plays a crucial role in two of the country's biggest challenges: winning the fight against climate change and delivering economic prosperity to all Americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Any serious attempt to tackle climate change will require a meaningful reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, roughly a third of which is generated by transportation. As early as 2016, research showed that most gas-guzzlers could be replaced with low-cost electric cars available at the time, which would significantly reduce emissions, even accounting for greater consumption of electricity. The Biden administration can promote and expedite electric-car adoption by building a network of charging stations alongside existing gas stations, eventually replacing them altogether.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But perhaps the most important infrastructure investment resides in the digital realm. Covid-19 has accelerated a trend that has been underway for years: moving work, schooling, shopping and entertainment online. All this requires fast, reliable and affordable broadband service, which is in short supply outside of homes and offices.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's a problem for an economy heavily dependent on the internet. But it can be solved by building a national broadband system akin to the national highway system that the federal government created in the 1950s. The new highways allowed labor, goods and people to move more cheaply and easily around the country, paving the way for business expansion, investment and job creation that benefited companies, workers and the broader economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A national system of free and reliable broadband would have widespread benefits. It would enable businesses to reach more consumers, educational resources to reach more Americans, and employers to reach a greater pool of workers — boosting the economy and making the U.S. more competitive. It's hard to imagine a more worthwhile investment of taxpayer dollars.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Biden's economic policy priorities should be aimed at three fundamental goals: ensuring that all Americans maintain an adequate standard of living until the Covid-19 crisis ends; backstopping essential public and private services; and equipping the economy and workers to be productive, innovative and competitive through the end of the century.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As Biden builds a legislative coalition on Capitol Hill to support his agenda, he must also sell it to the American public. This is where the president-elect's decades of public service and his understanding of the federal machinery will come into play. Georgia has handed Biden the opportunity to set the U.S. economy on a more sure-footed path, and he should seize it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "This is a smart emergency policy that avoids blanket student loan forgiveness, said Lindsey Burke, director of the Heritage Foundation's Center for Education Policy.

Payments made by the agency would still count toward loan forgiveness for borrowers in public service jobs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There's little question that, barring an unforeseen negative shock, all this presidential bragging will, to some extent, help the incumbent. The economy will be a tail wind for Trump's reelection. That tail wind may be somewhat weaker than is usually the case, but his sails will have economic wind in them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But how justified is that? Presidents always have and always will get credit for good economies and blame for bad ones. Should they?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In many cases, including Trump's, presidents ride trends they inherited. If those trends change for the better, as with Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, they get credit (sometimes deservedly, as per their anti-recessionary interventions). If they worsen, as with George H.W. Bush, they get blamed. What makes Trump unusual is not that he's riding favorable trends that predated him, nor that he's claiming credit for them. It's that he lies about them, claiming that the economy was awful until he saved it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A typical Trumpian refrain maintains, totally against the facts, that when he took office, America was stuck in a failed recovery and saddled with a bleak economic future. In Davos, Switzerland, last month, Trump falsely claimed that the economy he inherited was in a rather dismal state. He claims to have accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're willing to abuse the data, it is not difficult to perpetrate this falsehood. A recent analysis by the president's economic advisers argued that Under the Trump Administration, net worth for the bottom 50 percent of households has increased at an annual rate 15 times higher than the average growth seen under the three prior administrations' expansion periods. The analysis shows a (truly impressive) 15 percent annualized growth rate for real net worth over the first three years of Trump's term (to be precise, data exist for 11 quarters) vs. 1 percent for prior administrations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The key omitted fact is that this was precisely the growth rate when Trump took office. If we back this indicator up over the final three years of Obama's presidency, the growth rate is exactly the same: 15 percent, annualized. That's solid evidence of trend-riding. (Full disclosure: I was Vice President Joe Biden's economic adviser through 2011.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If we do the same exercise for the decline in unemployment and the growth in jobs — compare the past three years with the previous three years — we see that unemployment fell less quickly under Trump than it did under Obama (down one point under Trump and two points under Obama). Job growth under these comparable periods was faster under Obama than Trump (up 6 vs. 5 percent).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To be clear, that's not a slap at Trump's jobs record. Much as you gradually pour more slowly when filling a glass to the brim, as the job market closes in on full capacity, gains decelerate. But on these and many other indicators, it is factually uncontestable that Trump is riding inherited trends.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There are also soft spots in the economy that could translate more into political head winds than tail winds. Even after the tax cuts, business investment has been unusually weak over the past couple of years, declining in real terms for the past nine months, the worst such streak since the last recession. Though the most recent data hint of a potential rebound, the manufacturing sector contracted for much of 2019. Factory employment averaged 4,000 per month last year compared with 22,000 per month in 2018. A particularly disturbing new trend is the decline in health coverage among the uninsured. Importantly for this analysis, Trump's fingerprints are on these outcomes, as they are widely associated with the uncertainty invoked by his trade war and his attack on the Affordable Care Act.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Blowing the other way, two trends at opposite ends of the income/wealth scale have accelerated since 2016: the stock market and the pay of low-wage earners. The former is probably a function of high corporate profitability, and especially since so few middle- and low-income households hold much stock at all, that fuels the inequality arguments made by Trump's opponents.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The faster growth in real pay of low-wage earners provides an important example of what happens when low unemployment is sustained and minimum wages go up. This may help the president, but even with these gains, there's still a large gap between what people make and what they need, a gap that's closed in part by safety-net programs that the administration is trying to dismantle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How all of this translates into votes in an election that's still months away is anyone's guess. One recent poll shows an uptick in Trump's economic approval by independent voters, but the president's overall approval rating has always been much lower than historical economic correlations would predict. As political scientist Peter K. Enns recently put it: The fact that we're not seeing a corresponding uptick in presidential approval, that shows that the question of whether the economy will be less of a factor than in typical elections is still very much an open question.", "augmented": []}

Under the agreement, employers would be required to provide 14 days of paid sick leave at not less than two-thirds their regular rate. They would qualify for the benefit if they are sick and have to be quarantined or treated for coronavirus, or if they have to leave their jobs to take care of a family member who has coronavirus. Workers would also be eligible for paid sick leave if they have to stay home because they have a child whose school or childcare facility has closed due to the coronavirus.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Believe it or not, this is the least important thing that we are talking about, but politically this might be the most important to talk about, Trump said, a statement that would have been news to his supporters.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump's call with Australia's then-prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was also focused almost exclusively on Trump minding his personal politics. The call quickly broke down over an agreement the Obama administration had reached to accept more than 1,000 refugees from islands off the coast of Australia. Trump's objection seemed to be less to the terms than how it could make him — a man who campaigned against accepting refugees — look.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This is going to kill me, Trump said. I am the world's greatest person that does not want to let people into the country. And now I am agreeing to take 2,000 people. And I agree I can vet them, but that puts me in a bad position. It makes me look so bad, and I have only been here a week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump's overriding personal concern was also what landed him in hot water over the Ukraine call, given that he used it to pressure Zelensky to investigate issues pertaining to Joe Biden — a request that even Republicans who voted against removing Trump from office said was wrong.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Georgia call is most notable for this same reason. It features Trump trying to massage the details to benefit himself personally. At one point he even implores Raffensperger to find just enough votes — 11,780 — to overturn the result in the state. This is not the request of a president earnestly seeking out voter fraud; it's the request of someone just trying to obtain a certain outcome by whatever means necessary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state, Trump said, adding at another point: I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump referenced that number of votes no fewer than 18 times on the call.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another feature of these calls has been Trump's utter lack of familiarity with the details of the situations he's trying to arrest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In Georgia, as Philip Bump notes, Trump flubbed many of the details and pushed several debunked conspiracy theories that Raffensperger and a top aide rebutted in real time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On the Ukraine call, Trump also ran headlong into unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, most notably that Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor to help his son — an allegation for which there is no real evidence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump also failed to grasp the true nature of the refugee agreement on his call with Turnbull. He asked whether it was something that President Barack Obama had agreed to (which it was), and he repeatedly suggested that the number of refugees in the agreement was higher than it was. When Trump suggested it was 2,000 and Turnbull corrected him that it was lower, Trump then responded, I have also heard like 5,000 as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another feature of the calls has been denigration. Trump speaks dismissively about others with the kind of freedom you might expect in a private phone call but you wouldn't expect in any context in diplomacy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "During his call with Peña Nieto, Trump notably referred to the swing state of New Hampshire as a drug-infested den.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On his call with Zelensky, he bad-mouthed German Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying: Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk, and I think it's something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn't do anything.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And on his call with Raffensperger, Trump bad-mouthed Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), despite Kemp and Raffensperger being allies. If I didn't run, Brian wouldn't have had even a shot, either in the general or in the primary, Trump said, though Trump ran in 2016 and Kemp won the governorship in 2018. He was dead, dead as a doornail. … What a schmuck I was.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That last one also falls in line with a feature of Trump's calls with foreign leaders: Stories — often embellished ones — of his own electoral fortitude.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In the latest election, I won with a large percentage of Hispanic voters, Trump told Peña Nieto. I do not know if you heard, but with Cuba, I had 84 percent, with the Cuban American vote. But overall generally, I had well over 30 percent, and everyone was shocked to see this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He added later: We lost a lot of factories in Ohio and Michigan, and I won these states — some of these states have not been won in 38 years by a Republican, and I won them very easily. No states fit that description.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He told Turnbull of the refugee deal: Look, I do not know how you got them to sign a deal like this, but that is how they lost the election. They said I had no way to 270 [electoral votes], and I got 306.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This is, of course, a mainstay of Trump's public commentary as well, but the fact that he sees fit to insert it into diplomatic conversations with fellow leaders to apparently attempt to impress them is striking. That's especially the case given the narrowness of Trump's 2016 win, which included a popular-vote loss, all of which would have been no secret to the foreign leaders. But as always, Trump needs to hyperbolize his own political capital.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The last — and perhaps overriding feature — of these Trump calls is the often incoherent mixture of flattery, threat and bargaining.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump's call with Peña Nieto, for instance, included a threat of a border tax — something Peña Nieto noted had not been the subject of discussions between aides. But Trump at other points pleaded with Peña Nieto to soften his tone on not paying for the border wall. And toward the end, Trump said, It is you and I against the world, Enrique, do not forget — a marked contrast with Trump's tough campaign-trail rhetoric about Mexico and illegal immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The call with Turnbull turned negative rather quickly. But before Trump abruptly ended the conversation, he had suggested he would accept the refugee deal: Okay, this shows me to be a dope. I am not like this but, if I have to do it, I will do it, but I do not like this at all.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This Trump-call characteristic is perhaps most striking in the Raffensperger call, though. The background is that Raffensperger has been among the most vocal state GOP officials pushing back on Trump's claims — almost without fail — and it has quite possibly cost him his political career. Yet Trump tried frequently on the call to flatter him as if he could be sweet-talked into going along with the ploy, saying that you would be respected, really respected, if this can be straightened out before the election.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But he also threatened Raffensperger with an unspecified criminal investigation. That's a criminal offense, Trump said. And you can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The thing about the contrasting messages of flattery and punishment is that they often didn't follow any coherent line of argument. It would make sense to flatter to try to get what you want and then revert to threats if that didn't work. But Trump's approach in these cases wasn't focused on either and seemed to oscillate between the two.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), an on-again, off-again Trump foe who organized a group willing to stand athwart the inevitable during the Jan. 6 certification, received a tweet of approval.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This isn't what Cruz's lawyerly statement actually said, nor is it what he said during the appearance on Fox News that apparently inspired the tweet. Instead, he touted the unprecedented allegations of fraud, most of which stem from Trump. But such nuances are secondary to both parties. Trump got to tout an ally in his fight and Cruz got Trump's approval — even as he preserved the long-term deniability that his comments have been carefully intended to maintain.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's hard not to read this specific fight over the election results as being a sort of jury deliberation on Trump's role within Republican politics. The tension between efforts by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to limit Senate objections to the presidential election results and by senators such as Cruz who are eager to appeal to Trump's enthusiastic base has led to various examinations of where the power center of the party will land after Jan. 20.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But this is largely missing the forest for the trees. The story of the Republican Party for at least the past 12 years has been one of tension between a political establishment and a wild fringe. That tension has repeatedly spurred the establishment to try to appease or co-opt the fringe. But instead of folding into the party, the fringe keeps moving further out. That is the tension of the moment: How will a fringe empowered and reinforced by the Trump presidency coexist with a Republican Party eager to move back toward reality?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Three things happened in 2008 that shocked the Republican system. The first was that the presidency of George W. Bush was increasingly seen as a failure, even by many Republicans. By early October of that year, his approval among members of his party was under 60 percent in Gallup polling, a staggeringly low figure by recent standards. That was in part due to the downturn that was still burning through the economy, a downturn that destabilized the sense of security of even the most financially stable Americans. Those two things contributed to the election of Barack Obama, a manifestation of another cultural change in the country: the decreasing dominance of Whites.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Before Obama won, though, he was the target of baseless allegations that he had not been born in the United States and, therefore, was ineligible to hold the office of president. This wasn't true, but it was politically potent. The assertion wasn't limited to conservative circles; during his hard-fought Democratic primary victory over Hillary Clinton, even some Democrats elevated the claims. But the claims were heavily centered on right-wing websites that were finding new audiences with the emergence of social media. Rumors that spread over email spread more slowly than ones dropped into Facebook and Twitter (as the founder of Snopes explained to The Washington Post in 2015). Write up a blog post claiming evidence of Obama's ineligibility and tweet it out and suddenly you can propel the misinformation everywhere — and make a decent bit of cash from new visitors to your website.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As the 2008 election approached, it was clear that there was an enormous amount of energy to the political right of the GOP establishment, energy often concentrated in these theories. The party's nominee, John McCain, made one of the first overt efforts to appease those voters, selecting Sarah Palin as his running mate largely on the strength of her credibility with those skeptical of the establishment. His candidacy was doomed, though, and Palin didn't do much to help.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "From nearly the moment Obama took office, he became a lightning rod for the conservative fringe. Part of it was situational: Inheriting the crumbled economy meant needing to make broad investments to bolster employers and workers. Obama was painted as a socialist for doing so, a charge that itself leveraged a sense from some on the right that he was an other, given his family background and life story.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The tea party movement, which emerged soon after Obama took office, was a manifestation of those overlapping concerns. Ostensibly centered on government spending (and centered on that concern by conservative activists), the movement was also intertwined with concerns about the declining power of White America and immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many Republican candidates recognized the value of appealing to the fervent base of tea party supporters and did so overtly. The movement introduced candidates of its own, often pulled from the mistier fringes of conservative thought. The establishment pushed back hard, working to undercut primary challenges from tea-party-spawned candidates. Sometimes it worked; often it didn't. The energy among Republican voters for candidates espousing hard-line tea party positions propelled several to surprising primary wins — but then to general-election losses, as the establishment had feared.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That energy continued to be powered by conservative media. Fox News leaned into the tea party movement, being described by one research team as a national advocacy organization actively fostering a social protest identity. Further from the political center of the party were sites such as Breitbart, which not only generated enthusiasm for the movement but encouraged speculation about Obama's ancestry.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Republican leaders tried to appease the tea partyers to leverage the energy. A number of policy concessions emerged. The party shifted to the right. But the enthusiasm for the tea party movement was driven heavily by opposition to Obama and a changing America, and the elevation of various policy issues as central concerns was often secondary. Put another way, there was no appeasing those for whom the fight itself was often the desired goal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What's often underrecognized about Trump's emergence in national politics is that he was the best-known figure willing to fully immerse himself in those fights encouraged in far-right media. He flirted with a 2012 presidential run by leaning into birtherism, building a foothold with sketchier conservative media outlets by doing so.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "His embrace of birtherism didn't prevent an embrace from more-mainstream conservative outlets, though. He first publicly questioned Obama's birthplace in March 2011; at the end of that month, Fox News announced that he would be contributing weekly to its morning flagship program, Fox & Friends. That gig lasted until he announced his presidential candidacy in June 2015.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump's strategy wasn't complicated. He watched Fox News and read sites such as Breitbart and reiterated the questions and concerns he saw there. When violence in Central America led to a surge of young immigrants at the border with Mexico, Trump echoed conservative media in seizing on immigration as an issue. When several people infected with Ebola traveled to the United States shortly before the 2014 midterm elections, Trump, like Fox News and Breitbart, obsessed over it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, he was praised by supporters for his directness and honesty. What that meant, to a large degree, was that he was saying things that they were hearing on Fox News and in far-right media — things that other candidates wouldn't say often because they were believed to be prohibitive when seeking elected office. Trump said Fox things to a Fox audience, and a chunk of the audience coalesced around him once his comments about immigration prompted enough of a cultural fight to break through the noise. This relatively small core was a lot in a crowded primary field, and Trump quickly emerged as the Republican front-runner.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "After spending months thinking that Trump's support would collapse and a desperate few weeks in early 2016 trying to ensure that it did, the Republican establishment was forced to work with Trump. Over the course of the 2016 campaign, though, there was a broad assumption that he would lose and the party would need to rebuild.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The establishment had come to a similar conclusion in 2012 when Mitt Romney lost, deciding that, among other things, it needed to expand its base to include more non-White voters, perhaps by moving away from a hard line on immigration. (Even Sean Hannity embraced the idea when the political winds blew in that direction.) But it didn't need to make such a move to win in 2016. Instead, Trump's candidacy reinforced cultural and racial politics far more openly than those of past Republicans, helping stoke the energy of Republican voters. Against an unpopular Democratic opponent that year, his fervent base proved to be large enough in enough states to win him the White House.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Again, that base was powered by far-right media and misinformation. An influential study from Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society found that Breitbart was the most popular media outlet on the political right during the 18 months leading up to the presidential election. A few months before the election, Breitbart and the Trump campaign effectively merged, with the website's chairman, Stephen K. Bannon — who had once described the site as virulently anti-establishment — becoming the chief executive of the campaign itself.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Once he became president, Trump and the party similarly merged. As with the tea party movement, Trump's focus was never policy but, instead, fringe cultural fights. This suited the establishment fairly well: By letting Trump have his incendiary public persona, the GOP got hundreds of new conservative judges, three Supreme Court justices and a massive tax-cut package. It meant a lot of looking the other way at Trump's behavior and broad refusals to call out dishonesty and controversial comments, but for much of his term, it worked on a political level.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As the 2020 election approached, this alliance held. Trump's repeated attacks on the mail-in voting process and his refusals to say he would concede peacefully should he lose were met with shrugs. The 2018 elections were largely a rout for the Democrats thanks to Trump's unpopularity and, clearly, because many 2016 Trump voters stayed home with him not on the ballot. But being close to Trump wasn't itself necessarily disqualifying in that environment: Trump allies such as Ron DeSantis in Florida and Brian Kemp in Georgia won close gubernatorial races. So even as it seemed clear Trump would lose his reelection bid, most Republicans stuck with him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Then he lost. Trump's (predictable) refusal to acknowledge the loss was at first accepted as a cost of not alienating his base. The sentiment was infamously summarized by an official who spoke with The Post a few days after the loss was confirmed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time? No one seriously thinks the results will change, the senior Republican said. He went golfing this weekend. It's not like he's plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on Jan. 20. He's tweeting about filing some lawsuits, those lawsuits will fail, then he'll tweet some more about how the election was stolen, and then he'll leave.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This was the operating assumption for much of Trump's presidency: Go along with his nonsense, get what you need where you can and, eventually, things will go back to normal. Some in the establishment saw Trump's loss as a chance to step away from fringe politics, operating under an assumption that those politics are mostly associated with Trump himself.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They are not. The fringe has grown only more robust over the past four years, encouraged by Trump. He's leveraged sycophantic entities such as One America News and Newsmax in an effort to pressure Fox News to move further toward the right, an effort that has borne some fruit. He's refused to clamp down on bizarre conspiracy theories such as QAnon, even at times encouraging them. An expert who spoke with The Post in 2017 noted that Trump's politics are rooted in baseless conspiracy theories, something reinforced by his approach to communications as president. His counternarrative to Russia's interference in the 2016 election? A broad, baseless claim centered on the FBI. His rationalization for losing the election? A conspiracy among his opponents and state officials to prevent a win.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Since that Republican official shrugged at the harm of humoring Trump, Trump and the far right have only spiraled farther from the center of the galaxy, like a Voyager probe of nonsense. When Fox News had the gall to accurately report that Trump lost his reelection bid, Trump and his allies rejected the network. Fox News spent years building foot soldiers for the MAGA movement, but, in refusing to accede to his theories, it was quickly rejected by many Republicans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Suffolk University has for years asked Americans what TV news or commentary source they trust most, offering options such as CNN, Fox News, PBS and MSNBC. Fox News consistently earned most-trusted marks simply by holding the majority of Republicans. But in the first Suffolk poll released after the election, Fox News is now running about even with none of the above.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Much of that shift, it is safe to assume, is a function of viewership having moved to One America or Newsmax, places where accuracy is often a secondary concern. Their rhetoric is centered on Trump at the moment, but it is also deeply opportunistic. Once the election fades as a subject of speculation, something else will fill the vacuum.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Probably. There's certainly some opportunism at play for Trump. But the point is that the fringe keeps doing its thing in ways that are often only tangentially linked to Trump. There is some chunk of the Republican base that is now invested enough in this divergent soap opera to turn away from Fox News. QAnon has engaged hundreds of thousands of people in a LARP about government conspiracies, Satanism and child abuse. The fringe was always more invested in cultural fights than political ones, but, encouraged by Trump, those cultural fights are now much further from the GOP establishment than they were even four years ago.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Maybe Trump's inevitable withdrawal from the scene will reduce that distance somewhat. Maybe without Trump at the center, the One America and Newsmax audience will return to Fox.

{"original": "She's actually talking about 1961. That's when her father, a Montgomery Ward salesman, had a heart attack, and so her mother started to earn money by answering phones in the catalogue department at Sears, Roebuck and Co. A job at Sears allowed my mother to eke out a living for a family of three, wrote Warren in her memoir. She turned 12 in 1961.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Let's see what the data shows.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "President John F. Kennedy scored a big victory when he persuaded Congress to raise the federal minimum wage in 1961 from $1 to $1.15. Congress also extended the minimum wage for retail or service enterprises that maintain one or more stores, among other categories, which started at just $1.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The higher wage applied to workers engaged in interstate commerce. That amounted to about 24 million workers, with another 3.6 million workers added at the lower wage. Both categories started getting a wage of $1.25 in 1965.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So was Warren's mother covered under the $1 wage or the $1.15 wage? That's unclear, though answering the phones for catalogue sales might have been considered interstate commerce.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It makes a difference in determining whether Warren is right. At $1, her mother would have earned an annual wage of $2,080. (We are assuming a full-time job of 40 hours a week for 52 weeks.) That is well below the Census Bureau's average poverty threshold for a three-person family of $2,383 in 1961 — and also the level the Warren campaign urged us to consider: female head of household for a family of three. That was $2,164.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But at the $1.15 wage, her mother would have just cleared the average poverty threshold, earning $2,392, or $9 above it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Moreover, a federal report from 1961 shows most retail workers earned more than the minimum wage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Warren's broader point is largely correct if you use the official poverty rate. The minimum wage has not kept up with inflation. In the 1960s, a minimum-wage job may have kept a three-person family out of poverty. Now, such a job would not keep a single mother with a child out of poverty.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The annual earnings from today's minimum wage is $15,080. In contrast, the poverty level for a two-person family is $15,877 and an adult and one child is $16,895.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In today's dollars, $1.15 would be worth $9.73, compared to today's federal minimum wage of $7.25. So, if the wage had kept pace with inflation, annual earnings would be $20,238 — compared to the poverty line for a family of three with one child under 18 of $19,730.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There's a separate debate about whether the official poverty measures adequately capture the range of services available to poor Americans, but we are going to keep this simple and focus on the official rate. Many experts say the official rate excludes social policies that the United States has developed and expanded to reduce poverty, and so the Supplemental Poverty Measure was developed. (See chart below.) In 2012 alone, the combined effect of all federal tax, cash and in-kind aid programs was to lift approximately 14.5 percent of the population — over 45 million people — out of poverty, according to the 2014 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Housing costs have also risen. The median price of a new house in 1965 was about $20,000, which adjusted for inflation is about $155,000. The median price of a new house in 2018 was about $325,000.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Warren campaign said Warren's parents signed a $13,900 mortgage in 1960 that stipulated monthly payments of $87.57. That would have been 44 percent of the $1.15-an-hour wage and more than 50 percent of a $1 wage. A general rule is that no more than 30 percent of income should go to housing so money would have been tight under either wage scale.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Update: Another reader contacted us after this fact check was published. He pointed to a 2012 Boston Globe account that indicated her father worked at half pay while her mother worked at Sears. This suggested the family survived on more than the minimum wage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Warren campaign referred us to a more detailed account in her memoir, A Fighting Chance. It describes how, after the heart attack, the family car was repossessed and her father could not get his old job selling carpet back. He got a different job in which he was paid on commission, not a regular paycheck. Her mother took the minimum-wage Sears job when they were in danger of losing their house. She got the job answering phones at Sears, Warren writes. Later, Daddy left his job as a salesman at Montgomery Ward— or maybe he was let go, I don't really know. He got work as a maintenance man cleaning up around an apartment building.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The timeline is not entirely clear though it appears that for some period of time, the family lived on more than just a minimum-wage paycheck. The Warren campaign said it did not know how long her father did not have a job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As we noted, Warren's overall point is correct: The federal minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation. In 1961, it could have kept a three-person family out of poverty. But today, it wouldn't even keep a two-person family out of poverty, at least according to the official poverty rate. Her case glosses over the fact that the official poverty rate may not be the best metric, but there is little debate that the minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As for our reader's question, the answer depends on whether Warren's mother in 1961 qualified for a minimum wage of $1 or $1.15.

Could it praise him for being a thoughtful husband? Could it make sure that he was getting the best possible deal?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That was what Barbara could offer at the last remaining department store in the only mall in Hermitage, a city of 16,000 in Western Pennsylvania. J.C. Penney used to be one of three anchor stores at the Shenango Valley Mall. Then, one day last March, both Sears and Macy's shut down, becoming two of the more than 500 department stores that closed across the country in 2017. Headlines have called the shrinking of these American staples the retail apocalypse. In Hermitage, employees called it the funeral, because of the way it sounded as customers lined up to make their final purchases. I'm so sorry, they said. I'm in shock. What are you going to do? What am I going to do?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What might have been just a sign of the times in a bigger city was a life-changing and economy-altering loss for Hermitage, the kind of place too far from anywhere to be considered a suburb, but too developed to be considered rural or to attract visitors with small-town charm. The closest thing Hermitage has to a downtown is the intersection where its mall sits, surrounded by McDonald's, Walgreens and Dunkin' Donuts. The biggest buildings down the road are Kohl's, Kmart and Walmart. The retail industry is the third-largest employer in town, just behind health care and manufacturing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When Macy's and Sears closed, nearly 200 people lost their jobs — the equivalent of 1 in 5 retail positions in the city. In the months that followed, strips of tape kept appearing on the mall directory, blacking out the names of stores that followed suit: FYE, Rue 21, GNC, the local antiques store, Jammin Jac's pizza shop. At many of the businesses that remained, foot traffic and sales numbers plummeted.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But come November, J.C. Penney was still open, and the most important season in retail was about to begin. Sharon Loughner, the general manager, was confident that the rush of holiday customers was on its way and, with little choice of where to go, that they would be coming to her store. She would need more workers to do all the extra fetching, folding, stacking and selling, and so she put out a call for seasonal employees.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Among the parade of well-qualified applicants from Hermitage and towns nearby came Barbara, a 67-year-old woman who seemed to represent all that retail used to be.

She addressed everyone, no matter their age, as sir or ma'am.", "augmented": []}

She had been an executive secretary for 30 years, and now, a few years into her retirement, had done the math on her savings, her mortgage payment and her grandchildren's Christmas gifts and decided it was time to return to work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The job at J.C. Penney was guaranteed only until the new year, but if she worked hard enough, she thought, they might keep her on.

{"original": "She studied up on diamond ratings and learned to lock the jewelry counter's glass cases to help prevent shoplifting. She learned not to ask if customers had J.C. Penney credit cards, but to assume that they did, so they would feel like they should. And that will be on your Penney's card, sir? She survived Black Friday, perfecting her response to unhappy customers: a hand over her bedazzled brooch and a sincere apology. I'm sorry, ma'am, we don't have the Fitbit here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Sometimes she worried she might be taking this position from someone who needed it more than she did. For many of her co-workers, Penney's was a second job. Amanda in jewelry had four children to support. Tina in home goods was taking care of her sick mother. Marcia in the men's department had been laid off when Macy's left. The employees bristled every time a customer asked, Is Penney's going to close, too?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The question was being asked constantly during the holidays, as customers returned to the Shenango Valley Mall and saw, some for the first time, the hallways of empty storefronts. There was nowhere except Penney's to buy men's dress clothes.

Fewer than 100 people still worked at the mall year-round.", "augmented": []}

Sun Myung Moon in which Moon declared himself the Messiah and said his teachings have helped Hitler and Stalin be reborn as new persons. At the March 23 ceremony in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, Rep. Danny K. Davis (D-Ill.) wore white gloves and carried a pillow holding an ornate crown that was placed on Moon's head. The Korean-born businessman and religious leader then delivered a long speech saying he was sent to Earth . . . to save the world's six billion people. . . . Emperors, kings and presidents . . . have declared to all Heaven and Earth that Reverend Sun Myung Moon is none other than humanity's Savior, Messiah, Returning Lord and True Parent. Details of the ceremony -- first reported by Salon.com writer John Gorenfeld -- have prompted several lawmakers to say they were misled or duped by organizers. Their complaints prompted a Moon-affiliated Web site to remove a video of the Crown of Peace ceremony two days ago, but other Web sites have preserved details and photos. Moon, 85, has been controversial for years. Renowned for officiating at mass weddings, he received an 18-month prison sentence in 1982 for tax fraud and conspiracy to obstruct justice. In a 1997 sermon, he likened homosexuals to dirty dung-eating dogs.", "augmented": []}

Everyone I talked to was furious, she said. With Minnesotans demanding to know whether Dayton is a follower of Moon, Lisi said, the senator persuaded the St. Paul Pioneer Press to write an article allowing him to reply. The event's organizers flew in nearly 100 honorees from all 50 states to receive state and national peace awards. The only international crown of peace awards went to Moon and his wife. Some Republicans who attended the event, including Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett (Md. ), said they did so mainly to salute the Washington Times, a conservative-leaning newspaper owned by Moon's organization. I had no idea what would happen regarding Moon's coronation and speech, Bartlett said yesterday. But a key organizer -- Archbishop George A. Stallings Jr., pastor of the Imani Temple, an independent African American Catholic congregation in Northeast Washington -- said Moon's prominent role should have surprised no one.

Stallings, a former Roman Catholic priest who was married in Moon's church, said Moon's association with those organizations is well known. You'd have to be deaf, dumb and blind to not know that any event that is sponsored by the Washington Times . . . could involve the influence, or the potential presence, of the Reverend Moon, he said. Use of the Dirksen building requires a senator's approval. Dayton said he gave no such permission, and Stallings said the question of who did so is shrouded in mystery. Moon has claimed to have spoken in the spirit world with all deceased U.S. presidents, Jesus, Moses, Mohammed and others. At the March 23 event, he said: The founders of five great religions and many other leaders in the spirit world, including even Communist leaders such as Marx and Lenin . . . and dictators such as Hitler and Stalin, have found strength in my teachings, mended their ways and been reborn as new persons.

Also speaking at the event was Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.). Davis said in an interview that he is a lifelong Methodist who does not agree with many of Moon's religious teachings. But he praised Moon's efforts to promote world peace. Davis said that some Moon associates have donated money to his congressional campaigns, but that that has nothing to do with his support for Moon's organization. The prominent role played by Davis, Fauntroy and Stallings, among others, reflects Moon's efforts to reach out to the black community.

{"original": "Q: How has the partial government shutdown affected federal employees ready to retire at the beginning of the year?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: Most agencies recommend employees submit their retirement applications about two or three months before their date of separation to allow the agency retirement office enough time to process their portion of the employee's separation and retirement application package. So federal employees who planned to retire likely would have already submitted their retirement application.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Employees who planned to retire during the shutdown period but had not informed their agency, likely must wait until the government reopens to start the process.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "While retirements will be effective on the scheduled dates of retirement, there may be delays in processing retirement applications. First, some agency retirement offices have been affected by the shutdown. If the employees at the relevant agency who finalize the retirement packages are furloughed, the process may be delayed until they return to the job. Second, most agency retirement offices forward retirement application packages to the OPM through the agency's payroll office first. If the agency's payroll office was affected by the shutdown, then that agency's retirement application packages are likely to be left sitting there until those employees return to work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Retirement applications for federal employees who work for agencies indirectly affected by the shutdown will probably not be affected by the shutdown.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Furthermore, years of service toward federal retirement will not be affected by a short-term government shutdown. Employees are allowed leave without pay for six months in a year before it would be considered a break in service.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: What happens if an employee's retirement date falls during the shutdown?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: If a federal employee already submitted a retirement application to his or her agency with a date of retirement that occurred during the shutdown, the employee will be retired, effective on the submitted date of retirement.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "A: As noted above, if a federal employee already submitted a retirement application to his or her agency with a date of retirement that occurred during the shutdown, the employee will be retired, effective on the submitted date of retirement.

{"original": "Retirement applications for federal employees who work for agencies not directly affected by the shutdown will not be affected by the shutdown.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: Is any retirement paperwork being processed?", "augmented": []}

Also, the Retirement Services division under the OPM remains open. If retirement applications have been sent to the OPM, they will be processed normally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Q: Will any employees who planned to retire lose any leave or pay?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A: No. The employee's retirement would be retroactively applied to a date before the end of the leave year, and the employee would receive the full amount of accumulated and accrued annual leave in a lump-sum payment. If an employee is scheduled to retire before the end of the leave year with an annual leave balance over the maximum leave ceiling (e.g., 240, 360 or 720 hours, as applicable) and the furlough prevents the employee's retirement from getting processed until January, the employee does not lose his or her annual leave above the maximum leave ceiling.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If back pay is granted to furloughed federal workers, as has happened in previous shutdowns, employees planning to retire will not lose pay owed before their effective retirement date either. The Senate passed the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, which would guarantee back pay for federal workers furloughed due to a lapse in appropriations. The House has also approved back pay for federal workers. If the president signs the bill, federal workers will not need to worry whether back pay will be granted in the bill to reopen the government.", "augmented": []}

I do not have any student loans, I have around $2,100 in credit card debt from a surgery I had to have last May that I will definitely pay off this year, nearly $30,000 in savings and maybe around that much in three retirement accounts at three different employers. Honestly, I don't even know how much I have in these retirement accounts because I have not looked in quite some time. All of this is just so overwhelming and daunting.

If I don't hit my number so what. I'll spend less. Most retirees I know (above average income) get along fine and most were involuntary retirements.

There will be an additional 47 households enrolled by the end of January, and organizers hope to raise an additional $500,000 to assist more families.

{"original": "The Blazers entered this season expected to at least maintain their surprising progress from last year, and to potentially take another step forward after winning 44 games and reaching the second round of the playoffs last season. Instead, Portland has fallen apart, with a 23-31 record entering Monday that has the Blazers on pace to win 35 games this season and finish outside of the playoff picture in the West.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now Portland, in ninth place in the West, has made a trade that clearly makes it worse today and makes Denver, the team in eighth, better. It's hard to see this as anything other than General Manager Neil Olshey deciding to cash in his chips and look to the future — specifically the 2017 NBA draft, which is considered to be flush with talent and in which he now has three first-round picks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It wouldn't at all be surprising to see Portland continue to make deals, both in order to try and add even more future assets and to address another problem that this trade clearly is trying to address.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A 2016 spending spree comes back to haunt the Trail Blazers", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That problem is the spending spree Portland went on last year, which has cost the Trail Blazers the chance to keep Plumlee in addition to forcing owner Paul Allen to fork over a substantial amount of cash.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "After its successful 2015-16 season, Portland signed one prominent free agent, forward Evan Turner, and re-signed four of its own players — Meyers Leonard, Allen Crabbe, Maurice Harkless and C.J. McCollum (with McCollum's deal coming in the form of a contract extension) for a combined $332 million present and future dollars. While the McCollum and Harkless deals look fine, the contracts given out to Turner (four years, $70 million), Crabbe (four years, $75 million) and Leonard (four years, $41 million) all look awful.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The argument from Portland's side would be that it was necessary to keep Crabbe and Leonard, who were restricted free agents, rather than losing them for nothing. And Turner was expected to be another ball-handler, which the team identified as something it would like to get to take pressure off McCollum and Damian Lillard. Plus, it was the only chance Portland would have to sign a big-money free agent before retaining their own players.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But because Portland spent so heavily last summer, it's already headed into the 2017-18 season with roughly $133 million guaranteed to 12 players after this trade — more than $10 million over the expected luxury tax line. That includes Nurkic's roughly $3 million salary for next season, but if Plumlee had received an offer commiserate with what was the going rate for starting centers last summer — roughly $17 million — and Portland would be committed to $147 million for those same 12 players.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The luxury tax bill for Portland at that point would be about $64 million dollars, putting the Trail Blazers' combined luxury tax and payroll commitments at north of $210 million before even filling out their roster, making them the most expensive team in NBA history by a country mile.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's clear, looking at things that way, why Portland would decide to move on from Plumlee, and take back a young center in Nurkic and a first rounder for its trouble. But Portland now needs a starting center and is still looking at a very expensive roster moving forward even without him — a direct consequence of spending so much to both sign and keep lesser players last summer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Denver still has plenty of work to do", "augmented": []}
{"original": "While the Portland side of this deal at least makes sense from a financial standpoint, it's hard to understand where the Nuggets were coming from. After trying to play Nurkic alongside budding star Nikola Jokic — another center — early in the season, Denver scrapped that plan and shifted to building around Jokic, a wonderful passer and scoring center who struggles defensively.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Plumlee, on the other hand, is another excellent passing big who is active and athletic, but he's not a great defensive player. While he's definitely more athletic and agile than Nurkic, it is hard to see how a defensive frontcourt of Plumlee and Jokic is going to be able to defend at a high enough level to work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Meanwhile, swapping Nurkic for Plumlee — while a talented player — leaves Denver with the same roster logjam it has had all season — one that's been expected to be used, because the Nuggets have plenty of intriguing players, to try to consolidate and find talent that fits around Jokic moving forward.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "A: Tucked in the Cares Act were several provisions that cover retirement accounts, including the suspension of RMDs for 2020. The measure was adopted because seniors were concerned they would have to take distributions from their retirement accounts when the stock market significantly dropped as the coronavirus spread in the United States. During the last financial crisis, when the stock market crashed, Congress suspended RMDs for 2009.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You are required by law to take withdrawals from your IRA, SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA or retirement plan — such as a 401(k) — once you reach 72. (It was 70½ before 2020.) But the Cares Act waives RMD payments for 2020, including for inherited IRAs.", "augmented": []}

Such a crash seemed to be well underway in late March, when the Cares Act was being discussed. For instance, if someone age 75, who has a 4.37 percent required distribution . . . had all her money in a Standard & Poor's 500 index fund, she would have had to withdraw 8.74 percent of her fund's balance to meet that requirement if the market were down 50 percent.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The straightforward answer is the requirement for taking a required minimum distribution is back for 2021, says Melissa Ridolfi, senior vice president for retirement and cash management at Fidelity Investments. Older Americans who had previously been taking distributions may need to relearn the habit, or just as importantly, those turning 72 in either 2020 or 2021 could be taking a distribution for the first time.

As Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia noted in a Dec. 14 speech, an improper payment rate of 10 percent is the historical norm for UI payments, which would translate to $38 billion of the $380 billion so far paid through the Cares Act. However, the actual figure must be far larger than that, Mr. Scalia observed, in part because computer-savvy fraudsters, often using personal identification information they have stolen from innocent third parties, were able to exploit the understaffed and technologically backward state agencies that are in charge of checking eligibility and determining payment rates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Waste, fraud and abuse is the perennial mantra of those who oppose using government resources to create a social safety net and blunt capitalism's sharpest inequalities. Yet 2020's UI fraud problem is not a story of inevitable corruption, but rather of the avoidable kind. And the best way to avoid it would have been to invest more in governmental capacity, both state and federal. The U.S. unemployment insurance system relies heavily on state governments, which, in turn, fund both administration of the program and benefits through a tax on employers. But they have little incentive to tap that tax base for investment in UI systems during good times, when jobless claims are few. The result is erosion of human capital and deferred modernization of computer systems.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The lesson is that sometimes government must spend money to save money. The top priority should be up-to-date software that enables states to calculate benefit levels more precisely and identify ineligible claims more swiftly.

In 2013 and 2014, Yahoo accounts were hacked, including by a Russian intelligence agent. One email sent to Yahoo highlighted by the article was dated Aug. 24, 2009, and indicated that an aide sent Abedin a password for access to her computer, as well as a PIN for use of a key fob, which then generates a random password for secure access. Thus it was a two-step process.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said it is unknown whether the laptop or the passwords contained in the email are classified. But he said emails showed Clinton and her aides ignored numerous warnings about computer security. While Abedin transferred information from an unclassified account, investigators later redacted significant portions of the emails before public release after deciding the emails contained classified information. Few of the emails have classified markings, but then-FBI Director James B. Comey in 2016 said Clinton and aides such as Abedin had been extremely careless and should have known the emails should have been handled with more care.", "augmented": []}

People, particularly the poor, will buy less if it's more expensive. Second, taxes on certain goods can be educative and signal disapproval. Nothing illustrates this more than gains we have seen from taxing tobacco over the past 50 years in our country and others. In Brazil, when tobacco taxes increased 116 percent (in real terms, i.e. adjusted for inflation) between 2006 and 2013, sales decreased by 32 percent, and tax revenue increased 48 percent.

The World Health Organization predicts major economic losses, $500 billion a year and growing, for LMICs if NCDs are not addressed. Ministers of finance shape tax policy — a powerful tool to reduce the harmful use of these products. But we also know that these ministers have many competing priorities.

In a recession, there are no deficit hawks.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "In last year's legislative session, the legislature, dominated by Democrats, promised to increase school spending by at least $32 billion over the next decade to implement the vaunted Kirwan Commission's Blueprint for Maryland's Future. Though it was built on multiple false narratives — that, e.g., the state underfunds its public schools (it spends 17 percent more per pupil than the national average) and underpays its teachers (they're paid 25 percent more per pupil than the national average) — the political power of the public school monopoly was sufficient to get the Blueprint passed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Where the money would come from was never resolved. Then the pandemic arrived, the budget imploded, and Gov. Larry Hogan (R) vetoed the bill. He had little choice: With revenue plunging, committing to massive new spending seemed untenable, and whacking the private sector with a tax hike would have deepened the recession.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But with a new legislative session about to begin, overriding that veto seems to be Democrats' top priority. Blueprint beneficiaries will claim that doing so would be stimulative — except, of course, in a balanced-budget world, more money for public schools just means less for everyone else, so no net stimulus. In addition, Keynesians know that the pumps that need priming here are those that stopped working during the recession — and teachers and education bureaucrats haven't missed any paychecks while teleworking, but many others, especially in the service and hospitality industries, have seen their jobs disappear.", "augmented": []}

With almost a quarter-million Marylanders unemployed, four tax hikes may be proposed this session. Though a bill to massively expand the state's sales tax crashed and burned in March, we'll probably see attempts to override Hogan vetoes of a more modest extension of the sales tax to digital products and a first-in-the-nation tax on digital advertising. Also likely are proposals to slap a higher income tax rate on wealthy one-percenters and ding Big Business by withdrawing various credits and adopting a combined reporting corporate income tax law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If Keynes is not spinning in his grave, his ghost is at least shaking his head ruefully. Though these tax increases are engineered to minimize political resistance by avoiding explicit burdens on the average Marylander, this matters not economically. Reducing the spending power of people or firms anywhere is contractionary; this diminishes demand and, thanks to what Keynes dubbed a multiplier effect, ultimately spreads negative effects everywhere.", "augmented": []}

Tax hikes at the federal level can be tough to evade, but states with unfriendly tax climates find that those they plan to milk sometimes seek greener pastures.

{"original": "You mentioned you are buying this vacation home with someone else. If that's the case, your mom can give you and this other person an annual gift of $30,000, and she can give you this gift each year until she has basically given you the property. As we mentioned before, we'd prefer to know you have some paperwork that shows the gift would be to you and the other person. We don't want you to be in a position where the IRS feels the gift was to you alone and then requires your mom to file gift tax paperwork with the IRS.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If your mother is giving you the home, however, and you do not have paperwork showing the gift was a loan, you should be aware that when it comes time to sell the property, you may walk into a minefield where the IRS determines you essentially paid nothing for the property, so if you sell it you will owe a great deal in capital gains tax.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In general, if the home is owned by you and used as a second home, you can deduct the real estate property taxes and may be able to deduct your interest payments you make to your mom. You'll have to see what benefits you get on your federal income taxes by deducting interest and property taxes. (You might also want to keep in mind the tax rules are changing and you may have a limited amount to deduct a maximum of $10,000 for real estate property taxes and any state income taxes you owe.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But if you have a primary home mortgage and a second home mortgage, the limits used to be that you could deduct interest on a primary loan of up to $1 million and $100,000 on an equity loan. Starting this year, you'll be able to deduct interest on a loan up to $750,000 with interest on home equity loans no longer deductible. (No worries for our readers who took out loans before Dec. 15, 2017.

{"original": "They cannot, in the most exacting definition of the word, be considered cheap, because their payroll this season probably will exceed $165 million, and that's enough to compete comfortably in the top 10 in the game.

{"original": "The first is murky, because the Lerners won't answer. But those who do business with them have some informed suspicions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Turn first to the legal issue, the fact that the Nationals are arguing in a court case that the Baltimore Orioles are not paying them their rightful fees from their agreement with the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, a convoluted deal negotiated through Major League Baseball before the Lerners owned the team. In a court filing last year, the Nats, for the first time, suggested the idea that they're being shorted is prohibiting them from competing for talent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Without this added and steady income, the Nationals cannot bring full economic confidence to investments in multi-year player contracts to keep up with the fierce competition for top players, Nationals principal Ed Cohen, a son-in-law of patriarch Ted Lerner, argued in a filing. More than a year later, that remains the strongest language linking the MASN situation to the way the team operates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So one strategy could be: Look what this MASN debacle is making us do! We're kicking money down the road to points when we hope to have more money coming in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But here's betting that, assuming any of us lives long enough to see the MASN dispute settled, the Nats don't change their strategy. Which leads to the other possibility: Ted Lerner built his real estate empire from scratch by making one patient, sound financial decision after another. The Lerners could well figure that the, say, $3 million they're not paying a pitcher this year can be invested in something else. If it yields even 5 percent, well, hey, that's an extra $150,000, and who wouldn't want an extra $150,000, even if you're worth nearly $5 billion?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "[Puerto Rico yearns for another golden era in Major League Baseball]", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Whatever the reasoning, it's certainly a topic of discussion within the game.

One year and $4 million, with $1 million available in incentives for innings pitched?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "More than fair for the player. Helps the team. End of story.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Except the Nationals will pay Blanton only $1 million in 2017, plus any bonuses he earns. They will pay him $1 million in 2018, when he could be playing for another team, and they will pay him $2 million in 2019, when he will be 38 and — who knows? — could well be retired.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Go down the roster. Wieters will make $10.5 million to play for Washington in 2017. That $10.5 million, though, will be paid out over three seasons.

{"original": "The previous offseason, the Nats signed Scherzer to a deal that, on the surface, was for seven years and $210 million. But its complicated structure includes not only a $50 million signing bonus that is doled out at various points over the life of the contract, but it includes three seasons — 2019, 2020 and 2021 — in which Scherzer is supposed to make $35 million annually, but all of that money, $105 million total, is deferred to future dates (and replaced in those years by some of the signing bonus).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Dig into the seven-year, $175 million extension signed by Strasburg last summer, and it gets even more complicated. Strasburg makes $15 million this season and again next. His salary for 2019, the third year of the deal, is listed at $35 million — but $30 million is deferred without interest. In 2020, he makes $25 million — but $10 million is deferred without interest. In 2024, the first year the deal is over, Strasburg will receive $10 million — the first of seven straight years he'll haul that in.", "augmented": []}

That's the last year Scherzer will be under contract. What we don't know: what that tax threshold will be when a new collective bargaining agreement is negotiated, covering 2022 and beyond. What we do know: Scherzer will be paid seven years after his contract expires, when he's 44.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And all that money counts against whatever the luxury tax threshold is in that given year. In a future season in which the Nats are paying both Scherzer and Strasburg — either of whom could be playing for another team or retired — the Nats could have, say, a $20 million payroll hit for players who don't play for them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Would that impact how much they'd be willing to spend on future rosters? We don't know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The issue, though, is this: If no other team in baseball operates this way, and if some player targets spurn deferred money instead of paid up front, then the Nats inherently compromise the talent pool from which they can pick. We know, for instance, that outfielder Yoenis Cespedes preferred what was billed as a three-year, $75 million deal from the Mets last year — a deal he could opt out of after one season, when he was paid $27.5 million — over a five-year, $110 million offer from the Nats. The Nats' money would have been paid out over a decade; thus, in real dollars, it would have been worth less than $110 million.", "augmented": []}

The bill also limits owners to renting their homes for 15 days a year while they are not present. This is far too restrictive.

Such sweeping climate legislation, or even enacting something like a carbon tax, would require a filibuster-proof majority or abolishing the filibuster. This isn't the Senate to deliver that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In part, that's because the Democratic Party is itself split over energy and climate policy. The vocal progressive wing, personified in members such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders, favors not just big spending on green initiatives, but also far-reaching mandates against fossil fuels and supporting environmental and social justice measures. On the other side stand members favoring a more cautious approach, not least because they hail from states where fossil-fuel production and distribution is a big source of economic activity, jobs and donor dollars. These include both senators from New Mexico, as well as senators in important swing states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. But one Democratic senator personifies this wing above all others: Joe Manchin of West Virginia.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In a sense, Manchin is the third big Senate winner this week. Assuming Ossoff prevails, Manchin is the presumptive next head of the chamber's Energy and Natural Resources Committee. His own vote is enough to swing power to a unified Republican caucus if he wants. As a Democrat in an overwhelmingly red state — and one who literally shot a copy of a carbon cap-and-trade bill in an ad for his first Senate campaign — he isn't going to be onboard for anything like a Green New Deal. He has pointedly said he doesn't back abolishing the filibuster. At the same time, however, unless he plans on simply switching parties or giving up his committee chair, he can't simply step into Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell's shoes and block everything Biden and the more progressive elements of the party want to do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The likely compromise involves a familiar emollient: spending. Manchin isn't inclined, both ideologically and as a matter of political survival in his coal-fired state, to back legislation that directly attacks fossil fuels, such as rescinding tax breaks for the industry or, at a more extreme level, mandating curbs on fossil-fuel production or consumption. But backing more stimulus dollars for clean technology such as electric vehicles or renewable energy is a different prospect. While West Virginians would bridle at a carbon tax, they aren't likely to be as exercised about vehicle chargers being built on their roads, especially if that brings jobs with it. And Manchin's critical role means he should be able to secure more federal dollars for the sort of climate initiatives he has favored as ranking member on the energy committee, which potentially extend the lifespan of fossil-fuel consumption, such as carbon capture, use and sequestration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The upshot is that, as Biden seeks to deliver his green agenda, the emphasis is less likely to be on mandates and more on money — in the form of an expanded, green-tinted stimulus bill — at least in the short term. This fits with Biden's emphasis on job-creation as a way to sell climate action to the American public in the context of recovery from the pandemic. It also fits with his appointments at the Department of Energy and other agencies, which portend a focus on executive action to coordinate industrial policy to boost green technologies and reverse outgoing President Donald Trump's own executive actions to support fossil fuels.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Biden has been at pains to stress bipartisanship and ignore the growing chorus of wing-nuttery from the hard right challenging his election victory. But Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington-based research firm, detects signs of this cracking. In his pre-runoff speech on Monday in Georgia, Biden criticized Trump's efforts to assert, take or seize power over the will of the electorate and also the incumbent Republican senators in the state for backing him up. Book also highlights Biden's use of the phrase national emergency when introducing his climate team last month, headed by Gina McCarthy. While that may have been just a throwaway line from a politician known for his syntactical throwing arm, it may also signal a willingness to resort to emergency powers to address climate change if he believes there is simply no deal to be had with Republicans. After all, Trump considered using such powers to force utilities to buy electricity from his favorite nuclear and coal-fired plants in the name of national security.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On that score, the constitutional arson likely to be attempted by a depressingly significant number of Republican pyromaniacs in Congress on Wednesday (and maybe into Thursday, given the debate rules) could provide the spark. Apart from Biden, perhaps Manchin's own centrism could be tested by such naked efforts to overturn America's democratic institutions and norms. As I have written before, the Republican shield for the fossil-fuels business has been effective; but as the party veers ever further away from conservatism toward radicalism, it becomes a liability. Georgia's unlikely result probably portends a relatively moderate green policy centered on stimulus spending. The Republican reaction could change that.", "augmented": []}

It's back to the same old-same old.", "augmented": []}

Trump, for example, is known to call this publication the Amazon Washington Post, a reference to The Post's owner, Jeff Bezos.
