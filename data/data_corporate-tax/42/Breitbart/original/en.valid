ATHENS, Greece (AP) – Authorities have banned demonstrations in a large section of central Athens and will shut down streets and subway stations during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who arrives in the Greek capital Thursday afternoon for meetings with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and other officials.\n\nAround 2,000 officers, a police helicopter and drones will be deployed for the visit, which ends Friday afternoon.\n\nGermany was the largest single contributor to the three international bailout packages Greece received since 2010 as it struggled through a dramatic financial crisis which almost saw it crash out of the eurozone. Germany was also seen as one of the main enforcers of the stringent austerity measures, including tax hikes and pension and salary cuts, imposed in return for the loans.\n\nGermany Profited €100 Billion From Greek Debt Crisis http://t.co/g1xF4xR5mh pic.twitter.com/pHhd52HA1k — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 11, 2015
The House Democrats' proposed 2019 homeland security budget reopens the nation's southern border to migrant inflows, while it also dangles the promise of cheap labor in front of GOP legislators and donors.\n\nThe draft budget adds $1.75 billion in extra border spending to President Donald Trump's $58.7 billion budget request for the Department of Homeland security in 2019, according to a copy published by the Washington Post.\n\nBut Democrats' draft bill does not include any funding for the wall, and it uses the extra money to help migrants bypass border protections and then win jobs in the U.S. labor market.\n\nJudging by the draft bill, the Democrats want to limit the government's ability to keep people out of the country, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. In the Democrats' provisions become law, he said, adding that enforcement would be weakened and people abroad would every quickly learn of that, and then illegal immigration would dramatically increase, especially of people with children.\n\nAny flood of new migrants will force down wages for Americans, raise profits for donors, and will pressure some Americans to seek welfare from the government. In 2017, under rules set by former President Barack Obama and Congress, roughly 400,000 migrants got work permits to compete against Americans for jobs.\n\nThe Democrats' bill does not include any money for fences or walls, and it bars officials from setting barriers in major migrant pathways across the border:\n\n[The bill] prohibits the use of funds from this and prior year Acts to construct physical barriers, as follows: Within or north of the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge; Within or north of the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park; Within or north of La Lomita Historical Park; Within, south of, or north of the National Butterfly Center; or Within, north of, or east of the Vista del Mar Ranch tract of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThe bill blocks Trump's rules which deny asylum to migrants who say they are afraid of gangs or domestic violence. It commits the DHS to end the detention of migrants who bring children to the border even though many migrants openly tell reporters that they bring children to trigger Obama's catch and release rules. The bill also cuts funding needed to keep migrants in detention until their legal claims are resolved, and it spends at least $75 million to encourage the catch-and-release of migrants.\n\nThe bill allocates $502 million for humanitarian concerns to welcome and aid migrants as they push their way through the border.\n\nIt also reopens Obama's pipeline for relaying Central American UAC youths from the cartels' coyotes at the border up to their parents and relatives who are living illegally in the United States while cutting ICE personnel levels and enforcement operations.\n\nThe bill also reauthorizes the EB-5 law which allows wealthy Chinese and Indian families to effectively buy green cards if they lend cash to American real-estate developers. The citizenship-for-sale program has strong supporters in both parties, including from New York's Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer and Texas' GOP Sen. John Cornyn.\n\nThe bill also diverts border security funds into pork-barrel spending in members' districts, such as the purchases of aircraft, extra construction projects, $403 million for disaster spending, and a requirement that federal agencies clean up debris from forest fires.\n\nThe Democrats' border-opening legislation comes after the GOP Hill leadership — and the White House's Hill liaison team — failed last winter to enact a DHS funding bill for 2019. During the entire year of 2018, the Senate's GOP leadership did not publicly use any carrots or sticks to win Democratic acceptance to a border security plan acceptable to President Donald Trump, who must now pressure Hill legislators to pass much of the 2018 border security bill which was not passed in 2018.\n\nBut Democrats do not want to recognize the economic and civic damage from their tacit support of mass migration, said Krikorian. He continued:\n\nIt is becoming increasingly mainstream on the left to reject the concept of immigration controls. Not that criminals should be let in, or terrorists, but the principle [they support] that everyone has the right to move here — unless there is some specific reason to keep them out— is now at the center of the Democratic Party.\n\nOur elites are increasingly dangerous — they are a danger to the health of their society, he added.\n\nTrump's Hire American policy is pushing up wages. So the DC estb. is loudly negotiating itself towards a wage-cutting amnesty. Lots of Kabuki noise and jumping to ensure the media does not pay attention to the money. https://t.co/8vkEEOocfi — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 19, 2019\n\nDemocrats have plenty of tools to pressure GOP legislators to accept the Democrats' border-opening legislation.\n\nThe bill denies any funding for walls. When GOP legislators push for wall funding, Democrats can demand offsetting cutbacks in enforcement and border rules.\n\nDemocrats also can offer more cheap labor to GOP donors if the GOP legislators agree to the Democrats' border opening plans.\n\nFor example, the bill does not include several expansions of visa-worker programs which were included in the July 2018 draft budget by Rep. Kevin Yoder and many GOP and Democratic appropriators. Yoder was defeated in November, but the border security panel is dominated by House and Senate appropriators.\n\nYoder's provisions would have roughly doubled the inflow of H-2B seasonal laborers, so forcing down salaries for American seasonal workers and blue collar workers.\n\nYoder also pushed for a rule which would allow all farm companies — including dairies — to use the fast-growing H-2A agricultural worker program. If adopted, the measure would shrink farmers' incentives and ability to buy American made, labor-saving machines, such as robotic cow-milkers.\n\nMost dramatically, Yoder and his fellow appropriators offered the hugely valuable prize of green cards to at least 50,000 additional low-wage Indian and Chinese graduates per year if they take middle-class jobs from American graduates. The green card offer is being marketed by lobbyists as the fair removal of country caps. But it is being backed by U.S. Fortune 500 companies who wish to raise their stock values by hiring more cheap visa-workers in place of American graduates.\n\nU.S. companies already employ roughly 1.5 million college trained visa workers, mostly in jobs that were not advertised to American graduates. Many of those workers accept very low wages from their employers in the hope of winning green cards from the government.\n\nFeds use a fake university to bust college-grad labor traffickers who funneled at least 600 Indian grads into jobs around the US. The trafficking was hidden within the quasi-legal workforce of 1.5 million H-1B, OPT, L-1, TN, etc. white-collar visa-workers. https://t.co/EBenDh5wE3 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 31, 2019\n\nThroughout the next several weeks, the GOP legislators will face pressure behind closed doors from business groups that want the cheap H-2A, H-2B, and H1B visa workers.\n\nYet few reporters ever ask legislators why they are eager to import cheap labor which forces down wages and salaries for Americans — including the wages and salaries paid to the journalists' children, friends, relatives, and college roommates.\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.\n\nThat flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up real estate prices in New York, California, and elsewhere, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
The looming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Tuesday has the potential to open up global tourism and foreign investment to North Korea, with little prospect of any profits reaching the North Korean people.\n\nReports have suggested since the dialogue process began that Kim Jong-un has encouraged Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping and President Trump to consider investing in lavish tourist resorts within his state.\n\nThe lush natural landscapes of North Korea – from Wonsan's beaches to the Pyongyang skyline to the terrific glory of Mount Paektu, an active volcano – lend themselves to inviting travel, particularly from China and other neighboring countries. Yet many remain skeptical that any investment enriching the Kim regime will help reduce the abject poverty the average North Korean suffers, and concerns abound that Pyongyang could use the money to strengthen its ironclad grip on religion, freedom of expression and any political dissent.\n\nUnlike his predecessors, father Kim Jong-il and grandfather Kim Il-sung, dictator Kim Jong-un made his avid interest in attracting tourism to the country well known early in his tenure. In 2013, Kim debuted the massive Masikryong Ski Resort, which official North Korean propaganda described as a feat of the supreme will of the people despite widespread hunger and disease that rendered skiing far from a priority of the average North Korean. Two years later, Kim announced that he would launch a campaign to attract up to two million foreign tourists by 2020, when the most common kind of tourist to the country was an elder Chinese communist seeking to relive the glory days of the Maoist era.\n\nWhile more permissive in allowing Chinese tourists to enter the country, the Kim regime does allow Westerners to see it, but only through restrictive tour programs where a North Korean guide stays with each individual at all times, ensuring they do not ask incorrect questions or wander out of the sight of the government. Tour companies like Koryo Tours and Young Pioneer Tours specialize in helping foreigners navigate the process of being allowed in, and organize itineraries once approved. They have not taken Americans since Congress passed a law banning American tourism to the country in 2017.\n\nThis interest in tourism has reportedly seeped into recent talks with China and the United States. This month, the South Korean newspaper Dong-A Ilbo reported that Kim has repeatedly mentioned to Chinese officials his desire to see Beijing invest in creating a world-class resort in Wonsan, a beachside city several reports suggest could be turned into a special economic zone where foreign investment is permitted. The same newspaper reported that Kim Yong-chol, believed to be Kim's most trusted official, suggested to President Trump that he could help North Korea build a casino in Wonsan, should talks with Kim go well, predicting that a casino in that city could generate $50 million a year.\n\nNorth Korea forced reporters covering the alleged shutdown of the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site to stay in Wonsan and write about what a beautiful place it is, reports revealed after the event, and at least one outlet, China's Xinhua news service, complied.\n\nMainichi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, reported this month that Kim may bring up the Wonsan project during his talks with Trump tomorrow.\n\nHarry J. Kazianis, the Director of Defense Studies at The Center for the National Interest and an expert on North Korean affairs, tells Breitbart News that any talk of resorts, at least in my view, is years away.\n\nWhile it would seem, at least on the surface, that any investment in a nation such as North Korea — with an economy one-third the size of Ethiopia — would be uplifting, it will do nothing to help the average citizen, he says. Building such resorts, in the hope that they will attract international vacationers and adventure seekers — if sanctions are lifted — will only enrich a regime that has over 100,000 people in gulags on-par with Stalin or Hitler. Such a thought actually sickens my stomach.\n\nPreliminary reports from Wonsan appear to corroborate the claim that resort construction has hurt the local people. Radio Free Asia (RFA), which relies on local sources to report on events deep within the secretive communist state, reported in May that Pyongyang is largely funding the Wonsan reports on the backs of local North Koreans.\n\nTo meet the needs of construction, the regime has issued a 'mobilization order' and has imposed a new construction tax, UPI, quoting RFA, reported. Local-level North Korean cooperatives, organized by neighborhood across the country, have been asked to donate manpower and financial support for the construction of the marine tourism zone, according to the source.\n\nWork on the construction in Wonsan has been so crushing, RFA reported two weeks later, that the rapid and haphazard construction caused an electrical fire in a barracks housing at least 40 laborers. It's unclear how many people died in the fire, but there were reportedly a large number of casualties, a source in the country told the outlet. The source stated that laborers were only allowed three to four hours of sleep a day.\n\nMore and more, local residents who hear about the deaths of these workers are expressing their dissatisfaction with how the construction is being pushed along, the source said. And even though a seaside resort is being built, we'll never get to go there.\n\nNorth Korea operates under a caste system known as songbun, that offers families clout based on how loyal they have historically been to the Kims. High songbun families live in Pyongyang and receive job offers in the central government; lower songbun families are banned from the capital and forced to starve for generations in rural areas. The lowest songbun families – relatives of known political dissidents or defectors, individuals found possessing Hollywood movies or Bibles – are relegated to concentration camps. Up to 120,000 people are estimated to live in North Korea's camp system, many having been born there and knowing nothing else.\n\nCommunist regimes that lack a rigid caste system rarely let locals partake in tourist activities meant for foreigners. In Cuba, for example – arguably gifted with the most lucrative tourist sites in all of the communist world – local Cubans are forced to do business in a worthless parallel currency, the Cuban peso, that is not accepted in tourist areas. Tourists use the Cuban convertible peso, which is worth the equivalent of an American dollar.\n\nThose who have observed the abuses of the Castro regime believe there is no way North Korea would allow low- or medium-songbun families to enjoy the nation's tourist resorts.\n\nFirst of all, North Korea has no money. Neither does Cuba. The investment you're going to make in Cuba, just like North Korea, is going to be China spending money there or some other entity spending money, but North Korea has no money and neither does Cuba, Dr. Javier García-Bengochea, whose family owned one of Cuba's most lucrative ports in Santiago before Fidel Castro stole it during the Revolution, told Breitbart News. So you are going to be effectively … cannibalizing or appropriating their natural or cultural resources going in for whatever their minerals are or tourism there is. You're not going to build Cuban society, or North Korean society.\n\nMickael Behn, whose family are the rightful owners of Havana Docks company, agreed. [Tourism and investment] will supply the top end of the regime, the military, to keep it alive, while all the other average people won't see any of it and will be used for cheap labor.\n\nThat's what the population is for, cheap labor, he added. it's an exact parallel to Cuba in that context.\n\nIf the Singapore summit results in the U.S. government allowing private American investors to profit there, Behn says, the nation's largest corporations may profit even if placed at risk of suffering what his family did in Cuba. I can see American companies going there … but it's at their own risk. The larger companies, I'm sure they can take a risk, a chance and they'll profit most from it.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has clearly stated it has no intent to invest American taxpayers' dollars in North Korea, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has hinted at the possibility of allowing Americans to invest there.\n\nThis will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid, he told Fox News Sunday. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives. These basic economic advances could go a long way to help North Korea's tourism industry.\n\nPompeo later said it was important to Kim Jong-un that he receive economic help from America in the form of private sector business's knowledge and know-how.\n\nThe tour guide companies – smaller than the major cruise corporations investing in Cuba, for example – have expressed a willingness to serve Americans with North Korea tours if Trump repeals the current ban. On its website, Koryo Tours states, as and when this travel ban is lifted, we would be more than happy to take you [Americans] to the DPRK (North Korea), and share our experience and knowledge there with you.\n\nWe will notify our mailing list as soon as there are any changes to this U.S. travel ban, and our ability to take people travelling on American passports to the DPRK, it adds.\n\nYoung Pioneer Tours, which chose to stop taking Americans after the death of one of its customers, Otto Warmbier, confirmed with Breitbart News that should the official U.S. ban on travel to the DPRK lift for U.S. citizens and if the opportunity to help facilitate positive business and economic relationships between the DPRK and American companies arose we would be open to assisting with these endeavours.\n\nTrump will likely face North Korea's economic concerns in person in his meeting with Kim tomorrow. Reports indicate the American side will not discuss human rights during this first meeting, so any conversation on the possibility of promoting tourism in the country will address only half the problem.\n\nNo American companies have publicly expressed a desire to invest in North Korea, whether in infrastructure or projects like the Wonsan resort. Yet estimates suggest it will take at least $2 trillion to bring North Korea into the 21st century, and South Korea simply does not have that kind of investment money around. China may help – it is already offering classes in economics to North Korean officials – but a communist regime can only do so much to spur economic growth.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
President Trump's compromise legislation to reopen the federal government funds border security measures in Pakistan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Libya.\n\nThe legislation known as the End the Shutdown and Secure the Border Act by Trump and the Senate GOP Leadership includes American tax dollars funding border security in North Africa, and the southern and western regions of Asia.\n\nWhile $5.7 billion is designated to build bollard-style fencing at the U.S.-Mexico border, about $15 million is allocated to border security programs in Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, the legislation grants nearly $6 billion to fund foreign militaries, which allows the Lebanese Armed Forces to use some of that funding to strengthen border security and secure Lebanon's borders.\n\nThe billions in U.S. taxpayer funding is also allocated to stabilize Libya, which includes increased border security for the country. The military of Egypt will continue to receive about $1.3 billion in taxpayer money that can likewise be used for border security efforts.\n\nIncluded in the compromise legislation is a plan to give amnesty in the form of three-year work permits to about a million illegal aliens and foreign nationals who would be shielded from deportation. The bill increases the number of low-skilled non-agricultural foreign workers that business is allowed to import every year instead of hiring Americans.\n\nThe Senate bill is expected to be voted on this week.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

President Donald Trump says ensuring legal immigrants prove they can be self-sufficient before permanently resettling in the United States is a critical Supreme Court victory for American taxpayers.\n\nDuring a rally in New Jersey on Tuesday evening, Trump touted this week's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allows the federal government to enforce the Clinton-era Public Charge rule, which seeks to end welfare-dependent legal immigration.\n\nI'm also very proud to report that we won a critical Supreme Court victory yesterday on immigration, Trump said. We will now finally be able to enforce federal law and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer-funded programs.\n\nThe rule ensures legal immigrants will be less likely to secure a permanent residency in the U.S. if they have used any forms of welfare in the past, including using subsidized healthcare services, food stamps, and public housing.\n\nPublic Charge: Self-Sufficient Immigrants Proficient in English Favored for Green Cardshttps://t.co/KeJI4XnNuC — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) August 12, 2019\n\nThe regulation will be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.\n\nThe National Academies of Science released a report two years ago noting that state and local American taxpayers are billed about $1,600 each year per immigrant to pay for their welfare, and immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households.\n\nA recent Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) study notes that about 63 percent of noncitizen households in the U.S. use at least one form of taxpayer-funded welfare, while only about 35 percent of native-born American households are on welfare. This means that noncitizen households use nearly twice as much welfare as native-born American households.\n\nThe most recent Harvard/Harris Poll finds that a 56-percent majority of Hispanic Americans support denying green cards to legal immigrants who have used welfare. About 60 percent of U.S. voters support ending welfare-dependent legal immigration — including 62 percent of swing voters.\n\nTrump also slammed Washington Democrats for betraying Americans on the issue of immigration, citing New Jersey's sanctuary policies that shield criminal illegal aliens from being deported:\n\nRight here in New Jersey, your state's Democrat leaders have instated sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your communities. For example, Cumberland County … they released an illegal alien with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child. He is now at-large, free to search for another innocent victim. They didn't give him to ICE. [Emphasis added]\n\nNo American should ever be hurt, harmed, or killed because left-wing politicians, Democrats, decided to shield and shelter criminals, Trump said.\n\nSince March 2019, New Jersey has been a sanctuary state for criminal illegal aliens. The statewide law bans local law enforcement from turning arrested illegal aliens over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\nCurrently, there is an estimated record high of 44.5 million foreign-born residents living in the U.S. This is nearly quadruple the immigrant population in 2000. The vast majority of those arriving in the country every year are low-skilled legal immigrants who compete against working- and middle-class Americans for jobs.\n\nEvery year, about 2,000 Americans are killed by illegal aliens, according to an analysis by Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL). Of the roughly 150,000 federal inmates in Bureau of Prisons custody, more than 40,000 are illegal aliens, indicating that more than 25 percent of the federal prison population came to the U.S. illegally.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

CLAIM: Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) says California had an incredible decade because it stood up for our values and took on big issues.\n\nVERDICT: Mostly false. California's economy recovered, but it lags behind in other areas.\n\nNewsom tweeted on New Year's Day: What an incredible decade. We've accomplished so much in CA by standing up for our values and taking on some of the biggest issues — from healthcare to gun violence to climate change.\n\nCuriously, Newsom did not cite the state's economic or fiscal progress, but its values. That is because much of what Newsom and the Democrats value in California has to do with good intentions, rather than real-world results.\n\nCalifornia's only achievement in health care is extending free benefits to illegal aliens. Despite gun control, it led the nation in mass slayings last year. And its effect on global climate is negligible, as its energy costs climb.\n\nWhen Breitbart News asked Newsom last month how he would defend his state against conservative criticism, he cited California's economic recovery, and noted that the state now runs a budget surplus, rather than a deficit.\n\nBut these trends, while commendable, are inseparable from the recovery of the nation as a whole. Though the state remains a hothouse for high-tech and media startups, thousands of companies left the state due to its high taxes, heavy regulations, and litigious environment.\n\nNewsom's predecessor, Jerry Brown, once said: We've got a few problems, we have lots of little burdens and regulations and taxes … But smart people figure out how to make it.\n\nThat attitude sums up California's economic development over the decade: incredible, and growing, wealth at the top, among the tech elite and the well-connected — while the poor grow, and the middle class stagnates, or leaves.\n\nAs Leo Tolstoy said, by way of Isaiah Berlin: The leaves of a tree delight us more than the roots. And the roots of California's progress have rotted over the past decade, under both Brown and Newsom, by a variety of measures.\n\nMiddle-class exodus: From 2007 to 2016, California lost a net million residents — some 2.5% of its population (which still grows due to births and immigration). The high cost of living — driven by high taxes and the shortage of housing — is a major factor. With homeowners and small business owners — the Republican base — leaving, Democrats and their policies become entrenched, though the state may lose a congressional seat after the Census.\n\nPower shortages: The state that leads the nation, and the world, in technological innovation cannot keep the lights on any longer — not since the Pacific Gas & Electric Company began shutting off the electricity last year during high winds to prevent wildfires and protect itself from liability. After focusing on green energy and letting nuclear plants go dark, the state government was unprepared for the basic task of making sure California had enough power.\n\nHomelessness: The most visible change in California over the past decade has been the surge in homelessness — 16.4% in 2018 alone, which entirely accounted for the nation's overall 2.7% rise. Tent cities are becoming a common sight in the big cities, and even in rural towns. The state has done nothing to address the root causes of homelessness; it keeps offering generous welfare benefits and asking the federal government for housing money.\n\nDrought: California suffered one of the worst droughts in its history for much of the decade. The effects were made worse because the state has failed to invest in new water storage infrastructure for decades. Though politicians point to climate change (inaccurately) as the cause of recent wildfires, poor forestry management — state and federal — plus restrictions on logging and poor residential planning have turned natural variation into man-made disasters.\n\nInfrastructure: The state suffers from a massive backlog in infrastructure spending. Democrats recently provided more funding for the state's roads — through an unpopular, regressive gas tax hike rather than spending cuts on less urgent priorities. But one of Newsom's first acts as governor was to cancel much of the state's high-speed rail plan, which had already sunk billions of federal dollars into plans for a rural segment no one had any interest in using.\n\nEducation: The past decade saw California schools continue to underperform. Reform movements, championing school choice, public charters, merit pay, and other proven innovations, gained support in minority communities and even won in local school board elections — only to be crushed, repeatedly, by teachers-union-backed candidates at the state level. For California's children, a decade of underachievement in public schools could have lifelong effects.\n\nCrime: Though crime remains at historically low levels, the past decade saw periods of increased crime in many areas, thanks in part to ill-conceived prison reforms such as Proposition 47, which focused on reducing sentences and downgrading many crimes. Notorious crimes committed by illegal aliens — such as the killing of Kate Steinle in 2015 — became national symbols of the lack of immigration enforcement and a general decline in the rule of law.\n\nAs this article was about to be published, Newsom added more claims about California's success:\n\nSpending some time looking back on 2019. CA made some serious first-in-the-nation and big moves… — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) January 2, 2020\n\nNoticeably absent: any mention of results, aside from the low unemployment rate, for which President Donald Trump can also claim credit.\n\nJoel B.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is reviving the establishment's virtual wall policy on the southern border to soften her uncompromising opposition to President Donald Trump's push for a real fence on the border.\n\nWhat the President is proposing is not the best way to protect our borders … We all support border security, and there is a better way to do it … The positive, shall we say, almost technological wall, that can be built is what we should be doing, Pelosi said January 10.\n\nNancy Pelosi's border security fix: Repair the border roads so it's easier for immigrants to enter U.S.https://t.co/X6ePFKurDQ pic.twitter.com/sYPgLLxHV9 — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) January 10, 2019\n\nPelosi's focus on a technological wall of sensors and drones helps the Democrats hide their push for more migration, despite its impact on Americans' wages, productivity, tax spending, crime, and civic peace, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThey have to make it sound like they are for some kind of enforcement, and so what they say they are in favor of is 'smarter enforcement,' just like the [Barack] Obama administration used to say their ICE strategy of 'prosecutorial prioritization' was really 'smarter enforcement,' she said.\n\nThe Democrats' push for a technological wall, is also very important for the new Democrat legislators elected in swing-districts, she said, adding:\n\nThey know they cannot afford to be seen blocking border security. We have to remember that Nancy Pelosi is not in the Speaker's chair now because voters want to abolish ICE or open the border. The Democrats [in November] won because there were a lot of Democratic candidates who won because they said they were just as hawkish on immigration as Republicans.\n\nPelosi also has to manage her raucous caucus, which includes moderates from swing-districts and progressives who back the Abolish ICE! slogan, Vaughan said.\n\nShe has to satisfy the open borders wing of her caucus [and] not veer too far in the direction of the progressives … I think the Democrats in Congress are more extreme on immigration than most Democratic voters are, but they can't afford to be associated with Abolish ICE! and pro-caravan demands.\n\nOverall, the party want the charade of enforcement, not actual enforcement, and that is true of border security and every other type of enforcement, she said.\n\nOther Democrats are touting technology as a full or partial substitute for a real fence. CNN reported January 4:\n\nIt is nothing more than a symbol when you look at it in this perspective, Bustos said during an interview on CNN's New Day, in reference to President Donald Trump's proposal for a wall. If we have a partial wall, if we have fencing, if we have technology used to keep our borders safe, all of that is fine. But it has just become this symbol that the president is not going to have any give-or-take when it comes to this $5 billion.\n\n.@RepCheri Bustos says the border wall has become nothing more than a symbol, but notes that in the end, we might have to give or take a little bit. It's just the way the world works.https://t.co/oiGb5OgcB7 pic.twitter.com/2aUrs7YK1Z — New Day (@NewDay) January 4, 2019\n\nPelosi is also trying to shift the debate away from fences and towards amnesties: We need to have comprehensive immigration reform … Dreamers and their families and the rest, she said January 10. Comprehensive Immigration Reform is what this debate frankly should be about, she said.\n\nThat Democrats' opposition to a wall is entwined with Democrats' increasing promotion of migrants above Americans and their children.\n\nOn January 4, for example, Pelosi said that a wall is an immorality — it builds walls in peoples' minds about who should come here.\n\nOn January 8, after Trump's national address, Pelosi downplayed the northward flow of economic migrants. The migrants are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counter-productive policies have only deepened, she said.\n\nOn January 10, Pelosi said that Trump's proposed barrier to Central American migration is discriminatory.\n\nIn February 2018, Pelosi gave a long speech in the House where she praised illegal migrants as better than Americans:\n\nWe recognize that they are a blessing to America … the dreamers are all over our country, Mr. Speaker, they are a blessing so across the board … These are the best of the best. They are so fabulous … I was impressed by the cumulative effect that they are making on their country. Each of them with their individual contribution to the greatness of America. So exciting, so proud of them … [They have] great humility about conveying their stories because when you see them and they tell their stories and the passion and the pride — the patriotism, passion, pride, patriotism, that they demonstrate, you will see why anyone who has had the wonderful experience of being in conversation or observing our dreamers, understand why they have had such a high reputation among the American people. some of whom have met them, some of whom have heard about them, some of whom have just catch the spark, catch the spark. Recognize, recognize again the hard work ethic, the commitment to education, to community service, to faith, to family, to the United States of America. It's a beautiful thing … Am I not lucky to be able to become so familiar with so many of these beautiful dreamers? We want to send these people back? This talent, this rich talent, this achievement, this determination, this faith in the future, this patriotism for America? I don't think so. We have to make [an amnesty] happen … Let us acknowledge the dreamers and their optimism, their inspiration to make America more American…\n\nDemocrats are trying to revive the establishment's 'virtual fence' substitute for a physical barrier. G.W. Bush and Obama ran that $1 billion scam from 2005 to 2015, but it only ensured more migrants, lower wages, and Trump's 2016 election. https://t.co/ZAQiunXoKl — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 10, 2019\n\nNationwide, the bipartisan establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. whites, Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
The government of Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro this week pledged to privatize as many state-run industries as possible in an effort to drastically reduce the size of the state.\n\nBolsonaro's new Minister for Infrastructure, Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas, revealed on Thursday that all airports managed today by state-owned Infraero will now be privatized, arguing that this would resolve the delay over contracts signed by former President Dilma Rousseff on the roads and at the Viracopos airport serving Sao Paulo state.\n\nEverything that can be privatized will be privatized, de Freitas said. We are going to test in March the auction of the three airport blocks.\n\nMinister of Economy Paulo Guedes claimed that the main priority of the administration involved the reform of the pension system, as well as widespread privatization and tax simplification.\n\nThe retirement system is currently a factory of inequalities, he explained. Those who legislate have the highest pensions, who they judge have the highest pensions. The Brazilian people and young people.\n\nBolsonaro also made a Twitter announcement about his economic plans on Thursday, promising to attract investment on transport systems such as trains, airports, and port terminals.\n\nWe will quickly attract initial investments for around 7 billion reals, with rail concessions, 12 airports, and 4 port terminals, he wrote. With the confidence of the investor in favorable conditions for the population, we will rescue the initial development of Brazilian infrastructure.\n\nRapidamente atrairemos investimentos iniciais em torno de R$ 7 bi, com concessões de ferrovia, 12 aeroportos e 4 terminais portuários. Com a confiança do investidor sob condições favoráveis à população resgataremos o desenvolvimento inicial da infraestrutura do Brasil. — Jair M. Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) January 3, 2019\n\nThe economic reforms are part of Bolsonaro's plan to reverse the calamitous socialist policies undertaken by former administrations. Excessive public spending led to a crippling recession that ended in 2017, leaving millions in unemployment and worsening the poverty they promised to eradicate.\n\nThis change in direction from previous administrations has excited investors around the world, many of whom believe Bolsonaro's leadership could revitalize Brazil's previously sluggish economy. The Brazilian stock market has already experienced an impressive rally since his election last October, hitting a new high of 91,564 points, with some analysts believing it could reach highs of between 100,000 and 120,000 points this year.\n\nAs part of his embrace of laissez-faire capitalism, Bolsonaro has also pledged to push back against communist movements around the world. Last month, the 63-year-old former army captain called for a global coalition against communism, instead urging people to support the wide struggle for freedom, democracy, and free commerce.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
An opinion piece published in the student newspaper at Texas State University this week tells white people that their DNA is an abomination.\n\nYou were not born white. You became white… You don't give a damn, author Rudy Martinez wrote in the University Star student newspaper.\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner, Martinez was arrested in Washington, DC during President Trump's inauguration. Martinez attempted to crowdfund money to help pay his legal fees, raising $1,345 of a $2,000 goal.\n\nWhiteness will be over because we want it to be, Martinez wrote in the column. And when it dies, there will be millions of cultural zombies aimlessly wandering across a vastly changed landscape. Ontologically speaking, white death will mean liberation for all… Until then, remember this: I hate you because you shouldn't exist. You are both the dominant apparatus on the planet and the void in which all other cultures, upon meeting you, die.\n\nWhen I think of all the white people I have ever encountered – whether they've been professors, peers, lovers, friend, police officers, et cetera – there is perhaps only a dozen I would consider 'decent,' Martinez continued.\n\nThe piece was titled Your DNA is an abomination, and ran under a genre header simply labeled, whiteness. A photograph of the column from the newspaper was provided to the media by former student body president Andrew Homann.\n\nThis is blatant racism against white people for nothing other than the color of their skin. She literally states she hates white people because we shouldn't exist, Homann wrote on Facebook. No one is going to stop Rudy from accomplishing what she wants, I guess aside from her lack of intellect. No one is going to take this paper seriously if the editorial board continues to allow baseless garbage to be published week in and week out.\n\nI have no doubt that racism is still alive today. Look no further than this blatantly racist, divisive article posted by the University Star, Homann told the Washington Examiner. While I believe Mr. Martinez has every right to express his disparaging world-view, I am appalled that the school paper, funded by tuition and tax dollars, would give this guy a platform to do so.\n\nOn Tuesday, Denise Cervantes, the Editor-in-Chief of the University Star, published an editorial note about Martinez's column. The column has received widespread criticism from readers, with many expressing that they find the author's ideas to be racist, she wrote. The University Star's opinion pages are a forum for students to express and debate ideas. While our publication does not endorse every opinion put forth by student columnists or guest contributors, as the editor I take responsibility for what is printed on our pages.\n\nThe original intent of the column was to comment on the idea of race and racial identities, she finished. We acknowledge that the column could have been clearer in its message and that it has caused hurt within our campus community. We apologize and hope that we can move forward to a place of productive dialogue on ways to bring our community together.\n\nMartinez's column no longer appears on the University Star website.\n\nThis story has been updated to remove references to Texas Tech that were originally included.
Planned Parenthood has filed a federal lawsuit against South Carolina in the wake of Gov. Henry McMaster's executive order banning abortion providers from the state's list of Medicaid providers.\n\nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic argues that Medicaid patients have the right to choose Planned Parenthood as their healthcare provider, reports the Post and Courier. The abortion facility also contends that South Carolina already has a shortage of healthcare providers.\n\nJenny Black, the Planned Parenthood affiliate's CEO, said Planned Parenthood and its patients are being irreparably harmed by the governor's order.\n\nThe women and men who come to Planned Parenthood for healthcare aren't doing so to make a political statement, she said. Every day that this continues, both (Planned Parenthood) and our patients are irreparably harmed.\n\nBrian Symmes, a spokesman for McMaster, said in a statement:\n\nGov. McMaster ordered (Health and Human Services) to continue reimbursing family planning providers because he recognizes how important those services are. But like millions of South Carolinians, he believes in the fundamental right to life for unborn children and does not believe tax dollars should go to organizations that perform elective abortions, and he will fight this foolish lawsuit with everything he has.\n\nIn his executive order, the Republican governor made a clear distinction between family planning services and abortion.\n\nAlthough the state should not contract with abortion clinics for family planning services, the state also should not deny South Carolinians' access to necessary medical care and important women's health and family planning services, which are provided by a variety of other non-governmental entities and governmental agencies, McMaster said.\n\nFederally qualified healthcare facilities in South Carolina that accept Medicaid as payment and provide more expansive health services than abortion clinics can be accessed at getyourcare.org. Since 2015, such federally qualified healthcare providers outnumbered Planned Parenthood clinics 268 to 2 in South Carolina.\n\nMcMaster also ordered the state's health agency to use funds left over from last year's budget for health care services for low-income individuals in South Carolina. The governor vetoed nearly $16 million for low-income individuals from the coming year's budget in order to cut Planned Parenthood's funding. The excess funds from last year's budget are providing monies for low-income services without funding abortion clinics.
Why, in the last 12 days of his presidency, did Donald Trump suddenly become the authoritarian of liberal fantasies? He sure wasn't an authoritarian for the past four years — he was a spineless wonder.\n\nWhen it came to the wall, bringing the troops home, ending hedge fund managers' tax loopholes and other campaign promises, Trump backed down to everybody: district court judges, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, the de facto president Jared Kushner, trusted Goldman Sachs alumnus Gary Cohn, useless donors, or any two people raising an objection.\n\nOK, never mind. I didn't know I'd have to get out of my chair. I'll just lie and tell my supporters it's already done.\n\nBut this time, it was finally about him.\n\nFor the items on Trump's 2016 campaign agenda, he actually had solid arguments. On overturning the election, he has no argument at all.\n\nThe bulk of Trump's rally speech last Wednesday consisted of the fanatically detailed claims of a paranoid about the election being stolen. The media, of course, have barely covered this part of the speech, since they're determined to suppress all mentions of any oting-vay aud-fray.\n\nNot to worry, media! I'm angrier after reading Trump's full exegesis on the election than I was when you were hiding it from me.\n\nHe cited vote tallies in this and that county, the media's use of suppression polls, constitutional provisions, the precise time of day votes came in, different states' voting rules and practices, the numbers of felons, dead people and illegal aliens who allegedly voted in various states, and on and on and on.\n\nDo you think Trump has any idea how many illegal aliens are in the country right now?\n\nNone whatsoever. Trump knows more about the accuracy settings on signature verification machines in Clark County, Nevada, than he does about DACA.\n\nFor four years, I've been told that Trump couldn't keep his campaign promises because: No one has ever faced such historic resistance! It's not his fault. Poor Trump!\n\nWell, how hard was it to keep his promises compared to overturning a presidential election?\n\nNow that we've gotten a bracing view of Trump's skills as a demagogue, I just want to know: Why didn't he ever use his powers for good? Why did he never hold a rally on the ellipse and ask his supporters to pressure their representatives to fund the wall? To repeal Section 230? To penalize outsourcing?\n\nNone of those proposals is insane. Now that I think about it, they are the exact ideas that got Trump elected. Another plus: Asking his supporters to lobby for popular issues would not have ended with senators and House members fleeing for their lives.\n\nEven as he was goading his most gullible supporters into criminal activity and — in one case — death, he still didn't give a crap about them.\n\nTrump was delighted by the mob he'd unleashed on the Capitol, but according to sources, appalled by how badly dressed they were. He expressed disgust on aesthetic grounds over how 'low class' his supporters looked, one Trump adviser told New York magazine, adding, He doesn't like low-class things.\n\nWhy are the cameras showing only my overweight supporters? Where are the hot women?\n\nYes, these were the deplorables, the left-behind, working-class Americans hanging on by their fingernails, who had bet their last dollar on Trump. (While we're on the subject, please drop the coup talk, media. We've seen the pictures. These weren't exactly Master of the Universe types.)\n\nDemocrats despise them, and Trump uses them.\n\nFor four years, Trump screwed over these very working-class Americans while giving Sheldon Adelson, Wall Street, and McConnell everything they wanted — sometimes things they didn't even ask for!\n\nClose your eyes … Surprise! I'm giving you the West Bank, too!\n\n(I admire Israel's gumption and even wish we could be more like them, but, seriously, did they even ask for approval of their settlements?)\n\nAt the same time, Trump said to the deplorables: Sorry, I guess we didn't have time to get to the wall…\n\nSo obviously, when it came to launching a mad plan with zero chance of success solely to benefit himself, Trump turned to the weakest members of society, the very people whom he had used to get elected and then betrayed. (Trump's best buddy, Benjamin Netanyahu, congratulated Joe Biden seconds after he was declared the winner.)\n\nIn his rally speech, Trump vowed he'd march to the Capitol with them. Go fight that guy! I'll be right behind you. After the rally, of course, he immediately repaired to the White House, where he could enjoy a nice lunch and watch the poor saps on TV.\n\nTrump sees other humans only in terms of what they can do for him. He will ask for favor after favor after favor, no matter how humiliating or burdensome, but the moment someone says no, will viciously attack him. Ask Jeff Sessions.\n\nThus, Trump came up with the manifestly insane idea that his vice president, Mike Pence, should refuse to certify the electoral votes. All Vice President Pence has to do, Trump said at the rally, is send it back to the states to recertify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people. It's even good for me, too!\n\nOn and on he went: So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he's listening to.\n\nThe vice president, not being a lunatic, had already declined Trump's very special offer — limited time only! — earlier that morning. Trump was setting up his supporters to be furious with Pence when they got to the Capitol and realized he had not awarded the election to Trump.\n\nAt 2:24 p.m., as Trump watched the mob streaming through the Capitol, he tweeted: Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution … Whereupon, some in the crowd began chanting, Hang Mike Pence!\n\nTrump never called to find out if Pence and his family were safe.\n\nFor 48 hours, Trump didn't lower the White House flag to half-mast in honor of Brian Sicknick, the Trump-supporting Capitol Hill Police officer who died from injuries sustained during the siege. The guy could at least have worn a decent shirt. Nor did he call Sicknick's family. Pence did.\n\nSometimes you get the feeling Trump's not really thinking about other people.\n\nThe reason Trump was a lazy, feckless coward for the past four years was that, once it got him elected, he didn't see how the MAGA agenda did anything for him. And the reason he became a whirling dervish of demagogic activity last week was that it was all about him.
Top industry bosses from Britain to Asia have seen staggering salary increases over the past several years, while worker wages in their respective countries have continued to lag far behind.\n\nLeading the pack in the United Kingdom is Britain's Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, the world's largest advertising company. Sorrell took home $90 million in salary and bonus in 2015 — up from his $65 million haul from the year before.\n\nThere is apparently no end yet in sight for the rise and rise of chief executive pay packages, said High Pay Centre director, Stefan Stern. In spite of the occasional flurry from more active shareholders, boards continue to award ever larger amounts of pay to their most senior executives.\n\nStern's outfit published its annual survey, earlier this month, on earnings at the Financial Times Stock Exchange's top 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe largest public companies in London earned an average of $7 million last year and have benefitted from a 10 percent pay raise while wages in the rest of the economy have declined.\n\nThe trend has extended beyond Great Britain's borders.\n\nCEOs in Japan — where 80 percent of the highest-paid executives are from other countries — take home about 67 times more than the average worker. The typical Australian CEO makes 93 times more.\n\nThe average salary of CEOs in India has doubled over the last two years.\n\nTop executives in the U.S. have seen similar salary inflation while worker wages have stagnated.\n\nAt McDonald's in 2014, the CEO to average worker pay ratio was 644 to 1, according to a Bloomberg News analysis.\n\nA 2016 report by Lawrence Mishel and Jessica Schieder of the Economic Policy Institute said CEOs from the 350 largest U.S.-based companies by sales took home an average of 276 times what the average worker at their company earns.\n\nDecades before the current rise in worldwide globalism, the United States Congress passed an Internal Revenue Service rule requiring all salaries above $1 million to be deemed as performance-based, forcing corporate tax deductions to kick in. Instead of slashing corporate pay, the law led to a rise in salaries. Companies, advised by high-priced consultants, began giving out stock options tied to performance-based goals that paved the way to the wide pay gap in today's global workforce, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nToday, from a maximum wage proposal to a push to raise the federal minimum wage, there's seemingly more makeshift solutions to the problem than there is political will to solve it.\n\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson.
The Algemeiner reports: JNS.org – The French government has denied a controversial report regarding a secretive department within the French Finance Ministry that allegedly targets Jews for tax evasion. France's General Directorate of Public Finance (DGFiP) stated that it categorically denies the completely unfounded assertions released today in the Globes newspaper, about the creation of a French tax department specializing in French Jews.\n\nThere is no such structure within the French tax administration. The French tax law forbids any distinction between people based on their origin, place of residence, nationality or religion, DGFiP added.\n\nThe denial came after the Israeli financial news outlet Globes reported last week that a one of a kind investigative department in France's Finance Ministry had 20 Hebrew-speaking employees and was in the process of hiring additional workers. The employees in the department were purportedly experts in Israeli law and able to discern whether or not French Jews were using Israel as a tax haven.\n\nRead more here.
In a column for the Hollywood Reporter, Senior Editor Eriq Gardner notes that Hollywood's major film industry players — who have often been the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump and his administration's policies — could actually be among the greatest beneficiaries of the president's proposed tax cuts.\n\nFrom the Hollywood Reporter:\n\nIf Donald Trump gets his way on tax reform, Hollywood actors, directors, and writers stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries. Understanding why takes some appreciation of the fact that the entertainment industry isn't just five big corporations, but also thousands of smaller ones — almost all incredibly obscure even if their owners are quite famous.\n\nAs the tax code currently stands, the richest individuals pay almost 40 percent on individual income (or less after deductions). Businesses pay a separate rate, which Trump wishes to set at 15 percent. Most importantly, the proposal outlined by the Trump Administration has this latter rate being applied to all businesses, including pass-through organizations like S corporations that distribute a salary to employee-owners and count the rest as profits. Under the current law, personal income and business income is taxed roughly the same, but if Trump succeeds, many folks may aim to establish mini-corporations for themselves to get their taxes down to 15 percent.\n\nGuess what? Many in Hollywood are largely set up already thanks to loan-out corporations that contract out services like acting and directing to production studios. Alas, alongside the 21st Century Fox's and Time Warner's come Kaling International (Mindy Kaling), Kimsaprincess Inc. (Kim Kardashian), Snooker Doodle (Emily Deschanel), Rogue Marble (Sylvester Stallone) and so forth.\n\n…
On Thursday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Special Report, Vice President Mike Pence stated of the Obamacare replacement bill, I think we're going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we're all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we've replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people's choices and giving states more flexibility, then that's where we're headed.\n\nPence said, [T]he legislation introduced this week in the House begins that process [of repealing and replacing Obamacare]. We're open and talking about ways we can improve that bill, but that combined with administrative action by the secretary of Health and Human Service,s and ultimately by, likely additional legislation, will get us to a point before we get to the spring this year where Obamacare will be gone, and it will be replaced with the kind of healthcare system that gives the American people more choices in their health insurance and gives states more freedom and more flexibility to provide Medicaid in the best way they see fit for our most vulnerable.\n\nWhen asked about objections to the repeal and replace in three phases, Pence responded, I think they can count on President Trump's going to be a man of his word. And the president made a commitment to not only repeal Obamacare, but to replace it with the kind of reforms that would allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines, the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance, and by giving states the flexibility to implement reforms in Medicaid a little bit like we did in the state of Indiana, where those programs will better serve our most vulnerable citizens.\n\nHe further stated, in response to a question the bill can be changed, I think we're going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we're all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we've replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people's choices and giving states more flexibility, then that's where we're headed.\n\nPence was then asked, So, eventually it's going to come down to that binary choice. And you're going to expend political capital to make sure it gets across the finish line?\n\nHe answered, President Donald Trump is a man of his word. … [H]e decided, the day after the election Bret, that that number one priority, the first priority of the Congress when they came back, is to keep his word to repeal and replace Obamacare. And we're going to make sure it happens.\n\nHe concluded, The central element of the president's vision for healthcare reform is to expand to a national marketplace, to allow the American people to purchase health insurance across state lines. … The president and I envision an American healthcare economy where people literally have hundreds or even thousands of health insurance products, not ordered by the government, but that they can choose from, and have some assistance from the government through tax credits and other ways to participate.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
President Trump called out Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos on Twitter, Sunday, referring to the billionaire as Jeff Bozo in a post to Twitter.\n\nSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post, President Trump declared.

A Kansas man has requested that an Iowa court grant his motion for a trial by combat to settle a custody dispute with his ex-wife and her attorney on the battlefield.\n\nDavid Ostrom, 40, of Paola, Kansas, has cited in court documents that his ex-wife, Bridgette Ostrom, 38, of Harlan, Iowa, has destroyed (him) legally, the Des Moines Register reported Monday.\n\nThe Carroll Times-Herald reported that Ostrom filed a request with the Iowa District Court in Shelby County to give him 12 weeks to source or forge Japanese swords used in battle.\n\nTo this day, trial by combat has never been explicitly banned or restricted as a right in these United States, Ostrom argues in court records, adding that it was used as recently as 1818 in British Court.\n\nOstrom told the Register that he got the idea for the duel after he learned about a 2016 New York Supreme Court case in which New York Supreme Court Justice Philip Minardo said that duels had not been abolished under state law.\n\nOstrom said the motion began when he became frustrated with his ex-wife's attorney, Matthew Hudson, saying he wanted to take the fight to the field of battle where (he) will rend their souls from their corporal bodies.\n\nHudson filed a resistance to Ostrom's trial by combat motion by doing a little spelling check.\n\nSurely (Ostrom) meant 'corporeal' bodies which Merriam Webster defines as having, consisting of, or relating to, a physical material body, the attorney wrote. Although (Ostrom) and potential combatant do have souls to be rended, they respectfully request that the court not order this done.\n\nHudson argued that a duel could end in one or both parties dying, which could outweigh custody and property tax issues.\n\nIt should be noted that just because the U.S. and Iowa constitutions do not specifically prohibit battling another person with a deadly katana sword, it does prohibit a court sitting in equity from ordering same, Hudson wrote.\n\nThe Iowa attorney also asked that the court take away Ostrom's visitation rights and make him undergo court-ordered psychotherapy.\n\nOstrom later admitted to misspelling the word but argued that he did not have any mental health issues.\n\nThe court has not made a decision on either party's motions.\n\nIn modern times, the right to trial by combat has been struck down in other courts around the world. In a 2003 case in the United Kingdom, a court ruled against a man who wished to invoke a trial by combat to settle a £25 fine for a minor motor vehicle offense, the Telegraph reported.
Foxconn Technology had big plans to build television displays in Wisconsin.\n\nThen the price of televisions in the United States crashed.\n\nFoxconn said Wednesday that it is rethinking its ambitious plans to build LCD displays in a factory in Wisconsin. In an interview with Reuters, a Foxconn executive said the company would instead use the site for research purposes rather than manufacturing.\n\nThe compaany said it remains committed to the project, the creation of 13,000 jobs and to our long-term investment in Wisconsin. But because the global market environment that existed when the project was first announced in 2017 has shifted, this has necessitated the adjustment of plans for all projects, including Wisconsin.\n\nFoxconn did not provide details about what global market changes had impacted its plans.\n\nMedia reports have cited tight labor markets and higher wages in the U.S. Manufacturing labor costs, however, are up just over 2 percent for the year.\n\nLouis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn CEO Terry Gou, told Reuters in a story published Wednesday that it is scaling back and possibly shelving plans to build liquid crystal display panel screens.\n\nIn terms of TV, we have no place in the U.S., Woo told Reuters. We can't compete.\n\nThe biggest challenge to its original plan to invest $10 billion to build a 22-million square foot liquid-crystal display panel plant is not labor costs in the U.S. What has changed is that the prices of televisions have undergone a stunning decline.\n\nCompared with a year ago, television prices have declined 18.6 percent, according to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThat makes it much harder to turn a profit while paying workers in the U.S.\n\nThere's no ready explanation for the decline in television prices. Industry experts say a slowdown in housing may be playing a role, although the price drop has been so steep that the housing market's woes seem insufficient. Some, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have said it is possible foreign manufacturers are illegally dumping televisions on the U.S. market at cut-rate prices.\n\nFoxconn is based in Taiwan but does the bulk of its manufacturing, including making Apple's iPhones, in China. It is the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer and the largest private employer in China.\n\nThe much-ballyhooed facility was heralded by President Donald Trump and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to return manufacturing to the Midwest and the United States. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers has criticized the tax incentives offered to Foxconn as too generous.\n\nAmerica is open for business more than it has ever been open for business. Made in the USA: It's all happening and it's happening very, very quickly, Trump said in June after visiting the Foxconn site. Today we're seeing the results of the pro-America agenda. America First, Make America Great Again. Greatest phrase ever used in politics, I suspect.\n\nEvery step of the way Foxconn has overpromised and under-delivered, said Democratic Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz in a statement. This news is devastating for the taxpayers of Wisconsin. We were promised manufacturing jobs. We were promised state of the art LCD production. We were promised a game-changing economic opportunity for our state. And now, it appears Foxconn is living up to their failed track record in the U.S. — leaving another state and community high and dry.\n\nThe president of Wisconsin's Technology Council, Tom Still, said he's not surprised that Foxconn wants to change course since televisions are becoming less expensive and iPhone sales are declining.\n\nStill, a supporter of the project, noted the company has already invested as much as $200 million in Wisconsin so he's not worried that the company might pull out.\n\nI do think that it's likely that they'll adjust to what the market conditions are, said Still, whose group nurtures tech in Wisconsin and advises state leaders on policy.\n\n–The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Less than a year after Massachusetts voters approved legalizing marijuana and taxing it at a rate of 12 percent, lawmakers already seek a larger take of the dealer's cut.\n\nIn shifting marijuana from decriminalized to legal status, voters permitted a maximum tax of 12 percent on sales of the sweet leaf. Seven months later, the state legislature seeks to grab more of pot profits by permitting taxes as high as 28 percent.\n\nIt's not as though those in the reefer business didn't see the state coming for their business.\n\nNine years ago, I sat down with two longtime pot dealers in the Beacon Hill Pub a short walk from where the Great and General Court does business. The sixtysomething sinsemilla sectaries viewed legalization as a way to corporatize a mom-and-pop enterprise.\n\nShould it be legal? Yes. Do we want it legal? No, declared cue-balled Charlie, dealing for decades within eyeshot of the state capitol. Mark, sporting a Pancho Villa mustache, informed, Every time I go over to Hempfest, I chant: 'Keep Marijuana Illegal.\n\nAt the time, a pot legalization proposal sought to impose a $150-an-ounce tax on the low-grade marijuana most commonly bought and smoked. In effect, the proposal aimed to double the price of a joint. This go-around, the proposed law allows for an end-around on the taxes by smokers using medical marijuana, which the bill exempts from the proposed taxation.\n\nIf you had to pay the licensing fee, it wouldn't necessarily be cost prohibitive, Mark explained. But with the taxes, your clientele is going to disappear. A lot of people would just balk at paying that.\n\nApart from raising taxes, the 48-page omnibus bill currently before the Great and General Court seeks to expand a cannabis board to five members, prohibit localities from enforcing laws against the transportation or delivery of pot, maintain a database on people using medical marijuana, and seize weed from those, such as Charlie and Mark, not given the state's imprimatur to sell. The proposed law authorizes investigations and audits of the pot dispensaries. It imposes stringent testing on the product. And it directs the authorized marijuana dealers to abide by an affirmative action program in hiring.\n\nFor pot dealers not keen on turning over their profits to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or eager to undergo annual audits, the law establishes a division of cannabis enforcement in the attorney general's office regarding a product that voters just legalized and long ago decriminalized.\n\nIronically, veteran dealers such as Mark and Charlie face a government more eager to put them out of business now than when they peddled an illegal product as consumers may boost their business by more enthusiastically turning to their cheaper, black-market pot.\n\nThe more than 54 percent who voted to legalize marijuana in November's election authorized a tax of no more than 12 percent. The 28 percent tax represents a 133 percent increase over the initial rate. Legislators seek to hold a vote on Thursday. Smoking citizens may counter by voting with their wallets.
Officials from the Treasury and the Department for Exiting the European Union have made contact with the City to discuss the best way to sever ties with the political bloc before the Government triggers Article 50.\n\nMeetings have been held between the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and top business lobby groups including the British Bankers' Association, the Confederation of British Industry, and City of London on how best to exit the European Union (EU), with officials wanting to draw up a plan of action before Article 50 is triggered, the Daily Express reported.\n\nThey have also had input from David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, who has been dubbed Minister for Brexit.\n\nThe Department has said: We are in the process of consulting various stakeholders, including the City of London, to ensure our approach will get the best deal for Britain.\n\nIt has been reported that officials have discussed the issue of passporting rights, which allow UK-based banks to set up branches in countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Talks have revealed a willingness among some top figures to abandon passporting, despite early calls to stay in the single market.\n\nMark Boleat has said: It's no good having a wish list that's not realistic – that's not what the Government wants. What it wants to know is: does Brexit mean the loss of 5pc of investment banking jobs? In which case – OK. If it means the loss of 30pc of these jobs, then what's the implication of tax revenue? Is passporting worth fighting for?\n\nMr. Boleat has cast doubt over the possibility of the UK securing a Norway-style deal to remain in the EEA, saying that accepting the free movement of people and accepting EU rules whilst paying large sums to Brussels would not be politically acceptable.\n\nAnthony Browne, Chief Executive of the British Bankers' Association, has said: We are not calling for membership of the single market – what we want is full two-way access to EU markets.\n\nNews of the discussions came as a survey conducted by ConservativeHome has shown that grassroots Conservative members do not think that the Norway option would not be a good deal for Britain.\n\nA majority of those polled at 69 per cent want a deal where the UK does not remain a single market member, and immigration is subject to full control rather than a time-limited emergency brake. This is compared to just 26% who wanted a Norway-style arrangement with the EU.\n\nNorway is part of the EEA, and apart from fisheries and agriculture, all other rules, including product registration and workers' regulations, are dictated by the EU. Legislation is made in Brussels without Norway's contribution to the decision making.\n\nUnder the European Economic Area Agreement. the Scandinavian country pays annually €391 million to 15 beneficiary states, €447 million a year to participate in certain EU schemes, and well as other smaller contributions – still in the millions of euros – to access other schemes.\n\nIn exchange, Norway has access to the single market – but must have free movement of people, an issue that swung the EU referendum vote in favour of Brexit.\n\nFollow Victoria Friedman on Twitter Follow @friedmanpress or e-mail: vfriedman@breitbart.com
President Joe Biden on his first day on the job axed the Keystone XL Pipeline, drawing the ire of union workers, industry stakeholders, and GOP lawmakers whose states will be negatively impacted by the decision.\n\nMike Sommers, president and CEO of trade group American Petroleum Institute, said Biden's announcement is a slap in the face to the thousands of union workers who are already a part of this safe and sustainable project.\n\nThis misguided move will hamper America's economic recovery, undermine North American energy security, and strain relations with one of America's greatest allies, Sommers said.\n\nMark McManus, general president of the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters, said in a statement:\n\nIn revoking this permit, the Biden Administration has chosen to listen to the voices of fringe activists instead of union members and the American consumer on Day 1. Let me be very clear: When built with union labor by the men and women of the United Association, pipelines like Keystone XL remain the safest and most efficient modes of energy transportation in the world.\n\nSadly, the Biden administration has now put thousands of union workers out of work, McManus said. For the average American family, it means energy costs will go up and communities will no longer see the local investments that come with pipeline construction.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board also responded to Biden's move, concluding that not only is it destructive to the U.S. economy but possibly illegal:\n\nSince 2000 the U.S. has led the world in energy-related emissions reductions as natural gas from shale hydraulic fracturing has replaced coal in power production. China's Paris commitment doesn't require it to cut emissions for another decade. Russia's are set to rise for years. Last November Russian oil giant Rosneft launched a massive exploration project in the Arctic. Mineral resources will remain a competitive advantage of Russia's economy, and will determine the place and role of the country in the world, Russia's strategic mineral plan says. Killing Keystone won't keep fossil fuels in the ground. It will merely strand billions of dollars in Canadian investment and kill thousands of U.S. jobs while enriching adversaries and alienating an ally. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has promised to use all legal avenues available to protect its Keystone investment if Mr. Biden killed the pipeline. [TC Energy] can avail itself of Nafta's investor-dispute settlement provision until June 2022, which would allow it to recoup its investment. The company also has a strong legal case that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress, not the President, power over foreign trade and that Mr. Biden's reversal violates due process.\n\nAnd some members of Congress are fighting back by introducing legislation to authorize the continued construction of the pipeline. Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) said:\n\nIt's only day one, and with the stroke of a pen, Biden has already taken steps to kill American energy projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline which is critical to energy producing states like Montana. This project will create thousands of jobs, generate tax revenue for local communities, promote North American energy security and independence, and it is the safest and most environmentally friendly way to transport oil. We must do all that we can to ensure construction moves forward.\n\nSen. James Inhofe (R-OK) said:\n\nWe came so far during the last administration – from prioritizing American energy development to ending the far-left's war on fossil fuels. The Keystone XL pipeline would create thousands of jobs in Oklahoma and throughout the nation and President Biden's disappointing choice today to revoke this permit will harm the nation's tremendous progress toward energy independence. I am sad to see this decision to continue the failed Obama-era legacy of denying tens of thousands of Americans good, well-paying jobs at the expense of satisfying liberal, 'Green New Deal' inspired interest groups.\n\nIt is a sad day for the future of American energy independence, but I will not stop fighting for legislation and other policies that keep energy costs down and further our energy and national security, Inhofe.\n\n[Keystone XL Pipeline is expected to provide approximately 11,000 direct high-paying jobs and up to 60,000 indirect and direct jobs, generate tax revenue, increase renewable-energy demand, reduce emissions and strengthen North American energy independence, the lawmakers' press release said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com
Tuesday on ABC's The View, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) said it is fantastic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is challenging the status quo, with policy proposals reflecting the ideology of the socialist left.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nMCCAIN: I wanted to ask you. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She was on 60 Minutes this weekend proudly calling herself a radical. And she's promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car should be eliminated within the next eleven years. Everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly and this ideology of the socialist left could splinter your party?\n\nHARRIS: No. You know, I think she's challenging the status quo. I think that's fantastic. I think that. You know, I used to teach, before, especially before, the last few years. And the thing I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it's good for the party. I frankly think it's good for the country. Let's look at the bold ideas. And I'm eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend the status quo, then do it. If there's not merit, let's explore new ideas.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) on Thursday called on Congress to investigate Robinhood's decision to restrict purchases of GameStop shares after Reddit users sent the stock soaring this week.\n\nWe need an investigation into RobinhoodApp's decision and who influenced that, Khanna wrote on Twitter. And this shows the need for a financial transaction tax on hedge fund shorting and SEC regulations on short selling practices.\n\nYes @aoc. We need an investigation into RobinhoodApp's decision and who influenced that. And this shows the need for a financial transaction tax on hedge fund shorting and SEC regulations on short selling practices. https://t.co/mYX8Ab3JwH — Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) January 28, 2021\n\nKhanna's comment came in response to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) expressing support for the House Committee on Financial Services to hold a hearing on Robinhood's actions.\n\nWe now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit. As a member of the Financial Services Cmte, I'd support a hearing if necessary, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\n\nAdditionally, Senate Republicans such as Ted Cruz (TX) and Mike Lee (UT) also signaled their support in getting to the bottom of Robinhood's stock trading restrictions.\n\nWe should investigate, Lee said.\n\nRobinhood and other retail brokerages are taking steps to tamp down the speculative frenzy surrounding companies such as GameStop, but the actions only sparked more volatility and an outcry from users of the platforms and some members of Congress that small investors are being treated unfairly.\n\nGameStop stock has rocketed from below $20 earlier to close around $350 Wednesday as a volunteer army of investors on social media challenged big institutions who had placed market bets that the stock would fall.\n\nThe action was even wilder Thursday: The stock swung between $112 and $483. At midday it was down 27% at $255.\n\nRobinhood said Thursday investors would only be able to sell their positions and not open new ones in some cases, and Robinhood will try to slow the amount of trading using borrowed money.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
More than 20 Manhattan investigators from the district attorney's office raided the offices of Newsweek magazine and its parent company IBT Media on Thursday, reports say.\n\nInvestigators were seen photographing Newsweek's servers, but it appeared at the time that no files were downloaded, according to the New York Post.\n\nOne source said that the investigators were paying special attention to the serial numbers on the servers.\n\nEmployees initially reported that the investigators were from the New York Police Department, but a department spokesman said the NYPD was not involved in the raid.\n\nLast month, the IRS placed a $1.2 million tax lien against Etienne Uzac, co-founder of IBT Media, owner of the magazine. IBT purchased Newsweek in 2013 after it had announced the end of its print edition. Under its new owners, the magazine reemerged as a print edition in 2014. the magazine's home offices double as IBT Media HQ.\n\nNeither Newsweek, its owners, nor the Manhattan DA's office have issued any statement about Thursday's raid.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.
Americans in the market for luxury homes are searching in the French Riviera because of President Trump, according to a real estate expert.\n\nWhile many Americans are also looking to buy properties overseas because of a strong dollar and low interest rates, one real estate expert says that President Trump's election has caused a spike in luxury housing sales, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMy phone started ringing the morning after he became president, and it hasn't stopped since, said Adrian Leeds, a Paris-based real estate expert who was born in the United States and is a regular guest on HGTV's House Hunters International.\n\nI'm signing contracts every single day from Americans who are either getting the hell out of Dodge or are thinking that they need backup homes. There are people who have profited from the stock market, and they don't know what effect Trump's going to have going forward, so they're looking for somewhere to put their money, Leeds added.\n\nFor prospective home buyers in France, there is no residency requirement to own a home there, and there are low property taxes. However, it is also difficult for many Americans to get a mortgage in France, and properties priced at $1 million or more have a higher tax rate.\n\nProperty taxes in France went up by an average of 14.7 percent between 2010-2015, according to English-language French news site the Local.\n\nAmerican homeowners who seek to rent their homes out are taxed on their profits, and people who own their homes for less than 15 years pay a capital gains tax of about 33 percent.\n\nBut despite the trade-offs of home ownership in France, real estate agents say it is a great time to buy property in France.\n\nIt is actually a buyer's market. There are a lot of properties for sale, but it's also a very stable market, said Angie Delattre, who works for a luxury property firm that specializes in real estate in the French Riviera.\n\nSome people have decided to give up their homes in favor of traveling the world. One such Maryland couple sold their house and embarked on a journey around the world in search of a new home after Trump's election.
Chancellor George Osborne has used the death of Jo Cox MP to demand Brexit supporters use more facts and less divisive political debate seconds before comparing UKIP to the Nazis and reasserting his discredited doomsday predictions for the economy.\n\nLook, first of all, I hope because of the tragic death of Jo [Cox] we can have a less divisive political debate in our country, he said on ITV this morning.\n\nAnd, particularly in the last few days of this referendum, we can have less baseless assertion and inflammatory rhetoric and more reasoned argument and facts, he added.\n\nThen, in the same interview, he went on to say that UKIP and Nigel Farage's breaking point poster was disgusting and vile, and had echoes of 1930s Nazi propaganda – himself echoing writers in the Guardian and a trades union boss, Dave Prentis of Unison, who reported the poster to the police for inciting hatred.\n\nYet even fellow Conservative MPs were shocked at how the Chancellor had so bluntly and shamelessly used the good name of the late Ms. Cox for political capital, just 48 hours after her death.\n\nMr. Osborne said UKIP were whipping up concerns, whipping up division, and making baseless assertions that millions of people are going to come into the country in the next couple of years from Turkey.\n\nAdding: That is what we should say no to. And, this referendum vote is a vote on the kind of Britain we want… do we want a meaner, narrower Britain that is poorer in every sense of the word? he asked.\n\nFor the remaining days [of the campaign], the people who are undecided in this referendum do want to hear the reasoned arguments and they want to hear the facts, he also said.\n\nAdding: And, I think it's important for people to understand that if we vote leave there is no turning back. It's a one-way door to a much more uncertain world where people's jobs and their livelihoods are at risk.\n\nGeorge Osborne's idea of reasoned argument and facts — presented in the past week — include his widely mocked doomsday predictions for a post-Brexit economy, based on figures from an independent organisation mostly funded by the European Union (EU) and British government.\n\nHis so-called 'Brexit emergency budget' was slammed by dozens of MPs in his own party, who promised to vote it down, as it was effectively using his power to threaten voters with punitive cuts and tax rises if they choose to vote against him.
The president of Jefferson Parish (JP) in Louisiana is facing petitions for recall after refusing to resign his post following allegations that he sent sexually explicit text messages to a 17 year-old boy.\n\nMike Yenni, a 40 year-old married father and lieutenant in the Naval Reserve, admits he sent inappropriate text messages to a teen boy when he was mayor of Kenner in 2015. Yenni did not indicate the details of the message nor identify the boy, reports WDSU.\n\nJefferson Parish Pres Mike Yenni in closed-door meeting with administration. @wdsu details @ 6 pic.twitter.com/Abbbts2QhF — Jennifer Crockett (@CrockettWDSU) October 10, 2016\n\nFBI investigators have interviewed at least four people regarding the sexting messages. Yenni – who has not been charged with a crime – sent sexually explicit text message to the teen after noticing him at a high school event, reports WWL-TV, which continues:\n\nThe youth who received the messages said Yenni, who was then the mayor of Kenner, first saw him at a function at his high school, a local Catholic institution. He said a mutual friend, who was 19 at the time, helped Yenni connect with him. … The friend, who allegedly helped connect the two, declined to be interviewed by WWL-TV. The youth said he and Yenni began to talk on the phone and text one another, and soon, the politician came to visit him at his job at a mall food court. They met in a bathroom, the youth said, and Yenni gave him some designer underwear. They kissed briefly. The texting continued, becoming more explicit over time. The youth provided WWL-TV what he says are copies of the text exchanges that were recovered after they were deleted, on the condition that the station not directly quote from them. Printouts of the messages appear to indicate they came from a cell phone account linked to Yenni in multiple online search engines. WWL-TV called the number in June and got the same outgoing voicemail message, featuring Yenni's voice, as could be heard on Yenni's official parish cell phone at the time. The phone listed on the printouts of the text messages is not billed to taxpayers. According to printouts of those texts, Yenni tells the teen he wants him naked. Days later, Yenni writes to ask the 17-year-old if he's worn the underwear Yenni bought him. Yenni says he wants to see him model it. Then Yenni texts the teen to say he wants to perform a sex act on him that night. The youth, who is openly gay and is now in college, said in an interview with WWL-TV that he wants to expose Yenni's behavior because he finds it disturbing. While the youth was initially flattered and intrigued by Yenni's overtures, he said the texts and phone conversations began to make him uncomfortable, such as one proposing three-way sex with him and the 19-year-old mutual friend. He asked me to go with him to his house in Oxford (Mississippi), the youth said. Records show Yenni owns an apartment there. Also, the way he would describe the sexual things he wanted to do to me. And he asked me to be a secretary or assistant in his office; that way I could be with him and not be questioned. Weeks after the sexting began, in June 2015, the youth said he broke off communication and blocked Yenni's number.\n\nIn a statement from his office Monday, Yenni, a Republican, announced that he will not resign his position because the incident at the center of this allegation is personal and, in no way, does it impact my ability to govern.\n\nI have read with humility your request for my resignation, Yenni said. While I understand your position and your concerns, I have and will continue to dutifully perform the obligations of the Office of Parish President.\n\nYenni continued:\n\nAs I noted in my statement, my actions are regrettable, and I am penitent. I have accepted responsibility for my poor judgment, and I apologized publicly to all parties involved. I did not violate any laws, I have not been contacted by any investigatory agency, especially the FBI, regarding this allegation. I want to put this in the proper perspective. I have been true to the oath that I have taken. I stated clearly that I never abused or misused my powers as a public official and there has been no misuse of tax dollars or public assets. And, I will work harder than ever to prove that good can rise from a bad decision.\n\nYenni is facing a chorus of calls for his resignation and warnings to stay clear of school campuses.\n\nJefferson Parish Council members called upon Yenni to resign, and the school board discussed banning him from their schools. Both the Gretna and Westwego City Councils voted for his resignation. Assessor Tom Capella, clerk of court Jon Gegenheimer, coroner Gerry Cvitanovich and sheriff Newell Normand also called for Yenni's resignation.\n\nU.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Majority Whip, cancelled his fundraiser scheduled with Yenni, citing the deeply concerning allegations.\n\nNationally, the New York Post cited Yenni's bizarre infomercial in which he admitted to the sexting scandal.\n\nMetairie attorney Robert Evans III filed a petition Wednesday to begin a recall.\n\nAttorney G. Patrick Hand III tells Breitbart News he is also filing for a recall drive. In his petition, Hand says:\n\nI don't care about Mr. Yenni's sexual preference (male or female). It makes absolutely no difference to me. However, the fact that Mr. Yenni did this with a minor, regardless of the age of consent in LA (17 y.o.a.), is very disturbing to me and many others. The fact that Mr. Yenni met his victim at an alumni function held by Mr. Yenni's Alma Mater, which is the same school the victim attended at the time (Jesuit High School), is very disturbing to me and many others. Many people believe Mr. Yenni used his power and influence to gain access to the 17 year old boy in question, and that he has used his power and influence to attempt to gain access to other minors. I am being told by members of Mr. Yenni's own family that there is much more to this story than simply sending inappropriate texts to a young man, as Mr. Yenni put it in his recent apology video.\n\nTerri Timmcke, a Jefferson Parish resident who asked for Yenni's resignation at the JP Council meeting and is also a member of the STOP Common Core Coalition in Louisiana, tells Breitbart News, The members of the activist group are all concerned about the welfare of our school children, and so many are sharing information on social media sites and contacting public officials in the hopes that widespread outrage will compel President Yenni to resign.\n\nMy biggest fear is that we, as a society, are now going to accept immoral behavior from public officials as long as it is not technically 'illegal,' she added.\n\nBreitbart News contacted Yenni for comment through his email address but received no response.
Multinational corporation General Motors (GM) sought to import nearly 2,800 foreign workers in the last three years to take U.S. jobs while laying off American workers.\n\nGM will be laying off at least 4,250 of its white-collar workers in Canada and America — with the vast majority in the U.S. — starting next week.\n\nThe layoffs are just a small component of the corporation's mass layoff scheme of 14,700 workers in North America — including at least 3,300 American factory workers. Meanwhile, GM is ramping up production of electric cars in China.\n\nIn 2019, GM expects to stop production at four American plants, including Detroit-Hamtramck and Warren Transmission in Michigan, Lordstown Assembly in Ohio, and Baltimore Operations in Maryland. This comes after GM laid off about 1,500 American workers in Lordstown in 2018, while their Mexico production remained unaffected.\n\nAt the same time GM has been laying off American workers, the corporation has been importing foreign workers from countries like India, China, Brazil, and South Korea.\n\nBlack Monday: GM to Layoff 4K American White-Collar Workershttps://t.co/2seec0UrBv — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) February 2, 2019\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018, GM attempted to outsource nearly 700 American jobs in Warren, Michigan, to foreign workers brought in on the H-1B visa. The corporation also tried to outsource 167 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign workers in Detroit, Michigan, another 154 U.S. jobs in Milford, Michigan, an additional 82 U.S. jobs in Pontiac, Michigan, and about 20 U.S. jobs in Roswell, Georgia.\n\nEvery year, more than 100,000 foreign workers are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program.\n\nLast year, alone, U.S. businesses attempted to outsource nearly 420,000 American jobs to foreign workers, a population that exceeds the total population of Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe U.S. high-paying jobs GM outsourced to foreign workers while laying off American workers over the last three years include nearly 320 electrical engineering jobs, nearly 320 mechanical engineering jobs, more than 220 software developer jobs, and about 66 commercial and industrial designer jobs.\n\nGM even outsourced nearly 150 U.S. jobs at its financial services wing in Arlington, Fort Worth, and Irving, Texas, as well as financial jobs in Detroit, Michigan, and Charlotte, North Carolina. The vast majority of these foreign workers imported to take these jobs were from India.\n\nThe United Auto Workers (UAW) union has launched a campaign urging consumers to boycott GM for their offshoring and outsourcing business practices that is leaving thousands of American workers laid off just years after the corporation was bailed out by U.S. taxpayers and received a massive tax cut.\n\nCompanies like General Motors have an obligation to build where they sell and stop exporting jobs abroad, UAW President Gary Jones said in a statement. After all, we invested in General Motors in their darkest days. Now they need to invest in us.\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported, more than 2.7 million H-1B foreign workers have been approved to come to the U.S. to take American jobs between 2007 and 2017. During that same period, businesses tried to outsource almost 3.5 million American jobs to foreign workers instead of hiring Americans.\n\nAbout four million young Americans enter the workforce each year, many looking for white-collar jobs in the STEM fields. Those Americans' prospects of finding work are crippled by the country's legal immigration process, which admits more than 1.5 million immigrants and hundreds of thousands of foreign visa workers annually.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The New York Times on Friday begrudgingly acknowledged that Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite, the latest blockbuster investigative work by Breitbart News senior contributor and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer, contains building blocks for scandals involving a number of 2020 Democratic hopefuls.\n\nThe Times featured a piece by Nicole Hemmer, who, throughout the piece, charges conservative media with minimizing not just impeachment but the full array of President Trump's misconduct.\n\nBut minimization is only half the strategy to protect Republican control of the White House. The other half is scandalization: an effort to create an air of nonstop scandal around previous Democratic presidents and presidential hopefuls, she contends.\n\nShe directly cites Schweizer's latest book Profiles in Corruption in an effort to build her case but appears to do the opposite, admitting that the investigative work — which contains a number of bombshells on top progressive leaders, candidates and non-candidates, like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Mayor Eric Garcetti — provides building blocks for scandals involving a number of 2020 Democratic hopefuls, albeit with a dismissive tone.\n\nHemmer writes:\n\nThe Breitbart contributor Peter Schweizer followed Clinton Cash, a book that helped spread the Uranium One conspiracy, with Secret Empires, which targeted Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden. Mr. Schweizer's most recent book, Profiles in Corruption, provides building blocks for scandals involving a number of 2020 Democratic hopefuls, like the daft tidbit that Senator Elizabeth Warren's son-in-law produced a film with support from two Iranian organizations. The investors, Mr. Schweizer wrote, might appear at first glance to be innocuous cultural organizations — but they are not. Both are funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government. It may not seem like much, but as the birtherism conspiracy shows, scandals have been rooted in less.\n\nHowever, Hemmer's attempt to equate Schweizer's book to wild conspiracy theories falls flat, as his work contains 1,126 endnotes with concrete evidence stemming from corporate and legal records, lobbyist disclosures, property records, White House visitor logs, tax liens, and federal bankruptcies, among other documents.\n\nBreitbart News has detailed several of the bombshell revelations featured in Schweizer's book, including Warren's son-in-law's ties to the Iranian regime via his production company, Tricolor Films.\n\nIn 2008, Warren's son-in-law, Sushil Tyagi, produced a film called The Song of Sparrows, which was directed by Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi. As Schweizer discovered, the movie's chief investors were funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government.\n\nAs Profiles in Corruption details:\n\nThe full credits of the film, for some reason, seem to also have been scrubbed from the internet. We obtained a copy by using the Wayback machine and made a startling discovery: the movie's chief investors included none other than the social deputy of the State Welfare Organization (SWO) of Iran (SWO-معاونت اجتماعی سازمان بهزیستی کشور) as well as the Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran. (سازمان فرهنگی و هنری شهرداری تهران) These two investors in the film might appear at first glance to be innocuous cultural organizations—but they are not. Both are funded and controlled by the Islamist Iranian government. The Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran states: This organization was founded in 1996 and [does] its activities under the supervision of a board of trustees composed of various cultural institutions such as IRIB and Islamic propaganda organization.\n\nBreitbart News broke down the revelation further:\n\nThe Cultural and Artistic Organization of Tehran's page promotes cultural events such as one for school children entitled The Seal of Hostages, attended by several top Iranian officials, according to the book. Another event is the inherently antisemitic Quds Day on the last day of Ramadan. The organization also arranges marches, as well as organizes posters and other materials, for Quds Day. Its site says, A new plan for the destruction of Israel will be launched, and the Quds Cultural Radio station will be located at the Radio Station. Also, the 'I love the fight against Israel' is distributed among the people. Schweizer notes, Quds Day typically features massive crowds organized by the Iranian government chanting 'death to America' and burning effigies, with full media coverage. He writes Tyagi's The Song of Sparrows has film credits that read like who's who of prominent Iranian government institutions. For example, there is a thank-you to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Air Force.\n\nThe revelation is just one of many on Warren, as well as the other prolific progressives featured in the book, as the Hemmer acknowledges in her op-ed for the Times.\n\nI think there's a lot of things about Elizabeth Warren that are troubling, about how she was actually a government consultant in the 1990s rewriting bankruptcy laws, and in a typical Washington move, she took that position and cashed in, Schweizer said during a recent appearance on Fox News's Special Report.\n\nShe basically went to corporations and said, I will consult for you and advise you in how to use the law that I wrote to your maximum advantage, he added.\n\nProfiles in Corruption also contains a number of detailed discoveries regarding the Biden 5, including how James Biden's firm received $1.5 billion in government contracts, despite having no experience, as well as Frank Biden's connection to projects receiving millions in taxpayer loans during the Obama administration. It also examines Hunter Biden's firms scoring business deals with people and entities tied to the governments of Russia, China, and Kazakhstan, as well as revelations on the former vice president's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, purportedly directing $2.5 million from Citizens for Biden and Biden for President Inc. to her own contracting firm during her brother's last presidential bid in 2008.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for forthcoming reports from Profiles in Corruption.
The New York state legislature has passed a new law allocating up to $5 million in tax credits meant to encourage operators of a qualified film production company to hire women and people of color as TV writers and directors.\n\nSenate Bill S4999D passed 38 to 24 on Wednesday and adds an additional $5 million in tax incentives on top of New York's existing budget allotment of $420 million in TV and film tax credits.\n\nPeople in the TV industry have understood for years that enhancing the diversity of writing and directing improves the stories that appear onscreen, Writers Guild of America, East executive director Lowell Peterson said, according to Deadline. The missing link for policymakers has been putting money at the point of hire, and this legislation is an important step in that direction.\n\nThe bill had received support from the Directors Guild of America, whose Eastern executive director, Neil Dudich, said, For years the DGA has pushed the industry to change their imbalanced hiring practices — so that talent, and talent alone, is the defining factor.\n\nBy encouraging studios, networks and producers to discover the talented New York TV directors and writers that are out there in abundance, this bill can be a meaningful step forward in establishing a level playing field for all, Dudich added.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is expected to sign the bill into law, which will allow appropriation of the new funding.\n\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
On Thursday Senate Republicans introduced a measure that would ban organizations from the use of taxpayer funds to promote or refer girls and women for abortions abroad.\n\nThe legislation, known as the American Values Act, is in response to President Joe Biden's executive order revoking the Mexico City Policy, which the Trump administration expanded to prohibit organizations that receive U.S. health assistance funding from promoting or performing abortions overseas as a method of family planning.\n\nBiden signed the executive order despite consistent polling that shows Americans share bipartisan unity on barring taxpayer funding of abortion both within the United States and abroad.\n\nSens. Jim Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Todd Young (R-IN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced the measure that seeks to permanently enact and expand existing prohibitions on the use of U.S. foreign assistance to pay for the performance or promotion of abortion services overseas, a joint press release stated.\n\nRisch said in the statement that pro-abortion groups have set their sights on exploiting loopholes and even overturning the long-standing pro-life provisions of law that have provided a solid foundation for values-based U.S. foreign assistance.\n\nIt is time for Congress to take decisive action and eliminate any ambiguity about how these provisions are meant to be applied, and so I'm proud to introduce the American Values Act to make them permanent in U.S. law, he added.\n\nU.S. foreign assistance is a critical tool of our national security and should not, in any way, go towards abortion or the promotion of abortion overseas, Rubio said.\n\nThe progressive left is working to enact their agenda at every possible opportunity, Young said, adding pro-abortion groups are hard at work trying to hijack those tax dollars not to protect our nation, but to perform or promote abortions around the world.\n\nThe legislation would permanently enact restrictions on the use of U.S. foreign aid to pay for the promotion or performance of abortions, forced sterilizations, or biomedical research related to abortions.\n\nPaul also reintroduced two pro-life bills that seek to defund Planned Parenthood and define human life starting at conception:\n\nThe proper role of government is to ensure that individual rights are protected, the most basic of which is the right to life. Sen @RandPaul introduces two pro-life bills, aiming to defund Planned Parenthood and define human life starting at conception.https://t.co/4wrANMN7ns — March for Life (@March_for_Life) February 3, 2021\n\nAbortion providers like Planned Parenthood will tell you differently, but every single life matters, including the unborn, Paul said in a statement. I was proud to force the Senate to vote on defunding this organization. Our nation cannot expect to fully protect and maintain our other rights if we do not respect the fundamental right to life even starting in the womb.
Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday regarding the potential for a new gun control debate in Congress after the tragedy in Las Vegas, President Trump's tax reform plan, and the federal response to Puerto Rico.\n\nSaid Norman of events in Las Vegas, For this to happen just shows the issues this country has.\n\nTo say that guns ought to be more regulated is just the wrong way, he continued, Now, what ought to be the topic of discussion is the tragedy that took place and how we can help to get God back into the mainstream of public life and it was absent in the killer and anyone that tries to make political hay, again, by talking about gun control, is backward in my opinion.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:
Marc Short, the former top aide to the Koch brothers who is the President's liaison to Congress, will leave as early as this summer, says the Wall Street Journal.\n\nShort is also complaining that he cannot get Trump's agenda endorsed by Congres, lamenting to colleagues the 'diminishing returns' of [his] pushing President Donald Trump's agenda through the Republican-controlled Congress as the midterm elections approach, according to people familiar with the conversations, says the WSJ report.\n\nShort's exit and replacement are important, partly because he is widely regarded as a champion for the GOP establishment's priorities, but not for the President's populist priorities, such as funding for a border wall.\n\nShort is a former top manager for the business donors in the Koch brothers' political network, and he also worked for Vice-President Mike Pence who did not have a populist record before 2016.\n\nShort played a leading role in persuading Congress to pass the December 2017 tax cuts.\n\nSince then, Trump's focus and agenda has turned to more populist priorities, such as a reduction in immigration numbers. The reductions will pressure companies to raise wages and develop labor-saving, higher-productivity machinery, so they are loudly opposed by the GOP donors. Short failed to get Trump's populist immigration policy and border-wall funded in the 2017 and 2018 omnibus bills, or getting Trump's immigration policy approved by the Senate in a February 2018 debate.\n\nThe WSJ reports:\n\nMr. Short's tenure has been marked by ups and downs, reflecting the Trump administration's legislative record. The main legislative accomplishment so far has been the tax package that Republicans approved in December, although some inside the White House have argued that Mr. Cohn and his team deserved much of the credit. But the White House was unable to repeal the Affordable Care Act, has abandoned its push for an infrastructure spending package, and has been unable to find consensus within the Republican Party on an immigration overhaul.\n\nShort has played a lower-profile role in the House debate over immigration reform and amnesty.
Left-wing filmmaker and activist Michael Moore said in a social media post Friday that furloughed federal workers should start a mass uprising and hound Mitch McConnell over the government shutdown.\n\nWhat would a nonviolent mass uprising by 800,000 federal workers look like? Sit-ins. Takeover buildings. Shut down all air travel, Michael Moore said. A human 'wall' at the WhiteHouse. Hound Mitch McConnell so that he has no sleep, no lunches w/ lobbyists. Refuse to show up for work. I'd join that!\n\nWhat would a nonviolent mass uprising by 800,000 federal workers look like? Sit-ins. Takeover buildings. Shut down all air travel. A human wall at the WhiteHouse. Hound Mitch McConnell so that he has no sleep, no lunches w/ lobbyists. Refuse to show up for work. I'd join that! — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) January 18, 2019\n\nThe federal government has been in a state of partial shutdown for over three weeks now in the longest shutdown in American history. Democrats refuse to pass spending for the government that includes money for President Trump's promised border wall.\n\nMoore's social media rants often target the president and Republicans. After the 2018 midterm elections, the 64-year-old said that the only way Republicans win elections is by making it harder for African-Americans to vote.\n\nIt has to feel awful knowing that your side is outnumbered by the millions and the only way you can hang on to any power is to simply rig it/steal it/prevent black people from voting. That is the work of cowards, he said.\n\nMore recently, the Bowling for Columbine creator declared that the GOP tax cut in 2017 was like an act of terror.\n\nAll the Republicans in that photo you showed standing there on the steps with him a year ago today all looking so slap happy and ah, remember it's not just Trump, all of the Republicans, all of them, nobody has had the courage to stand up and say this is wrong, this is un-American, he said.\n\nThis hurts this country. This is— this tax cut in a sense an act of terror because it's going to make the people who are already struggling to get by that much harder to get by.
California is the second-most expensive state to own a car, when adding in the purchase price, taxes, insurance premiums and maintenance costs — and Governor Jerry Brown is looking to regain the top crown.\n\nA new study from the personal finance website Go Banking Rates, reveals that the average additional costs per year to buy a new car and operate it for three years can vary by as much as $2,406 a year, depending on the residence of the consumer.\n\nAccording to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for a new car in America is about $33,543. But there are also six other factors that Kelly Blue Book evaluates to determine the true cost of owning and operating a vehicle in its first three years. Those costs include: sales tax, title fees, registration fees, average annual insurance premiums, annual gas expenses and average maintenance and repair costs. For a three-year period, the average additional cost per year to owning a car in the U.S. can vary by as much as about $3,742 a year.\n\nCalifornia has a well-earned reputation as Taxifornia. Consumers in the Golden State will pay an average of $4,817 per year over the purchase price to own a car in its first three years\n\nBut Michigan is even worse than California, because the state has the highest insurance premium costs in the nation. A Michigander will pay an average of $5,105 per year over the purchase price to own a car in its first three years.\n\nThe cheapest place to own a new car in its first three years is the Live Free or Die state of New Hampshire, where the annual cost is about $2,699. Keeping with its moto, New Hampshire does not impose a sales tax on vehicle purchases and has some of the lowest insurance premiums, maintenance and repair costs in the nation.\n\nSacramento politicians will probably review this story and be appalled that they are not the national leader in cost.\n\nBut as Breitbart News reported, California Governor Brown is already claiming that the Golden State has a $59 billion backlog of maintenance needs on state highways and bridges. He has recently argued: We're going to have to find another way to finance the upkeep of the roads.\n\nThere is little opportunity to raise taxes at the pump, since Californians already pay the highest gasoline tax rate in America at 70.87 cents a gallon. Consequently, Brown has set-up a 15-member commission to study replacing the gas tax with an even more expensive road usage charge.\n\nBreitbart News estimates that the new roadway scheme would cost each California driver about $350 more per year. That would be more than sufficient for the state to regain its title as the most expensive state to operate a car.
Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro addressed the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday, where he declared the country open for business while criticizing the policies and corruption of previous socialist administrations.\n\nIn what proved to be a short keynote address, the Brazilian leader made a pitch designed to excite foreign investors by promising to reduce the heavy hand of the state after years of sluggish growth and an economic crisis that saw skyrocketing unemployment and extensive civil unrest.\n\nI took office amid a great ethical, moral, and economic crisis, he declared. I want to introduce to all of you the new Brazil we are building. We are committed to changing our history.\n\nWe will work to lower the tax burden, streamline rules and make life easier for those who want to produce and do business as entrepreneurs, invest and create jobs, he continued. We shall work to foster economic stability while respecting and honoring contracts … and balancing government accounts. Bolsonaro also spoke of his country's extraordinary natural beauty and declared it his mission to make progress in harmonizing environmental preservation and biodiversity, with much needed economic development. The 63-year-old former army captain also took aim at the left-wing governments that have dominated Latin America over the past two decades but have failed to keep power in recent years with the election of right-leaning governments in Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Paraguay. We do not want to have a Bolivarian type of Latin America, as was the case in Brazil under previous administrations, he said. I believe that this new wave of interacting with South American countries has had a contagion effect – more center, center-right leaders have been successfully elected in these neighboring countries. I believe this is a clear cut response indicating that the left wing will not prevail in that region, which is a very good development in my view, not only for Latin America but for the rest of the world, he continued. Left-wing regimes continue to prevail in neighboring Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba, all of which Bolsonaro has pledged to push back against by forming a global coalition against communism. Bolsonaro's speech was written and revised by his economy minister, Paulo Guedes, a U.S.-educated free marketeer. It reportedly aimed to give the broadest message possible of the new Brazil that is presenting itself, with our arrival in power. The trip to Switzerland was Bolsonaro's first as the Brazilian leader. U.S. officials have previously indicated that he would visit Washington early in 2019 for a meeting with President Donald Trump.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
The European Union Capital of Culture competition has rejected the city of Székesfehérvár after claiming a video presented by the city's mayor showed the city to be too white and Christian.\n\nSzékesfehérvár, which was competing with several other Hungarian cities in the contest, presented a short video to the judges at the political bloc showing why the city should be shortlisted for the project.\n\nAccording to Székesfehérvár mayor András Cser-Palkovics, the committee who watched the film dismissed it as a propaganda film of white Christian Europe.\n\nMr Cser-Palkovics congratulated the three cities that had been shortlisted for the project but said that one of the EU experts said his city's video was a propaganda film of white Christian Europe, everyone is white, happy, dancing in the streets.\n\n'Accept the Will of the People on Migration, Culture, or Hit the Road': Orbán Tells Europe's Leaders\n\nhttps://t.co/bmp36tEsOy — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2017\n\nThe mayor claimed that one of the panel, a Belgian politician, objected to the identity of the application based on the Greek, Roman, and Christian-Jewish cultures.\n\nIn the context of the applications, almost nothing was done, they did not deal with sustainability, funding, and did not deal with programs or investments, but only with daily political and ideological accusations. Just because we take pride in our cultural values. The cross is not only a religious but also a cultural value, and gives it the diversity that makes us proud of Europe, he added.\n\nThe European Capitals of Culture initiative, started in 1985, is touted as promoting the diversity of Europe by highlighting different cities across the continent in an effort to promote a European identity.\n\n'Hungary First': Orbán Vows to 'Fight Those Who Want to Change the Christian Identity of Europe' https://t.co/It6BWyPxDo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2018\n\nThe rejection for being too white echoes a movement across the western world to promote diversity. This has been slammed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who recently called for a patriotic alliance to combat advocates of mass migration and globalism.\n\nThe Orban government has laid much of the blame for the promotion of 'diversity', open borders, and mass migration on left-wing billionaire George Soros and his massive network of NGOs.\n\nThe Hungarian government recently passed a new law that would implement a new tax on NGOs assisting mass migration, which would be used to further reinforce the Hungarian border.\n\nOrban has also been a champion of traditional European culture, remarking back in November that governments should be dedicated to Christian values.
Forbes deleted an article this week about closing public libraries in favor of buying books on Amazon after it sparked a backlash online.\n\nThe article, which was written by Long Island University economist Panos Mourdoukoutas, was entitled Amazon Should Replace Local Libraries to Save Taxpayers Money. The article argued that Amazon could fill the role of local libraries by replacing them with its own bookstores.\n\nAmazon should open their own bookstores in all local communities. They can replace local libraries and save taxpayers lots of money, while enhancing the value of their stock, Mourdoukoutas wrote.\n\nLibraries slowly began to service the local community more, he added. Libraries introduced video rentals and free internet access. The modern local library still provides these services, but they aren't for free. Homeowners have to be financed by taxpayers in form of a 'library tax.' It is usually added to school taxes, which in some communities are already high.\n\nThe article sparked an immediate backlash and Forbes promptly removed it from their site. In a statement, a Forbes spokesperson said that the article was removed because it was outside of the contributor's area of expertise.\n\nForbes advocates spirited dialogue on a range of topics, including those that often take a contrarian view, the spokesperson said. Libraries play an important role in our society. This article was outside of this contributor's specific area of expertise, and has since been removed.\n\nAngry tweets responding to the article's author garnered thousands of likes on Twitter.\n\nI'm a librarian and this is actually the worst fucking idea ever. Libraries by Amazon would eliminate the most important function libraries have—as a socialized daytime service to cash-poor and working class people left behind by digital advances. https://t.co/YqxLgAZQm6 — cyree jarelle johnson (@cyreejarelle) July 22, 2018\n\nAs they are today, libraries are mostly used by folks who don't (or who are denied access to) daytime economies, particularly homeless/houseless folks. There is NO WAY that Amazon libraries would continue to serve homeless/houseless people in this way. — cyree jarelle johnson (@cyreejarelle) July 22, 2018\n\nLibraries aren't just museums for books, people. Real life people come there for information on services to try to often save their lives. Info on doctors, domestic violence shelters, help to get jobs. Stop funding everything that rich folk want and leave libraries the fuck alone — jamey hatley (@jameyhatley) July 22, 2018\n\nIt is unclear why Mourdoukoutas' article and the resulting backlash prompted Forbes to act so quickly. In the age of Internet journalism, bad opinions are often met with swift and persuasive rebuttals. Disagreements are best had when each party has an opportunity to express their opinion. Moreover, it's important that no one fears that the mere expression of their opinion will result in brigading and censoring of their words.\n\nCensorship issues aside, many critics have pointed out that the closure of public libraries would have the strongest impact on low-income families. Paul Guequierre, director of communications for the Urban Libraries Council, explained why this decision would hit low-income Americans the hardest. The communities that would be affected the most would likely be low-income people, immigrants, and, really, the most marginalized among us, he said. [People] don't have to buy a cup of coffee at the library.\n\nAn archived version of the original Forbes article can be read here.
Despite many cities hosting the Olympics facing bankruptcy in the aftermath, a new study by Beacon Economics LLC and UC Riverside predicts that the Los Angeles area would see an $9.5 billion economic boost and generate $4.4 billion in worker earnings if the city is awarded the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nLos Angeles, Paris and Budapest are the finalists to be awarded the 2024 Olympic Summer Games. The winning city will be picked in September, supposedly based on evaluations of the competing cities' vision, governance, games delivery and venue funding.\n\nL.A.'s bid is uniquely structured compared to the other finalist cities, because LA claims it does not need to build any new permanent venues. LA 2024 intends to rely solely on access to existing sports complexes in Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties.\n\nThe economic impact study was conducted by the UC Riverside's School of Business Center for Economic Forecasting and Development to evaluate the viability of the L.A. 2024 Olympic Bid Committee (L.A. 2024) final proposal. According to their analysis, the City of Los Angeles will not lose money hosting the games and will generate additional tax revenues of between $152 million and $167 million, mostly from hotel transient occupancy taxes and incremental sales tax revenues.\n\nThe increase in economic output from the games will also generate the equivalent amount of between 74,308 and 79,307 full-time jobs.\n\nBut the City of Los Angeles will still be at risk for up to $6 billion in spending necessary to host the games. L.A. 2024 estimates it will make a surplus by selling $1.3 to $1.5 billion of Olympics and Paralympic Games tickets; plus taking in $4.8 billion in advertising and sponsorship revenue.\n\nThe competition to host an Olympic games comes after the 2016 Rio De Janeiro Olympic Summer Games that cost about Brazil about $4.6 billion to host and was filled with daily tales of corruption. Ten days after the final ceremonies, Brazil's Senate convicted impeached President Dilma Rousseff by a vote of 61-20 for illegally using money from state banks to bankroll public spending on the Olympics and other boondoggles.\n\nThe 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics was predicted to cost to cost the host $125 million. When challenged on the cost, Mayor Jean Drapeau — famously confident in his management capabilities — declared: The Olympics can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby. The economic flop left Montreal saddled with $1.5 billion in debt.\n\nAfter the estimated cost of hosting the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics doubled to over $11 billion, Greece had to admit to the European Commission that it was entering a public debt crisis. Thirteen years later, Greece is still an economic basket case.\n\nA confident Los Angeles Eric Garcetti claimed as the Rio Olympic scandal was raging in August: In 1984, Los Angeles showed the world that a responsibly managed Olympic Games could add billions of dollars to the local economy and bring progress that could be felt for decades to come — and we're ready to do that again in 2024.
The Ugandan military's heavy presence in the national capital, Kampala, ahead of the country's general election on Thursday evoked a tense, war-like atmosphere, Ugandan human rights lawyer Nicholas Opiyo told Deutsche Welle (DW) on Wednesday.\n\nIt doesn't feel as though the country is going into an election, Opiyo told the German state broadcaster.\n\nIt feels as though the country is at war, he said, describing scores of armored vehicles with mounted guns … patrolling the capital.\n\nOpiyo recently served jail time in Uganda after facing charges of money laundering and is currently out on bail. The human rights lawyer described the government's charges against him to DW as a continuation of a pattern targeting civil society leaders.\n\nOpiyo said many people he knew in Uganda sent their families out of the country or to the countryside after Uganda's army deployed forces to maintain order in the capital this week.\n\nIn addition to increasing security in Kampala, the Ugandan federal government has shut down access to most social media platforms used in the country ahead of its January 14 general election.\n\nThe government has closed social media, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said in a national address on January 12.\n\nMuseveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986, accused U.S.-owned Facebook and alleged foreign actors of arrogance in his speech after Facebook removed Ugandan accounts linked to his reelection campaign on January 11. The accounts were allegedly pretending to be independent supporters of Museveni.\n\nThis is unfortunate but it is unavoidable, the Ugandan president said of the social media blockage.\n\nThere is no way anybody can come around and play with our country, to decide who is good, who is bad. We cannot accept that, Museveni said, adding that he cannot tolerate this arrogance.\n\nThe social media shutdown has hindered journalists' efforts to report on Uganda's voting process on election day.\n\nMuseveni in 2018 criticized social media platforms for promoting allegedly false information in Uganda, claiming young people spent too much time on messaging apps such as WhatsApp. Later that year, Uganda's government imposed a $0.05 tax on social media usage in the country. Since then, many Ugandans have accessed the internet via Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to side-step the tax.\n\n[T]hose who are already using VPNs are able to easily get around this latest social media blackout, DW noted on Wednesday.\n\nSince [Monday], we have been having a problem with the internet, especially those people who are using [the social media tax]. They have found it so challenging but with people who had already downloaded VPN, they are okay, Kampala resident Gerald Sengelo told the broadcaster.\n\nUganda is one of 15 African countries to restrict social media access during elections since 2015, according to data from the privacy protection company Surfshark.
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's (D) push to ban private gun sales was defeated in the Virginia Senate Courts of Justice Committee Monday morning.\n\nThe Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that Second Amendment supporters held a Monday morning rally in Capitol Square while Northam planned speak to gun control supporters mid-afternoon.\n\nOn January 10, 2018, Breitbart News reported that Northam was pushing a ban on private gun sales by seeking a requirement that all gun sales, retail or private, be performed via a background check. This would have required law-abiding Virginians to seek out a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) to do a background check if a private citizen was selling a gun to a neighbor, a lifelong friend, or a co-worker.\n\nColorado already has a similar law and charges a fee every time a background check is performed. In the end, the fee is like a gun tax that raises the sale price for each gun sold without offering any substantial hindrance to high profile attacks in return. High profile attackers almost always acquire their guns via background checks, which is easy to do if one has avoided accumulating a criminal history.\n\nBackground checks look backward, as the name suggests, and where there is no criminal history there is no reason to prevent a gun sale.

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron and the 'Remain' campaign are only targeting one specific demographic to register to vote in Britain's referendum on the European Union (EU), Breitbart London can reveal.\n\nLast week, Breitbart London alleged that the government was spending copious amounts of tax payer money trying to get young people to vote in the referendum, considering they are more naturally likely to vote 'Remain'.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/740269678711431168\n\nDespite the dismissive messages from Remain campaigners, Breitbart London can reveal that in fact, Mr. Cameron is only targeting 18-35-year-olds exclusively on Facebook in order to get a huge voter registration bump in favour of the outcome he prefers: a vote to stay in the EU.\n\nFacebook sponsored adverts, which have accounted for a huge percentage of those registering to vote on the UK government website, reveal that Mr. Cameron is using his own tax payer funded Facebook page to target younger voters.\n\nThis means Mr. Cameron, his government, and the Remain campaign are not only ignoring anyone older than 35, but that their claim to simply be trying to register as many people to vote as possible is a verifiable lie.\n\nOn Friday, Facebook prompted Register to vote.\n\nMaybe coincidence, but here's how voter reg stats changed. #euref pic.twitter.com/ZjOdHfbv3l — dan barker (@danbarker) June 5, 2016\n\nThe screenshot proving the claim reveals: You're seeing this advert because David Cameron wants to reach people aged 18 to 35 who are in England. This is based on things like your Facebook profile information and your Internet connection.\n\nThe ad itself reads: Deadline Extended: You can register to vote until midnight tonight.\n\nThe link takes people to the UK government website which has seen a 2.5 million surge in voter registrations in the past 30 days – higher than at any previous General Election.\n\nAnd while no one has said that people should not register to vote of their own accord, Remain campaigners are hiding behind their extra government funding and the targeted ads by attacking Leave campaigners as being anti-democracy.\n\nA spokesman for the Leave.EU campaign told Breitbart London: The motives behind extending the deadline were already questionable, but to spend tax payers' money in this period targeting young people specifically is beyond contempt. It shows you the depths dodgy Dave and the Remaniacs will go to stitch up the vote.\n\nTraditionally, younger voters are more inclined to vote to Remain in the European Union than leave. Recent YouGov polling reveals that those under the age of 24 are likely to vote 'Remain' by 64 per cent to 18 per cent, with 5 per cent saying they would not vote, and 13 per cent remaining undecided.\n\nOf the age group 25-49, Remain has the backing of 44 per cent of voters, with just 35 per cent saying they'd vote to leave (six per cent would not vote, and 14 per cent are undecided).\n\nThe British government has undertaken a massive voter registration campaign, as has the Labour Party and a number of left-wing, pro-EU outfits such as the BBC, Facebook, local councils, Bite the Ballot, 38 Degrees, the Green Party, and more.\n\nQuestions will now be asked as to why the government is only using tax payer money to target one demographic that benefits the Remain campaign.\n\nCampaigners have told Breitbart London they expect Members of Parliament to demand to know how much the government has spent on total on this blitz. The figure is expected to stretch into the millions of pounds.\n\nFollow Raheem Kassam for more Brexit breaking news
Economist and CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow praised the GOP's tax legislation Sunday on New York AM 970 radio's The Cats Roundtable, saying he has never seen anything like the response by major corporations to increase wages, bonuses or increasing investments.\n\n[W]e are on the front end of a major business investment boom. And that boom is going to carry economic growth faster, it's going to create more jobs, it's going to create more wages, Kudlow told host John Catsimatidis.\n\nHe added, The deficit is going to be much lower. This thing is going to pay for itself inside of a couple of years. … This will enhance America's influence overseas because of our booming economy.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
INDIANOLA, Iowa (AP) — Joe Biden has called for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign to disown what he calls doctored video that some Sanders supporters say shows the former vice president endorsing Republican calls to cut Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThere's a little doctored video going around … put out by one of Bernie's people, Biden told supporters Saturday in Indianola, Iowa, referring to a 2018 speech in which Biden discussed then-House Speaker Paul Ryan saying rising deficit demanded action on the popular entitlement programs.\n\nI'm looking for his campaign to come forward and disown it, Biden continued, pointing to his 2020 campaign proposals designed to shore up Social Security. But they haven't done it yet.\n\nThe video in question, circulated on Twitter by a top Sanders adviser, does not appear to be altered. But the short clip omits Biden's larger argument over how Ryan handled the 2017 tax cuts and subsequent budget debates. A separate Sanders' adviser included a transcript of Biden's remarks in the video clip in a separate campaign newsletter. He added other, more extended video, of Biden as a U.S. senator in 1995 and presidential candidate in 2007 explaining his support for a more austere federal budget, including putting Social Security and Medicare on the table.\n\nThe 2020 campaign flap highlights long-standing philosophical fissures between the progressive Sanders, who has spent decades arguing for a massive expansion of the federal government, and the more centrist Biden. Those differences have come to the forefront as Biden and Sanders are bunched with Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren atop early state polls weeks before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.\n\nResponding to Biden's remarks Saturday, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said, Joe Biden should be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security.\n\nThe facts are very clear: Biden not only pushed to cut Social Security — he is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions, Shakir said in a statement. The vice president must stop dodging questions about his record, and start explaining why he has so aggressively pushed to slash one of the most significant and successful social programs in American history, which millions of Americans rely on for survival.\n\nIn a Jan. 1 tweet, Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels wrote that it is soul-wrenching to have heard Biden say 'Ryan was correct.' He attached a 20-second video clip taken from an April 2018 speech Biden delivered at the Brookings Institution.\n\nPaul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code. What's the first thing he decided we had to go after? Biden continued, leaning into the microphone. Social Security and Medicare … That's the only way you can find room to pay for it.\n\nIt was part of a broader speech in which Biden outlined his economic vision. He previewed his 2020 campaign emphasis on the middle-class, but declared that billionaires are not the problem, an implicit contrast with progressives. The statement that Gunnels highlighted reflects a common Biden argument from the 2020 campaign: that Republicans pushed a tax cut whose benefits are tilted to corporations and the wealthiest Americans, knowing it would balloon the deficits, so the GOP could then justify cutting Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhat I'd do is I make sure that we expand Social Security coverage, Biden insisted Friday when a voter in Iowa asked him about the program.\n\nBiden, like most Democrats, proposes raising the cap on the level of income that is subject to the payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. That cap is set at $137,700 for the current tax year, meaning any income beyond that threshold is still subject to personal income tax, but not payroll taxes. Biden — and many other Democrats — propose lifting that cap to increase the tax revenue flowing into the Medicare and Social Security trust funds.\n\nSanders' camp, meanwhile, maintains that Biden's history is more important than his current proposals. Another of their favorite video clips shows then-Sen. Biden, in the first years after Republicans' 1994 midterm election romp, calling for a more austere approach. When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security, as well, Biden said at the time. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans' benefits. … And I not only tried it once. I tried it twice, I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.\n\nJust as the Biden campaign argues that Republicans would lambaste the Vermont senator as a socialist if he wins the Democratic nomination, Sanders' backers retort that Trump would use the same video clips they cite to harm Biden with older voters who will prove critical in battleground states in November.
TEL AVIV – Fires in nine localities across Israel have been deemed acts of arson and possibly terrorism, rendering victims eligible to receive compensation from state emergency funds for victims of terror.\n\nThe Israel Tax Authority said on Tuesday that fires in nine cities and settlements occurring at specific times were started by arsonists. These include Haifa, where roughly 500 homes were burnt down, and several West Bank settlements.\n\nFrom information received by the Tax Authority, the Israel Police and the Fire and Rescue Services commission, it has been determined that the fires in these locations were caused by intentional arson with reasonable suspicion of terrorist activities, a statement from the tax authority noted.\n\nLosses caused by wildfires and other natural disasters would usually only be covered by private insurance. In these nine cases, financial losses would be considered war damages.\n\nSeveral dozen of the 1,773 fires firefighters battled last week are suspected to have been started by arsonists, police said. Six teenagers from the Arab-Israeli village of Jadeidi-Makr who were arrested last week on suspicion of setting a nearby forest on fire were denied bail on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, police announced that a 28-year-old Arab-Israeli man from the northern city of Umm al-Fahm is to be indicted for arson.\n\nKnesset members have been calling for the government to compensate all victims of the fire in full, regardless of whether or not the losses were the result of arson. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon (Kulanu) announced that NIS 2,500 ($650) will be awarded to every person who is unable to return home due to damages.\n\nSome 75,000 people were forced to flee their homes since the wildfires started last Tuesday, destroying 32,000 acres of land. Most have been cleared to return home but damages are estimated to reach hundreds of millions shekels.
Employees of tech companies in San Francisco, California, can't leave the city fast enough, fleeing for the potential tech hubs of tomorrow such as Austin, Texas, and Miami, Florida. One former San Francisco exec said: what else can God and the world and government come up with to make the place less livable?\n\nMiami Mayor Francis Suarez has been fielding inquiries from top executives in the tech world, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, according to a report by NBC News.\n\nThe report added that the mayor has also met with former Google Chairman and Clinton lackey Eric Schmidt, and the chairman of Palantir, Peter Thiel, among others.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that a big part of the reason why they are moving is that they feel that there is an inhospitable environment for regulation and taxation, said Suarez.\n\nMiami is not the only city experiencing this type of migration, as tech employees from San Francisco are fleeing to other states offering them better opportunities as well.\n\nTech workers living in San Francisco had once believed that the high rent, high taxes, long commute to work, and rude neighbors were worth it if they could live in the epicenter of a boom that was changing the world, reported SFGATE.\n\nBut now, in the wake of the pandemic, tech workers can't flee the city fast enough, as spending months working remotely in other towns has shown them that the quality of life can be higher elsewhere.\n\nTech workers and their bosses realized they might not need all the perks and after-work schmooze events. But maybe they needed elbow room and a yard for the new puppy. A place to put the Peloton. A top public school, noted SFGATE.\n\nAnd so they fled to more affordable places, like Georgia, and states with no income taxes, like Texas and Florida. The report added that the number one choice of relocation for people leaving San Francisco is Austin, Texas.\n\nJohn Gardner, the founder and CEO of the remote personal training startup Kickoff — who fled San Francisco for Miami Beach — told SFGATE that he can't help but wonder, what else can God and the world and government come up with to make the place less livable?\n\nJustin Kan, who co-founded Twitch, tweeted to his followers in August last year, asking them where he should move.\n\nWe're selling our house and moving out of SF. Where should we go and why? asked Kan.\n\nWe're selling our house and moving out of SF. Where should we go and why? — Justin Kan (@justinkan) August 17, 2020\n\nCome to Austin with us. Growing tech ecosystem and Texas is the best place to make a stand together for a free society, responded Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of software company Palantir.\n\nCome to Austin with us. Growing tech ecosystem and Texas is the best place to make a stand together for a free society. — Joe Lonsdale (@JTLonsdale) August 17, 2020\n\nThe report added that there are currently 33,000 members in a Facebook group called Leaving California, as well as 51,000 members in its sister group, Life After California. In the groups, people share photos of moving trucks, and links to property listings in new cities.\n\nWhen people decide to leave San Francisco, they usually don't know where they want to go, they just want to go, said Terry Gilliam, the founder of both Facebook groups.\n\nBear Kittay, the co-founder Good Money, echoed those sentiments, and even acknowledged that some people may find themselves relocating to a place that is more conservative.\n\nThe things that make this city ill are not within my control to change, said Kittay of San Francisco.\n\nA lot of people are choosing to go to places where there's opportunity, he added. And maybe it's a place that is more conservative and there can be an integration of dialogue.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently promised on social media that future Tesla vehicles will have the ability to fly while announcing the same day that Tesla will no longer be producing certain popular Model S vehicles.\n\nIn a recent series of tweets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed that future Tesla vehicles will have the ability to fly. Replying to a tweet in which one Twitter user jokingly implied that Tesla vehicles in the year 2022 will look something like a flying DeLorean car from Back to the Future, Musk stated that the new Roadster will actually do something like this.\n\nThe new Roadster will actually do something like this https://t.co/fIsTAYa4x8 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nPopular YouTube tech reviewer and Tesla owner Marques Brownlee (known by his YouTube handle of MKBHD) replied to Musk's tweet saying that he feels as if Musk wasn't joking in his initial tweet and actually believes that Tesla Roadsters will be flying in 2022. Musk replied that he was indeed serious:\n\nI'm not. Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite over-wrapped pressure vessel in place of the 2 rear seats. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nBrownlee did not appear skeptical of Musk's claim and instead stated that he loved the idea, Musk then said that one of the benefits of this idea is that the Roadster could accelerate at the limit of human endurance.\n\nPlus, you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nWhen asked if the car would be able to drive a quarter of a mile in less than eight seconds, Musk replied: No problem.\n\nNo problem — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nBut a few hours later, Musk returned to Earth when tweeted that Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the popular 75 kWh battery version of their Model S and Model X vehicles, with the 100 kWh battery version becoming the standard model:\n\nStarting on Monday, Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the 75 kWh version of the Model S & X. If you'd like that version, please order by Sunday night at https://t.co/46TXqRJ3C1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2019\n\nRecently, John Engle, President of Almington Capital, noted that as Tesla manages to fix some of its production issues, resulting in a 13 percent rise in Model 3 car deliveries in the fourth quarter, the company now faces a new challenge — lack of demand. While Tesla has still failed to meet its previously projected production goal of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles a week, their delivery of 63,150 Model 3 vehicles in the fourth quarter was a solid improvement. But as the company closes up a supposed backlog of 450,000 vehicles, cracks are beginning to appear.\n\nAccording to what Engle says are Tesla's reported numbers, approximately 7,000 Model 3 vehicles are being kept in storage and without buyers. This amounts for approximately two weeks worth of vehicles at Tesla's current production rate. Combined with the $2,000 price slash across all of the company's vehicles in an attempt to offset the phase-out of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle owners, and a general drop in Model 3 sales, it's understandable why many investors believe that the coming year will show a lack of demand for Tesla's vehicles. Even as the company plans to expand their European sales, Goldman Sachs sees an imminent lull in demand.
A new report on the state of the public school systems in Obama's home state of Illinois finds they are $20 billion in debt with no end in sight to the growing budget failure.\n\nAccording to a new review by the Chicago Tribune, the massive debt isn't necessarily crushing the state's schools, because the state legislature has passed laws to give schools the power to keep borrowing no matter what, so there is no incentive for the schools to mind budgets. According to the paper, the debt has accrued due to special deals in Springfield that have given districts exemptions so they can keep borrowing beyond limits set by law.\n\nThe Tribune found the state's schools are collectively in enough debt to amount to about $10,000 for each Pre-K to 12th-grade public school student in the state.\n\nAll the borrowing is a drain on taxpayers who have to repay the debt, the paper noted, as well as school budgets that must steer billions of dollars annually to principal and interest payments — money that could be targeted to classrooms. In some districts, more local tax money is collected for debt payments than for teacher salaries and student instruction.\n\nOne public schools official told the paper that if a school in the state exceeds its limits nothing happens, so they just keep borrowing or they go to their representatives and get special set-asides or borrowing deals that sit outside their limits.\n\nAs an example, the paper revealed that one district supposedly had a debt limit of $16 million but last year reached $50 million, as there was no legal curb on its spending.\n\nThe problem isn't just laid at the doorstep of state Democrats, either, as one bill in the state legislature filed by Republican House Leader Tom Cross allowed a district near his home to float $450 million in bonds without having the debt count toward its borrowing limit.\n\nAnother district, Ford Heights District 169, borrowed a whopping ten times more than its supposed borrowing limit.\n\nOf the nearly $20 billion in debt statewide, the Chicago Public Schools account for a huge chunk totaling at least $6.3 billion in overages.\n\nYet, despite the massive overspending, teachers unions in many districts want more. Recently the Chicago Teachers Union launched an illegal one-day strike demanding raises and higher spending in the Windy City.\n\nThe strike was such an outrage to city officials that Chicago Public Schools chief Forrest Claypool vowed teachers would not be paid for missing the school day.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com
An amnesty would generate more taxes for the government and more cheap workers for businesses, according to a pitch from a construction executive and various Koch network activists that sidelines the interests of American employees.\n\nStan Marek, the owner of Marek Brothers, a Houston-based construction firm that has employed many illegal migrants, is pushing the ID & Tax Proposal amnesty:\n\nLet's face it: those 11 million [illegal migrants] are not sitting on their duff. They're working somewhere. They may be working under a fake Social [Security Number], they may be working as an independent subcontractor, but they're working and they've got skills. A lot of these workers working in the underground economy, used to work for [construction company] people like me. They were let go because of ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] audits or Social Security No Matches, or insurance audits or whatever, and yet they're 11 to 12 million people in this country on payrolls sending in about $6 to $7 billion a year of Social Security [payments] that they would never get. These ICE audits have taken millions of people off of payrolls and dumped them into the underground economy where they're working for cash and not paying taxes.\n\nThe fix is an adult DACA: We know it works because it works for 800,000 people, said Marek, who has long complained about the No-match letters.\n\nThis is crony capitalism … business partnering with government to increase its profits [by cutting Americans' wages] while dumping the costs on taxpayers, responded Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. By legalizing the illegal immigrants, the benefit to employers is greater because there's more of the cost of [cheap labor] immigration that taxpayers can be forced to bear.\n\nMarek's DACA refers to President Barack Obama's 2012 award of work permits to roughly 800,000 young illegal migrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. The DACA work-permit giveaway has not been approved by Congress, partly because many millions of Americans are worried about their families' jobs, income, and health in an increasingly elite-controlled economy. It's not amnesty, Marek wrote in 2014. It is a sensible program aimed at identifying people and taxing them for working in the United States. That's the kind of border security we need.\n\nThe corporate demand to hire illegal migrants instead of Americans comes amid a housing boom that could otherwise help pull many sidelined Americans back into jobs and the middle-class. But Marek's video excludes any talk about Americans' current or future role in their own nation's economy.\n\nThe children of migrants are our future workforce, said Marek, as the video shows migrants working in jobs needed by Americans such as cleaning hotel rooms, driving, construction, and laying bricks. The video also shows many jobs where employers prefer to use cheap migrant labor instead of investing in labor-saving machinery. So the video shows migrants cutting weeds with prehistoric tools, milking cows, picking fruit by hand, and delivering food by bicycle.\n\nSeveral investor-funded activists echoed Marek's call for cheap labor in the video.\n\nDeporting illegal migrants would be an economic tragedy, said Daniel Griswold, the immigration policy director at the Koch-funded Mercatus Center. Think of the workplaces that would be disrupted, he lamented.\n\nBecause 95 percent of the undocumented residents in this country are employed, it means that the market can bear it, said Tony Payan, from the James A. Baker Institute at Rice University. I think the immigration system in the United States has a huge gap — we don't have [work] visas for the kinds of workers that our very dynamic economy often needs.\n\nPayan's call for endless visa worker inflows echoes the any willing worker plan pushed by President George W. Bush — and dodges the question of whether the United States should adopt a two-tier society of citizens exploiting powerless foreign workers.\n\nThe video did not mention that companies are free to hire employees away from other companies by offering higher wages and benefits.\n\nThis video sympathy helped Marek and other speakers to offer progressives and government employees a share of the potential benefits from the mass amnesty of illegal migrants.\n\nWe think over half of the undocumented are uninsured, said Ken Janda, an adjunct professor of healthcare management at Rice University. That's a challenge because if they don't have the cash to pay, those costs are shared by the rest of the community. Either tax dollars pay for them, or … those costs have to be pulled out of insurance premiums and insurance dollars from other sources.\n\nThe amnesty pitch was wrapped in a soft-focus video, which portrayed the illegals as the victims, even though the illegals voluntarily enter the United States, break laws, and extract wages away from Americans' labor market. For example, Marek offered sympathy for the poor migrants who accept low wage jobs from construction executives:\n\nThe jefes that run big crews, the labor brokers who violate every principle and law, yeah, they're making a lot of money. But if you take the typical worker out there walking on that truss, that are working as independent contractors, they're living in poverty, most of them. They don't have workman's comp, and if they get hurt most of them are going to just suck it up. If they get hurt, they're going to go to the ER [hospital emergency room]. And if they go to the ER, it's expensive and we have to pay for it.\n\nMarek and his allies repeatedly blamed Americans for not welcoming an uncapped inflow of migrants that would push the Americans out of jobs, cut their wages, spike their housing costs, and crowd their children's' schools.\n\nWe have not given the [illegals] the opportunity or [the] certainty to be able to fully contribute to the country, said Jorge Lima, the senior vice president of policy at the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity group. That is not just hurting them, but that's hurting us.\n\nThis is us who becomes the obstacle, said Robert Sanborn, president of Children at Risk. a Houston, Texas, advocacy group for migrants. I worry about all these kids [of illegal migrants] that could be tremendous economic assets for us … they're always going to be underperforming.\n\nOur legal immigration system has failed for years to keep up with the demand of our economy, said Ali Noorani, the president of the National Immigration Forum.Since there are very few legal pathways for people to enter the country, [migrants] make a decision to overstay a visa, to enter without inspection and hence, we're faced with this population of unauthorized immigrants.\n\nThe video ignored the impact of the cheap-labor migrant workforce on the employment and income of American workers. In 2018, Breitbart reported:\n\nBlaine Taylor, the whistleblower, said the construction industry in California once offered a starting wage of about $45 an hour in the late 1980s. Fast-forward to 2018 — nearly two decades into when illegal aliens began flooding the industry — he now says that wages have fallen by more than half, standing at just $11 an hour.\n\nTaylor continued:\n\nThe reality is that a person that was hired as a laborer in 1988, I paid $15 an hour and within a month if I could leave him on the job alone, he got $20 an hour. If I hired somebody that already knew how to do certain types of labor or certain types of operations, they would get $20 an hour. Now, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. They can't go lower than the minimum wage. And much of that, if they're not being paid by the hour at less than $11 an hour, they're being paid per piece — per piece of plywood that's installed, per piece of drywall that's installed. Now, the subcontractor can circumvent paying them as an hourly wage and are now being paid by 1099, which means that no taxes are being taken out.\n\nMarek's pitch to progressives is the latest example of employers trying to globalize the American labor market so they can hire anybody they want from abroad and break the bargaining position of American workers, said Krikorian. He continued:\n\nThere's not that many unions, generally speaking, but American workers in a tight labor market have bargaining power, even as just individuals. But if the labor market is expanded to include in effect the entire world, then there can never be a tight labor market. It becomes effectively impossible. That puts employers in the driver's seat and takes away any [marketplace] bargaining power that American workers would have, even those who aren't in unions or have any kind of formal organization.\n\nIn a tight labor market, they still have market power [to demand higher wages]; With a globalized labor market, American workers lose that market power, he added.\n\nMany polls show that the public welcomes legal migrants — but also much prefers that new jobs go to Americans first. In April 2020, a Washington Post poll showed 69 percent of Hispanics said yes when they were asked, Would you support … temporarily blocking nearly all immigration into the United States during the coronavirus outbreak? Just 30 percent of Hispanics opposed the border shutdown.
DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron says the European Union needs to reform itself this year to be able to compete with big powers like China and the United States.\n\nMacron said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that more ambitious EU countries must be able to move toward more European integration, even if other European countries don't want to join in.\n\nHe said: The less ambitious should not block the more ambitious in the room.\n\nHe added that countries sharing the euro currency must be able to agree on a much stronger and much fair system. He said EU countries need to coordinate their tax policies because otherwise talents will disappear.
Swedish bank Handelsbanken says Sweden's economy has signs of weak growth and the unemployment rate has increased compared to other European Union member-states.\n\nHandelsbanken chief economist Christina Nyman stated in a press release that the Swedish economy grew by just one per cent in 2019, that she expected the economy would continue to perform poorly this year, and that unemployment would also continue to rise.\n\nSweden is the only country in the EU where unemployment has clearly increased in recent years, Nyman said.\n\nThe economist went on to say that the labour market in Sweden would likely be weaker than both the EU and United States averages in the coming year, and that predicted wage increases could lead to low inflation.\n\nWe believe that economic indicators will start to turn up during the year and that the Riksbank will therefore still leave interest rates unchanged at zero percent both this year and next year, she said.\n\nThe Swedish unemployment rate, according to newspaper Dagens Industri, is expected to sit at around 7.2 per cent this year and rise even further to 7.4 per cent in the following year.\n\nSwedish Municipalities Who Took in Too Many Migrants Face Service Cuts https://t.co/3ZnaxssAfY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 26, 2019\n\nSweden's unemployment rate shows a massive disparity when native Swedes are compared to foreign-born residents.\n\nA report released in October of last year showed that as many as 90 per cent of migrants who arrived during the height of the 2015 migrant crisis and received permanent residency were unemployed.\n\nAnother report from earlier this month revealed that in the 18 to 25 age bracket, close to half of Swedish debtors were migration-background young men.\n\nThe struggling economy has left many local governments in financial peril as costs for services for new migrants remain high and existing unemployed migrants do not add to the already strained tax base.\n\nEight out of ten municipalities will be forced to make serious cuts to local services as a result of mass migration and changing demographics.\n\nSweden: Around 90 Per Cent of 2015 Migrants with Residency Status Are Unemployed https://t.co/G4IhlnXBCx — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 6, 2019
A video of a father confronting Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) about her plans to erase the bulk of student loan debt went viral on Thursday after he questioned the fairness of her proposal and added that those of us that did the right thing get screwed.\n\nA father confronted Warren during an event in Grimes, Iowa, on Monday about her plan to roll back student loan debt for about 95 percent of students who have debt.\n\nI just wanted to ask one question. My daughter is getting out of school. I've saved all my money. She doesn't have any student loans. Am I going to get my money back? he asked.\n\nOf course not, Warren replied.\n\nSo you're going to pay for people who didn't save any money and those of us who did the right thing get screwed? he asked.\n\nMy buddy had fun, bought a car, and went on all the vacations, I saved my money. He makes more than I did. I worked a double shift, the man pressed before accusing Warren of not taking him seriously.\n\nYou're laughing at me, he said. Yeah that's exactly what you're doing. We did the right thing and we get screwed.\n\nI appreciate your time, Warren stated as he walked away:\n\nMy daughter is in school. I saved all my money just to pay student loans. Can I have my money back?@ewarren: Of course not So you're going to pay for people who didn't save any money and those of us who did the right thing get screwed?pic.twitter.com/EXoU2ci2Wt — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) January 23, 2020\n\nUnder Warren's plan, individuals with a household income of $100,000 or less could have $50,0000 in student debt erased. Those with a household income of up to $250,000 could also see some of their debt erased, but a lower amount.\n\nShe also vows to cancel the majority of student loan debt on day one of her presidency via executive action:\n\nWe have a student loan crisis—and we can't afford to wait for Congress to act. I've already proposed a student loan debt cancellation plan, and on day one of my presidency, I'll use existing laws to start providing that debt cancellation immediately. https://t.co/bvhpuQmHH1 — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 14, 2020\n\nWarren says it is nonsense to suggest that the U.S. cannot afford her proposal, contending that her Ultra-Millionaire Tax will cover the costly plan.
Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Sen. Lindsey Graham‏ (R-SC) said if Republican legislators did not follow through with their promises they are dead.\n\nWhen asked if Congress was going to pass tax reform Graham‏ said, ‏If we don't we are dead.\n\nHe continued, If we don't cut taxes and we don't eventually repeal and replace Obamacare then we're going to lose across the board the house in 2018. And all of my colleagues running in primaries in 2018 will probably get beat. It will be the end of Mitch McConnell we know it. That is a symptom of a greater problem. If we do cut taxes and repeal and replace Obamacare it doesn't matter what Bannon does because we'll win.\n\nHe continued, Mitch McConnell is not our problem. Our problem that we promised to repeal and replace Obamacare and we failed. We promised to cut taxes, and we're yet to do it. If we're successful Mitch McConnell is fine if not we're all in trouble. We'll lose our majority, and I think President Trump will not get reelected.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Mike The Situation Sorrentino, of MTV's Jersey Shore fame, is facing up to five years in federal prison after pleading guilty to felony tax evasion, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Friday.\n\nMarc Sorrentino, brother of The Situation, also pleaded guilty to aiding in the preparation of a fraudulent tax return and will face a maximum of three years. Five and three years are statutory maximum sentences; both men are likely to receive much less severe penalties.\n\n\n\nThe charges against the Sorrentinos stem from the concealment of cash receipts from businesses the brothers set up to monetize The Situation's fame. The bothers were alleged to have failed to report potentially millions of dollars of receipts, knowingly failing to file tax returns, and filing false tax returns and strategically depositing the cash to avoid oversight.\n\nAs we approach this year's filing season, today's guilty pleas should serve as a stark reminder to those who would attempt to defraud our nation's tax system, Jonathan D. Larsen, Special Agent in Charge of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division's Newark Field Office, said in the DOJ press release accompanying the pleas. No matter what your stature is in our society, everyone is expected to play by the rules, and those who do not will be held accountable and brought to justice.\n\nAll of us are required by law to pay our fair share of taxes. Celebrity status does not provide a free pass from this obligation, the U.S. attorney supervising the prosecution, Craig Carpenito of the District of New Jersey, added.\n\n\n\nTheir accountant, Gregg Mark, already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government in 2015.\n\nThe plea agreement, which saw the brothers plead guilty to one felony charge each, avoided the much more serious charges detailed in the their 14-count indictment, including currency structuring (continually making deposits under $10,000 to avoid reporting requirements) and conspiracy.\n\nThe Sorrentinos are scheduled to be sentenced April 25 before U.S. District Judge Susan D. Wigenton.
The GOP tax overhaul looks increasingly likely to win enough votes to pass in the Senate after Senator John McCain said he supports the bill.\n\nAfter careful thought and consideration, I have decided to support the Senate tax reform bill. I believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle class families, McCain said in a statement Thursday.\n\nMcCain also said he endorses the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate that is included in the Senate tax bill, describing the mandate as an onerous mandate.\n\nBy repealing the individual mandate, this bill would eliminate an onerous that especially harms those from low-income brackets, McCain said.\n\nMcCain also said that while he takes seriously concerns some Senators have raised about the economy, it's clear this bill's net effect on our economy would be positive.\n\nMcCain's endorsement is a major milestone because it was his vote against the repeal of Obamacare that sunk the GOP bill this summer. His declaration of support narrows the range of issues that need to be resolved by GOP leaders to reach the fifty votes required to pass the measure (with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast the tie-breaking vote).\n\nThe list of GOP Senators whose votes are in doubt now includes just the deficit hawks Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, the small business advocates Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, and healthcare holdout Susan Collins of Maine. Nearly all, however, have expressed confidence that their issues can be resolved in negotiations with Senate leaders.
The value of Tesla Inc. stock plunged by about $5.4 billion over a 48-hour period this week as the company declared a large quarterly loss and finally acknowleded that deliveries of its high-volume Model 3 will be delayed by at least 6 months.\n\nTesla (OTC: TSLA) has only made a profit in one quarter of its 14-year existence, and that was only due to selling federal and state tax credits to traditional auto manufactures and others that actually do make taxable profits.\n\nAlthough Tesla's $2.98 billion third quarter revenue slightly beat Wall Street analysts' estimates, the company lost $671 million, or $2.92 per share. That was twice the-$336 million loss in the prior quarter, and set an all-time cash burn high of $16 million per day.\n\nBreitbart News reported in early October that CEO Elon Musk had announced that Tesla Inc. had its all-time best quarter with record deliveries of 26,150 vehicles, including 14,065 Model S sedans; 11,865 Model X SUVs; and 220 Model 3 economy cars. That was considered a disappointment for Model 3 deliveries, and its stock sold off by 1 percent.\n\nBut Musk emphasized that through physics-first principles, Tesla would shape a new mode of industrial production to improve efficiency by factors of 10 or even 100 times. He said Tesla's key advantage in building all-electric vehicles was limiting the number of moving engine parts to 20, versus up to 10,000 for internal combustion engines.\n\nWith investors reassured that Tesla was on track to ramp up to delivering 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in the December quarter and 10,000 per week in the March quarter, Tesla's stock traded up on big volume to an interim high of $362.55 on October 18.\n\nBut the stock opened at $301.15 per share on November 2 and has been trading down after Musk acknowledged on the company's third quarter conference call that it is difficult to predict when the bottlenecks will be cleared in production of Model 3s. He said he did not expect to be at 5,000 Model 3 units a week until late March.\n\nMusk tried to reassure shareholders that he is leading from the front lines to battle production hell delays. Tesla said the main problem holding up production of the Model 3s were production delays at Tesla's $5 billion Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada, where Panasonic four-battery cell modules are automatically inserted into an aluminum-wrapped battery case. Musk referred to his Instagram post last week where he is having a late-night campfire with a couple of managers on the Gigafactory's roof as a sign of his focus.\n\nMusk did assign some blame for production delays on the Model 3 being more automated, compared to the company's largely hand-built luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. Musk stated that bringing this level of automation online is simply challenging in the early stages of the ramp.\n\nBut he failed to comment on Edward Niedermeyer's brilliant October 30 report in the Daily Kanban industrial blog that Tesla did not give a purchase order to a major automated tooling supplier to develop two Body in White (BIW) transfer lines for the Model 3 early this year. Although car companies normally place fully-designed orders for BIW lines with at least a two-year lead time, and BIW manufacturers almost always assemble and test the line at their factories, Tesla asked for a 4-month delivery and wanted to expedite delivery by doing a risky cold build line layout and quality testing at Tesla's factory.\n\nNiedermeyer added that disagreements between Tesla's designers and engineers resulted in numerous revisions to the scope of the contract and eventually led Tesla to drop the second line from its purchase order. The BIW vendor blamed Tesla's high level of turnover in key positions, which Breitbart News has highlighted in the past. Without the second BIW assembly line, Tesla can never produce 10,000 units per week.\n\nIn another example of Tesla failing to have enough lead time to produce Model 3 units, Panasonic's Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga told Reuters that Gigafactory batteries are still being mostly made by hand. This process (for battery packs) will be soon automated, and then the number of vehicles to be produced will rise sharply. Tsuga declined to comment on how far Tesla Model 3 production is behind its targeted delivery schedule.
With 2018 in the rear-view mirror, some of the world's largest, most influential, and most volatile states prepare to elect their heads of government this year. Below, five countries whose presidential races – or attempts at hosting presidential races – will help shape the political impact of 2019.\n\nAfghanistan\n\nThe government of Afghanistan confirmed this weekend that the 2019 presidential elections will occur on July 20, raising a host of questions regarding the nation's democratic norms and ability to maintain security for voters in light of ongoing, and increasingly frustrating, peace negotiations with the Taliban. The July date pushes the election back from April 20, the original election day; government officials cite security, operational, and technical related issues making that deadline impossible.\n\nAfghanistan will begin registering presidential candidates today, meaning a full list of the candidates is not yet available, though incumbent President Ashraf Ghani will likely appear on the ballot.\n\nWho wins the Afghan presidential election is less important than whether the country can pull off organizing a nationwide election without major intervention by the Taliban. The Taliban rejected yet another call for direct talks with Ghani's government this weekend, insisting that they had gained too much ground to bother entertaining Ghani. The Taliban has repeatedly rejected talks with Ghani because they consider themselves the legitimate government of Afghanistan and Ghani merely a puppet of the United States.\n\nU.S. peace talks with the Taliban could also endanger the election, as reports suggest that the Trump administration is seeking a FARC-like peace deal that would legitimize the Taliban as an Afghan political party. In the unlikely event that such a deal is signed before the election, there is a non-negligible possibility that the Taliban itself fields a presidential candidate.\n\nNigeria\n\nNigeria, Africa's largest economy, held its first successful democratic transfer of power in 2015, when incumbent Goodluck Jonathan lost to former dictator Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari won the presidency largely on his promise to eradicate the Boko Haram threat in northeastern Nigeria, a promise he has entirely failed to live up to despite repeatedly declaring victory against the terrorist group as early as December 2015.\n\nThe 2019 election is pivotal for the future of Nigeria not just because of the prolonged Boko Haram threat, but because it will be a test of whether the 2015 election was a mere fluke or whether Nigeria has fully embraced democratic institutions. Democratic traditions are built over time, and the lack of overt threat of a military takeover or coup d'etat bodes well for the state so far.\n\nDemocracy is so in demand in Nigeria that, by October, 79 political parties had registered to field candidates in the 2019 election. In the regional legislative elections, 89 parties registered to run candidates. Yet the frontrunners remain the candidate for the two major parties: Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). The campaign has already turned bitter – Buhari's campaign is accusing Abubakar of having a sealed indictment against him for corruption in the United States, while Buhari has had to deny that he is a clone of himself deployed to replace the real, dead Buhari. According to some estimates, as Buhari kept some of his medical treatment for unspecified conditions a secret, he spent up to 15 percent of his term abroad receiving healthcare.\n\nArgentina\n\nArgentina was the first major country in the Americas to turn rightward after the early 21st-century wave of leftist presidents took over the region – including the United States, as former Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri took over the country before President Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Macri won his election largely in response to the tremendous backlash against leftist predecessor Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's ties to the Venezuelan dictatorship and Iran's Islamic theocracy in the aftermath of the suicide of the prosecutor investigating Iranian terrorism in Argentina, Alberto Nisman.\n\nDespite running as a pro-business candidate, Macri's biggest challenge in 2019 will be justifying the languishing status of his nation's economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently gave Argentina a $56 billion credit line to fix its recession, the largest ever, which only exacerbated concerns that the Argentine peso's value is about to plummet. The economic situation has deteriorated to a point that speculation has begun that Kirchner will attempt to reclaim the presidency from Macri despite an ongoing corruption investigation and the still-unresolved status of the Nisman murder.\n\nIt is impossible to fully assess the status of the Argentine election until candidates, Kirchner in particular, confirm their running status. Whoever confronts Macri, however, will have to navigate residual bitterness from the Kirchner presidency – and fear of becoming another Venezuela under yet more socialist rule – to adequately use Macri's woeful economy against him.\n\nCanada\n\nCanada's is not technically a presidential election, but the nation will choose its head of government in October 2019 through its parliamentary elections, granting the nation a chance to review the record of leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trudeau will face off against Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer and Jagmeet Singh of the New Democratic Party, attempting to run on issues such as environmental regulation and regional trade.\n\nConservatives appear eager to discuss environmental regulation under Trudeau; this summer, Scheer spelled out the Carbon Tax! in black marker on a white plate, donned safety glasses, and smashed it in a gleeful if somewhat cheesy performance of the traditional Greek celebration at a political event. In parts of Canada dependent on the energy industry for its economy, Trudeau is highly unpopular, facing boos even at the peak of his popularity nationwide.\n\nTrudeau is also running as a sort of anti-Trump for the region, repeatedly referencing the alleged polarization of the Western political climate and how embracing leftist policies can temper its effect. The campaign, for now, appears to be working, though not by much – early polls show Trudeau's Liberals with a four-point lead over the Conservatives, whose major challenge will be Scheer's relatively lackluster name recognition.\n\nBolivia\n\nFew doubt that longtime socialist leader Evo Morales will win Bolivia's 2019 presidential election, scheduled to take place in October. What makes this election interesting is the growing concern that it will neither be free nor fair, as Morales should not legally be allowed to appear on the ballot in the first place.\n\nBolivia held a referendum on term limits in 2016, and the people spoke clearly: they did not want Morales to have the ability to run for yet another turn. Morales responded to this news by turning to the nation's Supreme Court, which ruled in December that, despite the referendum, Morales' name should appear on the ballot. If he wins, Morales will begin his fourth term in office.\n\nOpponents call the Supreme Court move a slow-motion coup and organizers have planned protests attended by thousands against Morales. Morales is currently facing five official opponents, the most prominent of which is former president Carlos Mesa, who has made the questionable legality of the Supreme Court ruling a key issue in his campaign.\n\nThe two biggest questions this election poses are whether Mesa can effectively unite the anti-Morales opposition and, in the case that he does, whether Morales' government will allow a free and fair vote, anyway.
Starting this year, the Hungarian government is set to offer free in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures for couples wanting children in order to boost the national birthrate to 2.1 children by 2030.\n\nThe Hungarian government has taken control of six private fertility clinics and plans to purchase new buildings in order to meet demands of the estimated 150,000 couples across the country who have fertility issues but want to have children, La Croix reports.\n\nPreviously, IVF procedures were largely out of reach for many Hungarian couples due to the costs associated with the procedure, but now the pro-family government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is planning to give all couples free access.\n\nSecretary of State for the Family Katalin Novák commented on the new measures saying: If all couples who want a child manage to have a baby, Hungary will no longer have demographic problems.\n\nHungary currently faces a demographic winter if trends are not reversed, with the population expected to decline from the current 9.7 million to six million by the year 2070.\n\nHungarian Government Will Give $33,000 Bonus to Married Couples Who Have Three Children https://t.co/twV072eq7e — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 1, 2019\n\nOther nations have largely relied on mass migration to counter demographic trends and ageing populations but the Orbán government has, instead, adopted arguably the most pro-family policies in the world in order to avoid turning to migration to reverse population decline.\n\nAmong the policies adopted by the government last year has been a 30,000 euro loan to couples which is completely forgiven if they have three children. Hungary has also introduced tax breaks for families as well as extending daycare options or an allowance for elderly relatives who care for children.\n\nAnother programme will also see women with four or more children becoming exempt from income taxes for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn our minds, immigration means surrender, Prime Minister Orbán said last year, and added: If we resign ourselves to the fact that we are unable to sustain ourselves even biologically, by doing so we admit that we are not important even for ourselves.
The homeless population in New York City has reached an all-time high.\n\nNew York City's Department of Homeless Services said 60,252 people remain homeless, up 200 in two weeks, CBS New York reports.\n\nIt's definitely something that we cannot stand for as a city, NYC Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito said.\n\nViverto told CBS New York that one possible way to solve this problem in the city would be to expand the Living in Communities (LINC) voucher program, a program that gives money to those in homeless shelters to spend on more permanent housing options. But some landlords might be hesitant to participate in the program.\n\nI think the challenge that we've seen with the current voucher program, subsidy program, the LINC program, is for a very short period of time, there may be some hesitancy by landlords to engage with the city on it, she said.\n\nViverto is not the only city official to comment on this disturbing trend in New York City.\n\nComptroller Scott Stringer called the lack of child care at city shelters a tragedy for the city.\n\nFormer NYC Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who now runs a program for the homeless called WIN, called on the city to create a position that would be in charge of finding permanent housing options for the homeless.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio insists that solutions are coming. Some of the biggest tools, weapons, we have to address homelessness are on the way, he said in response to a question about the issue. There's a lot more coming, and we intend to turn the tide, but it's going to be a long battle.\n\nSo far, the mayor's office is working on a new initiative that would require 25 percent of the apartments built under a tax exemption plan to be set aside for the homeless.\n\nBut the mayor's office declined to give any more specifics, saying more plans are in the works, but there is nothing that can be shared yet.
